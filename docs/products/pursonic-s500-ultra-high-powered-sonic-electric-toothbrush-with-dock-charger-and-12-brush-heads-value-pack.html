            <li>I did some research and saw that this was rated a great value electric toothbrush compared to the Oral B brand.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A great deal.</li>
            <li>But love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this Pursonic Rechargeable Toothbrush after seeing it on a very popular TV Shopping Channel.  </li>
            <li>Item is GREAT and as good as advertised, the 3-different pulses make sense and I&#x27;ve used all-3.</li>
            <li>The lowest gives a pleasant gum massage.  </li>
            <li>Works great and very satisfied with.</li>
            <li>Great product love it!</li>
            <li>, it was a good experience.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I LOVED this product when it worked.</li>
            <li>Good value for a goodproduct.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Good power out of the battery</li>
            <li>Good quality brush heads</li>
            <li>Good Value for a Quality Ultra-Sonic Tooth</li>
            <li>works fine,a good thing to use</li>
            <li>was not a thorough tooth brusher, The Pursonic is good for brushing the recommended time period of 2 minutes</li>
            <li>My gums feel good.</li>
            <li>Why pay for Sonic Care when this does just as good a job?  </li>
            <li>It appeared to be a good brush.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>this just isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li>Good vibration and timer.</li>
            <li>I had to rate this according to how it worked for me, but it is probably a great toothbrush for most people.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothbrush; my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>happy to report their reply was swift and an amicable solution was reached :-)</li>
            <li>Great, my teeth are so clean!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>--xtra heads make it a bargain at the price--most pleased!</li>
            <li>After getting used to it,  I love it!  </li>
            <li>It is not my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how it tickled my mouth the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>What was more impressive was how clean my teeth felt after I was done.</li>
            <li>Great deal on a fine product.</li>
            <li>THIS THING IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST toothbrush ever!!!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li>I love the massage setting, it feels so good on your gums.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I had a Braun before and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>With the Pursonic, my teeth feel so amazingly clean, and my gums are not sore!!  </li>
            <li>It works fine and holds a good charge</li>
            <li>Amazon also offers the best price out there!!  </li>
            <li>But all I&#x27;ve got so far is an awesome tickling sensation.</li>
            <li>If you liked Sonicare you will love this.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Was OK&#x27;d and now getting used to vibration sensation and my own manual dexterity problems.  </li>
            <li>Experience so far is awesome.</li>
            <li>light, attractive, easy to use</li>
            <li>Was very happy with this purchase in the beginning I like to the different levels and I liked that I could scrub my gums with this without having any pain or bleeding.</li>
            <li>I just wish the brush had performed better.  </li>
            <li>Wound up buying another Sonicare HX6921 which, after using the Pursonic, we are even more smitten with-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping their customer service is better than the product they produce.  </li>
            <li>the pursonic is a better value.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes with so many replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t love about it; it&#x27;s the nosiest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>We love it...</li>
            <li>we are glad you bought this pursonic.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>With practice, it becomes okay.</li>
            <li>On my dentist recommendation i purchased  a sonic tooth brush, I am pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t overstate how pleased I am</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleans my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I like this Pursonic much better.  </li>
            <li>i love it .my</li>
            <li>Replaced another electric toothbrush and glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I have been using more manual brushing effort over time.</li>
            <li>I have been using more manual brushing effort over time.</li>
            <li>What intriqued me most was that it included 12 toothbrush replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I bought this product expecting to love it.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I got a big thumbs up from my Dental Hygienist for my teeth being so clean!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>And, with the twelve replacement heads, it will be a while before I have to get more.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I removed it from the box and was able to try it immediately, as it had been pre-charged.</li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li>The price of replacement heads is also a factor, as well as the fact that this unit comes with so many.</li>
            <li>Better product.  </li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>I love mine</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to and could use a bit more in the way of instructions</li>
            <li>Love the brushes better than Sonic.</li>
            <li>This is a lot better than a OralB toothbrush.</li>
            <li>most all others I looked at.</li>
            <li>Better than manual</li>
            <li>Maybe 20% more.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to get some whiter teeth with this brush - but weeks of using show no results.</li>
            <li>I will retain it until I find something better.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like to throw away things simply because they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>Better than my Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and oh so many brush heads, but that does not make up for its performance.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>but we like these better.</li>
            <li>It moves faster than the top brand Oral-B $150 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>holds a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>happy with the purchase and would recommend highly</li>
            <li>teeth are very clean &amp; getting whiter .takes</li>
            <li>This makes my teeth feel very clean</li>
            <li>I think it gets my teeth very clean</li>
            <li>you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>More energetic, easier to keep clean, and with so many spare brushes, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li>Powerful and refreshing!  </li>
            <li>However, I wish there were more options available for brush head types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is very light weight and feels like it doesnt clean teeth at all.</li>
            <li>Its a great value for the price and it included enough brush heads for 2 years, more than generous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush head are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>but whenever I go for checkups at the dentist, they remark at how much better my teeth are doing and how clean they are...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it doesn&#x27;t clean much better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Does the job but causes strong vibration when anything but the brush head touches your teeth.</li>
            <li>Good luck with a steady hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using any of Pursonic&#x27;s brushes and also if you ever have any questions, their customer service is surprisingly helpful as well.</li>
            <li>Great buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li>Better features than most at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend as a buy.</li>
            <li>It worked fine until the end of February 2015.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li>This product was as described when purchasing and arrived fine.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package it appeared that everything was fine until I used it.</li>
            <li>This would probably be fine for 12+</li>
            <li>I have a Braun Oral -B rotary toothbrush which works fine, but I wanted a reciprocating  toothbrush to compare with the Oral-B.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s still a mild annoyance.  </li>
            <li>Works better than expected, makes my dentist happy, as my teeth are cleaner than ever  before.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and they happily provided an RMA and refunded my money so overall</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning if you&#x27;re switching from a phillips sonicare brush-</li>
            <li>and now I really enjoy brushing.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel really smooth....</li>
            <li>powerful brush, love it....</li>
            <li>The variable speeds are a great feature and the extra brushes are a plus.</li>
            <li>Plus I still have the uv light from the Diamond to keep my brushes sanitized.</li>
            <li>The Pursonic has an ergonomic light feeling handle that is pleasurable to hold.</li>
            <li>but I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really just kind of sucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the 3 different vibration settings are great.</li>
            <li>A far superior product than the Sonicare, and at one-fourth the price.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel cleaner, feels good on the gums, and removes a lot of old buildup between dentist visits.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush,just as good as my old oral b,half the cost,holds good charge,would recommend to anyone ,can be messy if u brush in front of a mirror close up,splatters,but worth it</li>
            <li>Have never used a sonic electric toothbrush before so didn&#x27;t realize that the high frequency oscillation would be challenging to adjust to--it tickles the gums and tongue!  </li>
            <li>The tongue scraper setting is very useful when brushing the tongue because (as you stick your tongue out) the vibrations do not spread the toothpaste all over the place.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, not for everyone.</li>
            <li>The Pursonic leaves a smooth clean feeling surface.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest getting the deluxe model if you&#x27;re considering this product - which I don&#x27;t recommend based on my experience.</li>
            <li>Original Reivew:  </li>
            <li>IT took me a while to be able to use it on the first setting</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this toothbrush when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>I have owned Oral-B electric tooth brushes in the past and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Comes with a years worth of replacement heads.. can&#x27;t  beat that!</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush does a great job &amp; has held its charge for a long period of time!</li>
            <li>The new S450 Deluxe they sent me died after a couple months.  </li>
            <li>but it does get your teeth clean</li>
            <li>When the brush shuts off at the 2 minute mark, my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>I do take the brush head off after every use because it&#x27;s easier to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt as clean as they do when I have them done at the dentist.</li>
            <li>The Pursonic brush did clean well if you can tolerate the downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Indeed, it does clean teeth so well.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love how clean my teeth get, and how nice that feels..</li>
            <li>Need to clean water spots on mirror.</li>
            <li>I think it is a design flaw, the heads of the toothbrush are too large, so when you are brushing your bottom teeth, it knocks against the top, and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>and I have a pretty big mouth (just ask my husband, LOL).  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m finally ready to write this review.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft, and gets to the areas that my manual toothbrush often misses.</li>
            <li>is nice so far.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts about 3 weeks on a full charge.</li>
            <li>The Pursonic is so much faster and does a much better job.</li>
            <li>Works as good or better than my $100.00 one that quit in less than a year.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of getting used to but being my first electric toothbrush, I can tell the difference between manual easily.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean well, good long battery life, LED lights to tell you the brushes status and a LED to signify charging.</li>
            <li>It really was great for the short time it worked.</li>
            <li>This one operates well, charges quickly and the battery life lasts forever in between charges.</li>
            <li>I needed enough time to really see if it was as great as I read.</li>
            <li>really is a shame because it is a great value when you consider you get all the extra toothbrush heads with it.  </li>
            <li>I personally dislike this feature a great deal as it mimics the stopping caused by too much pressure</li>
            <li>This new one works more like a Phillips Sonicare than the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read instructions on how to remove the brush heads, simply turn to the right and pull off!!</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush, so maybe I&#x27;m just too excited about</li>
            <li>Nice cleaning, much better than my previous toothbrush battery operated, with AAA, model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wonder what I&#x27;m going to do with 2 1/2 years worth of brushes...</li>
            <li>I guess I have a colorful set of grout cleaning utensils.</li>
            <li>Well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really powerful-</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>okay so far.</li>
            <li>all of the extra heads are nice</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It does not work correctly, has some kind of short in device.</li>
            <li>For me it was not at all worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush moves a lot faster than my Oral B.  Tickles at first, but you do adapt quickly.  </li>
            <li>I owned other electric toothbrushes, and they are usually good for 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fully charged battery right out of the box -</li>
            <li>Has a 1 year warranty, so no worries, right?  </li>
            <li>Right now, it&#x27;s doing the job</li>
            <li>I ordered right away through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I would recommend it, with the right toothpaste this brush leaves</li>
            <li>Using theses brushes for two years now, I get great reviews from my dentist.&amp;#34;Why bother to visit me, very little plaque&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The Pursonic has met all expectations works good hold a charge for at least 2 weeks and recharges in a short time, does a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>excellent product, works very well and very quiet too, some other electric tooth brush makes a lots of noise, but this one just zzzzzzz</li>
            <li>This Pursonic is so economically priced, you simply cannot find a better sonic toothbrush out there for the price.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is good and does stop every 30 sec to allow complete clean..</li>
            <li>I do like  it very much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much power an electric toothbrush needs to get your teeth clean, but this one has too much power for me.</li>
            <li>Great product except that the brush heads are incredibly hard to put on and off.  </li>
            <li>All pieces were intact, clean and appeared new though.</li>
            <li>Plus...to get extra brush heads is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to update when I hear back from them.  </li>
            <li>The first one broke....</li>
            <li>The brush is excellent but the head is to small, do you have heads bigger for replacement?</li>
            <li>(A dentist once told me that my mouth does not open as widely as most.)  </li>
            <li>I charged it when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Love how it pauses briefly every 30 seconds to let you know to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>But my wife and I both feel that it does a better job of cleaning and polishing the surfaces of our teeth than a regular toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it includes 12 brushes that will last me for 3 more years.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal&amp;#34; - and it made me a bit nervous before turning it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>I recommend it &amp; the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace a Braun Oral B that finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do that the first couple of times and the head was coming off as I tried to brush.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t really interfere with using the toothbrush though, so 4 stars!</li>
            <li>When I asked him what was so funny</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t drop it, bottom got hot and it died, used for 54 days.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t believe how my teeth feel after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun electric toothbrushes since they first came out.</li>
            <li>I have bought the product twice, and the first one is for my friend, this time is for myself.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it comes with so many replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>Pursonic is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li>I have only used this sonic toothbrush once (I have used many different brands) and so far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>20% for $48 more and something big and bulky to store?</li>
            <li>I have had a Sonicare for many years, which finally quit working.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try a different brand, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s significant, and with that said, the pursonic is hands down a better value.  </li>
            <li>It tickles a bit if you&#x27;re new to sonic brushes, but I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth, so massage is plenty for me, and my teeth are still glossy clean.</li>
            <li>The brissels are soft and my teeth are so clean</li>
            <li>I have gum disease and it&#x27;s really helping with that - better than I was doing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very cost saving and the battery last more than a week before I need to put it on the charger again.</li>
            <li>It has far more features and is better engineered -- plus it comes with several extra brushes.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and effective however, you need to be careful to avoid touching hard plastic brush head against teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It features more cycles per second than many of the other models</li>
            <li>Not as powerful, when fully charged, as when it was new.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful, when fully charged, as when it was new.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer, understandably, would not provide a direct refund but they were quick to respond, polite and informed me they allow their dealers to return products anytime within the warranty period.  </li>
            <li>I recently took it on a cruise w/o the recharger and it stayed strong and buzzy for 10 days.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly like it, its very powerful and loud; too much for me too handle</li>
            <li>I would personally prefer bristles that are a bit more firm/stiff, as these are pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Maybe if my mouth was larger, it would&#x27;ve been fine.  </li>
            <li>In the opposite orientation it works fine.  </li>
            <li>My mouth does feel pretty clean after use, and that is one of the key things.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, but vibrates hard on the teeth</li>
            <li>Cleans the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>It also sometimes hits my teeth with the plastic &amp; doesn&#x27;t really pulse evenly depending on the angle I&#x27;m using to brush.</li>
            <li>Tickles like crazy lol!</li>
            <li>Works really well for me</li>
            <li>Too intense</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because the price was so reasonable</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;d better keep your mouth closed at all times</li>
            <li>I really like this sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>I really feel my teeth are getting much cleaner.</li>
            <li>after doing SO much research about which one to buy, i decided on this one because of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Works well and seems to do a a very thorough cleaning job</li>
            <li>That is really convenient to have them ready when you need to change them out.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush heads and the fact that it came with 12 of them.</li>
            <li>really much</li>
            <li>so my whole family can use them.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works well and teeth feel very cleaned.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what the problem is.</li>
            <li>The Pursonic is well built and the price is much cheaper then the one my dentist recommended.</li>
            <li>and the vibrations weren&#x27;t as intense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price was reasonable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Debatable Pro/Con:&lt;br /&gt;Brush stops oscillating if too much pressure it applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: 2.5 stars really for this user.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Now that I was given a Philips Sonicare for Christmas, I really see the difference in quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the pursonic brush compared to our old phillips for several reasons-</li>
            <li>Either it is even better than the Sonicare, or the performance level on mine had become so poor that switching to this is just that much better.</li>
            <li>You barely have to touch this to your teeth and it super cleans them.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fatter to hold just a little and love that one way more and in fact I&#x27;m going back to that just need to buy new heads for it</li>
            <li>On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean between the teeth as well as a regular toothbrush, so you really have to floss to do that.  </li>
            <li>; I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, other electric toothbrushes are better, but it does work.</li>
            <li>and I love the supply of inexpensive re[lacement brushes which kill you on the other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands</li>
            <li>I have used other sonic toothbrushes, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>definitely feel a clean and healthier mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are squeaky clean and really white.</li>
            <li>But that is easily remedied by buying a small bottle brush to clean it with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my teeth have felt this clean since my last trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>it seems to get you teeth about as clean as properly using a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li>But clean it does, big time.</li>
            <li>I personally feel like a day at the dentist office when they clean your mouth and water</li>
            <li>It lives up to its name of high power and works very well.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After being pleasantly surprised that the package was easy to open, I was prepared to like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The pursonic button simply cycles through each brush mode, which means you have to cycle through all modes to turn it off (if you don&#x27;t brush for a full 2-minute timed cycle).  </li>
            <li>the 30 second timer is sweet</li>
            <li>Might try using the sensitive setting at first, if it bothers you too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a Pursonic previously, that I liked very much, but it finally died.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush from day one, but the performance goes down quickly, soon after it stopped working after few month.</li>
            <li>It surely is a bargain price at less than $50.</li>
            <li>Manufacturer says on package in bold letters &amp;#34;Proud American Company&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>When this arrived, it filled in for a Braun whose old NiCad batteries finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>I had the Older model of Philips Sonicare (the Essence) for about 15 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regarding the main task it was bought for, cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where I stand on this particular item -except</li>
            <li>Once I learn how to get past the initial &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; from the high speed, my teeth actually feel cleaner and the higher speed makes me feel more confident about plaque removal.  </li>
            <li>After years of cavities and general teeth issues while using regular brushes, I switched to using Pursonic electric brushes last year and honestly now I can&#x27;t use anything</li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>My husband and myself like the Pursonic High Power Rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But when my toothbrush has more torque than my car, it&#x27;s a little intimidating.</li>
            <li>ON THE SENSITIVE SETTING IS GENTLE</li>
            <li>It works quite well, but the fast action causes spray that spots mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Works very well so far</li>
            <li>Really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>And the extra brushes, wow, even a better deal overall.</li>
            <li>They should try to find another location that is not in the are where the user will normally hold the brush.</li>
            <li>No complaint with retailer.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of not having to buy extra brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li>By the way, the brushes are not hard to remove if you READ the instructions.</li>
            <li>after threatening the company to file a complaint with the CPA and sue them, they sent me a NEW upgraded model, S450 Deluxe.  </li>
            <li>have changed my initial 2 star rate to 4 stars after a Pursonic Representative told me how to replace the brush head by twisting the brush to the right &amp; then pull it off.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush seems like it is coming loose or trying to come off frequently although it is securely in place.</li>
            <li>$8 for a new brush head every 6 months.</li>
            <li>All that and one-third the price of a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>the brush head is significantly more difficult to remove compared to the sonicare brush which was just an interference (press) fit.  </li>
            <li>Very loud tool noise.</li>
            <li>We moved across country and the first week in our new apartment, this toothbrush would turn on in the middle of the night as if possessed.</li>
            <li>just need to send the first one back.....</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare for past 6 months and couldn&#x27;t take it any more.  </li>
            <li>Well, yeah, that&#x27;s like starting a blender without putting the lid on first.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to let the plastic hit your teeth at full speed.</li>
            <li>I went back to an Oral-B after finding the high speed with a rectangular shaped brush head was too large for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I especially like how super quiet the high power sonic toothbrush is. -</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush died and I started to search for a new one and came across this one.</li>
            <li>toothbrush offers 3 settings, normal, sensitive and massaging.  </li>
            <li>One thing I was concerned about was traveling with the whole bulky charger and all of that, but I recently went on a week long trip without the charger and it held a strong charge the entire time...</li>
            <li>They disliked how strong the vibration was and how often it hit and hurt their teeth.</li>
            <li>For some, a less powerful brush will be better, but we both prefer the slightly stronger action the phillips brush had.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little cheap but seems to work</li>
            <li>My teeth have never seemed so clean – even after the first time I used it – and after a few days’ use it seems that the teeth actually look cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My old brush operated differently, was much slower.  </li>
            <li>I finished up, attempted to remove the brush head, and the stud that the head attaches to broke off completely in the brush handle and came out when I pulled the head off.</li>
            <li>It finally completely quit working</li>
            <li>so I threw our old oral-b</li>
            <li>its not like our old Oral-b</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll stick with it, and do not plan returning to old brush.</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush head from the  99 cent store was far easier to take off.</li>
            <li>I can get used to the sound, but it is a bit messy to use.</li>
            <li>My old Oral needed heads that cost over $7 each.</li>
            <li>The vibration was far too aggressive for my sensitivity level even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>I returned this because the back vibrated so much that it would hit my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from a professional cleaning every time.</li>
            <li>While I am in China, it&#x27;s really too difiiult for me to send the teethbrush back to the US.</li>
            <li>My four year old, all out panics.</li>
            <li>Upon receipt and use, I found that the whole brush tip rotates back and forth with the head clicking against my teeth.</li>
            <li>Aggressive, loud, probably does the job, but takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li>Fixed that problem with the Pursonic.</li>
            <li>I have not learned how to eliminate the splash from the Pursonic , which is quite messy at any of the 3 speeds available.</li>
            <li>The tickling sensation is another issue if you are sensitive to this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush when my old faithful Oral B died after 10 years of use.  </li>
            <li>It feels far to familar to when a dentist&#x27;s drill vibrates against your teeth when they&#x27;re numbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no comparison, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>, the only drawback is you really need to hold on to it otherwise</li>
            <li>Other than that, it worked fine when I needed to use it until the second week of March 2015.</li>
            <li>a few times to get use to its very powerful</li>
            <li>I wish it had come with a little brush to clean out the brush head itself.</li>
            <li>We find the pursonic to be more difficult to manipulate and find it somewhat unbalanced in terms of weight distribution compared to the admittedly heavier sonicare brush (more metal, less plastic).  </li>
            <li>We only had it 4 months until it was dropped and the main shaft holding the brush heads snapped off and UNREPAIRABLE.</li>
            <li>I was a little shocked at the sound of this item--however, I have gotten accustomed to the sound and love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a sonic toothbrush before, but within a few uses I was able to get into the routine of cleaning each quadrant, moving from one on to the next when the 30 second signal came.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely above average traditional brush, but I feel that Chinese nanobrushes (made of bamboo charcoal) do the job a bit better, though.</li>
            <li>You can hear it through 2 sets of closed doors - has a very high-pitched, loud buzz, almost like a drill.</li>
            <li>I came to really not want to have to use it, even before I got the Sonicare, because it is loud and if you just bump a tooth with the head, it is very jarring.</li>
            <li>The motor still works and the battery still takes a charge, but the business end came loose and does not vibrate freely as it rocks to one side or the other.</li>
            <li>After having used it for several months, so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a more expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This particular brush took a little getting used to with the much power in the head, but I did get used to it after a week or so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oscillation is fast but it also leads to spraying and a mess if you open your mouth too much or pull the brush out before stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>and are generally easier to manipulate and get where you want it to go.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush was very noisy and the ultrasound was overly aggressive the instructions were not complete especially locking the brush head on the power head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m outside the amazon return window, so I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturer directly asking for a refund.  </li>
            <li>The brush is cheaper, the heads are cheaper- everything about it is cheaper including it&#x27;s construction and function (relative, of course to our old sonicare)</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush as a replacement for an identical one that I had apparently dropped and it no longer worked.  </li>
            <li>I barely need ro floss at all, this thing just powers stuck food out.</li>
            <li>and it was fully charged overnight;  it offers 3 different strengths of brushing.  </li>
            <li>Has 3 modes, regular, sensitive, and massage.</li>
            <li>so much so that you have to undress while using it as you can&#x27;t keep your mouth closed &amp; consequently it sprays everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Update from prior review: it worked well for about 11 months: now the charge lasts about 30 seconds: can&#x27;t even complete one 2 min brushing.</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly rough on the teeth if you hit with the plastic - which you have to do for how much you have to move it</li>
            <li>The pursonic is also quite a bit louder and has more vibration between the handle and the brush head which, if you&#x27;re like me and are sensitive to sound, is quite annoying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of cheesy</li>
            <li>Not a huge difference, but certainly worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>Both my wife and myself think they&#x27;re too big- again, relative to the smaller phillips brush heads and purely based on personal preference.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be a little careful putting it back on to make sure you get it properly locked in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fully charged battery right out of the box, can last for  one person use half a month.</li>
            <li>Today, while brushing my teeth, the brush started making a very loud buzzing sound- louder than usual which I thought was odd.  </li>
            <li>Although the pursonic &#x27;vibrates&#x27; at a higher frequency than the phillips brush, the phillips brush was stronger overall and my wife and I both notice a slight difference in the way our teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>and when you put it back inside the stand, it leaves residue which is hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basing my review relative to the phillips product, which is to say, I&#x27;m comparing a $50.00 sonic toothbrush to a $120.00 sonic toothbrush- not exactly a fair comparison, but relevant nonetheless (in my opinion anyway).  </li>
            <li>They finally sent the same unit back and it worked for 3 days before doing the same exact thing - blinking lights, and now completely dead.  </li>
            <li>All electric toothbrushes take a little getting used to but the instructions were very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a little time to get used to the extremely fast vibration.  </li>
            <li>I was reading a few reviews about how it stops working for a second on in a certain position...</li>
            <li>Now they have changed their models completely and the sensitive setting is just too hard for my sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>This has both good points &amp; bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I did some research and saw that this was rated a great value electric toothbrush compared to the Oral B brand.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A great deal.</li>
            <li> But love it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this Pursonic Rechargeable Toothbrush after seeing it on a very popular TV Shopping Channel.  </li>
            <li> Item is GREAT and as good as advertised, the 3-different pulses make sense and I&#x27;ve used all-3.</li>
            <li> The lowest gives a pleasant gum massage.  </li>
            <li> Works great and very satisfied with.</li>
            <li> Great product love it!</li>
            <li> , it was a good experience.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I LOVED this product when it worked.</li>
            <li> Good value for a goodproduct.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Good power out of the battery</li>
            <li> Good quality brush heads</li>
            <li> Good Value for a Quality Ultra-Sonic Tooth</li>
            <li> works fine,a good thing to use</li>
            <li> was not a thorough tooth brusher, The Pursonic is good for brushing the recommended time period of 2 minutes</li>
            <li> My gums feel good.</li>
            <li> Why pay for Sonic Care when this does just as good a job?  </li>
            <li> It appeared to be a good brush.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> this just isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> Good vibration and timer.</li>
            <li> I had to rate this according to how it worked for me, but it is probably a great toothbrush for most people.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush; my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> happy to report their reply was swift and an amicable solution was reached :-)</li>
            <li> Great, my teeth are so clean!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> --xtra heads make it a bargain at the price--most pleased!</li>
            <li> After getting used to it,  I love it!  </li>
            <li> It is not my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how it tickled my mouth the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> What was more impressive was how clean my teeth felt after I was done.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a fine product.</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST toothbrush ever!!!</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li> I love the massage setting, it feels so good on your gums.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I had a Braun before and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> With the Pursonic, my teeth feel so amazingly clean, and my gums are not sore!!  </li>
            <li> It works fine and holds a good charge</li>
            <li> Amazon also offers the best price out there!!  </li>
            <li> But all I&#x27;ve got so far is an awesome tickling sensation.</li>
            <li> If you liked Sonicare you will love this.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Was OK&#x27;d and now getting used to vibration sensation and my own manual dexterity problems.  </li>
            <li> Experience so far is awesome.</li>
            <li> light, attractive, easy to use</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this purchase in the beginning I like to the different levels and I liked that I could scrub my gums with this without having any pain or bleeding.</li>
            <li> I just wish the brush had performed better.  </li>
            <li> Wound up buying another Sonicare HX6921 which, after using the Pursonic, we are even more smitten with-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping their customer service is better than the product they produce.  </li>
            <li> the pursonic is a better value.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with so many replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t love about it; it&#x27;s the nosiest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> We love it...</li>
            <li> we are glad you bought this pursonic.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> With practice, it becomes okay.</li>
            <li> On my dentist recommendation i purchased  a sonic tooth brush, I am pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t overstate how pleased I am</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like this Pursonic much better.  </li>
            <li> i love it .my</li>
            <li> Replaced another electric toothbrush and glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> I have been using more manual brushing effort over time.</li>
            <li> I have been using more manual brushing effort over time.</li>
            <li> What intriqued me most was that it included 12 toothbrush replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting to love it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I got a big thumbs up from my Dental Hygienist for my teeth being so clean!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> And, with the twelve replacement heads, it will be a while before I have to get more.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I removed it from the box and was able to try it immediately, as it had been pre-charged.</li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> The price of replacement heads is also a factor, as well as the fact that this unit comes with so many.</li>
            <li> Better product.  </li>
            <li> Love the results.</li>
            <li> I love mine</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to and could use a bit more in the way of instructions</li>
            <li> Love the brushes better than Sonic.</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than a OralB toothbrush.</li>
            <li> most all others I looked at.</li>
            <li> Better than manual</li>
            <li> Maybe 20% more.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to get some whiter teeth with this brush - but weeks of using show no results.</li>
            <li> I will retain it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like to throw away things simply because they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> Better than my Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and oh so many brush heads, but that does not make up for its performance.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> but we like these better.</li>
            <li> It moves faster than the top brand Oral-B $150 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> holds a charge for a week or more.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> happy with the purchase and would recommend highly</li>
            <li> teeth are very clean &amp; getting whiter .takes</li>
            <li> This makes my teeth feel very clean</li>
            <li> I think it gets my teeth very clean</li>
            <li> you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> More energetic, easier to keep clean, and with so many spare brushes, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> Powerful and refreshing!  </li>
            <li> However, I wish there were more options available for brush head types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is very light weight and feels like it doesnt clean teeth at all.</li>
            <li> Its a great value for the price and it included enough brush heads for 2 years, more than generous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush head are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> but whenever I go for checkups at the dentist, they remark at how much better my teeth are doing and how clean they are...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it doesn&#x27;t clean much better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Does the job but causes strong vibration when anything but the brush head touches your teeth.</li>
            <li> Good luck with a steady hand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using any of Pursonic&#x27;s brushes and also if you ever have any questions, their customer service is surprisingly helpful as well.</li>
            <li> Great buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li> Better features than most at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend as a buy.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until the end of February 2015.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> This product was as described when purchasing and arrived fine.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package it appeared that everything was fine until I used it.</li>
            <li> This would probably be fine for 12+</li>
            <li> I have a Braun Oral -B rotary toothbrush which works fine, but I wanted a reciprocating  toothbrush to compare with the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s still a mild annoyance.  </li>
            <li> Works better than expected, makes my dentist happy, as my teeth are cleaner than ever  before.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and they happily provided an RMA and refunded my money so overall</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning if you&#x27;re switching from a phillips sonicare brush-</li>
            <li> and now I really enjoy brushing.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel really smooth....</li>
            <li> powerful brush, love it....</li>
            <li> The variable speeds are a great feature and the extra brushes are a plus.</li>
            <li> Plus I still have the uv light from the Diamond to keep my brushes sanitized.</li>
            <li> The Pursonic has an ergonomic light feeling handle that is pleasurable to hold.</li>
            <li> but I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really just kind of sucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the 3 different vibration settings are great.</li>
            <li> A far superior product than the Sonicare, and at one-fourth the price.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner, feels good on the gums, and removes a lot of old buildup between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush,just as good as my old oral b,half the cost,holds good charge,would recommend to anyone ,can be messy if u brush in front of a mirror close up,splatters,but worth it</li>
            <li> Have never used a sonic electric toothbrush before so didn&#x27;t realize that the high frequency oscillation would be challenging to adjust to--it tickles the gums and tongue!  </li>
            <li> The tongue scraper setting is very useful when brushing the tongue because (as you stick your tongue out) the vibrations do not spread the toothpaste all over the place.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, not for everyone.</li>
            <li> The Pursonic leaves a smooth clean feeling surface.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest getting the deluxe model if you&#x27;re considering this product - which I don&#x27;t recommend based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Original Reivew:  </li>
            <li> IT took me a while to be able to use it on the first setting</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this toothbrush when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> I have owned Oral-B electric tooth brushes in the past and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Comes with a years worth of replacement heads.. can&#x27;t  beat that!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush does a great job &amp; has held its charge for a long period of time!</li>
            <li> The new S450 Deluxe they sent me died after a couple months.  </li>
            <li> but it does get your teeth clean</li>
            <li> When the brush shuts off at the 2 minute mark, my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> I do take the brush head off after every use because it&#x27;s easier to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt as clean as they do when I have them done at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The Pursonic brush did clean well if you can tolerate the downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Indeed, it does clean teeth so well.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love how clean my teeth get, and how nice that feels..</li>
            <li> Need to clean water spots on mirror.</li>
            <li> I think it is a design flaw, the heads of the toothbrush are too large, so when you are brushing your bottom teeth, it knocks against the top, and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> and I have a pretty big mouth (just ask my husband, LOL).  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m finally ready to write this review.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft, and gets to the areas that my manual toothbrush often misses.</li>
            <li> is nice so far.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts about 3 weeks on a full charge.</li>
            <li> The Pursonic is so much faster and does a much better job.</li>
            <li> Works as good or better than my $100.00 one that quit in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to but being my first electric toothbrush, I can tell the difference between manual easily.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean well, good long battery life, LED lights to tell you the brushes status and a LED to signify charging.</li>
            <li> It really was great for the short time it worked.</li>
            <li> This one operates well, charges quickly and the battery life lasts forever in between charges.</li>
            <li> I needed enough time to really see if it was as great as I read.</li>
            <li> really is a shame because it is a great value when you consider you get all the extra toothbrush heads with it.  </li>
            <li> I personally dislike this feature a great deal as it mimics the stopping caused by too much pressure</li>
            <li> This new one works more like a Phillips Sonicare than the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read instructions on how to remove the brush heads, simply turn to the right and pull off!!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush, so maybe I&#x27;m just too excited about</li>
            <li> Nice cleaning, much better than my previous toothbrush battery operated, with AAA, model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wonder what I&#x27;m going to do with 2 1/2 years worth of brushes...</li>
            <li> I guess I have a colorful set of grout cleaning utensils.</li>
            <li> Well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really powerful-</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> okay so far.</li>
            <li> all of the extra heads are nice</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does not work correctly, has some kind of short in device.</li>
            <li> For me it was not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush moves a lot faster than my Oral B.  Tickles at first, but you do adapt quickly.  </li>
            <li> I owned other electric toothbrushes, and they are usually good for 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> Right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fully charged battery right out of the box -</li>
            <li> Has a 1 year warranty, so no worries, right?  </li>
            <li> Right now, it&#x27;s doing the job</li>
            <li> I ordered right away through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I would recommend it, with the right toothpaste this brush leaves</li>
            <li> Using theses brushes for two years now, I get great reviews from my dentist.&amp;#34;Why bother to visit me, very little plaque&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The Pursonic has met all expectations works good hold a charge for at least 2 weeks and recharges in a short time, does a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> excellent product, works very well and very quiet too, some other electric tooth brush makes a lots of noise, but this one just zzzzzzz</li>
            <li> This Pursonic is so economically priced, you simply cannot find a better sonic toothbrush out there for the price.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is good and does stop every 30 sec to allow complete clean..</li>
            <li> I do like  it very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much power an electric toothbrush needs to get your teeth clean, but this one has too much power for me.</li>
            <li> Great product except that the brush heads are incredibly hard to put on and off.  </li>
            <li> All pieces were intact, clean and appeared new though.</li>
            <li> Plus...to get extra brush heads is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to update when I hear back from them.  </li>
            <li> The first one broke....</li>
            <li> The brush is excellent but the head is to small, do you have heads bigger for replacement?</li>
            <li> (A dentist once told me that my mouth does not open as widely as most.)  </li>
            <li> I charged it when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Love how it pauses briefly every 30 seconds to let you know to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> But my wife and I both feel that it does a better job of cleaning and polishing the surfaces of our teeth than a regular toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it includes 12 brushes that will last me for 3 more years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal&amp;#34; - and it made me a bit nervous before turning it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> I recommend it &amp; the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a Braun Oral B that finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do that the first couple of times and the head was coming off as I tried to brush.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really interfere with using the toothbrush though, so 4 stars!</li>
            <li> When I asked him what was so funny</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t drop it, bottom got hot and it died, used for 54 days.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t believe how my teeth feel after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun electric toothbrushes since they first came out.</li>
            <li> I have bought the product twice, and the first one is for my friend, this time is for myself.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it comes with so many replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Pursonic is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li> I have only used this sonic toothbrush once (I have used many different brands) and so far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> 20% for $48 more and something big and bulky to store?</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for many years, which finally quit working.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a different brand, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s significant, and with that said, the pursonic is hands down a better value.  </li>
            <li> It tickles a bit if you&#x27;re new to sonic brushes, but I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth, so massage is plenty for me, and my teeth are still glossy clean.</li>
            <li> The brissels are soft and my teeth are so clean</li>
            <li> I have gum disease and it&#x27;s really helping with that - better than I was doing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very cost saving and the battery last more than a week before I need to put it on the charger again.</li>
            <li> It has far more features and is better engineered -- plus it comes with several extra brushes.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and effective however, you need to be careful to avoid touching hard plastic brush head against teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It features more cycles per second than many of the other models</li>
            <li> Not as powerful, when fully charged, as when it was new.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful, when fully charged, as when it was new.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer, understandably, would not provide a direct refund but they were quick to respond, polite and informed me they allow their dealers to return products anytime within the warranty period.  </li>
            <li> I recently took it on a cruise w/o the recharger and it stayed strong and buzzy for 10 days.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like it, its very powerful and loud; too much for me too handle</li>
            <li> I would personally prefer bristles that are a bit more firm/stiff, as these are pretty soft.</li>
            <li> Maybe if my mouth was larger, it would&#x27;ve been fine.  </li>
            <li> In the opposite orientation it works fine.  </li>
            <li> My mouth does feel pretty clean after use, and that is one of the key things.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, but vibrates hard on the teeth</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> It also sometimes hits my teeth with the plastic &amp; doesn&#x27;t really pulse evenly depending on the angle I&#x27;m using to brush.</li>
            <li> Tickles like crazy lol!</li>
            <li> Works really well for me</li>
            <li> Too intense</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because the price was so reasonable</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;d better keep your mouth closed at all times</li>
            <li> I really like this sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> I really feel my teeth are getting much cleaner.</li>
            <li> after doing SO much research about which one to buy, i decided on this one because of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems to do a a very thorough cleaning job</li>
            <li> That is really convenient to have them ready when you need to change them out.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush heads and the fact that it came with 12 of them.</li>
            <li> really much</li>
            <li> so my whole family can use them.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well and teeth feel very cleaned.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what the problem is.</li>
            <li> The Pursonic is well built and the price is much cheaper then the one my dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> and the vibrations weren&#x27;t as intense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price was reasonable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Debatable Pro/Con:&lt;br /&gt;Brush stops oscillating if too much pressure it applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: 2.5 stars really for this user.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now that I was given a Philips Sonicare for Christmas, I really see the difference in quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the pursonic brush compared to our old phillips for several reasons-</li>
            <li> Either it is even better than the Sonicare, or the performance level on mine had become so poor that switching to this is just that much better.</li>
            <li> You barely have to touch this to your teeth and it super cleans them.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fatter to hold just a little and love that one way more and in fact I&#x27;m going back to that just need to buy new heads for it</li>
            <li> On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean between the teeth as well as a regular toothbrush, so you really have to floss to do that.  </li>
            <li> ; I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, other electric toothbrushes are better, but it does work.</li>
            <li> and I love the supply of inexpensive re[lacement brushes which kill you on the other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands</li>
            <li> I have used other sonic toothbrushes, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> definitely feel a clean and healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are squeaky clean and really white.</li>
            <li> But that is easily remedied by buying a small bottle brush to clean it with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth have felt this clean since my last trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> it seems to get you teeth about as clean as properly using a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li> But clean it does, big time.</li>
            <li> I personally feel like a day at the dentist office when they clean your mouth and water</li>
            <li> It lives up to its name of high power and works very well.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being pleasantly surprised that the package was easy to open, I was prepared to like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The pursonic button simply cycles through each brush mode, which means you have to cycle through all modes to turn it off (if you don&#x27;t brush for a full 2-minute timed cycle).  </li>
            <li> the 30 second timer is sweet</li>
            <li> Might try using the sensitive setting at first, if it bothers you too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a Pursonic previously, that I liked very much, but it finally died.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush from day one, but the performance goes down quickly, soon after it stopped working after few month.</li>
            <li> It surely is a bargain price at less than $50.</li>
            <li> Manufacturer says on package in bold letters &amp;#34;Proud American Company&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> When this arrived, it filled in for a Braun whose old NiCad batteries finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I had the Older model of Philips Sonicare (the Essence) for about 15 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the main task it was bought for, cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where I stand on this particular item -except</li>
            <li> Once I learn how to get past the initial &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; from the high speed, my teeth actually feel cleaner and the higher speed makes me feel more confident about plaque removal.  </li>
            <li> After years of cavities and general teeth issues while using regular brushes, I switched to using Pursonic electric brushes last year and honestly now I can&#x27;t use anything</li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> My husband and myself like the Pursonic High Power Rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But when my toothbrush has more torque than my car, it&#x27;s a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> ON THE SENSITIVE SETTING IS GENTLE</li>
            <li> It works quite well, but the fast action causes spray that spots mirrors.  </li>
            <li> Works very well so far</li>
            <li> Really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> And the extra brushes, wow, even a better deal overall.</li>
            <li> They should try to find another location that is not in the are where the user will normally hold the brush.</li>
            <li> No complaint with retailer.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of not having to buy extra brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> By the way, the brushes are not hard to remove if you READ the instructions.</li>
            <li> after threatening the company to file a complaint with the CPA and sue them, they sent me a NEW upgraded model, S450 Deluxe.  </li>
            <li> have changed my initial 2 star rate to 4 stars after a Pursonic Representative told me how to replace the brush head by twisting the brush to the right &amp; then pull it off.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush seems like it is coming loose or trying to come off frequently although it is securely in place.</li>
            <li> $8 for a new brush head every 6 months.</li>
            <li> All that and one-third the price of a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> the brush head is significantly more difficult to remove compared to the sonicare brush which was just an interference (press) fit.  </li>
            <li> Very loud tool noise.</li>
            <li> We moved across country and the first week in our new apartment, this toothbrush would turn on in the middle of the night as if possessed.</li>
            <li> just need to send the first one back.....</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare for past 6 months and couldn&#x27;t take it any more.  </li>
            <li> Well, yeah, that&#x27;s like starting a blender without putting the lid on first.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to let the plastic hit your teeth at full speed.</li>
            <li> I went back to an Oral-B after finding the high speed with a rectangular shaped brush head was too large for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I especially like how super quiet the high power sonic toothbrush is. -</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush died and I started to search for a new one and came across this one.</li>
            <li> toothbrush offers 3 settings, normal, sensitive and massaging.  </li>
            <li> One thing I was concerned about was traveling with the whole bulky charger and all of that, but I recently went on a week long trip without the charger and it held a strong charge the entire time...</li>
            <li> They disliked how strong the vibration was and how often it hit and hurt their teeth.</li>
            <li> For some, a less powerful brush will be better, but we both prefer the slightly stronger action the phillips brush had.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap but seems to work</li>
            <li> My teeth have never seemed so clean – even after the first time I used it – and after a few days’ use it seems that the teeth actually look cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My old brush operated differently, was much slower.  </li>
            <li> I finished up, attempted to remove the brush head, and the stud that the head attaches to broke off completely in the brush handle and came out when I pulled the head off.</li>
            <li> It finally completely quit working</li>
            <li> so I threw our old oral-b</li>
            <li> its not like our old Oral-b</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll stick with it, and do not plan returning to old brush.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush head from the  99 cent store was far easier to take off.</li>
            <li> I can get used to the sound, but it is a bit messy to use.</li>
            <li> My old Oral needed heads that cost over $7 each.</li>
            <li> The vibration was far too aggressive for my sensitivity level even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I returned this because the back vibrated so much that it would hit my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from a professional cleaning every time.</li>
            <li> While I am in China, it&#x27;s really too difiiult for me to send the teethbrush back to the US.</li>
            <li> My four year old, all out panics.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt and use, I found that the whole brush tip rotates back and forth with the head clicking against my teeth.</li>
            <li> Aggressive, loud, probably does the job, but takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> Fixed that problem with the Pursonic.</li>
            <li> I have not learned how to eliminate the splash from the Pursonic , which is quite messy at any of the 3 speeds available.</li>
            <li> The tickling sensation is another issue if you are sensitive to this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush when my old faithful Oral B died after 10 years of use.  </li>
            <li> It feels far to familar to when a dentist&#x27;s drill vibrates against your teeth when they&#x27;re numbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no comparison, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> , the only drawback is you really need to hold on to it otherwise</li>
            <li> Other than that, it worked fine when I needed to use it until the second week of March 2015.</li>
            <li> a few times to get use to its very powerful</li>
            <li> I wish it had come with a little brush to clean out the brush head itself.</li>
            <li> We find the pursonic to be more difficult to manipulate and find it somewhat unbalanced in terms of weight distribution compared to the admittedly heavier sonicare brush (more metal, less plastic).  </li>
            <li> We only had it 4 months until it was dropped and the main shaft holding the brush heads snapped off and UNREPAIRABLE.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked at the sound of this item--however, I have gotten accustomed to the sound and love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a sonic toothbrush before, but within a few uses I was able to get into the routine of cleaning each quadrant, moving from one on to the next when the 30 second signal came.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely above average traditional brush, but I feel that Chinese nanobrushes (made of bamboo charcoal) do the job a bit better, though.</li>
            <li> You can hear it through 2 sets of closed doors - has a very high-pitched, loud buzz, almost like a drill.</li>
            <li> I came to really not want to have to use it, even before I got the Sonicare, because it is loud and if you just bump a tooth with the head, it is very jarring.</li>
            <li> The motor still works and the battery still takes a charge, but the business end came loose and does not vibrate freely as it rocks to one side or the other.</li>
            <li> After having used it for several months, so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a more expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This particular brush took a little getting used to with the much power in the head, but I did get used to it after a week or so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oscillation is fast but it also leads to spraying and a mess if you open your mouth too much or pull the brush out before stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> and are generally easier to manipulate and get where you want it to go.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush was very noisy and the ultrasound was overly aggressive the instructions were not complete especially locking the brush head on the power head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside the amazon return window, so I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturer directly asking for a refund.  </li>
            <li> The brush is cheaper, the heads are cheaper- everything about it is cheaper including it&#x27;s construction and function (relative, of course to our old sonicare)</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush as a replacement for an identical one that I had apparently dropped and it no longer worked.  </li>
            <li> I barely need ro floss at all, this thing just powers stuck food out.</li>
            <li> and it was fully charged overnight;  it offers 3 different strengths of brushing.  </li>
            <li> Has 3 modes, regular, sensitive, and massage.</li>
            <li> so much so that you have to undress while using it as you can&#x27;t keep your mouth closed &amp; consequently it sprays everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Update from prior review: it worked well for about 11 months: now the charge lasts about 30 seconds: can&#x27;t even complete one 2 min brushing.</li>
            <li> It is also incredibly rough on the teeth if you hit with the plastic - which you have to do for how much you have to move it</li>
            <li> The pursonic is also quite a bit louder and has more vibration between the handle and the brush head which, if you&#x27;re like me and are sensitive to sound, is quite annoying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of cheesy</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference, but certainly worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> Both my wife and myself think they&#x27;re too big- again, relative to the smaller phillips brush heads and purely based on personal preference.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be a little careful putting it back on to make sure you get it properly locked in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fully charged battery right out of the box, can last for  one person use half a month.</li>
            <li> Today, while brushing my teeth, the brush started making a very loud buzzing sound- louder than usual which I thought was odd.  </li>
            <li> Although the pursonic &#x27;vibrates&#x27; at a higher frequency than the phillips brush, the phillips brush was stronger overall and my wife and I both notice a slight difference in the way our teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> and when you put it back inside the stand, it leaves residue which is hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basing my review relative to the phillips product, which is to say, I&#x27;m comparing a $50.00 sonic toothbrush to a $120.00 sonic toothbrush- not exactly a fair comparison, but relevant nonetheless (in my opinion anyway).  </li>
            <li> They finally sent the same unit back and it worked for 3 days before doing the same exact thing - blinking lights, and now completely dead.  </li>
            <li> All electric toothbrushes take a little getting used to but the instructions were very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little time to get used to the extremely fast vibration.  </li>
            <li> I was reading a few reviews about how it stops working for a second on in a certain position...</li>
            <li> Now they have changed their models completely and the sensitive setting is just too hard for my sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> This has both good points &amp; bad.</li>
            <li> The smaller heads are also less likely to buzz against our teeth, which the pursonic heads do frequently.  </li>
            <li> Multiple heads will last a long time.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s construction and quality are not significantly lower than the sonicare (relative to the price difference anyway), so if you&#x27;re new to sonic toothbrushes, I&#x27;d have no problem recommending this brush without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> Once you get past that point, it really scrubs your teeth.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for so much power.</li>
            <li> Long story short-</li>
            <li> but the flat surfaces of the tooth.</li>
            <li> I Was a little disappointed at how much the brush head moved compared to other brands, but quickly became accustomed to it and felt that for the price, it was acceptable -- a full charge helped.</li>
            <li> but found the noise it makes - a high whine sound - unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Both brushes feature multiple modes, however, the pursonic has a single button to control everything- modes, on and off.  </li>
            <li> This seems to limited to when brushing on one side only.  </li>
            <li> The thing splatters and makes a complete mess.</li>
            <li> After a few days I am like an old pro and boy can I feel the difference it makes!</li>
            <li> Its power level and charge-hold time had been steadily decreasing for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> So, fast numbs mouth hard to hold without dripping.</li>
            <li> all of which could be considered minor, but are still annoyances that are realized every time we use it.  </li>
            <li> My fault that I did not completely read description and threw away packing before I realized that it does not.  </li>
            <li> I know how long i am brushing and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds its charge for a long while.</li>
            <li> (No idea how long the hold up, however... See Cons)&lt;br /&gt;Teeth seem clean&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; it unintentionally jumps from one speed to the other while brushing forcing you to cycle back to the speed of your choice.</li>
            <li> Going back to an Oral B with both sonic and rotating heads.cks to one side or the other.</li>
            <li> Due to life circumstances I did not have the opportunity to open this until the end of October.</li>
            <li> only an average product</li>
            <li> Curious as to how long it will go before another charge is needed.</li>
            <li> say, 6 months down the road to see if we&#x27;ve adapted to the differences mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> At least it died creatively -- it started randomly going on in the middle of the night at first (just a bit startling - especially for those of us with overactive imaginations).</li>
            <li> It is NOT a high powered unit as stated.</li>
            <li> It is not impossible - just difficult.  </li>
            <li> It tickled at first and was a little hard to control, but it only took a few days to get over this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extra messy - prepare to clean your mirror &amp; sink daily because it sprays like crazy.</li>
            <li> The hard part of the Purosonic  brush head was frequently hitting my teeth</li>
            <li> use it everyday for the last 1/2 year.</li>
            <li> works as expected</li>
            <li> While it works well if used carefully, it sprays toothpaste all over the place (when/if I use it anymore, I use it in the shower) and can hurt if you accidentally touch your teeth with the brush handle vs just the bristles.  </li>
            <li> This item works really well, but the plastic molding where you can switch out the heads of the toothbrush is poorly made.</li>
            <li> so vibrating that much seems unnecessary.</li>
            <li> My other plain sonic toothbrush with the big attachment</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest setting, this thing vibrates the hell out of your teeth, it&#x27;s difficult to control, and vibrates at such a high rate that it&#x27;s very difficult to clean anywhere</li>
            <li> We are getting a second one for the master bath just because we are lazy.</li>
            <li> For example, if you were to go through a timed cycle, but then want to brush your tongue after the cycle ends, it doesn&#x27;t take 2 min to brush your tongue so you have to cycle through the 2 other brush modes before it turns off.  </li>
            <li> At first your lik WTF</li>
            <li> and now I have to charge it every other day</li>
            <li> there is a small learning curve trying to find the button to turn on/off which is know big deal...</li>
            <li> Of course, other people&#x27;s experience may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other unit the brushes cost an arm and leg.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and run under hot water if it is difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and saw that people mentioned it hurt when it knocked against other teeth, but I thought that had to be an exaggeration.  </li>
            <li> We prefer the smaller heads and find it easier to get in behind back molars, etc.</li>
            <li> The brush head slides over a post on the base and rotates left to secure the brush head.  </li>
            <li> After having her wash her hands, I got the base open and confirmed my suspicions.</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement in November 2014 and last week (late June 2015)</li>
            <li> when suddenly my toothbrush started vibrating in the bathroom, late at night.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money</li>
            <li> The only negative is having to go thru each step in order to turn it off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasted more than 2 weeks without the base while I was on vacation</li>
            <li> I was careful to buy an Oral-B that had the round brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner with less effort and shorter time.</li>
            <li> Even despite they cost 100 times less (4-pack for $1.5 with shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After less than a week, I tried unscrewing the toothbrush head from the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even attempt to contact them considering my previous hassle.  </li>
            <li> I am really unhappy that I spent so much money on this pursonic.</li>
            <li> It has an annoying loud, high pitch hum to it.  </li>
            <li> It really only works for one person bc removing the toothbrush head to change out is so hard!</li>
            <li> nothing like a little perspective.  </li>
            <li> Also, the replacement heads are a little over $2 each, and it comes with 12.  </li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> but it requires little plug-in time to this</li>
            <li> but the battery has recently started performing poorly-</li>
            <li> Sadly, our old phillips sonicare bit the dust- the shaft the brush head attaches to separated from the motor after about 4 years of use by 2 people twice a day, so we were in need of a replacement.  </li>
            <li> stopped charging after just a few months</li>
            <li> I paid $49.90 (shipping included) on Amazon, so it does pay to check a few prices.  </li>
            <li> You just have to put the twist tie on the extra cord behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Pronounced dead on 8/21/16.</li>
            <li> Missing the beginning of the days of using the brush....</li>
            <li> The led lights started to blink erratically, it stopped charging, then went completely dead.  </li>
            <li> After tracking the shipment and seeing it was delivered, I waited a few days and got no response.  </li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s not huge</li>
            <li> all the slow buildup and other issues are gone.</li>
            <li> I usually like a narrow brush, but this one is a little too small &amp; narrow even for me.</li>
            <li> I owned other expensive sonic-style toothbrushes in the past and this Pursonic beats it to he$# and back.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush shape somehow has the hard part hitting against my teeth which never happened with my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a solid electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t crazy expensive this is a decent one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not just a small difference-</li>
            <li> and ultimately I took it out to my car&#x27;s trunk because the toothbrush would randomly turn itself on and off during the night....</li>
            <li> It was one disappointing toothbrush that I put up with far longer than I should have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Product imprint in small letters &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened, but it doesn&#x27;t charge and won&#x27;t&#x27; work again..</li>
            <li> The vibration of this tooth brush is such that it uncomfortably tickles and vibrates your teeth.</li>
            <li> My younger children find the vibration to be to uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I was not able to return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand holds 4 brush heads &amp; has a small footprint that will economize the room on your sinktop.</li>
            <li> However, there are a couple of things that are inconvenient, such as the brush head being hard to remove from the body (especially when the brush head or your hands are wet), and the cover for back part of the base being a bit clunky.</li>
            <li> We prefer smaller heads because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re used to using- time will tell if the larger heads on the pursonic continue to be somewhat annoying.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I waited too long to return this</li>
            <li> The head of unit broke off because it is to hard to twist of the brush heads when changing them.</li>
            <li> It gets in the hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> The heads hardly have any brissels</li>
            <li> I pulled really hard</li>
            <li> This is our biggest complaint about the pursonic.  </li>
            <li> and I brought it home to its base, where I was hopeful it would reset itself and begin working normally.  </li>
            <li> Bad quality product and they only &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alternate features like a mode for sensitive teeth and massage come off as worthless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched from another well known brand because I got tired of the ridiculous costs of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> It will give you a rather unpleasant &amp;#34;jolt&amp;#34; if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat annoying, but again, this is compared to the sonicare brush which simply turns off with one press of the button, rather than cycling through-</li>
            <li> It would turn on and buzz on the bathroom counter until one of us would get up and press the button to try and turn it off or pick it up and place it back in its Base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resorted to holding the brush head with a facecloth in order to get enough of a grip to unsecure it from the base.  </li>
            <li> Poor design in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> putting it back on its base and recharging it did NOT fix the problem.  </li>
            <li> I was also really tired of paying +/-</li>
            <li> The problem is when your done brushing the brush head is wet, slippery and very hard to unsecure from the base.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times, thinking it was just that I had to get used to it, but I was terrified to brush my teeth because it was so painful, so I knew I had to return the product.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the base unit, which looked flimsy in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Now it sits on my bathroom counter as an expensive dust collector.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m stuck with a useless piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I docked one star because I was skeptical about the packaging-</li>
            <li> For a person with arthritis in their hands, it is a difficult move.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> and now she is crazy about it...</li>
            <li> There is one position that the vibration keeps cutting out.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed to know this toothbrush has been rendered useless...</li>
            <li> The one thing we both hate is the twist to lock (the head is put onto the brush handle and is twisted about 30º to lock it to the handle</li>
            <li> but the heads are nearly impossible to remove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is simply a bad design... find something else.</li>
            <li> I would have given a 4 or 5 star rating but putting the brush head on and off of the base of the toothbrush is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred a functioning toothbrush! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost disappointed when the brushing time is up.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It snapped at the base of the brush and was not fixable.</li>
            <li> When you put the brush head on the base, you have to put it on and then twist it to the correct position.  </li>
            <li> The bottom part of the brush head is still attached inside the tooth brush base.</li>
            <li> My wife picked it up and tried to turn it off then saw a brownish substance oozing out of the base which I immediately recognized as battery acid.</li>
            <li> my wife hated it...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I could not get it to STOP(it was OBSESSED!!!)</li>
            <li> Bad!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is very bad product!!!!!</li>
            <li> What a bad luck!!!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible machine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice cleaning, much better than my previous toothbrush battery operated, with AAA, model.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted more than 2 weeks without the base while I was on vacation</li>
            <li> Great deal on a fine product. And the extra brushes, wow, even a better deal overall.</li>
            <li> You barely have to touch this to your teeth and it super cleans them.  I spread the toothpaste all around my mouth before I ever turn on the brush. That seems to work best. I have really sensitive teeth, so massage is plenty for me, and my teeth are still glossy clean. I purchased the $4 two yr warranty also. We are getting a second one for the master bath just because we are lazy. You get 12 brush heads with every unit. That&#x27;s a great value. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Update 1.7.15:  The manufacturer, understandably, would not provide a direct refund but they were quick to respond, polite and informed me they allow their dealers to return products anytime within the warranty period.  I contacted Amazon and they happily provided an RMA and refunded my money so overall, it was a good experience.  I just wish the brush had performed better.  Wound up buying another Sonicare HX6921 which, after using the Pursonic, we are even more smitten with- nothing like a little perspective.  Revised again to 2 stars for the very good and prompt customer service.  Update 12.28.14:  I&#x27;ve dropped my review to 1 star.  Today, while brushing my teeth, the brush started making a very loud buzzing sound- louder than usual which I thought was odd.  I finished up, attempted to remove the brush head, and the stud that the head attaches to broke off completely in the brush handle and came out when I pulled the head off. The piece that broke was made of plastic- picture uploaded.  Not only that , but the battery has recently started performing poorly- it won&#x27;t hold a charge longer than 3 days anymore.  I cannot recommend this toothbrush any longer.  With 2 people using this brush twice a day, it didn&#x27;t even last 3 months.  I&#x27;m outside the amazon return window, so I&#x27;ve contacted the manufacturer directly asking for a refund.  I&#x27;m hoping their customer service is better than the product they produce.  I&#x27;ll be sure to update when I hear back from them.  Original Reivew:  Sadly, our old phillips sonicare bit the dust- the shaft the brush head attaches to separated from the motor after about 4 years of use by 2 people twice a day, so we were in need of a replacement.  I&#x27;m basing my review relative to the phillips product, which is to say, I&#x27;m comparing a $50.00 sonic toothbrush to a $120.00 sonic toothbrush- not exactly a fair comparison, but relevant nonetheless (in my opinion anyway).  This is the brush I&#x27;m comparing it to:  http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HX6921-02-Rechargeable-Toothbrush/dp/B00CUG273A/ref&#x3D;sr_1_16?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1415748234&amp;sr&#x3D;8-16&amp;keywords&#x3D;phillips+sonicare  I&#x27;m not in love with the pursonic brush compared to our old phillips for several reasons- all of which could be considered minor, but are still annoyances that are realized every time we use it.  Brush head size:  Both my wife and myself think they&#x27;re too big- again, relative to the smaller phillips brush heads and purely based on personal preference.  We prefer the smaller heads and find it easier to get in behind back molars, etc. and are generally easier to manipulate and get where you want it to go.  The smaller heads are also less likely to buzz against our teeth, which the pursonic heads do frequently.  We&#x27;ve only had the pursonic for a month, so that&#x27;s well within what I would call an adjustment phase to get used to the differences in brush head size.  We prefer smaller heads because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re used to using- time will tell if the larger heads on the pursonic continue to be somewhat annoying.  Power:  Faster does not necessarily equal better/stronger.  Although the pursonic &#x27;vibrates&#x27; at a higher frequency than the phillips brush, the phillips brush was stronger overall and my wife and I both notice a slight difference in the way our teeth feel.  Not a huge difference, but certainly worth mentioning.  For some, a less powerful brush will be better, but we both prefer the slightly stronger action the phillips brush had.  The pursonic is also quite a bit louder and has more vibration between the handle and the brush head which, if you&#x27;re like me and are sensitive to sound, is quite annoying.  Ergonomics:  The pursonic is bigger in every dimension, and we find ourselves not liking the larger diameter of the brush handle.  Again, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning if you&#x27;re switching from a phillips sonicare brush- it&#x27;s a noticeable difference.  We find the pursonic to be more difficult to manipulate and find it somewhat unbalanced in terms of weight distribution compared to the admittedly heavier sonicare brush (more metal, less plastic).  The one thing we both hate is the twist to lock (the head is put onto the brush handle and is twisted about 30º to lock it to the handle) design for the brush head- the brush head is significantly more difficult to remove compared to the sonicare brush which was just an interference (press) fit.  This is our biggest complaint about the pursonic.  Features:  Both brushes feature multiple modes, however, the pursonic has a single button to control everything- modes, on and off.  The sonic care brush had a mode-select button and a power button- select the mode you want, and the power button turns it on and off.  The pursonic button simply cycles through each brush mode, which means you have to cycle through all modes to turn it off (if you don&#x27;t brush for a full 2-minute timed cycle).  For example, if you were to go through a timed cycle, but then want to brush your tongue after the cycle ends, it doesn&#x27;t take 2 min to brush your tongue so you have to cycle through the 2 other brush modes before it turns off.  It&#x27;s somewhat annoying, but again, this is compared to the sonicare brush which simply turns off with one press of the button, rather than cycling through- we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to that setup.  I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s still a mild annoyance.  Finally, value:  There&#x27;s zero doubt the pursonic is a better value. The brush is cheaper, the heads are cheaper- everything about it is cheaper including it&#x27;s construction and function (relative, of course to our old sonicare) and it&#x27;s not just a small difference- it&#x27;s significant, and with that said, the pursonic is hands down a better value.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s construction and quality are not significantly lower than the sonicare (relative to the price difference anyway), so if you&#x27;re new to sonic toothbrushes, I&#x27;d have no problem recommending this brush without hesitation.  If however, you are coming out of a higher-end sonic brush like we were, you may not like the pursonic.  For now, we&#x27;ll keep it and use it.  Since it&#x27;s only been about a month, I&#x27;ll try and remember to update my review say, 6 months down the road to see if we&#x27;ve adapted to the differences mentioned above.  For now, after only 30 days, 3 stars is all it gets from me, all things considered.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me as a gift for Christmas 2014. It worked fine until the end of February 2015. We moved across country and the first week in our new apartment, this toothbrush would turn on in the middle of the night as if possessed. It would turn on and buzz on the bathroom counter until one of us would get up and press the button to try and turn it off or pick it up and place it back in its Base. Other than that, it worked fine when I needed to use it until the second week of March 2015. All of a sudden it stopped working. Now it sits on my bathroom counter as an expensive dust collector. When I tried to return it to amazon, the return period had passed at the end of January. So now I&#x27;m stuck with a useless piece of garbage. Buyers beware!!! I&#x27;m telling everyone to avoid this brand!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I LOVED this product when it worked. The reason I&#x27;m rating it one star is that it came with 3 years of brushes and stopped working in under 6 months. At least it died creatively -- it started randomly going on in the middle of the night at first (just a bit startling - especially for those of us with overactive imaginations). Then, once you turned it on, it wouldn&#x27;t turn off. And, finally, it just never turned on again. Of course, it died after the return window and I can&#x27;t find anything about options for returning/replacing it now. It really was great for the short time it worked. I just wonder what I&#x27;m going to do with 2 1/2 years worth of brushes...I guess I have a colorful set of grout cleaning utensils. I would have preferred a functioning toothbrush! :(</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great.  Cleans the teeth very well.  I would have given a 4 or 5 star rating but putting the brush head on and off of the base of the toothbrush is very difficult.  The brush head slides over a post on the base and rotates left to secure the brush head.  The problem is when your done brushing the brush head is wet, slippery and very hard to unsecure from the base.  I&#x27;ve resorted to holding the brush head with a facecloth in order to get enough of a grip to unsecure it from the base.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; and weigh 240.  So strength is not the problem.  Poor design in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve stayed with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. It tickles a bit if you&#x27;re new to sonic brushes, but I got used to it quickly. I like that it comes with so many replacement heads. I docked one star because I was skeptical about the packaging- there wasn&#x27;t any seal to indicate that it hadn&#x27;t been opened before. All pieces were intact, clean and appeared new though.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Just don&#x27;t drop it. It snapped at the base of the brush and was not fixable.</li>
            <li> I like its thorough brushing and teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> works great for the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed the difference in my last checkup. I credit the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first one broke....2 weeks in so I bought another one just need to send the first one back.....will be doing that monday...the one I had before that lasted 1.6 years</li>
            <li> did not like handle rattling on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Still getting adjusted to this item, but works great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase and I know my teeth are getting an A-! brushing compared to the battery operated Oral B electric brush I was using. The 12 heads are a BIG plus and they are quality brush heads. This particular brush took a little getting used to with the much power in the head, but I did get used to it after a week or so and now I really enjoy brushing. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Good value for a goodproduct.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST toothbrush ever!!!</li>
            <li> The brush is excellent but the head is to small, do you have heads bigger for replacement? I do like  it very much.</li>
            <li> It is great!! Been using it for a month now. I was reading a few reviews about how it stops working for a second on in a certain position... Lol it pauses every 30 seconds to let you know it is timing you.. It cuts off at 2minutes.. At first your lik WTF.. But if u read the manual it has a purpose.. But love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush as a replacement for an identical one that I had apparently dropped and it no longer worked.  I purchased the replacement in November 2014 and last week (late June 2015) I was traveling, staying in a motel....when suddenly my toothbrush started vibrating in the bathroom, late at night.  Long story short-I could not get it to STOP(it was OBSESSED!!!)....and ultimately I took it out to my car&#x27;s trunk because the toothbrush would randomly turn itself on and off during the night.... It finally completely quit working and I brought it home to its base, where I was hopeful it would reset itself and begin working normally.  I am so disappointed to know this toothbrush has been rendered useless...putting it back on its base and recharging it did NOT fix the problem.  I will order a totally different brand of electric toothbrush, tomorrow!!!!</li>
            <li> The head of unit broke off because it is to hard to twist of the brush heads when changing them. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> junk, no power, didn&#x27;t remove plaque.  not worth the money</li>
            <li> brush was way to aggressive and vibrated my head off, figuratively speaking</li>
            <li> Everything just as advertised! Very nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this Pursonic Rechargeable Toothbrush after seeing it on a very popular TV Shopping Channel.  I have been using the Sonicare brands of toothbrushes for 10+ years. Now they have changed their models completely and the sensitive setting is just too hard for my sensitive teeth and gums.  THIS PURSONIC TOOTHBRUSH  ON THE SENSITIVE SETTING IS GENTLE BUT SO VERY EFFECTIVE!!!  I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush offers 3 settings, normal, sensitive and massaging.  It has a 2 minute quad timer, and comes with 8+ extra toothbrush heads.  This Pursonic is so economically priced, you simply cannot find a better sonic toothbrush out there for the price.  I will not go back to the Sonicare Toothbrushes, which run $125.00+!! With the Pursonic, my teeth feel so amazingly clean, and my gums are not sore!!  Be sure to read instructions on how to remove the brush heads, simply turn to the right and pull off!! Amazon also offers the best price out there!!  LOVE-LOVE-LOVE !!!!</li>
            <li> stopped charging after just a few months</li>
            <li> This has both good points &amp; bad. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t crazy expensive this is a decent one. It vibrates at an impressive rates &amp; does a thorough job. It&#x27;s rechargeable so you don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries &amp; it comes with a ton of replacement heads. What I don&#x27;t love about it; it&#x27;s the nosiest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. You can hear it through 2 sets of closed doors - has a very high-pitched, loud buzz, almost like a drill. It&#x27;s extra messy - prepare to clean your mirror &amp; sink daily because it sprays like crazy. It also sometimes hits my teeth with the plastic &amp; doesn&#x27;t really pulse evenly depending on the angle I&#x27;m using to brush. I usually like a narrow brush, but this one is a little too small &amp; narrow even for me. The bottom line is: it works. It does a good job of cleaning your teeth. The things I don&#x27;t like about it aren&#x27;t enough to make me send it back, but I won&#x27;t be buying another one from this company.</li>
            <li> Does the job but causes strong vibration when anything but the brush head touches your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked at the sound of this item--however, I have gotten accustomed to the sound and love the toothbrush.  Well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This item was in an online article rating similar items. It was #2 over all and #1 in value for the dollar. I love it! Though it takes getting used to if you never used a sonic toothbrush before. Tickles like crazy lol! After a few days I am like an old pro and boy can I feel the difference it makes! I barely need ro floss at all, this thing just powers stuck food out.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and works great.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare for past 6 months and couldn&#x27;t take it any more.  It was one disappointing toothbrush that I put up with far longer than I should have.  Got the Sonicare and immediately knew I should have done so six months earlier.  It has far more features and is better engineered -- plus it comes with several extra brushes.  A far superior product than the Sonicare, and at one-fourth the price.</li>
            <li> It works well.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Does a very good job cleaning my teeth, I can feel the difference&lt;br /&gt;- Good power out of the battery&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality brush heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- One multifuncitonal on/off and speed switch; it unintentionally jumps from one speed to the other while brushing forcing you to cycle back to the speed of your choice. They should try to find another location that is not in the are where the user will normally hold the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment I have made...we no longer have to time our daughter&#x27;s daily teeth brushing!!!</li>
            <li> Great deal, still working</li>
            <li> Item is GREAT and as good as advertised, the 3-different pulses make sense and I&#x27;ve used all-3. Takes a bit of getting used to but being my first electric toothbrush, I can tell the difference between manual easily. Teeth feel cleaner with less effort and shorter time.</li>
            <li> I went back to an Oral-B after finding the high speed with a rectangular shaped brush head was too large for my mouth.  (A manual toothbrush is no problem however.)  I was careful to buy an Oral-B that had the round brush heads.  The hard part of the Purosonic  brush head was frequently hitting my teeth and I was told by my dentist&#x27;s office that there was a danger of damaging the enamel.  (A dentist once told me that my mouth does not open as widely as most.)  I had to rate this according to how it worked for me, but it is probably a great toothbrush for most people.</li>
            <li> I bought this a,month ago . I charged it when I first got it. That was 4 weeks ago and its still holding the charge. I haven&#x27;t put it back on the charge daily as someone said they do. Initial charge only. Curious as to how long it will go before another charge is needed. Cleaning is good and does stop every 30 sec to allow complete clean.. Well worth the money. Especially with the extra brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great product love it!</li>
            <li> Great, my teeth are so clean!</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one!!  At this price, they can!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! Love how it pauses briefly every 30 seconds to let you know to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, but vibrates hard on the teeth</li>
            <li> Good Value for a Quality Ultra-Sonic Tooth Brush!&lt;br /&gt;It features more cycles per second than many of the other models&lt;br /&gt;and you will feel it!!</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this purchase in the beginning I like to the different levels and I liked that I could scrub my gums with this without having any pain or bleeding. As time has gone on I only been about six months and we went from having to charge it once a week to charge it every four days and now I have to charge it every other day and it is a pain in the ass. My other plain sonic toothbrush with the big attachment well it&#x27;s not huge but it&#x27;s fatter to hold just a little and love that one way more and in fact I&#x27;m going back to that just need to buy new heads for it I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> No complaint with retailer.  Manufacturer says on package in bold letters &amp;#34;Proud American Company&amp;#34;.  Product imprint in small letters &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my pursonic toothbrush.amazon comes through again! !</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  It stays charged for longer periods of time than my IntelliSonic which died on me only after a year.  It lives up to its name of high power and works very well.</li>
            <li> use it everyday for the last 1/2 year. works as expected</li>
            <li> This unit is great.  It started charging immediately I plugged it in and it was fully charged overnight;  it offers 3 different strengths of brushing.  My teeth have never seemed so clean – even after the first time I used it – and after a few days’ use it seems that the teeth actually look cleaner.  All electric toothbrushes take a little getting used to but the instructions were very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exchanged several emails with Customer Care and I thought that their service was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like it, its very powerful and loud; too much for me too handle but it does get your teeth clean</li>
            <li> This is an excellent and inexpensive brush.  I recently took it on a cruise w/o the recharger and it stayed strong and buzzy for 10 days.  The brush pauses briefly after every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  There are three intensity levels. The lowest gives a pleasant gum massage.  One of the great advantages of this set is that it comes with a bunch of replacement brushes so you are not tempted to keep using a worn out brush.  By the way, the brushes are not hard to remove if you READ the instructions.</li>
            <li> When this arrived, it filled in for a Braun whose old NiCad batteries finally gave up the ghost. More energetic, easier to keep clean, and with so many spare brushes, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> After analysis paralysis, finally decided on buying this sonic toothbrush. After having used it for several months, so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a more expensive toothbrush. This one operates well, charges quickly and the battery life lasts forever in between charges. It comes with plenty of replacement heads too. Great buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li> great cleaning &amp; polishing...should have switched from brush to this product years ago!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to... my wife hated it... so I threw our old oral-b out... she had no choice but to use it and now she is crazy about it... I here her say... my teeth feel really smooth.... the 30 second timer is sweet it lets you know its time to switch to bottom/top. there is a small learning curve trying to find the button to turn on/off which is know big deal... its not like our old Oral-b where you push it once to turn on/off.... We love it... we are glad you bought this pursonic.</li>
            <li> Compares well with the leading brands. Better features than most at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend as a buy.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great! However removing the toothbrush head each time is difficulty! It really only works for one person bc removing the toothbrush head to change out is so hard!</li>
            <li> Love it. Cleans so will.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush,just as good as my old oral b,half the cost,holds good charge,would recommend to anyone ,can be messy if u brush in front of a mirror close up,splatters,but worth it</li>
            <li> Very powerful and effective however, you need to be careful to avoid touching hard plastic brush head against teeth.  It will give you a rather unpleasant &amp;#34;jolt&amp;#34; if you aren&#x27;t careful.  With practice, it becomes okay.</li>
            <li> works fine,a good thing to use</li>
            <li> Have never used a sonic electric toothbrush before so didn&#x27;t realize that the high frequency oscillation would be challenging to adjust to--it tickles the gums and tongue!  But my wife and I both feel that it does a better job of cleaning and polishing the surfaces of our teeth than a regular toothbrush does.  On the downside, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean between the teeth as well as a regular toothbrush, so you really have to floss to do that.  But you floss anyway, don&#x27;t you.  Right.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected, makes my dentist happy, as my teeth are cleaner than ever  before.  Works really well for me</li>
            <li> On my dentist recommendation i purchased  a sonic tooth brush, I am pleased with the result.&lt;br /&gt;I was not a thorough tooth brusher, The Pursonic is good for brushing the recommended time period of 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel a clean and healthier mouth. Its a great value for the price and it included enough brush heads for 2 years, more than generous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase and would recommend highly</li>
            <li> I had the Older model of Philips Sonicare (the Essence) for about 15 years. Its power level and charge-hold time had been steadily decreasing for the past couple of years. Last week when the power button finally gave out I decided to look for a replacement. I was also really tired of paying +/- $8 for a new brush head every 6 months. So, after reading the reviews for the Pursonic I decided to give it a try. THIS THING IS AMAZING. Either it is even better than the Sonicare, or the performance level on mine had become so poor that switching to this is just that much better. Plus, it includes 12 brushes that will last me for 3 more years.  All that and one-third the price of a new Sonicare. I can&#x27;t overstate how pleased I am</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush, so maybe I&#x27;m just too excited about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading the manual I&#x27;ve stumbled upon a sentence &amp;#34;Your gums may bleed during 1st week of usage, don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal&amp;#34; - and it made me a bit nervous before turning it on for the first time. But all I&#x27;ve got so far is an awesome tickling sensation. No bleeding, no discomfort, whatever. Of course, other people&#x27;s experience may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the main task it was bought for, cleaning my teeth. It&#x27;s definitely above average traditional brush, but I feel that Chinese nanobrushes (made of bamboo charcoal) do the job a bit better, though. Even despite they cost 100 times less (4-pack for $1.5 with shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll stick with it, and do not plan returning to old brush.</li>
            <li> While it works well if used carefully, it sprays toothpaste all over the place (when/if I use it anymore, I use it in the shower) and can hurt if you accidentally touch your teeth with the brush handle vs just the bristles.  Too intense; I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, other electric toothbrushes are better, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the locking feature.  When you put the brush head on the base, you have to put it on and then twist it to the correct position.  For a person with arthritis in their hands, it is a difficult move.  It is not impossible - just difficult.  Once you get past that point, it really scrubs your teeth.</li>
            <li> Works well and lots of extra toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because the price was so reasonable and I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare in the past.  I like this Pursonic much better.  Once I learn how to get past the initial &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; from the high speed, my teeth actually feel cleaner and the higher speed makes me feel more confident about plaque removal.  Plus...to get extra brush heads is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much power an electric toothbrush needs to get your teeth clean, but this one has too much power for me. You could use it to remove paint after you brush. Even on the lowest setting, this thing vibrates the hell out of your teeth, it&#x27;s difficult to control, and vibrates at such a high rate that it&#x27;s very difficult to clean anywhere but the flat surfaces of the tooth. And you&#x27;d better keep your mouth closed at all times or you&#x27;ll spray toothpaste all over the place. Maybe I&#x27;m just not suited to any electric toothbrush. But when my toothbrush has more torque than my car, it&#x27;s a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. My gums feel good. It gets in the hard to reach spots. My teeth are squeaky clean and really white.</li>
            <li> This item works really well, but the plastic molding where you can switch out the heads of the toothbrush is poorly made. The electric toothbrush head from the  99 cent store was far easier to take off. After less than a week, I tried unscrewing the toothbrush head from the toothbrush and I  broke the plastic. I had the same problem with an immersion blender I purchased on Amazon. You couldn&#x27;t unscrew the attachment from the body. They sent me a replacement and I never had another issue. Unfortunately I waited too long to return this so I am out the money. I won&#x27;t re-purchase on Amazon. I will go to Target to buy another electric brush so if there is another problem, I can return it.</li>
            <li> Each time I brush, my teeth and gums feel like I&#x27;ve just left the hygienist...powerful brush, love it....</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush does a great job &amp; has held its charge for a long period of time! I recommend it &amp; the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She likes it.</li>
            <li> i love it .my teeth are very clean &amp; getting whiter .takes a few times to get use to its very powerful</li>
            <li> It works quite well, but the fast action causes spray that spots mirrors.  I can get used to the sound, but it is a bit messy to use.</li>
            <li> This my third electric toothbrush. Best one ever</li>
            <li> Works very well so far</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush at a great price</li>
            <li> Replaced another electric toothbrush and glad that I did.  This one works just as well but comes with additional heads that will last me for awhile.  Other unit the brushes cost an arm and leg.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. After being pleasantly surprised that the package was easy to open, I was prepared to like the toothbrush. but found the noise it makes - a high whine sound - unpleasant. The toothbrush shape somehow has the hard part hitting against my teeth which never happened with my previous electric toothbrush. I don&#x27;t like the multiple pauses.</li>
            <li> Shakes like a mother****** but the heads are nearly impossible to remove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...5 months in and the plastic element that connects the motor to the head broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that this has happened elsewhere.  The shaft is scuffed in the photo because it took a vice grip to get out of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a bad design... find something else.</li>
            <li> 7/18/14  I just bought this thing today, so my comments are on initial quality and use.  I bought it to replace a Braun Oral B that finally died after many years of use.  The list price on this unit is $89.  I paid $49.90 (shipping included) on Amazon, so it does pay to check a few prices.  Also, the replacement heads are a little over $2 each, and it comes with 12.  My old Oral needed heads that cost over $7 each. This new one works more like a Phillips Sonicare than the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing I was a little concerned about the base unit, which looked flimsy in the pictures.  It is sturdier and heavier than it looks.  There is no excess cord storage, though.  You just have to put the twist tie on the extra cord behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully charged battery right out of the box - no 12, 24 or 48 hour precharge needed, because who buys a toothbrush they don&#x27;t need for a couple of days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users commented that they could not remove the head.  Follow the instructions and run under hot water if it is difficult to remove.  You do have to be a little careful putting it back on to make sure you get it properly locked in.  I didn&#x27;t do that the first couple of times and the head was coming off as I tried to brush.  We&#x27;ll see how this holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little time to get used to the extremely fast vibration.  This brush moves a lot faster than my Oral B.  Tickles at first, but you do adapt quickly.  Might try using the sensitive setting at first, if it bothers you too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw another comment about spraying toothpaste when you turn it on.  Well, yeah, that&#x27;s like starting a blender without putting the lid on first.  Who&#x27;s fault is that?  Learn to put the brush head in your mouth before turning it on, and turn it off before you take it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Pronounced dead on 8/21/16. The motor still works and the battery still takes a charge, but the business end came loose and does not vibrate freely as it rocks to one side or the other. Not as powerful, when fully charged, as when it was new. I have been using more manual brushing effort over time. Going back to an Oral B with both sonic and rotating heads.cks to one side or the other. Not as powerful, when fully charged, as when it was new. I have been using more manual brushing effort over time. Going back to an Oral B with both sonic and rotating heads.</li>
            <li> Bad!!!!!!!!!! All I can say is very bad product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and charges quickly. My dentist recommended a much more expensive product - like $140+ and I couldn&#x27;t afford that.  This is a great product at a great price with great results. I have gum disease and it&#x27;s really helping with that - better than I was doing with a regular toothbrush. I wish it had come with a little brush to clean out the brush head itself. It accumulates toothpaste inside and when you put it back inside the stand, it leaves residue which is hard to clean.  But that is easily remedied by buying a small bottle brush to clean it with.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush died and I started to search for a new one and came across this one. What intriqued me most was that it included 12 toothbrush replacement heads. Has 3 modes, regular, sensitive, and massage. Seems to clean well, good long battery life, LED lights to tell you the brushes status and a LED to signify charging.</li>
            <li> Because of picture, thought this also sterilized brush heads.  My fault that I did not completely read description and threw away packing before I realized that it does not.  Brush works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting to love it. Used it one time and it was perfect. Used it this morning and the brush head broke! The bottom part of the brush head is still attached inside the tooth brush base. Returning immediately.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic!  It&#x27;s really powerful- so much so that you have to undress while using it as you can&#x27;t keep your mouth closed &amp; consequently it sprays everywhere.  A small price to pay for so much power.</li>
            <li> not enough power at all. we have been using sonicare and oral B and this just feels like it tingles over teeth.. the toothbrush is very light weight and feels like it doesnt clean teeth at all.</li>
            <li> very nice, works great, a good buy!</li>
            <li> I really like this sonic toothbrush.  I bought It because it was the fastest one that I saw and it is great. I feel that my teeth are looking whiter since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I am really liking it. I really feel my teeth are getting much cleaner. I know how long i am brushing and that is a plus. Multiple heads will last a long time. Charges fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth have felt this clean since my last trip to the dentist. However, there are a couple of things that are inconvenient, such as the brush head being hard to remove from the body (especially when the brush head or your hands are wet), and the cover for back part of the base being a bit clunky. These don&#x27;t really interfere with using the toothbrush though, so 4 stars!</li>
            <li> great transaction and great product</li>
            <li> Really like it so far.  light, attractive, easy to use and I love the supply of inexpensive re[lacement brushes which kill you on the other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested to invest in a sonic tooth brush. Purchased this and my teeth have never felt cleaner! after doing SO much research about which one to buy, i decided on this one because of the replacement heads. Very cost saving and the battery last more than a week before I need to put it on the charger again.</li>
            <li> Returned. I bought this set because I had just got braces and wanted a deal on an electric toothbrush. Big mistake. The vibration was far too aggressive for my sensitivity level even on the lowest setting. I asked my boyfriend to try it to see if he could tolerate it since he doesn&#x27;t have braces. He tried it on all three settings and was laughing when I walked in the bathroom. When I asked him what was so funny he simply stated that the buzz of the vibrations reminded him of a song.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush; my teeth have never felt cleaner. I would recommend this to anyone who is still operating a manual brush. Teeth feel cleaner, feels good on the gums, and removes a lot of old buildup between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems to do a a very thorough cleaning job</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush.  The variable speeds are a great feature and the extra brushes are a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she uses it every day. I especially like how super quiet the high power sonic toothbrush is. - DanT</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING! I owned other expensive sonic-style toothbrushes in the past and this Pursonic beats it to he$# and back.  In one use my teeth felt like I had just left the hygienist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> Powerful and refreshing!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m finally ready to write this review. I needed enough time to really see if it was as great as I read. And it is GREAT! IT took me a while to be able to use it on the first setting but I&#x27;m there now and I&#x27;m fine with it. I love the massage setting, it feels so good on your gums. This makes my teeth feel very clean and I got a big thumbs up from my Dental Hygienist for my teeth being so clean!!!!!  I also like that it came with all the replacement heads. That is really convenient to have them ready when you need to change them out.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my children, ages 11, 9, and 4. They disliked how strong the vibration was and how often it hit and hurt their teeth. It stopped working and won&#x27;t charge after one month of use.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for my son. Works awesome.  Stays charged.</li>
            <li> Very good.  High quality.  Why pay for Sonic Care when this does just as good a job?  Also this is a very quiet toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job! The only negative is having to go thru each step in order to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Took a little getting used to.  It tickled at first and was a little hard to control, but it only took a few days to get over this and it&#x27;s a wonderful tooth brush.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  Even my dentist was impressed.  And, with the twelve replacement heads, it will be a while before I have to get more.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  The price with the extra heads can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great product for families with the color coded brush heads</li>
            <li> excellent style and features--xtra heads make it a bargain at the price--most pleased!</li>
            <li> I loved this brush from day one, but the performance goes down quickly, soon after it stopped working after few month. I am not sure what happened, but it doesn&#x27;t charge and won&#x27;t&#x27; work again..</li>
            <li> I returned this because the back vibrated so much that it would hit my teeth.  Maybe if my mouth was larger, it would&#x27;ve been fine.  It also tickled a bit.  It appeared to be a good brush.  I just couldn&#x27;t handle those two issues.</li>
            <li> I chose this toothbrush based on product reviews. When it arrived, I removed it from the box and was able to try it immediately, as it had been pre-charged. I&#x27;ve never used a sonic toothbrush before, but within a few uses I was able to get into the routine of cleaning each quadrant, moving from one on to the next when the 30 second signal came. When the brush shuts off at the 2 minute mark, my teeth are clean. The brush is nice and soft, and gets to the areas that my manual toothbrush often misses. Overall I am extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I like the price and effectiveness of the toothbrush. My mouth does feel pretty clean after use, and that is one of the key things. The price of replacement heads is also a factor, as well as the fact that this unit comes with so many. However, I wish there were more options available for brush head types. Specifically for bristle firmness/stiffness. I would personally prefer bristles that are a bit more firm/stiff, as these are pretty soft. YMMV.</li>
            <li> Our sonic elite died and we got this.  Better product.  Comes with 1 brushes for family use.  Works great and very satisfied with.</li>
            <li> REally Great toothbrush for 2 months, then died. Didn&#x27;t drop it, bottom got hot and it died, used for 54 days.</li>
            <li> Brush head are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this toothbrush when I first used it.  My old brush operated differently, was much slower.  After getting used to it,  I love it!  I&#x27;m almost disappointed when the brushing time is up.  I do take the brush head off after every use because it&#x27;s easier to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Great product except that the brush heads are incredibly hard to put on and off.  Perhaps mine is defective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always leave feedback. But I can&#x27;t believe how my teeth feel after the first use. I have been using Braun electric toothbrushes since they first came out. Then when my third one quit (each one lasted about 10 years) I ordered the Diamond it was ok but the replacement brushes were so expensive I decided to try the Pursonic. After reading the reviews I decided on the the 500.  The brissels are soft and my teeth are so clean I am thrilled.  If this one lasts the three years it will take me to use up all the included brushes it will pay for itself versus the cost of replacement brushes for the Diamond. Plus I still have the uv light from the Diamond to keep my brushes sanitized.</li>
            <li> I have used other sonic toothbrushes, but this one is my favorite.  It is thorough yet feels gentler on my teeth and gums.  I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from a professional cleaning every time.</li>
            <li> This product was as described when purchasing and arrived fine. I Was a little disappointed at how much the brush head moved compared to other brands, but quickly became accustomed to it and felt that for the price, it was acceptable -- a full charge helped. I really like the brush heads and the fact that it came with 12 of them. That&#x27;s a great money saver compared to others.</li>
            <li> The Pursonic has met all expectations works good hold a charge for at least 2 weeks and recharges in a short time, does a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap but seems to work okay so far.</li>
            <li> I bought a Phillips before but when I changed the brush head its not the same. So got this one and for the money, it&#x27;s awesome value and performance is nice so far.</li>
            <li> I have bought the product twice, and the first one is for my friend, this time is for myself. But only mine can&#x27;t nomal charge. What a bad luck!!! It&#x27;s fully charged battery right out of the box, can last for  one person use half a month. After the battery die , it can&#x27;t charge anymore, I can&#x27;t use for once!  While I am in China, it&#x27;s really too difiiult for me to send the teethbrush back to the US. So I want to try to find out why, then I opened it,  found the battery is producted in 2013.8! What can I say??? S***  Missing the beginning of the days of using the brush....really much</li>
            <li> Using theses brushes for two years now, I get great reviews from my dentist.&amp;#34;Why bother to visit me, very little plaque&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Due to life circumstances I did not have the opportunity to open this until the end of October. I purchased it in July. Upon opening the package it appeared that everything was fine until I used it. There is one position that the vibration keeps cutting out.  This seems to limited to when brushing on one side only.  In the opposite orientation it works fine.  I do not recommend this product and noticed that someone else noted this problem in the questions section.</li>
            <li> The product works and has all the parts and pieces it is supposed to. I have owned Oral-B electric tooth brushes in the past and have been very happy with them. The vibration of this tooth brush is such that it uncomfortably tickles and vibrates your teeth. it seems to get you teeth about as clean as properly using a manual tooth brush so vibrating that much seems unnecessary. I bought two of these so my whole family can use them. My younger children find the vibration to be to uncomfortable. My four year old, all out panics. This would probably be fine for 12+ but I would not recommend it for younger children</li>
            <li> Upon receipt and use, I found that the whole brush tip rotates back and forth with the head clicking against my teeth. Will look for one with rotating brushes.</li>
            <li> Great price that met the needs.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well and teeth feel very cleaned.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the results. Definitely better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love mine so I bought another for a gift.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be . The heads hardly have any brissels</li>
            <li> My husband and myself like the Pursonic High Power Rechargeable toothbrush.  Would recommend it yo everyone.</li>
            <li> Aggressive, loud, probably does the job, but takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> does a great job and has a bunch of heads that are included, great deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sonic tooth brush for about six months, and it works great. I especially like the fact that it comes with so many replacement brushes. I switched from another well known brand because I got tired of the ridiculous costs of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Works great, does the job UNTIL YOU DROP IT!!! Be forewarned. We only had it 4 months until it was dropped and the main shaft holding the brush heads snapped off and UNREPAIRABLE. So don&#x27;t drop it and it works great. I went back to the sonicare with the screw on heads because they are indistructable. We had one for 8 years until the motor wouldn&#x27;t charge. It was dropped over 100 times and never had this problem. Good luck with a steady hand.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34; area of the head vibrates. Took some getting used to. Tickles a lot!</li>
            <li> If you liked Sonicare you will love this.&lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on, I cringed from the noise.&lt;br /&gt;Then my tooth almost rattled out when I touched it.&lt;br /&gt;All three settings seemed the same to me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could find another Ultreo brush head.</li>
            <li> Very good brush for the money. Works as good or better than my $100.00 one that quit in less than a year.</li>
            <li> It works fine and holds a good charge</li>
            <li> It has an annoying loud, high pitch hum to it.  The toothbrush seems like it is coming loose or trying to come off frequently although it is securely in place. I do like the 3 variations of speeds. It is not my favorite! I had a Braun before and liked it a lot. Should have stuck with the same brand but my dentist recommended this one.</li>
            <li> After my hygentist &amp;#34;suggested&amp;#34; an electric toothbrush I wondered why I&#x27;d always had one for the kids but not for myself and husband. Fixed that problem with the Pursonic. It does a great job. Very happy.</li>
            <li> works great all of the extra heads are nice</li>
            <li> I purchased this in August 2014 and it died in December of 2014.  The led lights started to blink erratically, it stopped charging, then went completely dead.  Has a 1 year warranty, so no worries, right?  Wrong.  After contacting the manufacture to get a replacement, they had me ship the defective unit back, after trying to up-sell be a different model for an additional $20, and said they would repair it.  After tracking the shipment and seeing it was delivered, I waited a few days and got no response.  I sent them several emails asking about the status.  They finally sent the same unit back and it worked for 3 days before doing the same exact thing - blinking lights, and now completely dead.  I&#x27;ve sent them another email explaining this and I&#x27;m waiting for a response.  I would never consider purchasing another Pursonic item.  Bad quality product and they only &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34; honor their warranty.  I&#x27;ll post an update as this progresses.  UPDATE: after threatening the company to file a complaint with the CPA and sue them, they sent me a NEW upgraded model, S450 Deluxe.  It&#x27;s awesome, but it shouldn&#x27;t have taken all this for them to honor a warranty they provide.  I would highly suggest getting the deluxe model if you&#x27;re considering this product - which I don&#x27;t recommend based on my experience. Update 2:  The new S450 Deluxe they sent me died after a couple months.  I didn&#x27;t even attempt to contact them considering my previous hassle.  I purchased a Philips and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Pursonic is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well.  It takes some getting used to and could use a bit more in the way of instructions (that&#x27;s why it get 4 rather then 5 stars)  My dentist is happy that I started using it and says she can see a difference in my plax build up in the shot time I have been using it.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible machine. I did not even open it until a week ago and I was not able to return it.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes off during me brushing my teeth. It is NOT a high powered unit as stated. I am terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works great!! Thank you for the great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I have only used this sonic toothbrush once (I have used many different brands) and so far I am very pleased.  I love the idea of not having to buy extra brushes for a long time.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was very noisy and the ultrasound was overly aggressive the instructions were not complete especially locking the brush head on the power head</li>
            <li> My toothbrush is not charging. I don&#x27;t really know what the problem is. Does anyone know what the problem would be?</li>
            <li> I gave this a 2 star rating because it cuts off a lot when brushing and the brush is a pain to replace, it does have a lot of power and when brushing it tickles the inside of your mouth and you want to stop.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. Love the brushes better than Sonic.</li>
            <li> This motorized brush will rattle your head if you let the plastic portion of the toothbrush come in contact with your teeth. But clean it does, big time.</li>
            <li> only an average product</li>
            <li> excellent product, works very well and very quiet too, some other electric tooth brush makes a lots of noise, but this one just zzzzzzz</li>
            <li> This is a very great toothbrush. This is a lot better than a OralB toothbrush. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I have nothing to compare it with. I was really impressed with how it tickled my mouth the first time I used it.What was more impressive was how clean my teeth felt after I was done. My teeth felt as clean as they do when I have them done at the dentist.The battery lasts about 3 weeks on a full charge. The Pursonic is well built and the price is much cheaper then the one my dentist recommended. I plan to tell him to start recommending the Pursonic instead.</li>
            <li> Update from prior review: it worked well for about 11 months: now the charge lasts about 30 seconds: can&#x27;t even complete one 2 min brushing. There is no way to get in touch with the seller. I owned other electric toothbrushes, and they are usually good for 2-3 years. Not this one!</li>
            <li> love this! No complaints</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars because I could not remove the toothbrush head to replace it with one of the generous 12 extra brushes that came with the kit. I pulled really hard but it did not release. I have a Braun Oral -B rotary toothbrush which works fine, but I wanted a reciprocating  toothbrush to compare with the Oral-B. I have not learned how to eliminate the splash from the Pursonic , which is quite messy at any of the 3 speeds available. The tickling sensation is another issue if you are sensitive to this. The Pursonic brush did clean well if you can tolerate the downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited Review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my initial 2 star rate to 4 stars after a Pursonic Representative told me how to replace the brush head by twisting the brush to the right &amp; then pull it off. This was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vibrating toothbrush is 10,000 pulsating units faster(40,000 total)than most all others I looked at. Indeed, it does clean teeth so well. I can feel the difference when I run my tongue over my teeth. The Pursonic leaves a smooth clean feeling surface. The Pursonic has an ergonomic light feeling handle that is pleasurable to hold. The stand holds 4 brush heads &amp; has a small footprint that will economize the room on your sinktop. It surely is a bargain price at less than $50. I will have to learn how to use this toothbrush to my advantage &amp; alternate it with my rotary Oral-B.</li>
            <li> After years of cavities and general teeth issues while using regular brushes, I switched to using Pursonic electric brushes last year and honestly now I can&#x27;t use anything but. Not only do I love how clean my teeth get, and how nice that feels..but whenever I go for checkups at the dentist, they remark at how much better my teeth are doing and how clean they are...all the slow buildup and other issues are gone. It&#x27;s kind of cheesy but I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now. One thing I was concerned about was traveling with the whole bulky charger and all of that, but I recently went on a week long trip without the charger and it held a strong charge the entire time...quite impressive. I highly recommend using any of Pursonic&#x27;s brushes and also if you ever have any questions, their customer service is surprisingly helpful as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this in January. In June we noticed the heads weren&#x27;t attaching as well and the vibrations weren&#x27;t as intense. A couple of days ago it stopped working entirely, then yesterday all of a sudden it turned on by itself. My wife picked it up and tried to turn it off then saw a brownish substance oozing out of the base which I immediately recognized as battery acid. After having her wash her hands, I got the base open and confirmed my suspicions. I will be contacting Pursonic about what they plan to do to rectify this, my theory is somehow water made it&#x27;s way into the guts of the toothbrsh.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report their reply was swift and an amicable solution was reached :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush when my old faithful Oral B died after 10 years of use.  I did some research and saw that this was rated a great value electric toothbrush compared to the Oral B brand.  I read the reviews before purchasing and saw that people mentioned it hurt when it knocked against other teeth, but I thought that had to be an exaggeration.  Let me tell you, it was not!!  I felt like my teeth were being knocked out by the toothbrush head, and I have a pretty big mouth (just ask my husband, LOL).  I think it is a design flaw, the heads of the toothbrush are too large, so when you are brushing your bottom teeth, it knocks against the top, and vice versa.  I tried it a few times, thinking it was just that I had to get used to it, but I was terrified to brush my teeth because it was so painful, so I knew I had to return the product.  I had high hopes and was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It really is a shame because it is a great value when you consider you get all the extra toothbrush heads with it.  In this case, it seemed you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> excellent performance!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Get about two months out use out of each head.</li>
            <li> I had a Pursonic previously, that I liked very much, but it finally died. This one is a newer model and is performing wonderfully, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Received and, after reading info, had to contact dentist because there was a notice that people with pacemakers (which I am) should check with dentist before using since there is a magnetic component.  Was OK&#x27;d and now getting used to vibration sensation and my own manual dexterity problems.  It is not an instant use type of product.  This is not the manufacturer&#x27;s problem, it&#x27;s a consumer familiarization problem.</li>
            <li> pro: cleans well. Like the 3 options. Good stand.&lt;br /&gt;con: don&#x27;t like the water splashing all over the mirror, sink, hands and clothes. Need a raincoat. Need to clean water spots on mirror. Very loud tool noise. Clashes with teeth, doesn&#x27;t tickle. So, fast numbs mouth hard to hold without dripping. Tried turning on inside mouth and it&#x27;s no different. Toothpaste disappears without notice. I personally feel like a day at the dentist office when they clean your mouth and water flies all over the place and finds discomfort on the teeth. Better than manual but I would not rate above 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really just kind of sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it doesn&#x27;t clean much better than a manual brush. Maybe 20% more. 20% for $48 more and something big and bulky to store? Can&#x27;t be happening in my life. I thought I would be able to get some whiter teeth with this brush - but weeks of using show no results. The thing splatters and makes a complete mess. It is also incredibly rough on the teeth if you hit with the plastic - which you have to do for how much you have to move it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve stuck with Sonicare or Oral B - this just isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where I stand on this particular item -except for maybe on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds its charge for a long while. (I&#x27;ve only had the brush for 2 months or so but it requires little plug-in time to this point.)&lt;br /&gt;Oscillation is fast.&lt;br /&gt;Many brush heads included. (No idea how long the hold up, however... See Cons)&lt;br /&gt;Teeth seem clean&lt;br /&gt;Price was reasonable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;One brush doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on well anymore. I&#x27;ve thrown it out after having to continually set it back in place.&lt;br /&gt;Oscillation is fast but it also leads to spraying and a mess if you open your mouth too much or pull the brush out before stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;A jarring jolt occurs when the back of the brush head comes in contact with teeth. It feels far to familar to when a dentist&#x27;s drill vibrates against your teeth when they&#x27;re numbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debatable Pro/Con:&lt;br /&gt;Brush stops oscillating if too much pressure it applied. I understand the concept is to help one keep the brush tips the correct length on the teeth, but it&#x27;s a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;Brush has pre-set times to pause for a split second to remind you to move to another quadrant of your mouth. I personally dislike this feature a great deal as it mimics the stopping caused by too much pressure and I can&#x27;t discern always which is which.&lt;br /&gt;Alternate features like a mode for sensitive teeth and massage come off as worthless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: 2.5 stars really for this user. I will retain it until I find something better. Right now, it&#x27;s doing the job and I don&#x27;t like to throw away things simply because they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> Better than my Sonicare toothbrushes. What convinced me was the QVC pitch. Before ordering I came to Amazon to check if there were any reviews. To my delight, The toothbrush along with the replacement heads were 50% cheaper than the QVC price.  I ordered right away through Amazon. I have had the toothbrush for about a year now and L.O.V.E it. I am also only on my 2nd replacement head.  I think the 3 different vibration settings are great. The tongue scraper setting is very useful when brushing the tongue because (as you stick your tongue out) the vibrations do not spread the toothpaste all over the place. If you brushed your tongue on the regular brushing setting, your mirror would end-up covered in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it for a family member as a gift and would recommend the product to anyone in the market for one. I have taken the toothbrush without the charger on trips several times and it held a charge for 2 weeks without recharging.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I have had a Sonicare for many years, which finally quit working. I thought I would try a different brand, and am glad I did. There is no comparison, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. The Pursonic is so much faster and does a much better job. You know the feeling after having your teeth cleaned at the dentist? Now I get it every day. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this toothbrush!! Comes with a years worth of replacement heads.. can&#x27;t  beat that!</li>
            <li> It does not work correctly, has some kind of short in device.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has alot of power in it.  I think it gets my teeth very clean, the only drawback is you really need to hold on to it otherwise it will bounce off your teeth.</li>
            <li> Now that I was given a Philips Sonicare for Christmas, I really see the difference in quality. I bought the pursonic in October. I came to really not want to have to use it, even before I got the Sonicare, because it is loud and if you just bump a tooth with the head, it is very jarring. My teeth are cleaner with the sonicare, and I no longer feel as though brushing my teeth with a sonic device is a punishment. I am really unhappy that I spent so much money on this pursonic. It has fancy lights and oh so many brush heads, but that does not make up for its performance. For me it was not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> Experience so far is awesome. It works.</li>
            <li> I have problems with attaching the brush onto the handle.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, and was as described, I purchased 2 of these and my daughter and I love them. We use to use Braun but we like these better.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, not for everyone. It moves faster than the top brand Oral-B $150 toothbrush. Be careful not to let the plastic hit your teeth at full speed. Regardless, I would recommend it, with the right toothpaste this brush leaves you feeling very clean. You&#x27;ll see a difference.</li>
            <li> A great deal. holds a charge for a week or more. Good vibration and timer.</li>
