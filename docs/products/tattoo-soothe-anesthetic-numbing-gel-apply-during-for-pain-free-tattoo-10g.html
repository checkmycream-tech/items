            <li>and it was awesome ...</li>
            <li>Worked great!</li>

            <li>Happy with the product, and I am using !!</li>
            <li>It was incredible.</li>
            <li>but I would have to greatly disagree.</li>
            <li>It is really great.</li>
            <li>i was truelly hopeing this would of been a great buy...</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>it worked really good....</li>
            <li>I still have a good deal of work to do before my feet are done</li>
            <li>My tat artist laughed as i watched a movie and didnt feel a thing.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go</li>
            <li>Great stuff will order more</li>
            <li>it better work!</li>
            <li>details that the tattoo artist was able to do were amazing...</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li>love this product once the outline is done we put this on</li>
            <li>This stuff is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU &#x3D;))</li>
            <li>Got this for stitches, I also got the cream which turned out to be way better than the gel.</li>
            <li>From what Ive heard, artists that use Vaseline over top of this product to moisturize the skin tend to have problems with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>this product is ok.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better on you.</li>
            <li>I am using  more tonite</li>
            <li>Please show better the sizes of product</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t need to do this, and I never had before because I can tolerate pain, but the new peel I was using was the most potent available on the market which is used by doctors.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using both the before and after products..</li>
            <li>My tat was virtually pain free.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap so you should give it a try.</li>
            <li>Im right now going to buy more</li>
            <li>I love this product,fast delivery works fast .</li>
            <li>each work tremendously well.</li>
            <li>It did come fairly quickly tho ...</li>
            <li>This helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>I am very!!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a pain free way of making art.</li>
            <li>I used this DURING the procedure after I had broken the skin it worked perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t thank your business enough for offering the strongest OTC product of its kind.</li>
            <li>The rest of the shading was nearly pain free!</li>
            <li>It was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the shipping was SUPER FAST....</li>
            <li>i Def recommend this product and its a great little \\&quot;try me\\&quot; price and size!!</li>
            <li>and it does last for a bit more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li>I highly!!</li>
            <li>i really!</li>
            <li>Very!</li>
            <li>The first time was for two flowers.</li>
            <li>product does exactly what it says</li>
            <li>works great for sensitive areas and long sessions on the back.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys ..</li>
            <li>this product really delivered, i have been using it during my laser hair removal...</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work like I was hoping.</li>
            <li>and i really cant stand pain</li>
            <li>Great for numbing broken and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>How fast take d pain by nunming the area.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work really well.</li>
            <li>As soon as it wears off (roughly 10-20 mins) just put more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really wish companies would tell the truth every once in awhile.....</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>A very effective topical anesthetic, expensive, but better than anything else I&#x27;ve found over the counter.</li>
            <li>Other times i&#x27;d feel it and have him throw so more on.</li>
            <li>it works ok but not great and does not make tattoo pain free as advertised not even close</li>
            <li>this is not even close to a good product even when following direction DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY not worth it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li>Worked quickly and stayed numb for a good while.</li>
            <li>only concern was that when i 1st opened it i expected it to be a cream, but it was a very light gel..</li>
            <li>so be aware when you open it as not to leak.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging</li>
            <li>We try the different products on me first and this one did not make it to customer use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;specially when your approaching your last session, the pain of even the most advanced machines could be  hard to take.</li>
            <li>and on top of that I ended up having an allergic reaction to something in it and had to dry heal my tattoo because the entire area became inflamed and had a burning sensation for the following day or so.  </li>
            <li>also dont feel color when its near the outline</li>
            <li>If you think anything will give you a completely painless tattoo you are nuts</li>
            <li>I was having a back tat done &amp; wasn&#x27;t too keen on that much pain again.</li>
            <li>this completely numbed it for while.</li>
            <li>The second time, I was doing water all over, so the cream didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>It was definitely this product, however it may just be my particular biology.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to use on my face prior to a high concentrate of chemical peel.</li>
            <li>It helped but not near as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>the top of it is only as big around as a quarter and onlly goes about an inch maybe and inch and a half deep</li>
            <li>When I received my package, one jar was empty &amp; the other was filled with something like hair gel, not numbing gel.</li>
            <li>id say its at least worth a try but dont have high expectations.</li>
            <li>Apparently from what I hear and understand Vaseline sorta counter acts it.</li>
            <li>and the cost is a little more than what should have been paid for  because of the smallness in the little bitty jar.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>but mostly what disappointed me about this product was the amount of it i got not sure how many applications this tiny container is good for but ill describe dimensions of container.</li>
            <li>i spilled about half of it when i opened it because i didnt realize how watery it would be so buyer beware its not a bad product but slightly misleading</li>

            <li> i spilled about half of it when i opened it because i didnt realize how watery it would be so buyer beware its not a bad product but slightly misleading</li>
            <li> Like a normal tat, it wasnt too bad but there were some places that it hurt more than others.</li>
            <li> it is also not a creamy thick sauve like i was expecting it is very very liquidy</li>
            <li> But it could have been that I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li> honestly small amount, not that fast acting, not worth stopping for, I will take a pass on this product in the future</li>
            <li> was also smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> due to needing to apply 45 min prior to use.</li>
            <li> Look soforward big init picts, and soI little atearly arrived.</li>
            <li> so be careful opening it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but now I am a believer.</li>
            <li> Similar products do not compare and usually aren&#x27;t a triple anesthetic like this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because of the location but my tats in other places never hurt</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any use for the gel for other work, just my feet.</li>
            <li> My artist used a small dab of this every 10 minutes or so after a few initial rounds.</li>
            <li> then i even expected!!</li>
            <li> the skin was painful even to clean with water</li>
            <li> I bought this so i could sit thru a half sleeve.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s literally the size of the little containers of lip gloss, it does say 10g though</li>
            <li> Once a little ink was added to each petal, the artist added this cream.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, certainly doesn&#x27;t numb the pain</li>
            <li> You have to do a few lines before it kicks in</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> so very little is in this container</li>
            <li> Not really sure what to say about this one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too expensive for big areas</li>
            <li> gel is similar to what doctors use when they numb your skin for stitchs.</li>
            <li> and all i did was dot it onto the area even before the skin was broken</li>
            <li> I used it for my bottom area that got broken from being bed bound and</li>
            <li> Worst numbing product Ive tried so far</li>
            <li> this item sucks!!</li>
            <li> but I just received it in the mail and was shocked at how small it is</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it stuck in my mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this 3 times to help numb my skin for laser hair removal</li>
            <li> It does numb after you get tattoo.</li>
            <li> The artist was moving all over the ribs so each area was being opened and finished before the cream could numb.</li>
            <li> Within 5 seconds, its numb and it doesnt affect the color or tat at all.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be mad</li>
            <li> Bad thing</li>
            <li> My tat turned out looking like crap though.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> this item sucks!! doesnt work just feels like im rubbing slime on my skin that doesnt do anything! i will never buy again &amp; will tell my friends not to either!</li>
            <li> love this product once the outline is done we put this on and i cant feel any touch ups that need done also dont feel color when its near the outline</li>
            <li> awesome product!!! I used this DURING the procedure after I had broken the skin it worked perfectly!! i Def recommend this product and its a great little \\&quot;try me\\&quot; price and size!! I will also buy from this seller again!!! the shipping was SUPER FAST....the product arrived within 2 days!!!!! waaay sooner then i even expected!! thank you!!</li>
            <li> A very effective topical anesthetic, expensive, but better than anything else I&#x27;ve found over the counter. I don&#x27;t have (or give) tattoos, but this product still works well for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! This is the greatest numbing gel ever. I was skeptical at first, but now I am a believer. I would recommend to everyone. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this 3 times to help numb my skin for laser hair removal but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, certainly doesn&#x27;t numb the pain</li>
            <li> I just had my tattoo artist use this for a 4 hour side piece. The tat itself is of an eagle and one of the wings extends up my rib cage. If you think anything will give you a completely painless tattoo you are nuts (that&#x27;s why I took away 1 star... title could be decieving). This stuff is the next best thing. My artist used a small dab of this every 10 minutes or so after a few initial rounds. At times I could feel nothing at all. Other times i&#x27;d feel it and have him throw so more on. Tattoo still hurt like the dickens. I have over 45 hours of ink time in, I will not get another tattoo without using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product,fast delivery works fast . Plus its cheaper then what i buy it for in the local tattoo supply store ... I just finished using this on my virgin Mary tattoo on my leg and it was awesome ... You have to do a few lines before it kicks in but,still no problems. Thanks guys ..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t thank your business enough for offering the strongest OTC product of its kind. Similar products do not compare and usually aren&#x27;t a triple anesthetic like this one. I enjoy using both the before and after products..each work tremendously well. I will always rave about this product and recommend it to  hundreds of people. And of course I&#x27;ll send them to you..always prompt efficient delivery. THANK YOU &#x3D;))</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this product works at all.  I was not numb in the least.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> this product really delivered, i have been using it during my laser hair removal...&lt;br /&gt;specially when your approaching your last session, the pain of even the most advanced machines could be  hard to take. i applied this product as it says i should. and i felt no pain&lt;br /&gt;my only concern was that when i 1st opened it i expected it to be a cream, but it was a very light gel.. so be aware when you open it as not to leak.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was also smaller than i expected. but with all fairness i didnt take notice that it does say its only 10 grams.</li>
            <li> Worked great! I used the before and during ointments together and felt like I was being colored on with a crayon!</li>
            <li> Worked quickly and stayed numb for a good while. I did not use it for a tattoo application but for pain management. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my face prior to a high concentrate of chemical peel. Most people don&#x27;t need to do this, and I never had before because I can tolerate pain, but the new peel I was using was the most potent available on the market which is used by doctors. It&#x27;s really a personal choice.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE my husband used this and received a chemical burn from it. It was not the tattoo artist, we both used him on several occasions.</li>
            <li> The anesthetic does not help the pain. It was a waste of my money.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone .</li>
            <li> So I have not used this yet but I just received it in the mail and was shocked at how small it is, it&#x27;s literally the size of the little containers of lip gloss, it does say 10g though so I can&#x27;t be mad I just didn&#x27;t pay it any attention but for the price and this teeny tiny container it better work! It did come fairly quickly tho ...I will write a review when I use it on how it works.</li>
            <li> Got this for stitches, I also got the cream which turned out to be way better than the gel. Just depends on what you&#x27;re using it for and it does last for a bit more than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Works awesome. Wont lie, I&#x27;m a wimp when it comes to pain and I swear by this product. This helps tremendously. Ive heard, for some it doesnt work but I would have to greatly disagree. It helps when the artist knows how to properly use it. From what Ive heard, artists that use Vaseline over top of this product to moisturize the skin tend to have problems with its effectiveness. Apparently from what I hear and understand Vaseline sorta counter acts it.</li>
            <li> This gel is unbaliavable it worked really good....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details that the tattoo artist was able to do were amazing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li> honestly small amount, not that fast acting, not worth stopping for, I will take a pass on this product in the future</li>
            <li> I still felt it.  Worst numbing product Ive tried so far and on top of that I ended up having an allergic reaction to something in it and had to dry heal my tattoo because the entire area became inflamed and had a burning sensation for the following day or so.  It was not the artists fault.  My fiance does all my work in our shop.  It was definitely this product, however it may just be my particular biology.  We try the different products on me first and this one did not make it to customer use.  We actually threw it out.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work like I was hoping. It does numb after you get tattoo. Not before like I was hoping.</li>
            <li> if your looking to eliminate pain from a tattoo this is not the product for you all this does is reduce and ease pain it works ok but not great and does not make tattoo pain free as advertised not even close and you have to keep reapply to get any effect at all but mostly what disappointed me about this product was the amount of it i got not sure how many applications this tiny container is good for but ill describe dimensions of container. the top of it is only as big around as a quarter and onlly goes about an inch maybe and inch and a half deep so very little is in this container it is also not a creamy thick sauve like i was expecting it is very very liquidy so be careful opening it i spilled about half of it when i opened it because i didnt realize how watery it would be so buyer beware its not a bad product but slightly misleading id say its at least worth a try but dont have high expectations.</li>
            <li> due to needing to apply 45 min prior to use. this product is ok. i might use it again .</li>
            <li> My last tattoo was over five hours and I was in quite a bit of pain. Needless to say, it stuck in my mind. I was having a back tat done &amp; wasn&#x27;t too keen on that much pain again. I put this stuff on 45 minutes prior to, covered it w/ plastic wrap &amp; washed it off before going in. My tat was virtually pain free. I&#x27;ll definitely use this again. No need to endure pain that eventually makes you nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been getting ink done on both my feet since march 2012, the pain is excruciating. I found this stuff and had it rush shipped to me hoping it would bring some relief for my next session. It helped but not near as much as I was hoping. Maybe it&#x27;s just because of the location but my tats in other places never hurt so I don&#x27;t have any use for the gel for other work, just my feet. I still have a good deal of work to do before my feet are done so I will keep using this stuff for some relief, but it&#x27;s not helping the way I was led to believe it would.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i was having a tattoo done and i really cant stand pain and all i did was dot it onto the area even before the skin was broken and it numbed it perfectly</li>
            <li> This thing did not work at all, there is no point in buying it, so noone should buy it at all</li>
            <li> Used it on my husbands thigh, you do want to apply it several times throughout the tattoo but he said he didn&#x27;t feel 90% of the tattoo. I already purchased another jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this so i could sit thru a half sleeve. My tat artist laughed as i watched a movie and didnt feel a thing. Great stuff will order more</li>
            <li> works great for sensitive areas and long sessions on the back. would recomend this to others. Five minutes and you are good to go</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff on two occasions and it did not work at all. The price is cheap so you should give it a try. Maybe it will work better on you.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what to say about this one. It works, to some degree. It takes a minute to kick in. My tat turned out looking like crap though. Kinda like the ink didnt set through the gel. May just be a coincidence though.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!! When I received my package, one jar was empty &amp; the other was filled with something like hair gel, not numbing gel. Horrible! The packaging &amp; seals seemed legit but the product that you think you are buying is not what is in the jars. I wouldn&#x27;t give them any stars except amazon requires a rating. They don&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> Great for numbing broken and irritated skin. I used it for my bottom area that got broken from being bed bound and the skin was painful even to clean with water this completely numbed it for while. Bad thing it&#x27;s too expensive for big areas</li>
            <li> Wonderfull! Product , it came fast!today i did permanent makeup on my lips today, and i  cant no!! bilived !!

            <li> I used Tattoo Soothe twice, both times for a rib tattoo. The first time was for two flowers. Once a little ink was added to each petal, the artist added this cream. The rest of the shading was nearly pain free! It was incredible. The second time, I was doing water all over, so the cream didn&#x27;t really help. The artist was moving all over the ribs so each area was being opened and finished before the cream could numb. So, if you are filling in one area, get this cream! It is really great. It just depends on what you need it for.</li>
            <li> the numbing agent works quite and lasts quite a while but the container is alot smaller than it looks in the picture. and the cost is a little more than what should have been paid for  because of the smallness in the little bitty jar.&lt;br /&gt;and for that reason we are giving it a 1 star rating</li>
            <li> My artist applied an overall pass of undercolor and then put the gel on. Within 10 min he was back to work and I felt no more of the hot singe of the needle. Amazing!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work really well. I still felt pain as I got my back tattooed and it still hurt a lot. But it could have been that I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li> I recently was getting a back piece done and was just getting the outline done. Like a normal tat, it wasnt too bad but there were some places that it hurt more than others. After that session, went and got some of this cream/gel. It was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is similar to what doctors use when they numb your skin for stitchs. Rub it on the skin and then start the tat. Within 5 seconds, its numb and it doesnt affect the color or tat at all. As soon as it wears off (roughly 10-20 mins) just put more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One 8 gram container lasted about a 6 hour session. Im right now going to buy more so I can finish my back. Thanks for a pain free way of making art.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!  i don know if the people that wrote the reviews on this product got paid or if they work for whoever BUT this DOES NOT WORK it does not do as said  DO NOT BE FOOLED IT DOES NOT NOT NOT WORK AT ALL</li>
            <li> product does exactly what it says (soothe) this is not for numbing the skin to help in the process of the tattoo it is for relieving the burn after your done...i really wish companies would tell the truth every once in awhile.....i was truelly hopeing this would of been a great buy...</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li> this is not even close to a good product even when following direction DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY not worth it</li>
