            <li>Thanks for the product!</li>
            <li>When I first heard NickysOrangicHairGrow I taught to myself and ask would</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but have already seen an incredible difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first nickys hair product about 8 months ago VERY reluctantly.</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out, I had so many split ends, and my hair was always so dry</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical when I originally purchased this product,  but now I can honestly say this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>Thank you Nicky for putting it out there and giving me the opportunity to use such fine product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is very organic product</li>
            <li>I would say REALLY?</li>
            <li>so I will let you know if it really works</li>
            <li>Thanks to Nicky&#x27;sorganichairgrowth.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product twice for my mother, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>and she really loves it.</li>
            <li>Paying the amount I paid for this Hair Product was too much for Hair Oil that was very runny oil</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say too much cause my mom uses this not me</li>
            <li>This product has only healthy natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone that need amazing results and wants to pay little for it.</li>
            <li>Usually my hair would break and fall out abundantly but ever since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my hair has gotten stronger and softer.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser who is a domincan said WOW how ur hair grow so fast</li>
            <li>It makes my afro style texture soft, shiny and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I didnt do nothing new in style</li>
            <li>it was the first step now my hair starts to grow back</li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger now and full, no more breakage.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and shiny</li>
            <li>my one year old daughter whose hair would come out</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat natural ingredients that work.</li>
            <li>,IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SOFT AND NICE,SO FAR</li>
            <li>I had a bald spot from wearing braids all the time when I was transitioning and my hair grow back really well.</li>
            <li>, she tell me this product has made the biggest difference by far for her.</li>
            <li>After 1 year of using this product my hair became more Thick and longer.</li>
            <li>so she did the same result came exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The reaction that I get from her is so positive that on my next purchase I will double up-</li>
            <li>But Nicky&#x27;s organic hair growth products has help my hair get back to normal</li>
            <li>and she totally satisfy this products, she has promote new hair growth and</li>
            <li>You definitely see the growth and it leaves your hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found my natural hair remedy.</li>
            <li>so About a year ago I decided to go Natural to strengthen my hair back the way it was before perm.</li>
            <li>a week later the product came in early.</li>
            <li>When I first got the product, It lasted for a month and a half.</li>
            <li>Yet but other are telling me that the product really works</li>
            <li>One little problem I have is that the product get out of stock to fast.</li>
            <li>I did not see new hair growth and it was extremely oily</li>
            <li>I brought the hair grease and used it on my hair every other night because i have dry hair from my highlights, without paying too much attention for results ALOT of my co workers would compliment my hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but have already seen an incredible difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first nickys hair product about 8 months ago VERY reluctantly.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out, I had so many split ends, and my hair was always so dry</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I originally purchased this product,  but now I can honestly say this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>

            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> It makes my afro style texture soft, shiny and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I didnt do nothing new in style</li>
            <li> it was the first step now my hair starts to grow back</li>
            <li> My hair is much stronger now and full, no more breakage.</li>
            <li> It feels soft and shiny</li>

So, after about two months, my mom began to notice that her hair looked drastically different. The portion of her hair that was damaged began to re-grow; even her hairstylist was shocked about her progress.
