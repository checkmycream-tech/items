            <li>The Avocado Oil is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for natural hair and provides nutrient for the hair.</li>
            <li>OIL:&lt;br /&gt;Crude oil is highly recommended to be taken in capsules as an excellent anti-aging agent and alimentary supplement, since its taste and odor are not as delicious as those in the Extra Virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA</li>
            <li>pure, light and great on the skin!</li>

            <li>Very light in texture and smoother  than the fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Love this oil very much, It is helping to repair my hair and gives it tons of strength, I can literally go days without moisturizing now and my hair will still look great.</li>
            <li>Has light smell too,will be buying more soon!</li>
            <li>Softens skin, eases the appearance of fine line (or prevents them, in my case), nice for skin and hair.</li>

            <li>Its VERY moisturizing to my 4b/c natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great!!!</li>
            <li>I have read so many great reviews about avocado oil, and decided to finally try it for myself.</li>
            <li>When I saw the reviews on how great this oil is to cook with I had to try it, and sure enough!  </li>
            <li>Love this for skin softening right out of shower!</li>
            <li>It just disappears into my hair and skin leaving a wonderful softness to my skin and a dark luster to my hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never had a cleanser i&#x27;ve particularly loved, and i&#x27;ve never been good about washing my face other than in the shower.</li>
            <li>oil seems fine though.</li>
            <li>It was hydrated, but not oily, to the extent that the fine lines around my eyes and mouth seemed to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a fine hair</li>
            <li>I have eczema, dermatitis &amp; am also enjoying my first baby bump :)</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>

            <li>Nice thanks sooo mush</li>
            <li>like the way it makes your body feel so smooth..</li>

            <li>Great for making lotions and such.</li>
            <li>he did not develop any rashes and seems to enjoy his massage.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product and I was surprised how big of a container I was able to get.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a more natural chemical free way to hydrate my skin and this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this for 3 months now and have only used about 1/4 bottle so this size bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li>Great price,and can use for several things.</li>
            <li>Great product just wish they sold smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>I like this oil, its light and came packaged as appeared.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Fantastic product, fantastic value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Fantastic product, fantastic value.</li>
            <li>It is also light</li>
            <li>This oil is great as a base oil for lotions, etc, but it is a wonderful moisturizer all on its own.</li>
            <li>NIce - very moisturising for your skin.</li>
            <li>I like using it mixed with coconut, jojoba oil to keep hair happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to add to conditioners when I deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li>; it was light in color.</li>
            <li>Fantastic skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really light and pleadent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great on feet, elbows and hands that tend to need extra attentiin</li>
            <li>it is light, but not too light, like grapeseed oil.  </li>
            <li>Avocado oil makes my hair feels like a  professional salon visit but better, its my own home made treatment and I luv the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>good product for sensitive skin &amp; hair...</li>
            <li>This was a good value &amp; just the size I needed for what I use as a multi-purpose natural oil.</li>
            <li>So far so good and no smell to it.</li>
            <li>clear oil and good consistency.</li>
            <li>I do not believe in buyinglotions and cremes anymore, oil is SO MUCH BTTER!!!</li>
            <li>I have found the oil very useful.  </li>
            <li>Avocado oil has so many benefits, and the main thing I love it for is my skin.</li>
            <li>so far so good--- at 8 months pregnant no stretch marks (which I am prone to; as I do have some stretch marks on my thighs from weight gains/loss over the years).  </li>
            <li>This mixture leave my skin with a healthy glow and a mild, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Rich, silky and luxurious oil.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed all.</li>
            <li>Truly rich like it&#x27;s supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my wife she originally wanted coconut oil for moisturizing her face</li>
            <li>I like buying this product in person, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I was defrauded in this case.  </li>
            <li>I started with NOW&#x27;s almond oil, a great product if your skin is still problematic but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>This oil is light and mildly scented.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also great for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>&amp; my skin is nice, clear, and blemish free.</li>
            <li>My hair is nice and soft, my face has a glow that others notice and my skin is baby smooth.</li>
            <li>I figured why not go right to the source and buy pure avocado oil at a fraction of the price and make my own?</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite skin and cuticle oil and so ridiculously cheap compared to buying avocado oil-enriched products.</li>
            <li>(it also makes a great massage oil!), but I found that I couldn&#x27;t use the Sweet Almond Oil for year-round coverage, particularly during the dry, windy, winter months.</li>
            <li>A favorite large part of my skin care.  </li>
            <li>Yikes, right?!</li>
            <li>Worked great when I mixed it with olive oil for a hot oil conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this oil, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Good product, delivery on time, packed properly.</li>
            <li>It is good for hair deep treatment combine with coconut oil</li>
            <li>Just need to find some essential oils to make it smell good.</li>
            <li>I have tried sesame oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, and an oil from Weleda.  </li>
            <li>I am on a journey of creating my own natural hair products.  </li>
            <li>As with everything I read a lot of reviews before I buy anything.. I liked what I read and so far I&#x27;m liking how my scalp feels .</li>
            <li>Leaves both nice and soft</li>
            <li>Nowhere on this item specifies COOL.</li>
            <li>Nowhere it is claimed unrefined, meaning full of nutrients.</li>
            <li>CO is a superior oil which I use daily with VCO in organic form.</li>
            <li>Both oils are so superior that I mix with all my organic soaps as well as daily skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and soft in the morning</li>
            <li>It is also good to incorporate in any deep conditioner to moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li>I have also tried sweet almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter; but Avocado Oil makes my hair feel the healthiest and is one of the easiest to use (i.e., no melting required).  </li>
            <li>and im in absolute love</li>
            <li>Nice all natural product</li>
            <li>I am now a true believer in the product and keep it on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>My tan is holding beautifully, and is deeper than it has been in previous years.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t aware of all the benefits of avocado oil, I strongly recommend looking them up on Google.com.</li>
            <li>Great for dry feet right before bed.</li>
            <li>I wish the larger (16+ oz) bottles came with a pump top - I added one to mine and it makes things much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Came really quickly as I&#x27;m a prime member packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mildly scented...</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not feel oily.</li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning after a shower, while my skin is still damp, and it soaks in relatively quickly for an oil.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite oil (second favorite aside from coconut oil</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on stretch marks and how to avoid them when I got pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also pregnant and have had no itchy skin or stretch marks (crowd gasps in awe).</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The oil came quickly.</li>
            <li>the odor dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It was quickly delivered and packaged well</li>
            <li>I normally use almond oil for most things but this one works just as well</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to try for the Oil Cleansing Method, however the method was a complete bust.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that I still love this product for shaving my legs or just using it as a moisturizer in the shower.</li>
            <li>It looks fine, odor is slight and mild and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Well satisfied with this product,I think its&lt;br /&gt;Great for both skin and hair as am using it for my new baby&#x27;s hair and skin</li>
            <li>Fast easy transaction.</li>
            <li>Sinks into my skin so much faster and leaves a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and I could get dressed without worrying about getting my clothes oil stained.</li>
            <li>Got this avacado oil to mix w/ argan oil, sweet almond oil, rose hip seed oil, and some essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Helps my damaged hair so much!!</li>
            <li>but when I run out you can guarantee I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>Highly moisturizing!!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This oil is a bit on the heavy side, but great for legs...</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on my face since it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily and it soaks into my damp skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like how light this oil is.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for 1 week and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>I looked it up and some people are more sensitive to this oil on their face.</li>
            <li>With Now Foods Oils, I can design my own  deep treatment.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an oil to add to your beauty/health collection, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Now I am avoiding this brand for either cooking oil or for cosmetics since for either product there are better professional sellers in each field.</li>
            <li>I have a nice collection of various oils, and butters.</li>
            <li>Worth the monty</li>
            <li>and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It was softy and cleaning and give fresh feeling ...</li>
            <li>I loved the quality of the NOW brand and really embraced the almond oil in place of standard skin</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and breaks out from time to time mostly on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>So far I like it a lot but need more time .</li>
            <li>I make my own hair and skin products to avoid all the chemicals in commercial products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>It also gives a nice texture to my hair when I am mixing it with castor oil and my everyday hair product :)</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a good product and the key is to use as many things organic as possible.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this brand</li>
            <li>I was a fan of coconut oil but didn&#x27;t like that coconut oil solidifies and has a distinct scent (although I know people like it).</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just begun using avocado oil for cooking, but I am thrilled to have found another way to cook healthier while still indulging in sauteing and pan frying.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
            <li>I can Always Trust &#x27;Now Foods&#x27; to have clean &amp; pure products.</li>
            <li>Avocado oil is good for that, and this product is made by NOW Foods, from whom I purchase other food</li>
            <li>I use this just like lotion, right when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The shipment time was right.</li>
            <li>I like putting it on right out of the shower to lock in moisture).</li>
            <li>once you rub into skin it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>What makes it good for the skin, though is the fact that it is light and has very little smell, and what smell there is is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for skin also has no smell, it is not thick, So be careful when using it, it will just run right out of the bottle</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dry and frizzy hair, and I absolutely love this oil!</li>
            <li>It is very pure and I trust it for my cottage industry products.</li>
            <li>could* put on makeup immediately (although it took a good dose of powder to keep eye makeup in place), but I found after 30 minutes makeup stayed just as in tact as if I had used conventional</li>
            <li>Avocado Oil is clear, light and non-tacky with quick penetration characteristics.</li>
            <li>This product is a GREAT one for quite a few purposes!</li>
            <li>I have used the NOW brand in the past &amp; have had great results.</li>
            <li>The heavier Avocado Oil was the perfect solution as it provides a thick, rich, moisturizing coat that last for hours.</li>
            <li>The size is great too, so I&#x27;ll have enough to last for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Your complexion with be smooth and my face has a nice glow to it as well, I haven&#x27;t put foundation on my face in a few years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>By using avocado oil everyday, I feel that some of the &#x27;lose&#x27; skin I have have become plump and appears more healthy.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for hair, but I prefer NOW almond oil since almond oil smells nicer and less rancid.  </li>
            <li>I mentioned that I go back to my old products for a week for good comparison.</li>
            <li>I also think it is great to add the oil to any daily lotion you use as an extra boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it with various essential oils and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t gain weight super fast either</li>
            <li>So I put a little more avocado oil around my eyes because it is very safe for the sensitive skin in that area.</li>
            <li>The product is great, no unpleasant smell and not a heavy oil like that you would typically expect.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the real Avocado oil I bought not too long ago I feel like this was processed too much that all the good stuff was extracted.</li>
            <li>This product is really good, the oil is not too light or too thick I just love the way it feels on my skin would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>I love that this brand of oil is light and has no smell at all, unlike some other avocado oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>A little goes a looong way and it leaves the skin glowy and gorgeous, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Nice flow from the cap, pours nicely into my little roll-on vials that I use for diluted essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Amazing with not much of a smell</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to burn at the higher temperatures like olive oil does</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>bought this to use on my hair, but after the first use, I noticed it made my hair looked so greasy</li>
            <li>Next day I attempted to use it on my skin instead since it can&#x27;t go on my hair any more...</li>
            <li>I have more than enough to use</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li>I use as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I placed avocado oil in all my favorite shampoos and conditioners and deep treatments.</li>
            <li>Your favorite deep treatment goes from 3-stars  to 5-stars after one use.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I start running out.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>will definitely buy more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Came really fast!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I saw immediate results.</li>
            <li>I promise you will see a difference in your skin with consistent use.</li>
            <li>This is my first NOW product purchase, and it is working well.</li>
            <li>All visitors who visited to see baby actually complimented me skin :)</li>
            <li>I have eczema and this really relives the itch, and helps keep my skin moisturized, my hair loves it too!</li>
            <li>but this is the first one that worked.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES THE HAIR SOFT AND SKIN SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it&#x27;s made!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the amount of skin firming and lifting I got without buying the expensive anti aging</li>
            <li>Just something to think about for others who are interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of oils at this point--- trying to find an all natural, hexane free oil and/or lotion for my skin to (hopefully</li>
            <li>This is my first avocado oil I ever used</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>I first tried to start using.</li>
            <li>However, this is a TOP QUALITY oil, and the solution is to simply get a nicer glass container, and if the product shipped in a ziplock bag I would be over the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this is a TOP QUALITY oil, and the solution is to simply get a nicer glass container, and if the product shipped in a ziplock bag I would be over the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It leaves everything feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this, especially for this time of year.</li>
            <li>my skin has been soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Several years ago, someone gifted me a set of Proactive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or give you pimples (and I have pretty oily skin, so I would know.)</li>
            <li>The oil leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say I contacted the company</li>
            <li>I mixed it with my oils for my hair and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not too greasy; plus it leaves my hair soft and shiny when I use it.</li>
            <li>You can cook it at a higher heat than butter, coconut oil or hemp oil</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>Love the deep moisturizing ability without excess residue.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel really good, but I do have to endure a few moments of feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love the avocado oil it help with your hair being healthy, I mix it wih other oils that help you in growing back your hair specially if you are losing your hair.</li>
            <li>I add coconut oil and essential oils (peppermint, thyme, lavender and some clove), and it makes my dry skin happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from this company recently the JoJoba oil; and the quality of the oil was very rich and the oil had the  color I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It does not take much and it melts right into my body.</li>
            <li>it works the absolute best, this combo also works extremely well to treat the delicate skin around your eyes to minimize fine lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I watched a youtube video of a person talking about how she used organic coconut oil and other kind of organic oils to cure her eczema.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This lasts long enough for a good massage and doesn&#x27;t dry to quickly like many lotions</li>
            <li>When I try new products, I like to use them for a week then go back to the old products for a week for good comparison.</li>
            <li>It works probably better than most of them out there for far less cost.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with apricot and almond oil and all 3 seem to be of the same light golden color and consistency.  </li>
            <li>Amazon should do a better job of categorizing this item as it is VERY misleading - especially when it was returned as a search item under \\&quot;Avocado Cooking Oil\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li>Its odor and taste are of a very pleasant, faint nut like tone.</li>
            <li>That is pretty much all that I have to say.</li>
            <li>I usually buy from health food store but the price was a good by from company.</li>
            <li>I mix this with other oils, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a nice sheen with out weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I have had very good luck with the NOW oils and essential oils I have ordered in the past</li>
            <li>If you are having dry, brittle, damaged hair issues, start adding avocado to your favorite hair treatments, shampoos, conditioners, and body lotions.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of the avocado oil in my dry hair that is always thirsty for oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle which lasts me about 3-4 months if not longer.</li>
            <li>I use pure oils in my practice.</li>
            <li>I have also used pure argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li>Great oil for your hair if you have dry hair this will definitely keep it moist and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this brand to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>I think I will now begin to order from another company, because this company says that their products are 100% pure and real.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see a larger sized bottle offered here on Amazon since I am only able to find the 8oz bottles where I live and one 16 oz bottle with shipping still costs less than 2 of the 8oz bottles!</li>
            <li>, a few drops applied to the clarisonic, and my skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It works great and only takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great alternative to using actual avocados for hair masks because they&#x27;re so messy.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>I got my order fast.....</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>very versatile...</li>
            <li>This makes me wonder if it&#x27;s really avocado oil.</li>
            <li>A light application of this oil following her shower solves the dryness for both hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like real avocado oil to me....</li>
            <li>This moisturizer left me skin smooth n shiny.</li>
            <li>Use it for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I had gotten windburn and was really thinking</li>
            <li>Everywhere else I tend to not baby as much as my face and neck, so it took two days to get the rest of me softened up.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and leaves your skin moisturized after the bath without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast, efficient service.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need this much of it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing on my hair and skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my niece, I get all of my products from amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helps me.</li>
            <li>Avocado oil gets rancid fast.  </li>
            <li>I added a scent and it is a real treat at a fraction of the cost if it were labeled a bath oil or moisturizing oil.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>While the bottle says for body use I haven&#x27;t really used in on my body but imagine it would work well there.</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair and it helps leave my hair really moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I bought this to add to a scrub for my skin and it doesn&#x27;t soften my skin as much as baby oil does..</li>
            <li>it is very think</li>
            <li>Plus it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>I know someone said that this wasnt edible, but I heard straight from the company that it was.</li>
            <li>Odorless, lite on my hair/skin and very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Very silky feeling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I find it cheaper on amazon than in Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>It is a very multipurpose oil.</li>
            <li>I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li>NOW Foods - Avocado Oil is not edible nor does it hold in that much moisture.  </li>
            <li>My hair and skin are that much softer now that I&#x27;ve incorporate it in my product for home use.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>at  all  worked  real  </li>
            <li>it keeps my skin and hair very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This works really well in my home made soaps .</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I use this as a skin and hair moisturizer and it works very well.</li>
            <li>it is very nourishing and it hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well as delivery.</li>
            <li>Have been comparing brands and this is comparable and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>In the Extra Virgin Oil, the taste and odor are perceived as those of the fresh avocado, and its free fatty acids value is much lower, which makes it even more stable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not too thick and certainly good hair nails and skin</li>
            <li>Grapeseed or Sweet Almond oil I find are not rich enough for winter and they have a drier touch which is nice when it&#x27;s warmer out.</li>
            <li>and I love how it works with my other carrier oils.</li>
            <li>For hair, skin mixing with other oils its lite non greasy, love it for my face....</li>
            <li>I use this combined with many other oils.</li>
            <li>It mademy legs feel softer and more moisturized longer than any of the other $$$ lotions.  </li>
            <li>This oil is a great  moisturizer for my hair which is  extremely dry/damaged  due to  monthly hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>Any reputable oil producer will specify COOL since at least that is how one can trace the quality of the product</li>
            <li>Highly appreciated because its high smoke point (highest among all vegetable oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly appreciated because its high smoke point (highest among all vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s thick but not pasty; it absorbs quickly, but leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>Organic oil insures the healthy process externally when it is unrefined and full of nutrients not in conventional form.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my moisture facial cr&amp;egrave;me for daytime and use full strength in the evening.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice but very heavy</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work as well as my other essential oils when moisturizing, however, it&#x27;s great for when I deep condition the night before.</li>
            <li>Avocado oil is rich in vitamins and one of the more deeply penetrating, heavily moisturizing oils out there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this oil on its own, I really only use it in a bottle with other oils.</li>
            <li>I love it and dry skin no longer an issue!!!!</li>
            <li>I will probably start using more Avocado Oil and less Vitamin E Oil.</li>
            <li>When it is claimed for MOISTURIZING, it means nutrients are considerably less since it is a more processed oil from sourced</li>
            <li>Having bought this product with this label in person for a while, I found this oil to be A. More viscous than previous purchases.</li>
            <li>During the winter months I thought lotion would be enough to help keep my skin soft and smooth, and every winter I would still find myself scratching.</li>
            <li>I main use this oil for sealing my hair and it does wonders.</li>
            <li>(i use apricot-kernel oil for face and body in the shower--no particular reason for the difference except that i wanted to try both kinds of oil because they were recommended for my skin</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for my face, hair, or as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now Foods products are quality products at decent prices.</li>
            <li>i love this product i only use it for my hair only</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Anyway I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend NOW oils and this seller.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Degree of Association or Prevalence High (4)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and I will be buying it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and I will be buying it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cooking oil with a high smoke point.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>All of the velvety texture of olive oil with the added benefit of a high smoke point.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my body as well and with as cold as it has been your skin is always more dry in the winter than summer, it works great.</li>
            <li>It is not any kind of athletes foot or any other bacteria related but it just happens in winter for 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>100 percent natural and pure.</li>
            <li>of my eyebrows was down to half the normal size but using these products helped a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I just received my shipment of the Avocado oil today; and I must say, the oil was not a rich color like I&#x27;ve seen with many of the Avocado oils.</li>
            <li>I use it to moisturize my 3c/4a natural hair when I&#x27;m keeping it straight.</li>
            <li>Its not a thick oil</li>
            <li>Both have a shiny, dark green color, and are predominately monounsaturated, giving them great oxidative stability.</li>
            <li>My skin really likes this oil - it is so soothing and makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be happy to stick with the oil than some expensive body lotions/</li>
            <li>Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it&#x27;s called the European facial oil cleanse method.</li>
            <li>And no greasy residue like my beloved coconut oil leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I researched many products to use for sensitive skin &amp; stretching skin (growing tummy) &amp; all the other products had mineral oil/petroleum (yikes!</li>
            <li>There is no hidden chemicals or dyes that can really damage the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle of Avacado oil and it will last you a while.</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair in combo with some other oils, it loves it; shine smooth absorption</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and I don&#x27;t even do anything fancy like mixing it with other oils or heating it with a hair dryer while in.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s not messy, smelly, or splashy all over the bathroom, i actually use it pretty much every day, too.</li>
            <li>My new fav.</li>
            <li>I used it for my new born</li>
            <li>also i stopped using store bought moisturizer as i continuously carry and play and bf my new born.</li>
            <li>My new moisture go to.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to use on my natural hair, but I discovered that it works well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>thick, but in a good way - it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has kept my skin moisturized through the winter.</li>
            <li>I bought this to join the arsenal of oils for maintaining natural kinky hair, and I liked how thick it was compared to jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>leaves it very soft but not too greasy</li>
            <li>My skin feels highly moisturized and incredibly soft after using this oil and I find that it does give me all day coverage.</li>
            <li>And as expected, the package came right on time!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>There is no green tint to this at all!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for growth and elasticity (again, you should be going to efforts to take care of your hair and washing it at least weekly if you have african american hair).</li>
            <li>It makes my silky and soft in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s only funny when it doesn&#x27;t happen to YOU.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was searching for coconut oil when I ran across this stuff and decided on a whim to give it a try and WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m growing dreadlocks and they require me to moisturize my hair more than I did in the past.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle; the first bottle lasted about 2 months (and that is putting it on 2x per day).  </li>
            <li>I get more relief using topical prescription steroids but decided to keep it and use it on my aging hair (from reading other posts about the product).</li>
            <li>My first time buying avocado oil was at Sally beauty supply, I paid over $6 for a tiny bottle that touted it as a vitamin E enriched cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest this product to naturals and those who want sily, soft, and shiny hair without the greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>My skin is normally extra dry, easily irritated and this helped alleviate a bit of that.</li>
            <li>so it lasted very long; worth the price</li>
            <li>I know, it sounds strange, but this oil makes a fantastic overnight deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Almost like a shiny, smooth black stone.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>but it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair loves it, I used this for a number of different uses for my hair, hot oil treatment, pre-poo, I mix it with my hair grease, hair is really soft and manageable after using this.</li>
            <li>and it has made miracles on my hair, everybody asks me what I do on it because it is shiny and my black hair looks everyday darker and bright.</li>
            <li>But only $10 lost, I&#x27;ll just shop on Amazon less in the furture and more in stores where I can touch the thing im buying.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky, and a little bit goes</li>
            <li>Another reviews suggested putting some in a bottle of your favorite lotion or conditioner for a little extra TLC.</li>
            <li>It really tones down dark circles &amp; makes the skin around my eyes very smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different moisturizers, from Vaseline (the new product that guarantees to relieve dry skin conditions), to the body shop&#x27;s body butter for extremely dry skin, to aloe vera gel (I had to reapply every 2 hours to sooth the itchiness).</li>
            <li>Rated five because, well it&#x27;s clearly also a FOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>it is clear yellow,shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so so soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair and skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t WOW me.  </li>
            <li>I use it for body and hair and it makes both really soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks used several ingridiants for a foot cream  to cure psyrosis  waiting to see if it works or not we shall see saw the mixture on Pinterest</li>
            <li>Natural is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working well for our sensitive skin family.</li>
            <li>It works well with the rest of the oils that I mix together for use with my natural styles.</li>
            <li>I also use it directly on my face.</li>
            <li>It makes skin soft and elastic.</li>
            <li>So far I used this as an add on ingredient to my homemade moisturizer for body, nails and cuticles and so far</li>
            <li>My hair is always so soft after moisturing and using Avocado Oil as a sealant.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft, no greasy oily residue.</li>
            <li>her skin is soft again.</li>
            <li>I really like mixing my essential oils in this.  </li>
            <li>I use this oil for my natural hair and natural products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>From the latex-association:  Listed below are the allergens reported to be associated (clinically or immunochemically) with natural rubber latex.</li>
            <li>Stays soft and pliable unlike coconut oil that hardens around 76 degrees</li>
            <li>My skin and hair have never been so soft.</li>
            <li>natural oils as a replacement for chemical creams</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived completely intact with no problem.</li>
            <li>Consumed internally, one gets all the health benefits but processed it goes rancid much</li>
            <li>Avocado oil is much heavier in texture than AO with different natural ingredients like collagen-supporting amino acids and proteins, as well as vitamins A, D and E. Sugar cane produces glycolic acid, one of the natural alpha hydroxy acids that ex-foliate the skin as sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>Mostly used for cooking (as a common oil) and for salad dressing.</li>
            <li>I want people to know it is completely edible</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, and I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>Wow I thought.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for 2 yrs</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>I really like that there is no oily residue on my skin, and that it can be used with essential oils.</li>
            <li>In comparison to whole avocado made into a deep conditioner, this steals the cake!</li>
            <li>, I just think it&#x27;s either old or made from inferior fruit.</li>
            <li>I used the item on my natural hair and in my Henna.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and it feels smoother.</li>
            <li>Avocado oil when taken internally from a fresh avocado can help some people with psoriasis, but this product used on scalp topically seems not to do that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a reason why CA finally passed new laws for EVOO since majority of EVOOs from EU are diluted and EV has no more meaning when so many producers misrepresent their labeling and CA needs to compete with their production.</li>
            <li>I use this avocado oil along with other oils as apart of my skin and hair regimen, and it definitely makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I use the avocado oil for dry skin and hair (I use this oil as a hot oil treatment on my hair).</li>
            <li>I use this for dry skin and hot oil treatments and have for years.  </li>
            <li>I consume avocados all the time since raw avocados offer mono-saturated healthy oil, the second highest after sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li>little bit goes a long way so use a dime size and add more as needed.  </li>
            <li>It is less expensive and works better then cosmetic company&#x27;s products and this is natural and healthy</li>
            <li>This oil is a little heavy, but it&#x27;s great to use when my hair is dry and feeling brittle.</li>
            <li>and there was no odd smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a high price item since avocados are high priced fruit and with water shortage in CA, avocados not a drought plant that require very high amount of water, 400 gallons per avocado does not help the situation at all but regardless few issues with this item;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Organic oil insures the healthy process externally when it is unrefined and full of nutrients not in conventional form.ooking (as a common oil) and for salad dressing.</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft, shiny, and barely frizzy anymore!</li>
            <li>But there were No other Oil that Make My Hair Shiny and Soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily but not bad.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this specific oil.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to go with various other oils from NOW foods (sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, vegetable glycerin) as well as olive oil and vitamin e oil to make a mixture to moisturixe my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic oil, whether as a carrier oil to mix with other oils or as is, especially since it naturally has SPF of around 15+ (according to multiple websites, just google it).</li>
            <li>It works really well, the only downfall is that it is an oil and makes you a little greasy right after use..</li>
            <li>I just told the seller that in Colombia is very hard to find 100% natural this product for many reasons.</li>
            <li>The avocado is native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America, The fruit of the avocado is greenish in color with the shape similar to that of a large pear.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin and hair and use this as my go to hair, face and general skin lotion right out of the shower, especially after my evening bath.</li>
            <li>but none of them really cure the dry skin condition.</li>
            <li>I fill up an oz size cobalt glass dropper bottle and add a few drops of lavender essential oil (also Now brand) and use it for pretty much all my skin moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li>The lid to the bottle had broken so I lost about half of my product, but what made it to me was amazing!</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of essential oil for a different fragrance every day, and surprisingly if you let it be a few minutes before dressing, it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel  oily or damp like creams can.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more moisturized (for the entire day) than with the expensive creams and the fine lines are plumped up and almost unnoticeable I find that the dry flaky patches are gone entirely.</li>
            <li>They do dietary supplements, but this is sort of confusing if you don&#x27;t realize that a company with &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; in the title and a product name &amp;#34;avocado oil&amp;#34; that you know can be substituted with olive oil and other cooking oils, isn&#x27;t the kind of oil that you were looking for.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of thickness, if Sweet Almond Oil is on the very light end of the spectrum, Avocado Oil would be in the middle with its consistency being similar to Olive Oil (or other vegetable oils), and Jojoba and Castor Oil would be on the heaviest end of the spectrum as they are thick and viscous in consistency.</li>
            <li>I used other oils in the past, but this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like cocoa butter b/c it never gets absorbed and just stays greasy, but this does absorb into your skin if you give it a little while and rub it in.</li>
            <li>probably couldn&#x27;t have used such an emollient oil as a teen, but if you&#x27;re older or just generally prone to dryness, try it out.</li>
            <li>I have recently (6 months ago) decided to quit spending way too much money on face creams and try natural oils for my very dry and aging skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and my skin felt moisturized a lot longer than if I would have used lotion.  </li>
            <li>After all, I only applied twice so far.</li>
            <li>I was just looking for ideas on which natural oils to try next for moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>When I received the package, the top to the avocado oil was broken and the oil was spilling out.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in the tone of my skin and really only had very few pimples (which would have happened no matter what).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those with dry skin..</li>
            <li>At the end of the day his skin was glowing and not dry or greasy!</li>
            <li>This really helps my very dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper other places.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an oily odor, which is great (I&#x27;d hate to walk around all day smelling like an old greasy cupboard).  </li>
            <li>My hubby hated giving me back rubs before, but this makes it way easier to get a knot out and smells great!  </li>
            <li>So hard to find natural oils without that use me fast starting to get old smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Almond Oil in the past for several years now and it works well when you need a light, quick-absorbing, thin layer of oil during the summer months</li>
            <li>so i usually mix it with another type of oil (apricot right now).</li>
            <li>I applied this oil after shower and my skin was soft and no longer dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick curly hair</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way definitely would recommend worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Due to my error (and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t stated real clear on the site), I purchased this Avocado Oil thinking it was a cooking oil.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping to give my dry hair some much needed moisture but the first time I used it, my hair was as dry as dry as a desert within a few hours.</li>
            <li>I think the oil seems fine, but I got a bottle with an broken cap</li>
            <li>Keep bottle tightly shut and refrigerate or in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li>If one is purchasing oil, they certainly are not paying for marketing, it is the nutrients and when processed heavily, nutrients are gone.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>My hair type is naturally curly with major frizz, and this stuff definitely calms it down and makes it noticeably softer for days.</li>

            <li> OIL:&lt;br /&gt;Crude oil is highly recommended to be taken in capsules as an excellent anti-aging agent and alimentary supplement, since its taste and odor are not as delicious as those in the Extra Virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA</li>

            <li> Its VERY moisturizing to my 4b/c natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I have read so many great reviews about avocado oil, and decided to finally try it for myself.</li>
            <li> When I saw the reviews on how great this oil is to cook with I had to try it, and sure enough!  </li>
            <li> Love this for skin softening right out of shower!</li>
            <li> It just disappears into my hair and skin leaving a wonderful softness to my skin and a dark luster to my hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had a cleanser i&#x27;ve particularly loved, and i&#x27;ve never been good about washing my face other than in the shower.</li>
            <li> oil seems fine though.</li>
            <li> It was hydrated, but not oily, to the extent that the fine lines around my eyes and mouth seemed to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a fine hair</li>
            <li> I have eczema, dermatitis &amp; am also enjoying my first baby bump :)</li>
            <li> Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> Mix it one part tea tree to two parts avocado oil, though, and you have a great essential mix.</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin treatment</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice thanks sooo mush</li>
            <li> like the way it makes your body feel so smooth..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about once a week in my hair as a deep conditioner, and have noticed some great results.</li>
            <li> Great for making lotions and such.</li>
            <li> he did not develop any rashes and seems to enjoy his massage.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and I was surprised how big of a container I was able to get.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a more natural chemical free way to hydrate my skin and this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this for 3 months now and have only used about 1/4 bottle so this size bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li> Great price,and can use for several things.</li>
            <li> Great product just wish they sold smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> I like this oil, its light and came packaged as appeared.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Fantastic product, fantastic value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Fantastic product, fantastic value.</li>
            <li> It is also light</li>
            <li> This oil is great as a base oil for lotions, etc, but it is a wonderful moisturizer all on its own.</li>
            <li> NIce - very moisturising for your skin.</li>
            <li> I like using it mixed with coconut, jojoba oil to keep hair happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to add to conditioners when I deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> ; it was light in color.</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really light and pleadent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great on feet, elbows and hands that tend to need extra attentiin</li>
            <li> it is light, but not too light, like grapeseed oil.  </li>
            <li> Avocado oil makes my hair feels like a  professional salon visit but better, its my own home made treatment and I luv the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> good product for sensitive skin &amp; hair...</li>
            <li> This was a good value &amp; just the size I needed for what I use as a multi-purpose natural oil.</li>
            <li> So far so good and no smell to it.</li>
            <li> clear oil and good consistency.</li>
            <li> I do not believe in buyinglotions and cremes anymore, oil is SO MUCH BTTER!!!</li>
            <li> I have found the oil very useful.  </li>
            <li> Avocado oil has so many benefits, and the main thing I love it for is my skin.</li>
            <li> so far so good--- at 8 months pregnant no stretch marks (which I am prone to; as I do have some stretch marks on my thighs from weight gains/loss over the years).  </li>
            <li> This mixture leave my skin with a healthy glow and a mild, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Rich, silky and luxurious oil.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed all.</li>
            <li> Truly rich like it&#x27;s supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my wife she originally wanted coconut oil for moisturizing her face</li>
            <li> I like buying this product in person, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I was defrauded in this case.  </li>
            <li> I started with NOW&#x27;s almond oil, a great product if your skin is still problematic but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li> This oil is light and mildly scented.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also great for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> &amp; my skin is nice, clear, and blemish free.</li>
            <li> My hair is nice and soft, my face has a glow that others notice and my skin is baby smooth.</li>
            <li> I figured why not go right to the source and buy pure avocado oil at a fraction of the price and make my own?</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite skin and cuticle oil and so ridiculously cheap compared to buying avocado oil-enriched products.</li>
            <li> (it also makes a great massage oil!), but I found that I couldn&#x27;t use the Sweet Almond Oil for year-round coverage, particularly during the dry, windy, winter months.</li>
            <li> A favorite large part of my skin care.  </li>
            <li> Yikes, right?!</li>
            <li> Worked great when I mixed it with olive oil for a hot oil conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivery on time, packed properly.</li>
            <li> It is good for hair deep treatment combine with coconut oil</li>
            <li> Just need to find some essential oils to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> I have tried sesame oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, and an oil from Weleda.  </li>
            <li> I am on a journey of creating my own natural hair products.  </li>
            <li> As with everything I read a lot of reviews before I buy anything.. I liked what I read and so far I&#x27;m liking how my scalp feels .</li>
            <li> Leaves both nice and soft</li>
            <li> Nowhere on this item specifies COOL.</li>
            <li> Nowhere it is claimed unrefined, meaning full of nutrients.</li>
            <li> CO is a superior oil which I use daily with VCO in organic form.</li>
            <li> Both oils are so superior that I mix with all my organic soaps as well as daily skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and soft in the morning</li>
            <li> It is also good to incorporate in any deep conditioner to moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li> I have also tried sweet almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter; but Avocado Oil makes my hair feel the healthiest and is one of the easiest to use (i.e., no melting required).  </li>
            <li> and im in absolute love</li>
            <li> Nice all natural product</li>
            <li> I am now a true believer in the product and keep it on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> My tan is holding beautifully, and is deeper than it has been in previous years.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t aware of all the benefits of avocado oil, I strongly recommend looking them up on Google.com.</li>
            <li> Great for dry feet right before bed.</li>
            <li> I wish the larger (16+ oz) bottles came with a pump top - I added one to mine and it makes things much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Came really quickly as I&#x27;m a prime member packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mildly scented...</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning after a shower, while my skin is still damp, and it soaks in relatively quickly for an oil.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil (second favorite aside from coconut oil</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on stretch marks and how to avoid them when I got pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pregnant and have had no itchy skin or stretch marks (crowd gasps in awe).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil came quickly.</li>
            <li> the odor dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It was quickly delivered and packaged well</li>
            <li> I normally use almond oil for most things but this one works just as well</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to try for the Oil Cleansing Method, however the method was a complete bust.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that I still love this product for shaving my legs or just using it as a moisturizer in the shower.</li>
            <li> It looks fine, odor is slight and mild and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Well satisfied with this product,I think its&lt;br /&gt;Great for both skin and hair as am using it for my new baby&#x27;s hair and skin</li>
            <li> Fast easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Sinks into my skin so much faster and leaves a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and I could get dressed without worrying about getting my clothes oil stained.</li>
            <li> Got this avacado oil to mix w/ argan oil, sweet almond oil, rose hip seed oil, and some essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Helps my damaged hair so much!!</li>
            <li> but when I run out you can guarantee I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Highly moisturizing!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This oil is a bit on the heavy side, but great for legs...</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on my face since it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily and it soaks into my damp skin very well.</li>
            <li> I really like how light this oil is.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 1 week and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> I looked it up and some people are more sensitive to this oil on their face.</li>
            <li> With Now Foods Oils, I can design my own  deep treatment.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an oil to add to your beauty/health collection, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Now I am avoiding this brand for either cooking oil or for cosmetics since for either product there are better professional sellers in each field.</li>
            <li> I have a nice collection of various oils, and butters.</li>
            <li> Worth the monty</li>
            <li> and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It was softy and cleaning and give fresh feeling ...</li>
            <li> I loved the quality of the NOW brand and really embraced the almond oil in place of standard skin</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and breaks out from time to time mostly on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> So far I like it a lot but need more time .</li>
            <li> I make my own hair and skin products to avoid all the chemicals in commercial products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> It also gives a nice texture to my hair when I am mixing it with castor oil and my everyday hair product :)</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a good product and the key is to use as many things organic as possible.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this brand</li>
            <li> I was a fan of coconut oil but didn&#x27;t like that coconut oil solidifies and has a distinct scent (although I know people like it).</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just begun using avocado oil for cooking, but I am thrilled to have found another way to cook healthier while still indulging in sauteing and pan frying.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
            <li> I can Always Trust &#x27;Now Foods&#x27; to have clean &amp; pure products.</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is good for that, and this product is made by NOW Foods, from whom I purchase other food</li>
            <li> I use this just like lotion, right when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The shipment time was right.</li>
            <li> I like putting it on right out of the shower to lock in moisture).</li>
            <li> once you rub into skin it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> What makes it good for the skin, though is the fact that it is light and has very little smell, and what smell there is is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great for skin also has no smell, it is not thick, So be careful when using it, it will just run right out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dry and frizzy hair, and I absolutely love this oil!</li>
            <li> It is very pure and I trust it for my cottage industry products.</li>
            <li> could* put on makeup immediately (although it took a good dose of powder to keep eye makeup in place), but I found after 30 minutes makeup stayed just as in tact as if I had used conventional</li>
            <li> Avocado Oil is clear, light and non-tacky with quick penetration characteristics.</li>
            <li> This product is a GREAT one for quite a few purposes!</li>
            <li> I have used the NOW brand in the past &amp; have had great results.</li>
            <li> The heavier Avocado Oil was the perfect solution as it provides a thick, rich, moisturizing coat that last for hours.</li>
            <li> The size is great too, so I&#x27;ll have enough to last for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Your complexion with be smooth and my face has a nice glow to it as well, I haven&#x27;t put foundation on my face in a few years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> By using avocado oil everyday, I feel that some of the &#x27;lose&#x27; skin I have have become plump and appears more healthy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for hair, but I prefer NOW almond oil since almond oil smells nicer and less rancid.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned that I go back to my old products for a week for good comparison.</li>
            <li> I also think it is great to add the oil to any daily lotion you use as an extra boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with various essential oils and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t gain weight super fast either</li>
            <li> So I put a little more avocado oil around my eyes because it is very safe for the sensitive skin in that area.</li>
            <li> The product is great, no unpleasant smell and not a heavy oil like that you would typically expect.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the real Avocado oil I bought not too long ago I feel like this was processed too much that all the good stuff was extracted.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, the oil is not too light or too thick I just love the way it feels on my skin would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> I love that this brand of oil is light and has no smell at all, unlike some other avocado oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way and it leaves the skin glowy and gorgeous, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Nice flow from the cap, pours nicely into my little roll-on vials that I use for diluted essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Amazing with not much of a smell</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to burn at the higher temperatures like olive oil does</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> bought this to use on my hair, but after the first use, I noticed it made my hair looked so greasy</li>
            <li> Next day I attempted to use it on my skin instead since it can&#x27;t go on my hair any more...</li>
            <li> I have more than enough to use</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li> I use as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I placed avocado oil in all my favorite shampoos and conditioners and deep treatments.</li>
            <li> Your favorite deep treatment goes from 3-stars  to 5-stars after one use.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more when I start running out.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> will definitely buy more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Came really fast!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> I promise you will see a difference in your skin with consistent use.</li>
            <li> This is my first NOW product purchase, and it is working well.</li>
            <li> All visitors who visited to see baby actually complimented me skin :)</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this really relives the itch, and helps keep my skin moisturized, my hair loves it too!</li>
            <li> but this is the first one that worked.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES THE HAIR SOFT AND SKIN SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it&#x27;s made!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the amount of skin firming and lifting I got without buying the expensive anti aging</li>
            <li> Just something to think about for others who are interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of oils at this point--- trying to find an all natural, hexane free oil and/or lotion for my skin to (hopefully</li>
            <li> This is my first avocado oil I ever used</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> I first tried to start using.</li>
            <li> However, this is a TOP QUALITY oil, and the solution is to simply get a nicer glass container, and if the product shipped in a ziplock bag I would be over the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> It leaves everything feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this, especially for this time of year.</li>
            <li> my skin has been soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, someone gifted me a set of Proactive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or give you pimples (and I have pretty oily skin, so I would know.)</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say I contacted the company</li>
            <li> I mixed it with my oils for my hair and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not too greasy; plus it leaves my hair soft and shiny when I use it.</li>
            <li> You can cook it at a higher heat than butter, coconut oil or hemp oil</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> Love the deep moisturizing ability without excess residue.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel really good, but I do have to endure a few moments of feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love the avocado oil it help with your hair being healthy, I mix it wih other oils that help you in growing back your hair specially if you are losing your hair.</li>
            <li> I add coconut oil and essential oils (peppermint, thyme, lavender and some clove), and it makes my dry skin happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this company recently the JoJoba oil; and the quality of the oil was very rich and the oil had the  color I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It does not take much and it melts right into my body.</li>
            <li> it works the absolute best, this combo also works extremely well to treat the delicate skin around your eyes to minimize fine lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I watched a youtube video of a person talking about how she used organic coconut oil and other kind of organic oils to cure her eczema.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This lasts long enough for a good massage and doesn&#x27;t dry to quickly like many lotions</li>
            <li> When I try new products, I like to use them for a week then go back to the old products for a week for good comparison.</li>
            <li> It works probably better than most of them out there for far less cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with apricot and almond oil and all 3 seem to be of the same light golden color and consistency.  </li>
            <li> Amazon should do a better job of categorizing this item as it is VERY misleading - especially when it was returned as a search item under \\&quot;Avocado Cooking Oil\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> Its odor and taste are of a very pleasant, faint nut like tone.</li>
            <li> That is pretty much all that I have to say.</li>
            <li> I usually buy from health food store but the price was a good by from company.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a nice sheen with out weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I have had very good luck with the NOW oils and essential oils I have ordered in the past</li>
            <li> If you are having dry, brittle, damaged hair issues, start adding avocado to your favorite hair treatments, shampoos, conditioners, and body lotions.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of the avocado oil in my dry hair that is always thirsty for oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle which lasts me about 3-4 months if not longer.</li>
            <li> I use pure oils in my practice.</li>
            <li> I have also used pure argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Great oil for your hair if you have dry hair this will definitely keep it moist and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this brand to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> I think I will now begin to order from another company, because this company says that their products are 100% pure and real.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see a larger sized bottle offered here on Amazon since I am only able to find the 8oz bottles where I live and one 16 oz bottle with shipping still costs less than 2 of the 8oz bottles!</li>
            <li> , a few drops applied to the clarisonic, and my skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It works great and only takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great alternative to using actual avocados for hair masks because they&#x27;re so messy.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> I got my order fast.....</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> very versatile...</li>
            <li> This makes me wonder if it&#x27;s really avocado oil.</li>
            <li> A light application of this oil following her shower solves the dryness for both hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like real avocado oil to me....</li>
            <li> This moisturizer left me skin smooth n shiny.</li>
            <li> Use it for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I had gotten windburn and was really thinking</li>
            <li> Everywhere else I tend to not baby as much as my face and neck, so it took two days to get the rest of me softened up.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and leaves your skin moisturized after the bath without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast, efficient service.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need this much of it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing on my hair and skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my niece, I get all of my products from amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helps me.</li>
            <li> Avocado oil gets rancid fast.  </li>
            <li> I added a scent and it is a real treat at a fraction of the cost if it were labeled a bath oil or moisturizing oil.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> While the bottle says for body use I haven&#x27;t really used in on my body but imagine it would work well there.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and it helps leave my hair really moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a scrub for my skin and it doesn&#x27;t soften my skin as much as baby oil does..</li>
            <li> it is very think</li>
            <li> Plus it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I know someone said that this wasnt edible, but I heard straight from the company that it was.</li>
            <li> Odorless, lite on my hair/skin and very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> Very silky feeling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I find it cheaper on amazon than in Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> It is a very multipurpose oil.</li>
            <li> I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li> NOW Foods - Avocado Oil is not edible nor does it hold in that much moisture.  </li>
            <li> My hair and skin are that much softer now that I&#x27;ve incorporate it in my product for home use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> at  all  worked  real  </li>
            <li> it keeps my skin and hair very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This works really well in my home made soaps .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this as a skin and hair moisturizer and it works very well.</li>
            <li> it is very nourishing and it hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well as delivery.</li>
            <li> Have been comparing brands and this is comparable and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> In the Extra Virgin Oil, the taste and odor are perceived as those of the fresh avocado, and its free fatty acids value is much lower, which makes it even more stable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not too thick and certainly good hair nails and skin</li>
            <li> Grapeseed or Sweet Almond oil I find are not rich enough for winter and they have a drier touch which is nice when it&#x27;s warmer out.</li>
            <li> and I love how it works with my other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> For hair, skin mixing with other oils its lite non greasy, love it for my face....</li>
            <li> I use this combined with many other oils.</li>
            <li> It mademy legs feel softer and more moisturized longer than any of the other $$$ lotions.  </li>
            <li> This oil is a great  moisturizer for my hair which is  extremely dry/damaged  due to  monthly hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> Any reputable oil producer will specify COOL since at least that is how one can trace the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Highly appreciated because its high smoke point (highest among all vegetable oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly appreciated because its high smoke point (highest among all vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s thick but not pasty; it absorbs quickly, but leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li> Organic oil insures the healthy process externally when it is unrefined and full of nutrients not in conventional form.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my moisture facial cr&amp;egrave;me for daytime and use full strength in the evening.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice but very heavy</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as my other essential oils when moisturizing, however, it&#x27;s great for when I deep condition the night before.</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is rich in vitamins and one of the more deeply penetrating, heavily moisturizing oils out there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this oil on its own, I really only use it in a bottle with other oils.</li>
            <li> I love it and dry skin no longer an issue!!!!</li>
            <li> I will probably start using more Avocado Oil and less Vitamin E Oil.</li>
            <li> When it is claimed for MOISTURIZING, it means nutrients are considerably less since it is a more processed oil from sourced</li>
            <li> Having bought this product with this label in person for a while, I found this oil to be A. More viscous than previous purchases.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I thought lotion would be enough to help keep my skin soft and smooth, and every winter I would still find myself scratching.</li>
            <li> I main use this oil for sealing my hair and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> (i use apricot-kernel oil for face and body in the shower--no particular reason for the difference except that i wanted to try both kinds of oil because they were recommended for my skin</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for my face, hair, or as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now Foods products are quality products at decent prices.</li>
            <li> i love this product i only use it for my hair only</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Anyway I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend NOW oils and this seller.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Degree of Association or Prevalence High (4)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and I will be buying it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and I will be buying it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cooking oil with a high smoke point.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All of the velvety texture of olive oil with the added benefit of a high smoke point.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my body as well and with as cold as it has been your skin is always more dry in the winter than summer, it works great.</li>
            <li> It is not any kind of athletes foot or any other bacteria related but it just happens in winter for 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> 100 percent natural and pure.</li>
            <li> of my eyebrows was down to half the normal size but using these products helped a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I just received my shipment of the Avocado oil today; and I must say, the oil was not a rich color like I&#x27;ve seen with many of the Avocado oils.</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my 3c/4a natural hair when I&#x27;m keeping it straight.</li>
            <li> Its not a thick oil</li>
            <li> Both have a shiny, dark green color, and are predominately monounsaturated, giving them great oxidative stability.</li>
            <li> My skin really likes this oil - it is so soothing and makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be happy to stick with the oil than some expensive body lotions/</li>
            <li> Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it&#x27;s called the European facial oil cleanse method.</li>
            <li> And no greasy residue like my beloved coconut oil leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I researched many products to use for sensitive skin &amp; stretching skin (growing tummy) &amp; all the other products had mineral oil/petroleum (yikes!</li>
            <li> There is no hidden chemicals or dyes that can really damage the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very large bottle of Avacado oil and it will last you a while.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair in combo with some other oils, it loves it; shine smooth absorption</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and I don&#x27;t even do anything fancy like mixing it with other oils or heating it with a hair dryer while in.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s not messy, smelly, or splashy all over the bathroom, i actually use it pretty much every day, too.</li>
            <li> My new fav.</li>
            <li> I used it for my new born</li>
            <li> also i stopped using store bought moisturizer as i continuously carry and play and bf my new born.</li>
            <li> My new moisture go to.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use on my natural hair, but I discovered that it works well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> thick, but in a good way - it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has kept my skin moisturized through the winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to join the arsenal of oils for maintaining natural kinky hair, and I liked how thick it was compared to jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> leaves it very soft but not too greasy</li>
            <li> My skin feels highly moisturized and incredibly soft after using this oil and I find that it does give me all day coverage.</li>
            <li> And as expected, the package came right on time!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> There is no green tint to this at all!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for growth and elasticity (again, you should be going to efforts to take care of your hair and washing it at least weekly if you have african american hair).</li>
            <li> It makes my silky and soft in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s only funny when it doesn&#x27;t happen to YOU.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was searching for coconut oil when I ran across this stuff and decided on a whim to give it a try and WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing dreadlocks and they require me to moisturize my hair more than I did in the past.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle; the first bottle lasted about 2 months (and that is putting it on 2x per day).  </li>
            <li> I get more relief using topical prescription steroids but decided to keep it and use it on my aging hair (from reading other posts about the product).</li>
            <li> My first time buying avocado oil was at Sally beauty supply, I paid over $6 for a tiny bottle that touted it as a vitamin E enriched cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest this product to naturals and those who want sily, soft, and shiny hair without the greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> My skin is normally extra dry, easily irritated and this helped alleviate a bit of that.</li>
            <li> so it lasted very long; worth the price</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds strange, but this oil makes a fantastic overnight deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Almost like a shiny, smooth black stone.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> but it sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, I used this for a number of different uses for my hair, hot oil treatment, pre-poo, I mix it with my hair grease, hair is really soft and manageable after using this.</li>
            <li> and it has made miracles on my hair, everybody asks me what I do on it because it is shiny and my black hair looks everyday darker and bright.</li>
            <li> But only $10 lost, I&#x27;ll just shop on Amazon less in the furture and more in stores where I can touch the thing im buying.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky, and a little bit goes</li>
            <li> Another reviews suggested putting some in a bottle of your favorite lotion or conditioner for a little extra TLC.</li>
            <li> It really tones down dark circles &amp; makes the skin around my eyes very smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different moisturizers, from Vaseline (the new product that guarantees to relieve dry skin conditions), to the body shop&#x27;s body butter for extremely dry skin, to aloe vera gel (I had to reapply every 2 hours to sooth the itchiness).</li>
            <li> Rated five because, well it&#x27;s clearly also a FOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> it is clear yellow,shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so so soft.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair and skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t WOW me.  </li>
            <li> I use it for body and hair and it makes both really soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks used several ingridiants for a foot cream  to cure psyrosis  waiting to see if it works or not we shall see saw the mixture on Pinterest</li>
            <li> Natural is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working well for our sensitive skin family.</li>
            <li> It works well with the rest of the oils that I mix together for use with my natural styles.</li>
            <li> I also use it directly on my face.</li>
            <li> It makes skin soft and elastic.</li>
            <li> So far I used this as an add on ingredient to my homemade moisturizer for body, nails and cuticles and so far</li>
            <li> My hair is always so soft after moisturing and using Avocado Oil as a sealant.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft, no greasy oily residue.</li>
            <li> her skin is soft again.</li>
            <li> I really like mixing my essential oils in this.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil for my natural hair and natural products.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> From the latex-association:  Listed below are the allergens reported to be associated (clinically or immunochemically) with natural rubber latex.</li>
            <li> Stays soft and pliable unlike coconut oil that hardens around 76 degrees</li>
            <li> My skin and hair have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> natural oils as a replacement for chemical creams</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived completely intact with no problem.</li>
            <li> Consumed internally, one gets all the health benefits but processed it goes rancid much</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is much heavier in texture than AO with different natural ingredients like collagen-supporting amino acids and proteins, as well as vitamins A, D and E. Sugar cane produces glycolic acid, one of the natural alpha hydroxy acids that ex-foliate the skin as sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> Mostly used for cooking (as a common oil) and for salad dressing.</li>
            <li> I want people to know it is completely edible</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, and I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Wow I thought.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 2 yrs</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I really like that there is no oily residue on my skin, and that it can be used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> In comparison to whole avocado made into a deep conditioner, this steals the cake!</li>
            <li> , I just think it&#x27;s either old or made from inferior fruit.</li>
            <li> I used the item on my natural hair and in my Henna.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and it feels smoother.</li>
            <li> Avocado oil when taken internally from a fresh avocado can help some people with psoriasis, but this product used on scalp topically seems not to do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a reason why CA finally passed new laws for EVOO since majority of EVOOs from EU are diluted and EV has no more meaning when so many producers misrepresent their labeling and CA needs to compete with their production.</li>
            <li> I use this avocado oil along with other oils as apart of my skin and hair regimen, and it definitely makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I use the avocado oil for dry skin and hair (I use this oil as a hot oil treatment on my hair).</li>
            <li> I use this for dry skin and hot oil treatments and have for years.  </li>
            <li> I consume avocados all the time since raw avocados offer mono-saturated healthy oil, the second highest after sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way so use a dime size and add more as needed.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive and works better then cosmetic company&#x27;s products and this is natural and healthy</li>
            <li> This oil is a little heavy, but it&#x27;s great to use when my hair is dry and feeling brittle.</li>
            <li> and there was no odd smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a high price item since avocados are high priced fruit and with water shortage in CA, avocados not a drought plant that require very high amount of water, 400 gallons per avocado does not help the situation at all but regardless few issues with this item;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Organic oil insures the healthy process externally when it is unrefined and full of nutrients not in conventional form.ooking (as a common oil) and for salad dressing.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft, shiny, and barely frizzy anymore!</li>
            <li> But there were No other Oil that Make My Hair Shiny and Soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily but not bad.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this specific oil.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with various other oils from NOW foods (sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, vegetable glycerin) as well as olive oil and vitamin e oil to make a mixture to moisturixe my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fantastic oil, whether as a carrier oil to mix with other oils or as is, especially since it naturally has SPF of around 15+ (according to multiple websites, just google it).</li>
            <li> It works really well, the only downfall is that it is an oil and makes you a little greasy right after use..</li>
            <li> I just told the seller that in Colombia is very hard to find 100% natural this product for many reasons.</li>
            <li> The avocado is native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America, The fruit of the avocado is greenish in color with the shape similar to that of a large pear.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and hair and use this as my go to hair, face and general skin lotion right out of the shower, especially after my evening bath.</li>
            <li> but none of them really cure the dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> I fill up an oz size cobalt glass dropper bottle and add a few drops of lavender essential oil (also Now brand) and use it for pretty much all my skin moisturizing needs.</li>
            <li> The lid to the bottle had broken so I lost about half of my product, but what made it to me was amazing!</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of essential oil for a different fragrance every day, and surprisingly if you let it be a few minutes before dressing, it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel  oily or damp like creams can.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more moisturized (for the entire day) than with the expensive creams and the fine lines are plumped up and almost unnoticeable I find that the dry flaky patches are gone entirely.</li>
            <li> They do dietary supplements, but this is sort of confusing if you don&#x27;t realize that a company with &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; in the title and a product name &amp;#34;avocado oil&amp;#34; that you know can be substituted with olive oil and other cooking oils, isn&#x27;t the kind of oil that you were looking for.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of thickness, if Sweet Almond Oil is on the very light end of the spectrum, Avocado Oil would be in the middle with its consistency being similar to Olive Oil (or other vegetable oils), and Jojoba and Castor Oil would be on the heaviest end of the spectrum as they are thick and viscous in consistency.</li>
            <li> I used other oils in the past, but this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like cocoa butter b/c it never gets absorbed and just stays greasy, but this does absorb into your skin if you give it a little while and rub it in.</li>
            <li> probably couldn&#x27;t have used such an emollient oil as a teen, but if you&#x27;re older or just generally prone to dryness, try it out.</li>
            <li> I have recently (6 months ago) decided to quit spending way too much money on face creams and try natural oils for my very dry and aging skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and my skin felt moisturized a lot longer than if I would have used lotion.  </li>
            <li> After all, I only applied twice so far.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for ideas on which natural oils to try next for moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> When I received the package, the top to the avocado oil was broken and the oil was spilling out.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the tone of my skin and really only had very few pimples (which would have happened no matter what).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those with dry skin..</li>
            <li> At the end of the day his skin was glowing and not dry or greasy!</li>
            <li> This really helps my very dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper other places.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an oily odor, which is great (I&#x27;d hate to walk around all day smelling like an old greasy cupboard).  </li>
            <li> My hubby hated giving me back rubs before, but this makes it way easier to get a knot out and smells great!  </li>
            <li> So hard to find natural oils without that use me fast starting to get old smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Almond Oil in the past for several years now and it works well when you need a light, quick-absorbing, thin layer of oil during the summer months</li>
            <li> so i usually mix it with another type of oil (apricot right now).</li>
            <li> I applied this oil after shower and my skin was soft and no longer dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick curly hair</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way definitely would recommend worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Due to my error (and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t stated real clear on the site), I purchased this Avocado Oil thinking it was a cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to give my dry hair some much needed moisture but the first time I used it, my hair was as dry as dry as a desert within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I think the oil seems fine, but I got a bottle with an broken cap</li>
            <li> Keep bottle tightly shut and refrigerate or in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li> If one is purchasing oil, they certainly are not paying for marketing, it is the nutrients and when processed heavily, nutrients are gone.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> My hair type is naturally curly with major frizz, and this stuff definitely calms it down and makes it noticeably softer for days.</li>
            <li> Avocado oil does wonders for dry skin and any skin in general.</li>
            <li> I mixed this oil with my other natural oils to use on my body and hair.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son has dry skin and eczema dry patches.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little dab really goes a long way with this stuff too.</li>
            <li> The itching comes back every now and then, but I am using the same bland and keeping it off so far.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use natural oils on my skin rather than lotions or creams, but I had a hard time finding one that was heavy enough but absorbed well in the winter.</li>
            <li> So I grabbed this oil thinking it would not last long or work on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I also put a little it into a weekly deep conditioning hair masque that contains all kinds of oils and things and it helps keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to use on my extreme dry and sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> i use it every single day its been extremely helpful throughout my natural hair journey</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> My feet were dry and cracked and the second day using this stuff</li>
            <li> Her blonde hair is also on the dry side and quite tangly.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller on my face and my skin is not as dry anymore.</li>
            <li> I am a 20-something with fairly dry skin and occasional acne.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as part of a mix (with apricot kernel, Jamaican black castor oil and jojoba oil) to seal moisture in my hair (type 4 natural).</li>
            <li> Especially after the sun exposure, my skin was really really dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used before and will continue to use it mixed with Neem Healing Oil for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I know oil will make your skin oily, but those oils are just ridiculous, just making your skin feel super oily and not absorbing.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of just the oil alone on my face at night before going to sleep (after washing my face) and in the morning simply rinsing my face with hot water and then mixing a few drops with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only other oil I have tried that rivals this, especially for the face, is rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> And he does not particularly like getting his hair done, but this oil gets to work instantly to condition and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I used it on my toes that have been itching this winter and the area became sensitive and a little swollen.</li>
            <li> I rub it into my hands and feet and cuticles whenever I really want some serious moisture, especially after a shower/bath or at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a hard lotion, but we&#x27;ve also just used it straight on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> But after purchasing 33.8oz of avocado oil for only ten at Costco, AND COMPARING IT WITH ALL OTHER BRANDS, I did further research and learned that there are few kinds of avocado oils out in the market and unless it is not clearly printed on the labeling, do not assume anything or accept any claims on the phone or through writing from any producer since they are not liable for any claims except what printed on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then noticed it leaves a very greasy feeling to your skin, unlike vitamine E, which absorbs and does not give that icky</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected...</li>
            <li> It also heals your cuticle issues, and I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet on my parched long locks.  </li>
            <li> It also heals your cuticle issues, and I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet on my parched long locks.  </li>
            <li> One drop goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> I run a dab on the ends of my towel dried hair after showering and it leaves my hair noticeably soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected</li>
            <li> I tried coconut oil for a long time but still found that it was a bit greasy after apply (even after I whipped it in my Kitchenaid).</li>
            <li> What took me so long with this stuff?</li>
            <li> Not as thick as EVOO, but certainly not as thin as say jojoba.</li>
            <li> My feet are extremely dry and after a few day, try feet are soft.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil seemed to just linger on my skin for hours at a time while never absorbing, leaving my skin both dry and greasy at the same time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits!</li>
            <li> someone asked why I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in so long!</li>
            <li> I mixed it with Shea butter and some other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying they&#x27;ve added some essential oils to their avocado oil, and I will definitely be trying this for a little something extra.  </li>
            <li> We had to throw away 1/3 of the bottle, due to rancidity, even though it&#x27;s used daily on hair.  </li>
            <li> I combine these two without any other perfumes, scents or anything else like essential oils or</li>
            <li> i sometimes put it under my eyes at night for under eye circles, i see a tiny bit of difference, but i&#x27;m not consistent.</li>
            <li> on my legs, arms and back due to atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> and I hair, either alone or with some other oil, whether olive or coconut - warmed, mixed and applied for 20-30 mins.</li>
            <li> I think its mixed with other vegetable oils.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use with a couple other oils for facial use.</li>
            <li> I put it on at the end of my shower and pat dry.  </li>
            <li> Continue to use it on my face at night or baby which dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used coconut oil, still too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been prone to dry flaky skin, and dry staticky hair, and since I&#x27;ve been using this oil</li>
            <li> A skin saver for dry climates.</li>
            <li> When you put it on dry skin it remains a bit oily for a while before sinking in.</li>
            <li> Unlike all that store bought lotion that contains drying agents that in turn dry out your skin instead of nourish.</li>
            <li> This oil is devine for after shower in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would rehydrate my dry winter scap, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Well, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> The lotions on the market tend to damage and dry out the skin</li>
            <li> My skin was dry and thirsty but since I have been using this product</li>
            <li> The avocado oil has helped improve my dry skin</li>
            <li> I like it for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry skin in the winters and in my homemade conditioners.</li>
            <li> My skin remains dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will keep healing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has been horribly dry this winter.</li>
            <li> I suffer fro severe dry skin and eczema in the winter, so I came across this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Oil and Extra Virgin Oil have very similar characteristics, since Extra Virgin Oil is a special variety of crude oil.</li>
            <li> it pretty thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing weight and feared getting loose skin as a result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly thicker or less viscous than the almond oil, but wow my skin drank it in and never felt greasy.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very cold climate and usually during winter nothing keeps my skin soft and comfortable, but this does.</li>
            <li> Put it on wet or dry hair, put on a shower cap.</li>
            <li> It can be used in hair wet or dry or even on your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;RB, RBD and RBW GRADE:&lt;br /&gt;These are different combinations of the four typical refine steps (Refining, Bleaching, Deodorizing and Wintetizing).</li>
            <li> These are different combinations of the four typical refine steps (Refining, Bleaching, Deodorizing and Wintetizing).</li>
            <li> Have been using for several days now and have already noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair each morning after I shower.</li>
            <li> Now, I usually either use it as a sealant or mix it with olive oil, essential oils and water as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My hair is extemely curly and very dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this avocado oil because I have been suffering from very dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I use this with my moisturizers only a little bit</li>
            <li> and I feel like it was because I was religious with this regimen and didn&#x27;t miss a day (a little obsessive).</li>
            <li> so I bought Lavender oil from Now foods and mixed it a little with this oil</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and moisturized and hardly itchy(for</li>
            <li> So this bottle will last at least 5 months since I&#x27;m only using it for my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as an overnight facial moisturizer in an attempt to get away from all the icky ingredients in traditional face creams.  </li>
            <li> I leave my skin slightly wet and rub the oil in.</li>
            <li> For skin, use after shower, on wet skin.</li>
            <li> Blaaaa not really feeling this oil.</li>
            <li> it be green with the essential ingredent?</li>
            <li> Will keep using until the bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I read some articles and used this oil along with tea tree oil and the 2nd toe that used to itch and it completely dried up the swelling</li>
            <li> , I order a few months back</li>
            <li> I feel that this should say Massage or Body in the title so that people like me who see &amp;#34;Food-Oil&amp;#34; don&#x27;t get confused and buy something they really DON&#x27;T want to have.</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Guess I did not read carefully.</li>
            <li> Using a few drops I massage into facial skin and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a thick, natural moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird, but it&#x27;s not a super strong smell, so who cares?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pure.</li>
            <li> There is no foul or unpleasant odor and the oil rinses easily.</li>
            <li> Even if my skin is not dry at all, I still like to use a small amount, and it never feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I got some sun and my skin was extra dry, it used to take rounds of applying body lotion at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of people using this on their skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> I usually just squirt some in my palm and add a drop of 3 -4 different oils and use it like lotion.</li>
            <li> TO BE USED  WITH TWO OTHER OILS.</li>
            <li> and i keep one bottle in the shower and the other by the sink)</li>
            <li> I use it to blend with other oils for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m mixing this oil with some other oils for hair growth.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was using the avocado oil on his skin and there was an immediate difference from all of the other &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; products out there.</li>
            <li> and I simply had to reapply a small amount in the morning.</li>
            <li> I mix this and other oils to use in lieu of lotion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not to oily as for other oils</li>
            <li> I bought it based on recommendations I had seen on other sites for its uses as a moisturizer for every body part imaginable.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time &amp; as expected!</li>
            <li> I am extremely displeased by the fact that the product popped up when I was looking for cooking oils and it&#x27;s by a company called NOW Foods.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with other oils for hair, scalp, and body.</li>
            <li> Deceiving since it  was from Now Foods, listed with other consumable foods.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely please with the Avocado Oil: I use it on my skin every day.</li>
            <li> no thanks!)</li>
            <li> I Have Used Other Oils....</li>
            <li> Something was a little loose in the shipping, and oil spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> Other than feeling like I was dipped in a deep fryer for a little while, it worked wonders!!</li>
            <li> I have used Avocado oil before and Its my favorite to use on my very dry body face skin,but started using olive oil because it is cheaper and easier to get,then I started itching very bad and thought it was just dry winter skin</li>
            <li> I use shea butter or this Avocado oil (thick) or, Castor oil (super dooper thick) or, Jojoba oil (medium thick-</li>
            <li> If you put it on your hair, though, be careful - a little goes a loooooooong way.</li>
            <li> I blend this oil with my black castor oil as well as some other oils.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my skin because it clears dark spots and on my scalp and it works well.</li>
            <li> I massage it gently onto my skin, leave it on till I feel uncomfortable, and then wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My elementary-aged daughter has dry skin that gets lizard-like in cold weather or after too much time in the swimming pool.</li>
            <li> They never let me down.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because my skin is extremely dry).</li>
            <li> Ialso use on my hair but have to be very careful because it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> I am of ethnic descent and live in the far North - it&#x27;s a recipe for horrific dry skin that I&#x27;ve battled my entire life, until this winter when I started using Avocado Oil.</li>
            <li> I like to put some on my ends after I use my leave-in conditioner, and it seems to help with my hair getting less tangled.</li>
            <li> my skin is finally starting to show its age and my lazy lack of care for the past 47 years.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your hair or skin in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I am black.  </li>
            <li> (though of course it is a liquid and subject to those limitations).</li>
            <li> , I feel that this is less oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> A darker color than all previous purchases.  </li>
            <li> Smelling strongly of slightly rancid canola oil.  </li>
            <li> The comparison to conventional products was so stark that I would have given up on the week.</li>
            <li> conventional products was so stark that I would have given up on the week.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> This one has no &amp;#34;avocado scent&amp;#34; which I like to smell in the oils and the color is not the typical green which I am used to also.  </li>
            <li> For a little while, your skin feels like it did,</li>
            <li> It has a little thicker texture.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this for food, because I think it&#x27;s possibly a little rancid.</li>
            <li> This oil is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> thats what I use it for...no harsh smell</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I like to use it in my face and lips after washing my face with  One with Nature&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Soap</li>
            <li> too heavy just sat on my skin.</li>
            <li> There is almost no scent to this oil, so I like to add a few drops of lavender oil, rosemary oil and a drop of peppermint oil to moisture my skin .  </li>
            <li> this oil is not as heavy as the others.  </li>
            <li> Avocado oil is green.</li>
            <li> The fatty acids in Avocado oil nourish your hair to no end.</li>
            <li> It seems to cut down recovery time on blemishes and small scabs.</li>
            <li> For face or other delicate parts, I would stick with almond oil.</li>
            <li> However, if your skin condition is not that bad, it would be enough for daily skin care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small</li>
            <li> I mix the two together in a small jar and use a cotton swab every night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> For hair, i used along with my usual conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magic cure all, but then again no product is.</li>
            <li> Not sure which one did it, but it smelled kinda funky.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t penetrate as deeply as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> These grades are usually used by the cosmetic and pharmaceutical</li>
            <li> These grades are usually used by the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is working</li>
            <li> I have used Avocado oil in the past and this stuff did not smell like avocado oil at all.</li>
            <li> Skin requires vitamin E, this hardly has any compare to AO or WGO.</li>
            <li> This oil does well with me, my skin sucks it up, we were meant to be.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to cook with it especially since I tasted a bit</li>
            <li> About two weeks ago I was running late for work and had to put some oil on my legs in a hurry.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so thick, i don&#x27;t use it on my face</li>
            <li> I hate paying for a name brand when I can DIY for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Thick yummy oil for face moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> At first I hated the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little skeptical about the oil, but I&#x27;ll see how it does for as what it says on the packaging.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for something that is not that thick, but still nourishes your scalp, this will do it!</li>
            <li> Not too thin or thick!</li>
            <li> I get bad dry flaky skin and my hair is thin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle cap and found that the seal has been broken.</li>
            <li> Use this as a base for custom mixed body oils.</li>
            <li> I massage a thin layer into my face before I go to bed, and I wake up with hydrated but not greasy skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I work outside and the wind has been awful lately, but the avocado oil saved my skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, not impressed, would not buy again</li>
            <li> When used on my hair all it did was coat my strands, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all.</li>
            <li> , how unfortunate for me, also know that if you are allergic to latex you will be allergic to avocado oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed all the expensive skin and eye creams contain avocado oil</li>
            <li> It seems to leave my face softer and may be helping the very thin lines on my face</li>
            <li> The worst dry skin part is almost gone now.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly prone to bad calluses on elbows, knees, even fingers... but especially on my heels.</li>
            <li> esp in the cold wintry season</li>
            <li> And also I didn&#x27;t see any cold pressed, unrefined on the bottle.</li>
            <li> worst quality - don&#x27;t waste your money, its a sake oil.</li>
            <li> Who could have though that avocado oil smell unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Also, they are very expensive with their products.</li>
            <li> - NOT a FOOD Item - VERY DISAPPOINTED to say the least!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this oil from another vendor and it was BAD, so I ordered from NOW FOODS.</li>
            <li> had a bad experience at a hairdressers and my scalp was injured</li>
            <li> Oh and it doesnt smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t have that smell.</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed with almond oil, olive oil, and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed by the nomenclature here.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed with an oil from NOW foods.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a base for oil mixes.</li>
            <li> The Avocado oil should be the rich-heavy gold type base to it; but this oil that was sent to me was not that</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed to find this was a cosmetic for skin, not for consumption.  </li>
            <li> If the weather is terrible it seems cannot work well.  </li>
            <li> This oil smell nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> nice and hydrating for my hair and skin, gets the job done :)</li>
            <li> Love this for skin softening right out of shower!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so so soft.  I put it on at the end of my shower and pat dry.  Amazing with not much of a smell so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my scented lotion or perfume I put on after.  I keep buying it whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It makes my hair and skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> A must oil to use in homemade hair products and to your conditioners. I like it on my face at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I use it I in my natural hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of people using this on their skin and hair. I however, use it for cooking instead of olive oil which I use religiously. I use it in my food I use it on my salad as a salad dressing instead of olive oil and it just tastes really good . it doesn&#x27;t seem to burn at the higher temperatures like olive oil does um that&#x27;s about it I like a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Very light in texture and smoother  than the fractionated coconut oil. My new fav.</li>
            <li> I do like this pruduct  especially for my feet. My feet are extremely dry and after a few day, try feet are soft.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Love NOW Foods. I use a lot of NOW Foods products and this one is excellent just like the others. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> The cap was shattered , thus oil leaking.</li>
            <li> I use this every time after a shower.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this stuff for a week and I must say Im beyond impressed! My feet were dry and cracked and the second day using this stuff I noticed a dramatic difference. I am in love with this oil. My feet are so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> Used it to make a body butter/lotion. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits!</li>
            <li> Great quality oil, exactly what I wanted. I would definitely purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the whole bottle but it just didn&#x27;t WOW me.  I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivery on time, packed properly. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works great for after shower moisture replenish and is non greasy and does not rub off on my clothes or sheets</li>
            <li> bought this to use on my hair, but after the first use, I noticed it made my hair looked so greasy someone asked why I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in so long! Next day I attempted to use it on my skin instead since it can&#x27;t go on my hair any more...I then noticed it leaves a very greasy feeling to your skin, unlike vitamine E, which absorbs and does not give that icky feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to note is, this has a very strong spoiled-nut smell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, not impressed, would not buy again</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  I have already made one batch of transparent soap with it!  Beautiful :).  I WILL be ordering more.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I thought lotion would be enough to help keep my skin soft and smooth, and every winter I would still find myself scratching. This avocado oil works amazing wonders! I use this just like lotion, right when I get out of the shower. You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little dab really goes a long way with this stuff too. Too much and you&#x27;ll know!!&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my legs, arms, hands, even lips! It works really well, the only downfall is that it is an oil and makes you a little greasy right after use.. but the results are worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Another great plus, it&#x27;s just avocado oil!! There is no hidden chemicals or dyes that can really damage the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this with my moisturizers only a little bit but it works nice and does not clog the pores</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my extra dry skin.  I apply right after a shower, let it soak in and then apply a good body lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small</li>
            <li> Love this oil very much, It is helping to repair my hair and gives it tons of strength, I can literally go days without moisturizing now and my hair will still look great. This is a great purchase for skin and hair!!</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected...so am pleased...I have more than enough to use so I know it will last me for a while</li>
            <li> I got my order fast..... I&#x27;m very happy. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> i just love this oil its so versatile. i use it on my hair and skin. its a keeper! I will definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for my face and started breaking out and having more blackheads. I looked it up and some people are more sensitive to this oil on their face. BUT! On your body,  this stuff rolls on like a dream. I mix it with essential oils and put it on my arms and legs. I also use this oil mixed with sugar and a couple drops of lavender and camphor and voila- body scrub!</li>
            <li> great for massages and making items from sunscreen to body lotion, also good for adding on topically to skin by itself</li>
            <li> Saw this oil in a video and knew l had to have it.  Great price and fast delivery. Will be using them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great oil.  I&#x27;m always happy with &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; products.  This is a very light oil with great benefits.  I use as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my 3c/4a natural hair when I&#x27;m keeping it straight. I love it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is well described and is a good quality. It looks fine, odor is slight and mild and feels good on my skin. I hope the seller improves on a couple of points but I will buy from them again. The bottle doesn&#x27;t present an expiration or &amp;#34;Best used by&amp;#34; date. I would also like to see a tamper resistant product that covers the cap as well. But there was a tamper resistant seal below the cap. That was reassuring. I will probably start using more Avocado Oil and less Vitamin E Oil.</li>
            <li> Now Food Avocado Oil is one the best oils you can use for your hair. I placed avocado oil in all my favorite shampoos and conditioners and deep treatments. Your favorite deep treatment goes from 3-stars  to 5-stars after one use. Its also great for the skin. I apply it to my favorite body lotion and once again, it becomes the best lotion ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased all the Now Food Oils and now mix my own custom-made treatments and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;No one conditioner or treatment have all the ingredients you want in one product. With Now Foods Oils, I can design my own  deep treatment. Avocado oil makes my hair feels like a  professional salon visit but better, its my own home made treatment and I luv the way it makes my hair feel. If you are having dry, brittle, damaged hair issues, start adding avocado to your favorite hair treatments, shampoos, conditioners, and body lotions. You will luv the results.</li>
            <li> This is the Absolutely Perfect remedy for sunburns! WOW! I love how this HEALS! I absolutely LOVE this product! I never go without it during the summer or vacation days when sunburn is probable!</li>
            <li> I used this almond oil on making hair butters and skin creams. Very versatile. Was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t have that smell. But I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a hair oil and mix it with coconut oil. Put it on wet or dry hair, put on a shower cap. Allow 30-60 for penetration then shampoo and condition. Helps my damaged hair so much!!</li>
            <li> Love the product and on time as well.</li>
            <li> I use this avocado oil along with other oils as apart of my skin and hair regimen, and it definitely makes a huge difference. If you&#x27;re looking for an oil to add to your beauty/health collection, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;NOW Foods&amp;#34; misled the understanding that it is for skin care instead of cooking oil which I was looking for. Now I am avoiding this brand for either cooking oil or for cosmetics since for either product there are better professional sellers in each field.</li>
            <li> Love this avocado oil! I add it to my homemade facials and hair masks</li>
            <li> I would recommend.  Buy and buy Again! :)</li>
            <li> Great oil at affordable price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. Good for use in lotion making</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is a necessity for anyone who works with oils that go on the skin. This is actually food grade oil, so you can use it for cooking. What makes it good for the skin, though is the fact that it is light and has very little smell, and what smell there is is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as an massage oil because of its pureness and lightness. I also use it as a base for oil mixes. For example, tea tree oil has excellent anti-microbial qualities, but at full strength it can irritate the skin. Mix it one part tea tree to two parts avocado oil, though, and you have a great essential mix.</li>
            <li> This really helps my very dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> good product for sensitive skin &amp; hair...thats what I use it for...no harsh smell...mix it with your favorite essensial oil, body lotion or hair product..very versatile...I will reorder!</li>
            <li> I love their products. They never let me down.</li>
            <li> Love using this around my eyes.</li>
            <li> best avocado oil. 100 percent natural and pure. It is  my number one choice. I like it</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil. I use it for body and hair and it makes both really soft. The size is great too, so I&#x27;ll have enough to last for a while. I also like the price. I will definitely order more when I start running out.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with apricot and almond oil and all 3 seem to be of the same light golden color and consistency.  There is no green tint to this at all!  This makes me wonder if it&#x27;s really avocado oil.</li>
            <li> Best to use after the shower for silky smooth skin.  I absolutely love this oil...and so does my bf:-)</li>
            <li> Very nice oil with a pleasant scent. Mixed it with jojoba, coconut, castor oil or olive  and I have a very healthy hot oil treatment. Love to mix  it with eggs for added protein. Also aids in shedding and breakage😃</li>
            <li> Thanks used several ingridiants for a foot cream  to cure psyrosis  waiting to see if it works or not we shall see saw the mixture on Pinterest</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it as a face cleanser and a  moisturizer.  My skin looks and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this Avocado Oil!!  It is an excellent hair moisturizer. Gives my hair a nice sheen with out weighing it down.  I also add it to my conditioner, its just great!  will definitely buy more when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Good oil, use it to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> I am terribly prone to bad calluses on elbows, knees, even fingers... but especially on my heels. In both summer and winter I get cracked heels that peel and bleed, even if I&#x27;m vigilant about exfoliation and moisturizing. Yikes, right?! Rubbing on this oil before bed had my nail tech asking what I&#x27;d been doing differently, and for once I didn&#x27;t feel like I should apologize for negligent grooming. My elementary-aged daughter has dry skin that gets lizard-like in cold weather or after too much time in the swimming pool. Her blonde hair is also on the dry side and quite tangly. A light application of this oil following her shower solves the dryness for both hair and skin. Love it. I wish the larger (16+ oz) bottles came with a pump top - I added one to mine and it makes things much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I use alone on my skin and also mix with a lotion and essential oils.</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin treatment</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I put in all my lotions I make</li>
            <li> Love it!  Came really fast!</li>
            <li> I love the avocado oil it help with your hair being healthy, I mix it wih other oils that help you in growing back your hair specially if you are losing your hair.</li>
            <li> Used during pregnancy EVERY day and night. No stretch marks with both pregnancies ! Continue to use it on my face at night or baby which dry skin. Natural is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is fantastic. I use it on my hair, arms etc...</li>
            <li> excellent for skin &amp; sheen to hair</li>
            <li> Nice thanks sooo mush</li>
            <li> used it once, great for hair</li>
            <li> Love it, you will not be disappointed.  Better than baby oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I leave my skin slightly wet and rub the oil in. I also use on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually buy from health food store but the price was a good by from company.Product arrive on time and will buy again</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with castor oil to help my eyebrows to grow out.  It works, but it does take time to see results.  I mix the two together in a small jar and use a cotton swab every night before I go to bed.  If I&#x27;m not going out, I do the same thing during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my eyebrows was down to half the normal size but using these products helped a great deal.  You can also add coconut oil to the mixture as well. It&#x27;s all natural and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice but very heavy</li>
            <li> I have a nice collection of various oils, and butters. This avocado oils is one of the heavier oils. Not as thick as EVOO, but certainly not as thin as say jojoba. I use it mostly for my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, which is always a plus. I like to put some on my ends after I use my leave-in conditioner, and it seems to help with my hair getting less tangled. I have also added it to my shea butter/lotion and it is good for the winter, but I would go with something thinner in the summer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I put in on my hair before bed and it moisturized the deadness away.  Great on my legs too.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin loves this great product !</li>
            <li> I like what it does, don&#x27;t like the smell though. Who could have though that avocado oil smell unpleasant. It is good for hair deep treatment combine with coconut oil</li>
            <li> I like this oil.  I mix it with shea butter to make my twisting cream.  Good product.  Nice texture and consistency.</li>
            <li> like the way it makes your body feel so smooth..Also feels good on your hair as well as your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dry and frizzy hair, and I absolutely love this oil! The first time I used this product I saw immediate results. My hair was extremely soft, shiny, and barely frizzy anymore! I personally used it with combining it with my regular shampoo and letting them both sit on my hair for about 30 minutes and then washing it out and applying my regular conditioner. I highly recommend this oil (:</li>
            <li> Came really quickly as I&#x27;m a prime member packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil I use it for my hair in combo with some other oils, it loves it; shine smooth absorption all get 5 stars</li>
            <li> Avocado oil can be used for more then cooking, get my drift. Especially for the health nuts.</li>
            <li> I have always been about \\&quot;beauty on a budget\\&quot;. This product is a GREAT one for quite a few purposes! I LOVE using this on my hair (scalp and on the ends) as well as on my skin! It&#x27;s GREAT. I promise you will see a difference in your skin with consistent use. I put a few drops of just the oil alone on my face at night before going to sleep (after washing my face) and in the morning simply rinsing my face with hot water and then mixing a few drops with my moisturizer. Your complexion with be smooth and my face has a nice glow to it as well, I haven&#x27;t put foundation on my face in a few years (this is an addition to my regimen of weekly exfoliating and using dove to wash my face). It is a great product and I can&#x27;t stress enough how good it is on hair and scalp! This is a great product for growth and elasticity (again, you should be going to efforts to take care of your hair and washing it at least weekly if you have african american hair). I have always used the Now Solutions brand as that is the brand that I always see when I am at the health food store. I was happy to see a larger sized bottle offered here on Amazon since I am only able to find the 8oz bottles where I live and one 16 oz bottle with shipping still costs less than 2 of the 8oz bottles!</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil I can use on my dry-tending face without breaking out. Softens skin, eases the appearance of fine line (or prevents them, in my case), nice for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about once a week in my hair as a deep conditioner, and have noticed some great results. My hair type is naturally curly with major frizz, and this stuff definitely calms it down and makes it noticeably softer for days. It&#x27;s cheap, and I don&#x27;t even do anything fancy like mixing it with other oils or heating it with a hair dryer while in. I just coat the hair, leave it in for maybe an hour, and shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could definitely save you money if you&#x27;re always buying hair masques. It works probably better than most of them out there for far less cost.</li>
            <li> I have recently (6 months ago) decided to quit spending way too much money on face creams and try natural oils for my very dry and aging skin. I started using rose hip seed oil and the results were quite good. Then I found avocado oil and it is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Now Foods Avocado Oil is what I&#x27;m using as a cleanser and moisturizer ... with absolutely excellent results. My skin is much more moisturized (for the entire day) than with the expensive creams and the fine lines are plumped up and almost unnoticeable I find that the dry flaky patches are gone entirely. I highly recommend this product for those with dry skin..</li>
            <li> I was satisfied. The shipment time was right. And the oils are great. The avocado oils goes on my hair and body. Worth the monty</li>
            <li> Love using it on my hair and skin. Keeps it all moisturized and great when sealed with a light lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like real avocado oil to me....no odor, plane color, i lost faith.</li>
            <li> I bought this online because it is cheaper than the stores.  I use it as a body oil an oil for hair.  Great</li>
            <li> This is my first NOW product purchase, and it is working well. I used it to make a hard lotion, but we&#x27;ve also just used it straight on skin and hair. It&#x27;s working well for our sensitive skin family.</li>
            <li> I am going to use this in soapmaking!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love. This is a great oil</li>
            <li> This was a good value &amp; just the size I needed for what I use as a multi-purpose natural oil.</li>
            <li> Made me break out in hives. It&#x27;s not pure. What a lie. Lol</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil from another vendor and it was BAD, so I ordered from NOW FOODS. GREAT quality. I use this oil on my face and body. My pores are smaller on my face and my skin is not as dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time!! It can be used in hair wet or dry or even on your skin.  It does make my skin feel really good, but I do have to endure a few moments of feeling greasy.  Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and works really well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my hair and I love it.. I also use it on my skin..leaves it very soft but not too greasy</li>
            <li> The lid to the bottle had broken so I lost about half of my product, but what made it to me was amazing!</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter mix &amp; this is a good quality ingredient.</li>
            <li> I use it daily with some essential oils added for all my skin needs - face and body. It is less expensive and works better then cosmetic company&#x27;s products and this is natural and healthy</li>
            <li> I love avocado! The oil is doing a great job!</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin and hair. For skin, use after shower, on wet skin. For hair, i used along with my usual conditioner. Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with coconut oil for treatments for my hair to make it more healthy and promote hair growth, so far happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used Avocado oil before and Its my favorite to use on my very dry body face skin,but started using olive oil because it is cheaper and easier to get,then I started itching very bad and thought it was just dry winter skin but then a month of use got rashes so I knew it was the olive oil,so I bought Avocado oil again and when I use it all over my body my skin is so soft and moisturized and hardly itchy(for some reason its always somewhat itchy)So I&#x27;m just gonna stick with this for now on.Its thinner than olive oil and adsorbs in faster too,but thicker than rosehip seed or jojoba which is what i use on my face 1/3 an ounce of jojoba 1/3 an ounce of rosehip seed and  1/3 an  ounce of Avocado oil.I&#x27;ve never broke out from Avocado oil on my face.Has light smell too,will be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> It works well with the rest of the oils that I mix together for use with my natural styles. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love to use this avocado oil when cooking! Good quality!</li>
            <li> Great for making lotions and such. I also use it directly on my face.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it. I mix it in with my shampoo</li>
            <li> Excellent...I use it in my hand made lotions.  Doctoral Candidate P. Roulier</li>
            <li> My favorite oil for DIY hair conditioning.  I know, it sounds strange, but this oil makes a fantastic overnight deep conditioner.  Just add some to your hair and leave on overnight, when you shampoo it out in the morning, you hair looks and feels amazing!  I&#x27;ve just started experimenting with using this for skin care too.</li>
            <li> I used it for my new born he did not develop any rashes and seems to enjoy his massage.&lt;br /&gt;And also i stopped using store bought moisturizer as i continuously carry and play and bf my new born. This moisturizer left me skin smooth n shiny. All visitors who visited to see baby actually complimented me skin :)</li>
            <li> This oil is a bit on the heavy side, but great for legs...feet..ect...thicker skin.  I use it when I get out of the shower and it absorbs well.  For face or other delicate parts, I would stick with almond oil.</li>
            <li> If you want beautiful healthy looking skin, this product is for you. It also helps minimize the amount of oil my face produces throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Pretty good oil. I use it on my skin after showering.</li>
            <li> The avocado oil is great I use it both on my skin and hair. It makes my silky and soft in a matter of minutes!</li>
            <li> It makes skin soft and elastic. It does a really good job for the price and it was well worth it. It&#x27;s not a magic cure all, but then again no product is.</li>
            <li> I use this after showering.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and supple.  Great product that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> So far I used this as an add on ingredient to my homemade moisturizer for body, nails and cuticles and so far Im liking it.  Just need to find some essential oils to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to moisturize my hair and my skin. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have and smell and it pretty thick so a little goes a long way. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I main use this oil for sealing my hair and it does wonders. My hair is always so soft after moisturing and using Avocado Oil as a sealant. I will continue to use and purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I bought the oil to use in my hair masks but I&#x27;d rather have the actual avocado for future masks.</li>
            <li> When I received the package, the box is soaked with oil and I knew it was screwed. I opened the bottle cap and found that the seal has been broken. So the oil comes out during transportation.&lt;br /&gt;The oil seems fine though. Waiting for the improvement of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used your products before and they were great. This product is no different. Works for what I want. thank you.</li>
            <li> Been using this in my hair and skin as an after shower moisturizer and it&#x27;s lovely. Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my skin because it clears dark spots and on my scalp and it works well. Its not a thick oil so it runs easily. But I do recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this shipment arrived, nicely packaged and with no leakage.  This product  is outstanding.  I&#x27;ve found this brand to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> Item arrived well packaged and timely... It&#x27;s a large bottle so it lasted very long; worth the price and the product is good😊</li>
            <li> I love avocado oil and the price was appropriate for the size.  I use this to mix with my jojoba oil for my massage therapy business and it keeps me hydrated without smelling like flowers all day.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the seller. Would buy this product again. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The value for the price is amazing. It is an excellent product and I was surprised how big of a container I was able to get. I use a bunch of oils at various times and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I am having to make my own lotions and personal care products because of severe glycol allergies and have been very happy with these products. Fast easy transaction. Thank you</li>
            <li> Due to my error (and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t stated real clear on the site), I purchased this Avocado Oil thinking it was a cooking oil.  It seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been try this oil for my hair and body .. Also in my daily using bath and shampoo .. It was softy and cleaning and give fresh feeling ...</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I have eczema and this really relives the itch, and helps keep my skin moisturized, my hair loves it too!</li>
            <li> Love this! Skin feels soft, no greasy oily residue. Great for Body and hair. Use it for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and say it, I&#x27;m in peri-menopause. Men, don&#x27;t run. It&#x27;s all good. I started noticing last year that my skin wouldn&#x27;t hold moisture the way it always had. I don&#x27;t like to use chemical-laden products in my hair, on my skin, and etc., so I opted to try the oil-cleansing technique and ditching soap for my face. I started with NOW&#x27;s almond oil, a great product if your skin is still problematic but not overly dry.  I noticed a huge difference in the tone of my skin and really only had very few pimples (which would have happened no matter what).  I loved the quality of the NOW brand and really embraced the almond oil in place of standard skin moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this winter progressed, my regular routine wasn&#x27;t enough to keep from having scaly, itchy skin, a flaky T-zone of all things, and even coconut oil became a staple for me to use.  It&#x27;s oily and doesn&#x27;t sink in well enough to use and then get dressed for work. And the stuff blowing around outside in the wind (or even my hair) would occasionally get stuck to my coconut-oiled skin.  (It&#x27;s only funny when it doesn&#x27;t happen to YOU.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the NOW avocado oil about three days and I&#x27;m in lovelovelove.  It&#x27;s slightly thicker or less viscous than the almond oil, but wow my skin drank it in and never felt greasy.  For a little while, your skin feels like it did, about *cough* years ago.  I work outside and the wind has been awful lately, but the avocado oil saved my skin.  I had gotten windburn and was really thinking OMG I have lizard skin on my face, and the rest of me was as supple as a corpse.  My avocado oil soothed the irritated skin on my face and softened it overnight.  Everywhere else I tend to not baby as much as my face and neck, so it took two days to get the rest of me softened up.  But I&#x27;m working outside and I swear the wind robs your moisture through your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably couldn&#x27;t have used such an emollient oil as a teen, but if you&#x27;re older or just generally prone to dryness, try it out. It makes your skin glow in a way that it would take a $70.00+ jar of chemicals to achieve.  It also heals your cuticle issues, and I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet on my parched long locks.  I can&#x27;t be more enthusiastic about this brand or the product. I adore it. And no greasy residue like my beloved coconut oil leaves behind.erally prone to dryness, try it out.

            <li> Great. Product as described.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put on your scalp it makes it so itchy... I didn&#x27;t see any results on my hair, just an oily feel to it. I use it for my skin instead and it helps with the dryness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> This oil is just great! It just disappears into my hair and skin leaving a wonderful softness to my skin and a dark luster to my hair. Almost like a shiny, smooth black stone. I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is softer with this oil, but it is a bit stronger. I primarily use it on my face since it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily and it soaks into my damp skin very well.</li>
            <li> I thought this oil would cause more acne but to my surprise it has perfectly toned  and moisturized my face and body! I like to use it in my face and lips after washing my face with  One with Nature&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Soap (see my review on it). My face and body has never looked more healthy and beautiful! I am truly Amazed!</li>
            <li> In my teens I had acne. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s now. My skin is sensitive and breaks out from time to time mostly on my cheeks. I used olive oil...too heavy just sat on my skin. I used grapeseed oil, made me look oily. I used coconut oil, still too dry. Shea butter, broke me out, too oily. This oil does well with me, my skin sucks it up, we were meant to be. At night I mix one drop of it with my vitamin c serum and face cream from clinique after I cleanse with alba botanica toner. I have a good remedy going now. In the morning I use a drop as well under my moisturizer. One drop goes a long way for me. So this bottle will last at least 5 months since I&#x27;m only using it for my face.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Avocado oils for my hair and was great.</li>
            <li> Love this for cooking, salad dressings, even beauty care. Healthy fats that have never been clinically proven to heighten cholesterol! Try this people!</li>
            <li> I used other oils in the past, but this one is my favorite so far. No smell to it. It is liquid, so it is easy to spread. I mix it with castor oil to apply to my scalp, as a mask. I mix it with my body lotion, and I even mix it with a water in a spray bottle to enhance my curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dog that has severe allergies and rubs her hair off. Her skin was like an alligator. I tried many things but this is the first one that worked. her skin is soft again.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd purchase n I&#x27;m about to buy more! Not too thin or thick! Great moisture for my skin! Mildly scented... Love the way my skin looks n feels!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Great for message and for the skin! I will purchase this again. I received it on time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for skin also has no smell, it is not thick, So be careful when using it, it will just run right out of the bottle</li>
            <li> This is great for my hair, however smells of potato chips . Rated five because, well it&#x27;s clearly also a FOOD PRODUCT lol</li>
            <li> Its VERY moisturizing to my 4b/c natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin and great deal</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my bath bomb recipe and it&#x27;s great.  Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and leaves your skin moisturized after the bath without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Well satisfied with this product,I think its&lt;br /&gt;Great for both skin and hair as am using it for my new baby&#x27;s hair and skin too.although I mixed it with Shea butter and some other products.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin shine</li>
            <li> love this oil on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> love the way it leaves my skin, hair</li>
            <li> Is this Real?&lt;br /&gt;I started using this oil one Month ago and it has made miracles on my hair, everybody asks me what I do on it because it is shiny and my black hair looks everyday darker and bright. I just told the seller that in Colombia is very hard to find 100% natural this product for many reasons. Anyway I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great value for a nice carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I really like mixing my essential oils in this.  I usually just squirt some in my palm and add a drop of 3 -4 different oils and use it like lotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use in food preparation. Although Now Foods is in the title and the label says it is food grade, the directions are for use externally on skin and scalp. I am afraid to cook with it especially since I tasted a bit and it tasted similar to plastic.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my natural hair and natural products.  It&#x27;s almost gone! LOVE the price</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS OIL OUT OF RECOMMENDATION FROM A VIDEO TO GROW EYEBROWS AND EYELASHED TO BE USED  WITH TWO OTHER OILS. I HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT FOR THAT PURPOSE , BUT I DO USE IT TO OIL THE SCALPE , ARMS AND LEGS. IT MAKES THE HAIR SOFT AND SKIN SMOOTH. I&#x27;M SURE THERE&#x27;S MORE USES FOR THE OIL, I JUST HAVEN&#x27;T EXPLORED THEM YET. IF YOU&#x27;RE A OIL USING PERSON I WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I was searching for coconut oil when I ran across this stuff and decided on a whim to give it a try and WOW! I am impressed!  I&#x27;ve always been prone to dry flaky skin, and dry staticky hair, and since I&#x27;ve been using this oil I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it&#x27;s made!  My hair is under control and shiny, and my skin is healthy and moisturized.  I tan at the salon, and use this oil after I shower.  My tan is holding beautifully, and is deeper than it has been in previous years.  I have also noticed a better appearance of my tattoos.  I love how it&#x27;s thick but not pasty; it absorbs quickly, but leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day.  It doesn&#x27;t have an oily odor, which is great (I&#x27;d hate to walk around all day smelling like an old greasy cupboard).  I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying they&#x27;ve added some essential oils to their avocado oil, and I will definitely be trying this for a little something extra.  This stuff is seriously awesome.  The bottle is big so I won&#x27;t be needing to order any more for a while, but when I run out you can guarantee I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> This product is just what I was looking for. Thank you for the fast, efficient service. I will enjoy it!</li>
            <li> The quality is good and fell really natural, the price is good too.I will purchase it again to give my friend.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a more natural chemical free way to hydrate my skin and this is amazing.  Have used this in combination with Grape seed oil and thought I was the only one who noticed but just went for my yearly dermatology visit and he said my skin is so well hydrated.  I am very happy with the amount of skin firming and lifting I got without buying the expensive anti aging products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this for 3 months now and have only used about 1/4 bottle so this size bottle is a great value.</li>
            <li> Love this avacado oil. I use it on my face. It absorbs quickly and does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> Blaaaa not really feeling this oil. Can&#x27;t see any lasting effects. It&#x27;s good for moisture but maybe that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my line of beard oil I am starting and I love how it works with my other carrier oils. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great when used as a  light hair oil and conditioning. Keep bottle tightly shut and refrigerate or in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li> Great oil for hair and body mixed well in my own hair mixture.</li>
            <li> I will order this when I run out again.</li>
            <li> Great oil for many homemade health product. I normally use almond oil for most things but this one works just as well and I like to have a bottle around in case I need something different.</li>
            <li> Great product. Mix it with some lavender oil and it is a great post-shower moisturizer</li>
            <li> it is clear yellow,shouldn&#x27;t it be green with the essential ingredent?</li>
            <li> i real love this product in my lotions and hair lotoons. it make my hair and skin more moisterized. This is a must have to any person he make their own body products</li>
            <li> I will be sticking to extra virgin avocado oil for my beauty needs (e.g. hair/skin). This one has no &amp;#34;avocado scent&amp;#34; which I like to smell in the oils and the color is not the typical green which I am used to also.  Just something to think about for others who are interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I apply this liberally  after showering to moisturize my entire body. I live in a very cold climate and usually during winter nothing keeps my skin soft and comfortable, but this does. I like it because it has no scent, so I add a few drops of essential oil for a different fragrance every day, and surprisingly if you let it be a few minutes before dressing, it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel  oily or damp like creams can. A bottle lasts about 9 months, so it is a great value. I also put a little it into a weekly deep conditioning hair masque that contains all kinds of oils and things and it helps keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> my skin is finally starting to show its age and my lazy lack of care for the past 47 years. i&#x27;ve never had a cleanser i&#x27;ve particularly loved, and i&#x27;ve never been good about washing my face other than in the shower. i decided to try the oil cleansing method and a clarisonic, and i got this oil after seeing this type recommended on crunchy betty. i LOVE it. i use it on my face (i use apricot-kernel oil for face and body in the shower--no particular reason for the difference except that i wanted to try both kinds of oil because they were recommended for my skin and i keep one bottle in the shower and the other by the sink), a few drops applied to the clarisonic, and my skin feels and looks amazing. because it&#x27;s not messy, smelly, or splashy all over the bathroom, i actually use it pretty much every day, too. never going back to commercial cleansers again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, I use it for my hair to help with my hair breaking.  I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else because honestly I haven&#x27;t tried another avocado oil.</li>
            <li> It works great and only takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin.  Also I use it for my hair, it keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> I thought this was for cooking or salad dressing since it from Now Foods. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this product as well as  all of the NOW Foods products.</li>
            <li> Now Foods has some great products.  The avocado oil is perfect for making moisturizing creams with my beeswax.  I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Good product and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a carrier for cosmetics. It is very pure and I trust it for my cottage industry products.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> Great price,and can use for several things.</li>
            <li> perfect to do massage on curly hair, moisturizes and leaves super soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with various other oils from NOW foods (sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, vegetable glycerin) as well as olive oil and vitamin e oil to make a mixture to moisturixe my scalp. I&#x27;m growing dreadlocks and they require me to moisturize my hair more than I did in the past. I love it...</li>
            <li> This oil is a great  moisturizer for my hair which is  extremely dry/damaged  due to  monthly hair coloring.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great for the whole body! I use it daily and it leaves my skin hydrate and not greasy. Great buy</li>
            <li> use it for hair and skin there is no smell u have to add essential oil to it if u want smell</li>
            <li> Great product just wish they sold smaller bottles. Didn&#x27;t need this much of it. &amp; it doesn&#x27;t tell u the oz when u purchase it</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for the quality of this oil. Using it by itself on my skin provided me with no moisture and sometimes caused me to itch. When used on my hair all it did was coat my strands, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all. Compared to the real Avocado oil I bought not too long ago I feel like this was processed too much that all the good stuff was extracted. This oil may work great as a base oil for a mixture for skin or hair. I ended up using it for oil pulling. I won&#x27;t [purchase again.</li>
            <li> AMAZING OIL, GREAT FOR HAIR, SKIN AND NAILS DEFINITELY WISH I ORDERED THE 16OZ..LOVE IT. CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Use this as a base for custom mixed body oils. My skin loves it, not too greasy, absorbs well, and has no odor. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. Would definitely purchase again. Very moisturizing on my hair and skin care regimen. The oil blended well with both of my homemade hair and skin products. I think I mixed my reviews for Almond and Avocado. But would buy both again. They are great.</li>
            <li> Great oil for your hair if you have dry hair this will definitely keep it moist and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My new moisture go to. Gives my skin a good glow. Perfect post shaving. It does leave a temporary greasy feeling, because, well, it&#x27;s an oil. I will order a second bottle when I finish this one! A skin saver for dry climates. Nice on lips too!</li>
            <li> Thanks to my niece, I get all of my products from amazon. Love you girl.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I use this in my soap making. I tried mixing it with almond oil and putting on my hair. Not sure which one did it, but it smelled kinda funky.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle; the first bottle lasted about 2 months (and that is putting it on 2x per day).  I have tried a bunch of oils at this point--- trying to find an all natural, hexane free oil and/or lotion for my skin to (hopefully) prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.  I have tried sesame oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, and an oil from Weleda.  For the price, you cannot beat the Avocado oil--- and so far so good--- at 8 months pregnant no stretch marks (which I am prone to; as I do have some stretch marks on my thighs from weight gains/loss over the years).  I put it on in the morning after a shower, while my skin is still damp, and it soaks in relatively quickly for an oil.  When you put it on dry skin it remains a bit oily for a while before sinking in.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and mildly scented. It absorbs into your hair or skin in less than 10 minutes. I run a dab on the ends of my towel dried hair after showering and it leaves my hair noticeably soft and moisturized. Another reviews suggested putting some in a bottle of your favorite lotion or conditioner for a little extra TLC.</li>
            <li> Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it&#x27;s called the European facial oil cleanse method. I&#x27;m of French ancestors whose women have used the oil method for generations. We always blend our own recipes customized to the needs of each woman. Now brand of oil is the purest, clearest, and the cleanest I&#x27;ve found. Its safe for ingesting, too. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and shipped quickly. Highly recommend NOW oils and this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It leaves your skin extremely soft.  There is almost no scent to this oil, so I like to add a few drops of lavender oil, rosemary oil and a drop of peppermint oil to moisture my skin .  This mixture leave my skin with a healthy glow and a mild, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> light and best for massage, love it on my hair..nourishes it instantly. a must have! esp in the cold wintry season</li>
            <li> great product for your hair and skin.  Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The bottle claims that avocado oil helps improve skin elasticity. I have to say that I think it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve been losing weight and feared getting loose skin as a result. By using avocado oil everyday, I feel that some of the &#x27;lose&#x27; skin I have have become plump and appears more healthy. It&#x27;s really helps me.</li>
            <li> Rich, silky and luxurious oil.</li>
            <li> Great product! The NOW oils are safe to use in cooking, but I use this product as a body oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Sweet Almond Oil in the past for several years now and it works well when you need a light, quick-absorbing, thin layer of oil during the summer months (it also makes a great massage oil!), but I found that I couldn&#x27;t use the Sweet Almond Oil for year-round coverage, particularly during the dry, windy, winter months. The heavier Avocado Oil was the perfect solution as it provides a thick, rich, moisturizing coat that last for hours. My skin feels highly moisturized and incredibly soft after using this oil and I find that it does give me all day coverage. My winter skin has never felt better. It goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t sticky, and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of thickness, if Sweet Almond Oil is on the very light end of the spectrum, Avocado Oil would be in the middle with its consistency being similar to Olive Oil (or other vegetable oils), and Jojoba and Castor Oil would be on the heaviest end of the spectrum as they are thick and viscous in consistency.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, the oil is not too light or too thick I just love the way it feels on my skin would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for hair, but I prefer NOW almond oil since almond oil smells nicer and less rancid.  Avocado oil, if fresh, is good for hair.  Avocado oil gets rancid fast.  We had to throw away 1/3 of the bottle, due to rancidity, even though it&#x27;s used daily on hair.  NOT RECOMMEND if you wear latex gloves.  From the latex-association:  Listed below are the allergens reported to be associated (clinically or immunochemically) with natural rubber latex. Degree of Association or Prevalence High (4) Banana, Avocado, Chestnut, Kiwi - See more at: http://latexallergyresources.org/cross-reactive-food#sthash.oSjTd6D9.dpuf</li>
            <li> Use a lot of now oils for hair repair oil treatments. They work wonders!</li>
            <li> Does anyone find it is oily? This is my first avocado oil I ever used so I don&#x27;t know if it supposes to be like this. And also I didn&#x27;t see any cold pressed, unrefined on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Hydrates my skin so well. It has a little thicker texture. It feels great going on. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Great, exactly what I wanted. Great for massage and I used t to make an eyelash serum. Bigger than expected</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! I have been using it for my hair and face. I await seeing the results of continued use! I think that the consistency is great as well. The smell is light, pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like this oil, its light and came packaged as appeared.  So I,m happy.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
            <li> The oil isn&#x27;t tacky and feels pleasant on my face.  I&#x27;m hoping for miracles</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is my favorite oil for massage and lubrication. You don&#x27;t have to use very much. A little goes a long way. I also like how it absorbs nicely on the skin. I have been disappointed with almond oil, olive oil, and coconut oil. They do not absorb, just sitting on the surface of the skin. I know oil will make your skin oily, but those oils are just ridiculous, just making your skin feel super oily and not absorbing. Avocado oil, for the skin, is the best in my opinion. Now brand avocado oil is top quality and food grade. I will keep buying from them.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil for homemade lotions and creams.  Stays soft and pliable unlike coconut oil that hardens around 76 degrees F.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t penetrate as deeply as I thought it would. I purchased this product hoping to give my dry hair some much needed moisture but the first time I used it, my hair was as dry as dry as a desert within a few hours. Will keep using until the bottle is empty but I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I have found the oil very useful.  I have used it one my body after a bath, on my scalp, hair and face.  It also gave my feet a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> good ole sweet almond oil.  very good for crows feet, and hair, keeps hair smooth, and moist.</li>
            <li> The shipping details came after my product was delivered but that is no biggie. I have not used it as yet but it seems to be a good buy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect and just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Love it! I used to use macadamia nut oil, but started using this after my showers. Sinks into my skin so much faster and leaves a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li> My skin and hair have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Love it, and so doesn&#x27;t my hair! Lighter than caster oil! So if your looking for something that is not that thick, but still nourishes your scalp, this will do it!</li>
            <li> I am on a journey of creating my own natural hair products.  Avocado oil is one of the ingredients.  When I received the package, the top to the avocado oil was broken and the oil was spilling out.  The oil got on my comforter.  Otherwise the product is great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a while now and I&#x27;m always pleased with it. I mainly use it for my face, hair, or as a body moisturizer. I will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> I used this for my homemade lotion recipe and it makes an awesome product that really works.  Unlike all that store bought lotion that contains drying agents that in turn dry out your skin instead of nourish.</li>
            <li> This oil is devine for after shower in a dry climate. I added a scent and it is a real treat at a fraction of the cost if it were labeled a bath oil or moisturizing oil. The good value is mixing your own beauty products when you can, better quality, pure ingredients and lots of recipes on the web. Try it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow and look healthy</li>
            <li> very smooth -feels great on skin</li>
            <li> I am a 20-something with fairly dry skin and occasional acne. When I try new products, I like to use them for a week then go back to the old products for a week for good comparison. After about a month of use, I must say, I love this oil. I use it as a replacement for body lotion and mix it with kukui oil as a replacement for face creams, and my skin has never felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried to start using. natural oils as a replacement for chemical creams, I tried to use coconut oil. Coconut oil seemed to just linger on my skin for hours at a time while never absorbing, leaving my skin both dry and greasy at the same time. This oil is very different though! It absorbed quickly and I could get dressed without worrying about getting my clothes oil stained. If I wanted to, I *could* put on makeup immediately (although it took a good dose of powder to keep eye makeup in place), but I found after 30 minutes makeup stayed just as in tact as if I had used conventional lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle promises hydration and elasticity, and it delivers. Every morning I would wake up in shock of how great my skin was. It just looked and felt so nourished. It was hydrated, but not oily, to the extent that the fine lines around my eyes and mouth seemed to be disappearing. If I got some sun and my skin was extra dry, it used to take rounds of applying body lotion at least twice a day. But with this, I feel hydrated for 24 hours. Even if my skin is not dry at all, I still like to use a small amount, and it never feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic oil, whether as a carrier oil to mix with other oils or as is, especially since it naturally has SPF of around 15+ (according to multiple websites, just google it). The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the packaging. Something was a little loose in the shipping, and oil spilled in the box. It was a mess. I mentioned that I go back to my old products for a week for good comparison. The comparison to conventional products was so stark that I would have given up on the week. But, I was actually out of town, and I intentionally did not bring the product since I was concerned about leakage. However, this is a TOP QUALITY oil, and the solution is to simply get a nicer glass container, and if the product shipped in a ziplock bag I would be over the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Fantastic product, fantastic value. I highly recommend it, and I will be buying it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful please click yes below.to conventional products was so stark that I would have given up on the week.

            <li> Good for face massage. Fast shipping. But too pricey</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived completely intact with no problem. I mix this with other oils, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Received order with bottle opened and box soaked with oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil!! Love it for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for hot oil hair wrap!</li>
            <li> Good size bottle. I use it to blend with other oils for my hair and skin. So far so good and no smell to it.</li>
            <li> As with everything I read a lot of reviews before I buy anything.. I liked what I read and so far I&#x27;m liking how my scalp feels . I get bad dry flaky skin and my hair is thin .&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad experience at a hairdressers and my scalp was injured so I needed something to help .. So far I like it a lot but need more time . Will update soon!</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and on my skin. Leaves both nice and soft</li>
            <li> I really like how light this oil is. I use it as a moisturizer when I want something that does the job and is unscented.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> This is a high price item since avocados are high priced fruit and with water shortage in CA, avocados not a drought plant that require very high amount of water, 400 gallons per avocado does not help the situation at all but regardless few issues with this item;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not an edible avocado oil. All oils from any fruit that you consume, either internally or extarnally should be an edible oil. When it is claimed for MOISTURIZING, it means nutrients are considerably less since it is a more processed oil from sourced item.&lt;br /&gt;2. Nowhere on this item specifies COOL. Any reputable oil producer will specify COOL since at least that is how one can trace the quality of the product especially oil.&lt;br /&gt;3. Nowhere it is claimed unrefined, meaning full of nutrients. If one is purchasing oil, they certainly are not paying for marketing, it is the nutrients and when processed heavily, nutrients are gone.&lt;br /&gt;4. Skin requires vitamin E, this hardly has any compare to AO or WGO. Avocado is an extremely healthy fruit but not a skin conditioner at all. Consumed internally, one gets all the health benefits but processed it goes rancid much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;5. CO comes in organic form. CO is a superior oil which I use daily with VCO in organic form. Both oils are so superior that I mix with all my organic soaps as well as daily skin conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;6. Avocado oil is much heavier in texture than AO with different natural ingredients like collagen-supporting amino acids and proteins, as well as vitamins A, D and E. Sugar cane produces glycolic acid, one of the natural alpha hydroxy acids that ex-foliate the skin as sugar scrub. I combine these two without any other perfumes, scents or anything else like essential oils or what so ever in a bowl and take it with me to the beach. I massage it gently onto my skin, leave it on till I feel uncomfortable, and then wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why CA finally passed new laws for EVOO since majority of EVOOs from EU are diluted and EV has no more meaning when so many producers misrepresent their labeling and CA needs to compete with their production. I consume avocados all the time since raw avocados offer mono-saturated healthy oil, the second highest after sunflower seeds. But after purchasing 33.8oz of avocado oil for only ten at Costco, AND COMPARING IT WITH ALL OTHER BRANDS, I did further research and learned that there are few kinds of avocado oils out in the market and unless it is not clearly printed on the labeling, do not assume anything or accept any claims on the phone or through writing from any producer since they are not liable for any claims except what printed on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avocado Oil is the centrifuge extracted oil from the fruit of the tree, Persea Americana (also classified as Persea gratissima), which is a member of the Lauraceae family (Laurel). The avocado is native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America, The fruit of the avocado is greenish in color with the shape similar to that of a large pear. Different kinds of Avocado Oil are as follow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRUDE OIL:&lt;br /&gt;Crude oil is highly recommended to be taken in capsules as an excellent anti-aging agent and alimentary supplement, since its taste and odor are not as delicious as those in the Extra Virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA VIRGIN AVOCADO OIL:&lt;br /&gt;Crude Oil and Extra Virgin Oil have very similar characteristics, since Extra Virgin Oil is a special variety of crude oil. Both have a shiny, dark green color, and are predominately monounsaturated, giving them great oxidative stability. Extra Virgin Oil is gourmet grade and is excellent to be used in salad dressings and gourmet cuisine. In the Extra Virgin Oil, the taste and odor are perceived as those of the fresh avocado, and its free fatty acids value is much lower, which makes it even more stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RBDW GRADE:&lt;br /&gt;The RBDW (Refined, Bleached, Deodorized and Winterized) Avocado Oil is clear, light and non-tacky with quick penetration characteristics. Its odor and taste are of a very pleasant, faint nut like tone. Mostly used for cooking (as a common oil) and for salad dressing. Highly appreciated because its high smoke point (highest among all vegetable oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RB, RBD and RBW GRADE:&lt;br /&gt;These are different combinations of the four typical refine steps (Refining, Bleaching, Deodorizing and Wintetizing). These grades are usually used by the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always shop around and compare ingredients with nutrients not marketing by producers on the labeling. Oil from fruits, nuts and seed are the best ingredients for the skin since it is absorbed by the skin and processed by liver. Organic oil insures the healthy process externally when it is unrefined and full of nutrients not in conventional form.ooking (as a common oil) and for salad dressing.

            <li> i&#x27;m mixing this oil with some other oils for hair growth.  this oil is not as heavy as the others.  i sometimes put it under my eyes at night for under eye circles, i see a tiny bit of difference, but i&#x27;m not consistent. it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; will buy again.....</li>
            <li> I use the avocado oil on my hair and face about once a month.,  I leave it on about 30 minutes and then shower and shampoo as regular,.  It seems to leave my face softer and may be helping the very thin lines on my face (I&#x27;m over 60).  I think it is beneficial to my hair which is color treated and thinning.  When this bottle is done, I plan to get another.</li>
            <li> Use this mixed with Aloe Vera gel as a face moisturizer; no need for lotion anymore!</li>
            <li> The oil has no smell, which is great since I use it in my hair. It is also light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  While the bottle says for body use I haven&#x27;t really used in on my body but imagine it would work well there.</li>
            <li> Perfect choice for DIY hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of avocado oil and this oil meets all expectations. I use it for my hair and it helps leave my hair really moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for my skin and hair! And while doing further research I found our that it helps with acne. So that night I applied 2 1/2 drops in my hand, rubbed them together, then applied it all over my face. The next night my pores visibly shrunk and my skin was flawless and moisturized!!! I will definitely be buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> This oil seems as described. I was hoping it would rehydrate my dry winter scap, but it didn&#x27;t. Avocado oil when taken internally from a fresh avocado can help some people with psoriasis, but this product used on scalp topically seems not to do that.</li>
            <li> Well, I have dry skin so I keep using olive oil after taking bath.  This time I tried the Avocado Oil and I think it works but could just last for a while.  If the weather is terrible it seems cannot work well.  However, if your skin condition is not that bad, it would be enough for daily skin care.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to try for the Oil Cleansing Method, however the method was a complete bust.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that I still love this product for shaving my legs or just using it as a moisturizer in the shower. It leaves everything feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil (second favorite aside from coconut oil A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this while making some homemade lotion and skincare products. This is a very large bottle of Avacado oil and it will last you a while. I noticed this type of oil in a lot of high-end skincare lotions and under eye creams. So I bought it. I am so happy I did. My skin really likes this oil - it is so soothing and makes my face so soft. My skin is normally extra dry, easily irritated and this helped alleviate a bit of that. I also burned my skin a bit on part of my face (from a peel) and the only thing that helped with speeding up the healing was this stuff. I am really happy I bought it. I like all of NOW brand products.</li>
            <li> use for hair and skin for my daughter she has escema always looking for natural products that moisturize this works great</li>
            <li> Got this avacado oil to mix w/ argan oil, sweet almond oil, rose hip seed oil, and some essential oils.  Love this mix, feels great on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the castor and avocado oil to add to my Shea butter mix. I was not disappointed all. Love it.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to use on my extreme dry and sensitive skin...on my legs, arms and back due to atopic dermatitis. I get more relief using topical prescription steroids but decided to keep it and use it on my aging hair (from reading other posts about the product). I use Rogaine but was still losing hair...being a scientist at heart I decided to try the oil on my hair before I go to bed. Have been using for several days now and have already noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair each morning after I shower. If this turns out like I&#x27;m hoping Rogaine may decide to add this amazing oil to their product!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you.  Love this oil because it is versitle.  I use it for skin, hair, and works well on feet and nails</li>
            <li> I make my own hair and skin products to avoid all the chemicals in commercial products.  I use this mostly in my hair but have tried it on my skin also and it&#x27;s great for both.  Now Foods products are quality products at decent prices.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 1 week and the results are amazing. My 3 year old son has dry skin and eczema dry patches. I was using the avocado oil on his skin and there was an immediate difference from all of the other &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; products out there. We have have gone through them all. This oil kept his skin hydrated and moisturized throughout the night and I simply had to reapply a small amount in the morning. At the end of the day his skin was glowing and not dry or greasy! I also use the oil as my facial moisturizer mixed with rosehip seed oil and lavender essential oil. It has my skin feeling great as well. I think it is worth buying your own oils and creating your own moisturizers. The lotions on the market tend to damage and dry out the skin more then they moisturize. I also think it is great to add the oil to any daily lotion you use as an extra boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Avocado oil Lover!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cooking oil with a high smoke point.  Avocado oil is good for that, and this product is made by NOW Foods, from whom I purchase other food items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost bought this for cooking, then saw the review that warned that this is for bathing.  So I&#x27;ve added this review so that others will not make that same mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: If you are reading this, please add this information to the description.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way so use a dime size and add more as needed.  It left my skin feeling soft and my skin felt moisturized a lot longer than if I would have used lotion.  I received my shipment on time and I am pleased with this product.  I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to a scrub for my skin and it doesn&#x27;t soften my skin as much as baby oil does..</li>
            <li> I apply this to my skin after showering and also use it to moisturize my hair. When I used it on my hair it was alright. It didn&#x27;t work as well as my other essential oils when moisturizing, however, it&#x27;s great for when I deep condition the night before.</li>
            <li> This oil is great as a base oil for lotions, etc, but it is a wonderful moisturizer all on its own.</li>
            <li> I love this avacodo oil.  I mix it with various essential oils and it works great.  I use it on my skin and in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this, especially for this time of year. I mix it with my moisture facial cr&amp;egrave;me for daytime and use full strength in the evening. Apply about an hour to two hours before you go to bed so it sets in and doesn&#x27;t come off. I use it on my body as well and with as cold as it has been your skin is always more dry in the winter than summer, it works great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil, makes your hair and skin so soft and beautiful but I am allergic, how unfortunate for me, also know that if you are allergic to latex you will be allergic to avocado oil.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry and thirsty but since I have been using this product my skin has been soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this for both hair and body moisturizer because read it prevents hair loss and also it helps to build collagen.</li>
            <li> In looking for Avocado Oil for cooking - \\&quot;NOW FOODS\\&quot; seemed like a GREAT place to start.  Not until the product arrived did I realize this is a MOISTURIZING OIL - NOT a FOOD Item - VERY DISAPPOINTED to say the least!  Amazon should do a better job of categorizing this item as it is VERY misleading - especially when it was returned as a search item under \\&quot;Avocado Cooking Oil\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> this is the only oil that soothes my eczema. it is very think so i usually mix it with another type of oil (apricot right now). because it&#x27;s so thick, i don&#x27;t use it on my face but i love it everywhere else. it&#x27;s also great for dry and damaged hair. it&#x27;s a great alternative to using actual avocados for hair masks because they&#x27;re so messy. definitely one of my staples.</li>
            <li> Nice and non greasy for your hair.</li>
            <li> I want people to know it is completely edible I use it for cooking all the time it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> NIce - very moisturising for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as an overnight facial moisturizer in an attempt to get away from all the icky ingredients in traditional face creams.  My skin feels nice and soft in the morning and I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and great</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I been</li>
            <li> The NOW avocado oil has to be my favorite of them all!</li>
            <li> Avocado oil has so many benefits, and the main thing I love it for is my skin. I put it on my face at night before I go to bed &amp; my skin is nice, clear, and blemish free. Several years ago, someone gifted me a set of Proactive and I made the mistake of putting the toner around my eyes, which caused immediate wrinkles. I was heartbroken. So I put a little more avocado oil around my eyes because it is very safe for the sensitive skin in that area. It really tones down dark circles &amp; makes the skin around my eyes very smooth. All of the wrinkles have diminished. I also mix it with almond oil, grape seed oil, shea butter oil, &amp; jojoba oil which I use (the mixture) on my hair &amp; my body after showering. This is a large bottle which lasts me about 3-4 months if not longer. If you aren&#x27;t aware of all the benefits of avocado oil, I strongly recommend looking them up on Google.com. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mixed this oil with my other natural oils to use on my body and hair. It is also good to incorporate in any deep conditioner to moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on stretch marks and how to avoid them when I got pregnant. Now my dr said there wasn&#x27;t anything you could do to avoid them, it just depended on weight gain ( I also read it was hereditary and my mom has them). But I order this avocado oil, almond oil and jojoba oil and used all of it throughout my pregnancy. Other than feeling like I was dipped in a deep fryer for a little while, it worked wonders!! I don&#x27;t have a stretch mark to show and I feel like it was because I was religious with this regimen and didn&#x27;t miss a day (a little obsessive). I didn&#x27;t like cocoa butter b/c it never gets absorbed and just stays greasy, but this does absorb into your skin if you give it a little while and rub it in. I didn&#x27;t gain weight super fast either so that could have helped, but I fully believe that this works!!</li>
            <li> Love this product and brand will recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Great for you skin and hair. Plus it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Received leaking everywhere. Will not order again</li>
            <li> Accidentally purchased this brand.  It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you for years! I massage a thin layer into my face before I go to bed, and I wake up with hydrated but not greasy skin. It seems to cut down recovery time on blemishes and small scabs. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or give you pimples (and I have pretty oily skin, so I would know.) If you put it on your hair, though, be careful - a little goes a loooooooong way. It smells a little weird, but it&#x27;s not a super strong smell, so who cares?</li>
            <li> Good price.  Cheaper than going to my local health food store.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried.  Truly rich like it&#x27;s supposed to be.  Definitely NOT diluted.</li>
            <li> I even use on my face and it doesn&#x27;t break out. At first I hated the smell but now I&#x27;m over it.</li>
            <li> I mix this and other oils to use in lieu of lotion. I love it.</li>
            <li> Daily use is essential.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as part of a mix (with apricot kernel, Jamaican black castor oil and jojoba oil) to seal moisture in my hair (type 4 natural). I also add it to my moisturizing spritz. The oil leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. Next, I will add it to my deep conditioners for added slip. The price was reasonable, and I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Very nice avacado oil. Hair growth has improved !</li>
            <li> Used this product in my hair and body butters and it worked well. Love it on my hair as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love the Avacado Oil. We use this as a moisturizer for our entire body after s shower and we use if in off home made sugar scrubs. Thank you for s great product!!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my dry-cracked heels as well as my facial skin and my hair!  I didn&#x27;t think one product could do it, but this avocado oil does!</li>
            <li> pure, light and great on the skin!</li>
            <li> I used this oil for my hair and it was too think for me to get it off. I used it on my toes that have been itching this winter and the area became sensitive and a little swollen. It is not any kind of athletes foot or any other bacteria related but it just happens in winter for 3-4 months. I read some articles and used this oil along with tea tree oil and the 2nd toe that used to itch and it completely dried up the swelling and my toe had scales in next couple of days. Wow I thought. The itching comes back every now and then, but I am using the same bland and keeping it off so far. The oil has no smell so I bought Lavender oil from Now foods and mixed it a little with this oil and now it smells so good.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say I contacted the company and they said that this is food grade and edible!!! I know someone said that this wasnt edible, but I heard straight from the company that it was. :D It doesnt stay greasy on the skin either I love it!! Oh and it doesnt smell bad at all. Over all great product I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I am African American Female with 3c hair texture. I have been natural for 2 yrs how. My hair is extemely curly and very dry. This along with the Jojoba oil has been beyond excellent for me.I use it along with Beautifu Textures or As I am Hair products. I works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a fine hair and I am black.  This is my favorite oil.  I have also tried sweet almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter; but Avocado Oil makes my hair feel the healthiest and is one of the easiest to use (i.e., no melting required).  Now, I usually either use it as a sealant or mix it with olive oil, essential oils and water as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This does smell a bit like old oil once it&#x27;s on your skin, but I fixed that with a few drops of essential oil. It&#x27;s so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Very thick, but in a good way - it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that has kept my skin moisturized through the winter. I am of ethnic descent and live in the far North - it&#x27;s a recipe for horrific dry skin that I&#x27;ve battled my entire life, until this winter when I started using Avocado Oil. I&#x27;m also pregnant and have had no itchy skin or stretch marks (crowd gasps in awe). Love, love, love this product!!</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed by the nomenclature here. I was looking for alternatives to greasy oils, and this arrived with instructions for use as a skin moisturizing agent. For THAT purpose, it works well.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be great for wrinkles.  I like it but can only use at night somewhat heavy&lt;br /&gt;Great size, excellent company to buy from</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a facial moisturizer, eye &amp;#34;cream,&amp;#34; neck rejuvenator, skin soother after waxing, hair conditioner additive; I even shave with it. Makes packing for a trip a breeze (though of course it is a liquid and subject to those limitations). I love that this brand of oil is light and has no smell at all, unlike some other avocado oils I&#x27;ve tried. I truly find it to be a miracle beauty aid and can&#x27;t believe how soothing it is and how moisturizing and youth-enhancing. Given all it does, and does beautifully, it is quite a bargain!</li>
            <li> That is pretty much all that I have to say. The avocado oil has helped improve my dry skin and I am so thankful for that! It also gives a nice texture to my hair when I am mixing it with castor oil and my everyday hair product :)</li>
            <li> Odorless, lite on my hair/skin and very hydrating.  I love this oil and will order everytime.  Big bottle lasts a while too.  I&#x27;ve since added it to my daily routine from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I bought this to join the arsenal of oils for maintaining natural kinky hair, and I liked how thick it was compared to jojoba oil. I like using it mixed with coconut, jojoba oil to keep hair happy. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect for hair or using on the body. It has a great light smell to it and it&#x27;s not to oily as for other oils, I order a few months back I&#x27;m about to order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural oil I have ever tried. I bought it based on recommendations I had seen on other sites for its uses as a moisturizer for every body part imaginable. I suffer from dry skin and hair and use this as my go to hair, face and general skin lotion right out of the shower, especially after my evening bath. It does not take much and it melts right into my body. My hair is nice and soft, my face has a glow that others notice and my skin is baby smooth. Nice as an overnight moisturizer, and the price cannot be beat. The only other oil I have tried that rivals this, especially for the face, is rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! And as expected, the package came right on time!</li>
            <li> worst quality - don&#x27;t waste your money, its a sake oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is a little heavy. I like it for my dry skin. Ialso use on my hair but have to be very careful because it&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my hair! I have super thick curly hair and it does a great job moisturizing my curls. It also does great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed massage therapist. I use pure oils in my practice. NOW Foods avocado oil is an excellent massage oil, and the Amazon Marketplace distributor Vitaminlife gave me an excellent price. I will order again from Vitaminlife.</li>
            <li> This is some good Avocado oil. Can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful the NOW products are. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I use it in my hair as a deep conditioner and on my skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> I love avocado oil but I purchased two of these from Now and one is rancid. I&#x27;ll have to throw it away because I don&#x27;t like to smell like MacDonald&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OIL.. MIXES WITH OTHERS.. JUST A BIT GOES A LONG WAY.. GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> One application and the red was gone from my daughters face. Very silky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff as a shower oil.  Also works great for shaving your legs (or to use after shaving).  A little goes a looong way and it leaves the skin glowy and gorgeous, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use avocado oil for my hair mostly. It&#x27;s great to add to conditioners when I deep condition my hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it for cooking yet. Maybe soon.</li>
            <li> Works great for a nighttime moisturizer. Does not absorb into the skin. So use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin and nail oil. My first time buying avocado oil was at Sally beauty supply, I paid over $6 for a tiny bottle that touted it as a vitamin E enriched cuticle oil. I&#x27;ve also noticed all the expensive skin and eye creams contain avocado oil...I figured why not go right to the source and buy pure avocado oil at a fraction of the price and make my own? I hate paying for a name brand when I can DIY for so much cheaper. I fill up an oz size cobalt glass dropper bottle and add a few drops of lavender essential oil (also Now brand) and use it for pretty much all my skin moisturizing needs. This is my absolute favorite skin and cuticle oil and so ridiculously cheap compared to buying avocado oil-enriched products. I rub it into my hands and feet and cuticles whenever I really want some serious moisture, especially after a shower/bath or at night before bed. Avocado oil is rich in vitamins and one of the more deeply penetrating, heavily moisturizing oils out there. If I top it with a layer of Shea butter it works the absolute best, this combo also works extremely well to treat the delicate skin around your eyes to minimize fine lines. Since I have acne prone skin I do not use it anywhere on my face except around my eyes since it does cause me to break out if I use it on my cheeks or chin, YMMV.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use natural oils on my skin rather than lotions or creams, but I had a hard time finding one that was heavy enough but absorbed well in the winter. I tried coconut oil for a long time but still found that it was a bit greasy after apply (even after I whipped it in my Kitchenaid). Enter this oil! It&#x27;s that perfect consistency of creamy feeling but it sinks in quickly. Grapeseed or Sweet Almond oil I find are not rich enough for winter and they have a drier touch which is nice when it&#x27;s warmer out. So the Avocado is perfect when I want something richer, but still not feel like I&#x27;m sticky or oily like I do with coconut oil. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I find it cheaper on amazon than in Whole Foods. Im African American and this works wonders for moisturizing my hair. I also use it on my dry skin in the winters and in my homemade conditioners. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I use on my hair and face. This bottle will last a very long time. Good product great price!</li>
            <li> I got it cause I heard it get rid of cellulite. I mixed it in with my Nivea firming lotion and together they work. I work out a lot also, but I always have and this extra helped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. I use it all over my body. It is a very multipurpose oil.</li>
            <li> this oil is so amazing its a great moisturizer for hair and skin treatments.  Once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife she originally wanted coconut oil for moisturizing her face but I got her this one after reading reviews and she loves it I also use it as pre shave oil and it is really great a little goes a long way definitely would recommend worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The Avocado Oil arrived in the time the seller said it would and it was larger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST MOISTURIZING OIL OUT HERE IN AMERICA AND BELIEVE ME, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL.  YOU CAN BLEND THIS WITH ANY LOTION OR CREAM YOU HAVE, OR YOU CAN USE THIS ON ITS OWN.</li>
            <li> My hubby hated giving me back rubs before, but this makes it way easier to get a knot out and smells great!  It&#x27;s a little oily but not bad.  Great for dry feet right before bed.</li>
            <li> I switch between this and the almond oil that is sold by the same Now Foods company. I like them both, I feel that this is less oily feeling.  I am a fan! A must after each shower!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as an addition to my hair care regimen. I mixed it with my oils for my hair and it worked like magic. About two weeks ago I was running late for work and had to put some oil on my legs in a hurry. So I grabbed this oil thinking it would not last long or work on my skin at all. It worked so well, I have started using it exclusively as my only moisturizing skin care product.</li>
            <li> I love to have smooth n shiny hair, skin and nails. This oil gives it to all to me. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this avocado oil because I have been suffering from very dry skin and eczema. Especially after the sun exposure, my skin was really really dry. I can see the white bumps on my arm, and my skin feels like alligator skin literally. I tried so many different moisturizers, from Vaseline (the new product that guarantees to relieve dry skin conditions), to the body shop&#x27;s body butter for extremely dry skin, to aloe vera gel (I had to reapply every 2 hours to sooth the itchiness). They all helped some but none of them really cure the dry skin condition. My skin remains dry and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I watched a youtube video of a person talking about how she used organic coconut oil and other kind of organic oils to cure her eczema. I searched on amazon and found this organic Avocado oil. This is day 2 of using this oil and I already have seen and felt a big difference. My skin is a lot smoother after only one application. The worst dry skin part is almost gone now.  The itchiness sometimes is still there, but I don&#x27;t feel the urge to reapply anything to sooth it. After all, I only applied twice so far. I&#x27;ll keep using this oil after every shower and hopefully it will keep healing my dry skin. I&#x27;ll be happy to stick with the oil than some expensive body lotions/butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is way easier than body lotions and butters. The oil doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because my skin is extremely dry). Anyway, this is a good product and the key is to use as many things organic as possible. I have also used pure argan oil on my face. It also works well as a moisturizer. I have sensitive skin on my face. I&#x27;ll try to use minimum products with chemicals. Organic is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I use this as my carrier oil for essential oil applications.  This seems to be a better alternative if you are giving gifts as many people have nut allergies, but not avocado allergies.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Quality oil for the price, timely delivery. I will continue to order this oil based on the prices.</li>
            <li> Great deal. The larger container. Pure oil is wonderful for my scalp. I really like the organic oil. Great deal</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment of the Avocado oil today; and I must say, the oil was not a rich color like I&#x27;ve seen with many of the Avocado oils. I&#x27;ve ordered from this company recently the JoJoba oil; and the quality of the oil was very rich and the oil had the  color I was expecting. The Avocado oil should be the rich-heavy gold type base to it; but this oil that was sent to me was not that; it was light in color. I&#x27;m a little skeptical about the oil, but I&#x27;ll see how it does for as what it says on the packaging. I think I will now begin to order from another company, because this company says that their products are 100% pure and real. I&#x27;m beginning to think that this company is not lining up to the things they say. Also, they are very expensive with their products. I paid about $14 and some change for the 16oz bottle, of course with s/h they charged me $6. So, I paid about $20 and some change. I found the oil elsewhere for a better price and better quality. Be best if you truly do your research on the oils and go from there.</li>
            <li> I think the oil seems fine, but I got a bottle with an broken cap and I can&#x27;t return it. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This advocado oil is aaaamazing. I use it on my hair and it has done wonders. Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time &amp; as expected! I have used the NOW brand in the past &amp; have had great results. Happy to find it at a reasonable price on line.</li>
            <li> For those of you who think this oil is for cooking IT IS NOT. I&#x27;ve been wanting a thick, natural moisturizer for my skin. I use shea butter or this Avocado oil (thick) or, Castor oil (super dooper thick) or, Jojoba oil (medium thick- I like putting it on right out of the shower to lock in moisture).</li>
            <li> This is the perfect carrier oil for hair and body.  Its thicker than sweet almond but thinner than castor oil, and has greater health benefits, a very good value</li>
            <li> Love it ..im gonna try all the kinds soon ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this in place of a body lotion. It works well. I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with it. It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> While I still believe the product was over priced and should have been part of prime like all the rest of their products. I purchased because I trust the product, I will however continue to search for a better price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this brand</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for hair and skin :)</li>
            <li> great product for skin and hair</li>
            <li> My skin has been horribly dry this winter. This oil soaks in nicely without being oily. No smell which is nice. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> Now Foods always delivers a quality product. The avocado oil does not disssapoint. I use the avocado oil for dry skin and hair (I use this oil as a hot oil treatment on my hair). There is no foul or unpleasant odor and the oil rinses easily. Fair price for the size of the bottle. This is a food grade product.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the avocado oil in my dry hair that is always thirsty for oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil! We use it as a body and hair oil!</li>
            <li> Very nice and feels hydrating on my skin. Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> I use after shower and even on face.  It is not oily per say....once you rub into skin it soaks right in.  Skin is definately softer</li>
            <li> I really like that there is no oily residue on my skin, and that it can be used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry skin and hot oil treatments and have for years.  On skin, I use it alone and I hair, either alone or with some other oil, whether olive or coconut - warmed, mixed and applied for 20-30 mins.</li>
            <li> I blend this oil with my black castor oil as well as some other oils. This oil absorbs so nicely. I really love it.</li>
            <li> use for cosmetics and moisturizers</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it as scalp treatment for flakes, skin moisturizing, and on my face as well. Will keep purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this as one of my top carrier oils.  Nice flow from the cap, pours nicely into my little roll-on vials that I use for diluted essential oils.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Did not like it.  NOW Foods - Avocado Oil is not edible nor does it hold in that much moisture.  It is oily.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin LOVE this stuff. I use this oil in my body butter concoction and hair oil medley. I LOVE IT!!!! I would, and have suggested that everyone give this oil a try. My hair and skin are that much softer now that I&#x27;ve incorporate it in my product for home use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I received avocado oil  Having bought this product with this label in person for a while, I found this oil to be A. More viscous than previous purchases. 2.  A darker color than all previous purchases.  3. Smelling strongly of slightly rancid canola oil.  I like buying this product in person, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I was defrauded in this case.  But only $10 lost, I&#x27;ll just shop on Amazon less in the furture and more in stores where I can touch the thing im buying.</li>
            <li> The oil came quickly. I use it on my skin and hair. I put some in my hair before a workout, and then wash it off in the shower. It gives my hair body and shine. Avocado oil does wonders for dry skin and any skin in general. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The product is great, no unpleasant smell and not a heavy oil like that you would typically expect.  Worked great when I mixed it with olive oil for a hot oil conditioner.</li>
            <li> Use NOW Foods products(Oils) all the time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love them for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again, but may find it cheaper locally.</li>
            <li> A very good product.  Popular with clients.</li>
            <li> Love this oil will be re ordering. For hair, skin mixing with other oils its lite non greasy, love it for my face....</li>
            <li> love it use it for hair and skin but mostly hair, for both it does wonders!!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use on my natural hair, but I discovered that it works well on my dry skin. I use it after showering while my skin is still damp. It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> excellent oil for the skin and hair great products buy it for everyday use.  Will be stocking up on this product.</li>
            <li> very good  excellant for  the  skin  would  recommend  to  everybody  not  gresey  at  all  worked  real  well  for  me  a1</li>
            <li> Although this may be a good product for massage therapy or soothing dry/flaky skin, I had thought that this was an Avocado COOKING Oil. I am extremely displeased by the fact that the product popped up when I was looking for cooking oils and it&#x27;s by a company called NOW Foods. They do dietary supplements, but this is sort of confusing if you don&#x27;t realize that a company with &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; in the title and a product name &amp;#34;avocado oil&amp;#34; that you know can be substituted with olive oil and other cooking oils, isn&#x27;t the kind of oil that you were looking for. I can give this to my sister who does massage therapy, but that wasn&#x27;t my intentions. I feel that this should say Massage or Body in the title so that people like me who see &amp;#34;Food-Oil&amp;#34; don&#x27;t get confused and buy something they really DON&#x27;T want to have.</li>
            <li> i love avocado oil.  its great for your skin and hair.  it keeps my skin and hair very moisturized.  will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is  a nice product. I like how big the bottle is. I use this combined with many other oils. I would reccomend</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, I used this for a number of different uses for my hair, hot oil treatment, pre-poo, I mix it with my hair grease, hair is really soft and manageable after using this.</li>
            <li> I heard it was good for cellulite.  I am not sure if it is working I stopped checking but I do love the way it feels on my skin.  I also use in my water oil mix for my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil was good. Used it for my hair</li>
            <li> This oil smell nasty. I have used Avocado oil in the past and this stuff did not smell like avocado oil at all. Ladies watch out I got it from Zulera.</li>
            <li> Fantastic skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great massage oil. Really light and pleadent. It has no scent. But you can add essential oils to it for smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasts long enough for a good massage and doesn&#x27;t dry to quickly like many lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great on feet, elbows and hands that tend to need extra attentiin</li>
            <li> very good quality.  Probably better quality than Costco... but I saw Avocado oil at costco the day after I purchased this at 1/3rd the price.  I regret purchasing from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great for face and body!</li>
            <li> Works well for what I ordered it for</li>
            <li> Great price and service</li>
            <li> it appears to be avocado oil</li>
            <li> This works really well in my home made soaps .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s yellow oil. Avocado oil is green. I think its mixed with other vegetable oils.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Use it on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I bought this to mix with other oils for hair, scalp, and body. It&#x27;s great nourishment for the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Avocado oil!!!! Highly moisturizing!!! Good for dehydrated skin &amp;/or hair!!!! I will definitely purchase AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a skin and hair moisturizer and it works very well. Mild pleasant smell and absorbs quickly. I was a fan of coconut oil but didn&#x27;t like that coconut oil solidifies and has a distinct scent (although I know people like it). Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Luxurious and not greasy like coconut oil.</li>
            <li> tried most of their oils and this is my favorite, make my skin amazing and soooooo good for you your kids</li>
            <li> i love this product i only use it for my hair only and im in absolute love i use it every single day its been extremely helpful throughout my natural hair journey</li>
            <li> Best helper for detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. it is very nourishing and it hydrates my skin. I wonder why i never thought about buying this product before. and it&#x27;s rather affordable too. I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great price, nice oil!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t the chance to use it just yet but looks and smells phenomenal. Very happy with the price and quality and the service. I&#x27;ll be back for more oils from you, service has been exceptional!</li>
            <li> Excellent value thank you</li>
            <li> Avocado oil is great for you and is unique in the kitchen.  All of the velvety texture of olive oil with the added benefit of a high smoke point.  Now makes a good product.  I mix this with nut based oils in some salad dressings as well.  4 stars because it&#x27;s a good price/value for nutrition content but this brand lacks some of the robustness in flavor and aroma.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this specific oil.  it is light, but not too light, like grapeseed oil.  i mix equal parts avocado, olive, and almond oil and use it to moisturize my body.  i can even use it on my face!</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper other places. I should have looked before I bought. Other than that it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. I put some in my shampoos or hair conditioner for extra moisture.</li>
            <li> This avocado oil is very good is it five a 5 plus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed with an oil from NOW foods.  The Avocado Oil is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li> perfect for my home made lotion</li>
            <li> I ordered my oil from a great seller. Shipping was fast as well as delivery. I have read so many great reviews about avocado oil, and decided to finally try it for myself. I use avocado oil for my hair. I must say that I LOVE it. This is one of my favorite oils. It&#x27;s light and not too greasy; plus it leaves my hair soft and shiny when I use it. In comparison to whole avocado made into a deep conditioner, this steals the cake! When I run out I will order it again to aid me in my hair regimen. I&#x27;d suggest this product to naturals and those who want sily, soft, and shiny hair without the greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working wonders on my skin. I use it in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected. I found a cheaper alternative two days later at Costco. I purchased a 34 oz bottle for 9.99. I am using it as a nutritional supplement, not a massage oil.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for natural hair and provides nutrient for the hair. The fatty acids in Avocado oil nourish your hair to no end. I don&#x27;t really use this oil on its own, I really only use it in a bottle with other oils. I&#x27;m kind of an oil FREAK!</li>
            <li> Love avocado oil.  Use it in home made lotions, creams and body butters.  Have been comparing brands and this is comparable and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I had no idea I even wanted avocado oil when I did my search...  I was just looking for ideas on which natural oils to try next for moisturizing my skin.  When I saw the reviews on how great this oil is to cook with I had to try it, and sure enough!  ...You can cook it at a higher heat than butter, coconut oil or hemp oil and there was no odd smell.  I&#x27;ve only just begun using avocado oil for cooking, but I am thrilled to have found another way to cook healthier while still indulging in sauteing and pan frying.</li>
            <li> It feels great and is now my go to moisturizer.  I do not believe in buyinglotions and cremes anymore, oil is SO MUCH BTTER!!! Why didnt i find this stuff sooner?!  It mademy legs feel softer and more moisturized longer than any of the other $$$ lotions.  Forget buying stuff you cant even pronounce the ingredients to..really. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using this for food, because I think it&#x27;s possibly a little rancid. It smells off. But I&#x27;ll use it for skin and hair... the odor dissipates quickly. It was quickly delivered and packaged well, I just think it&#x27;s either old or made from inferior fruit. Oh well!</li>
            <li> But feels wonderful on skin. So hard to find natural oils without that use me fast starting to get old smell</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed to find this was a cosmetic for skin, not for consumption.  Deceiving since it  was from Now Foods, listed with other consumable foods.  Guess I did not read carefully.</li>
            <li> We use avocado oil on everything - hair, skin, nails. Love the deep moisturizing ability without excess residue.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was as promised.  However, I had an allergic reaction when I used it on my face.  I gave it to a colleague who loves it.</li>
            <li> I use in my hair and it does great for voluminization. Thick yummy oil for face moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. Its not too thick and certainly good hair nails and skin</li>
            <li> I used the item on my natural hair and in my Henna. The smell was great and lift my hair really soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Great on hair &amp; skin mix w: essential oils for body spray</li>
            <li> This oil is a little heavy, but it&#x27;s great to use when my hair is dry and feeling brittle. It makes my hair soft and it feels smoother. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Yes!!! What took me so long with this stuff? It&#x27;s perfect for my hair and my son&#x27;s. And he does not particularly like getting his hair done, but this oil gets to work instantly to condition and moisturize.</li>
            <li> A favorite large part of my skin care.  I add coconut oil and essential oils (peppermint, thyme, lavender and some clove), and it makes my dry skin happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent skin oil! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle. clear oil and good consistency.</li>
            <li> I am extremely please with the Avocado Oil: I use it on my skin every day. I have eczema, dermatitis &amp; am also enjoying my first baby bump :) I researched many products to use for sensitive skin &amp; stretching skin (growing tummy) &amp; all the other products had mineral oil/petroleum (yikes! no thanks!) &amp; FINALLY I found the Avocado Oil!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned-Never put something On your body you Wouldn&#x27;t put in your mouth. Our skin absorbs stuff we put on it Of course :) Great Quality! LOVE IT! Thank you!!! I can Always Trust &#x27;Now Foods&#x27; to have clean &amp; pure products. Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used before and will continue to use it mixed with Neem Healing Oil for my dry skin. But, please don&#x27;t bother me with e&lt;br /&gt;requests for future reviews.</li>
            <li> best moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li> Nice all natural product</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality avocado oil and I use it in many ways -- add a couple of drops to my moisturizer in the morning, use as a deep conditioner for hair, even use it to condition my cuticles. Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great ingredient for soap</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but appears to be just what I wanted.  I have had very good luck with the NOW oils and essential oils I have ordered in the past so I am sure this will be great</li>
            <li> I suffer fro severe dry skin and eczema in the winter, so I came across this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I applied this oil after shower and my skin was soft and no longer dry and itchy.  I am now a true believer in the product and keep it on my bathroom counter.  I love it and dry skin no longer an issue!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use with a couple other oils for facial use. Using a few drops I massage into facial skin and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I Have Used Other Oils....But there were No other Oil that Make My Hair Shiny and Soft....I Had this buy the bigger bottle of this oil....Mix it Up My Grapeseed Oil and My Hair is Back to Life....I Love this Oil!!!</li>
