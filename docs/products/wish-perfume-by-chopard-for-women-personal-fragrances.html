            <li>Nice fragrance, fun bottle and great price</li>
            <li>I like the scent of Wish, but I love Casmir even more!</li>
            <li>(the organic kind that still smells of coconuts) and then spritzing the hair and doing the walk through :)</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best purchases for the money.</li>
            <li>I work in a clinic and walked by a patient one day who happened to be wearing this gorgeous, warm, sweet and rich-smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for many years and it is nice to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Its sweeter than Casmir (which I love too) but still has some of the warm, sexy woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>but it is actually very cheap.</li>
            <li>It is authentic.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>...i have not given anybody a better gift on a better day..</li>
            <li>I tried so many samples before I bought this eau de parfum.</li>

            <li>I gave it away as a gift :-)</li>
            <li>I receive SO many compliments on this everytime</li>
            <li>This fragrance will go to the top of my list as a favorite.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I was gifted a bottle from my baby brother for Christmas.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume of all time is Casmir by Chopard, and this one is just as wonderful, though different.</li>

            <li>I love my grandma to pieces, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like her.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m not quite sure about it.</li>
            <li>and I want to be able to smell the lovely \\&quot;phase 2\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>Get compliments all the time love the smell</li>
            <li>and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
            <li>Received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I will say that is a problem with many fragrances on me and Angel</li>
            <li>Amazon is the most reliable place I have found to purchase Wish.  </li>
            <li>and you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s apure delight, don&#x27;t know how to explain the scent.</li>
            <li>and I love it when she wears it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>just love it</li>
            <li>and she was very excited.</li>
            <li>Then a bit later, it morphed into the gorgeous, sweet, delicious smell I must have smelled on our patient, and I was soooooo excited and could not stop smelling myself.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I decided to gift my friends, they love it!  </li>
            <li>Love amazing purfume have used this for over ten plus years and get great compliments on it</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good....</li>
            <li>Very classy fragrance and great deal</li>
            <li>The price is terrific and my order arrived incredibly quickly--just about 12 hours from placing it.</li>
            <li>Love this cool smell</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure it is authentic</li>
            <li>It is my super&#x27;s wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong, not too light-- just the way I like.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it :) highly recommend to anyone who loves sweet smells :)</li>
            <li>absolutely love this smells fresh all day , like you just got out of the shower</li>
            <li>It has a light aroma that lasts.</li>
            <li>Then I sprayed it on my wrists, and I thought it smelled like cheap soap.</li>
            <li>I sniffed my wrist and sure enough it was my beloved Wish that I had sprayed at 8am that morning.</li>
            <li>This scent is beautiful and it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mystery why this perfume apparently never \\&quot;caught on\\&quot; and thus is available here for a great price.</li>
            <li>Strong sweet vanilla smell</li>
            <li>A caramelly-vanilla deliscious concoction, it will remind you of something wonderful to eat but is more complex than today&#x27;s sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li>:) the pink wish is very nice as well more flower smell ;)</li>
            <li>It is a nice fragrance, not overwhelming and a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I found this perfume originally on vacation in the caymans years ago and have since lost my original bottle in moving etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One spritz is nice and not too loud for the office, but this could be a special date-night fragrance as well.</li>
            <li>The end result is a comforting sweet bakery scent.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Many people comment on how much they like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>to the sweet side, but not overly sweet, just well balanced.</li>
            <li>Its young and fresh but still sexy!</li>
            <li>I saw that this wasn&#x27;t expensive and bought a couple bottles for Xmas gifts.it smells great but nothing like cashmere.the bottle is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and the bottle is also super cute, the only issue I&#x27;ve had is that the little ring on the top of the cap has come off, but you can put it back in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite positive it smells completely different on everyone and may not be the ideal perfume for some, but at such affordable prices it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>and he put his face right up</li>
            <li>Ordered the brand new product thru Amazon, free shipping and timely shipped.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I place an order and received it today, so I can say it super fast delivery,</li>
            <li>Nice and clean smell, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>First ever purchased Chopard when traveling in Paris.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Wish since 1998 when I bought my first bottle in London.  </li>
            <li>I get many complements every time I wear it, especially from my friends husbands.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>When I first found this perfume I had to get it in Europe at two to three times the price.</li>
            <li>Smells expensive and best for fall/winter.</li>
            <li>packaging was great but the scent does not last as long as i remembered it to</li>
            <li>Wish is a GREAT scent, reminds me a little bit of Angel but nothing near the price!</li>
            <li>Ordered this product previously for myself and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as describe, will purchase from them again very happy with product is so hard to find!!!</li>
            <li>It has a delicate fresh scent that is very appealing as one gets closer to the wearer.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>However, rather than show my immediate displeasure I sprayed a single spray on one wrist to which everyone in the room smelled and responded that it was a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>very well packed protecting the product.</li>
            <li>she wanted it so much that she wanted me to give up my bottle to her ..</li>
            <li>This one really stuck.</li>
            <li>Delicious on a cold</li>
            <li>You can really smell the incense.</li>
            <li>it is unusual, I don&#x27;t see in for sale in dept stores.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no problem at all with color/age/packaging - box was wrapped and perfume is a gorgeous blue color.</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s non-floral, sharp scent.</li>
            <li>I began to smell a more powdery sugary mix of toffee, caramel, vanilla and sandalwood notes, none of which emerged over the other.</li>
            <li>is the original blue liquid</li>
            <li>The smell is light and citrus and sophisticated you only need a little.</li>
            <li>If I new that shipping was almost as much as the cost of this product - I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit floral but really classic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for our daughter and it is a classic scent which she has used for years.</li>
            <li>the color of the perfume in the amazon picture looks very old!</li>
            <li>I have worn this perfume since my freshman year in high school</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it too...not too much heavy...</li>
            <li>I told him I got a new perfume</li>
            <li>I immediately opened the box to spray a bit into the cap only to be hit with a huge patchouli wave that instantly reminded me of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>i had bought my first wish at a duty at the airport when i was going back home..</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Also, the scent does not seem to last as long as the scent of my original perfume.</li>
            <li>This stuff is completely intoxicating.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a tiny bit into the box at first and it smelled very much like Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel, which I am not a huge fan of.</li>
            <li>Now having it worn it nearly every day since Christmas I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate the different notes and character of this scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s haunting and mysterious yet soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>Asked at a store never heard of it, the color is blue not green like the picture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy, subtle scent without being overpowering!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little nervous buying it without having tried it on myself first, so</li>
            <li>I asked 3 friends for their opinions today; one said \\&quot;It smells classic, not old lady\\&quot; and the other two proffered \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; without me even asking leading questions.</li>
            <li>I can smell it when I first put it on and a few minutes later I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume of all time is Casmir by Chopard, and this one is just as wonderful, though different.</li>
            <li> and I love love love Casmir</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> I love how this smells.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love my grandma to pieces, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like her.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not quite sure about it.</li>
            <li> and I want to be able to smell the lovely \\&quot;phase 2\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> Get compliments all the time love the smell</li>
            <li> and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
            <li> Received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I will say that is a problem with many fragrances on me and Angel</li>
            <li> Amazon is the most reliable place I have found to purchase Wish.  </li>
            <li> and you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s apure delight, don&#x27;t know how to explain the scent.</li>
            <li> and I love it when she wears it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> just love it</li>
            <li> and she was very excited.</li>
            <li> Then a bit later, it morphed into the gorgeous, sweet, delicious smell I must have smelled on our patient, and I was soooooo excited and could not stop smelling myself.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I decided to gift my friends, they love it!  </li>
            <li> Love amazing purfume have used this for over ten plus years and get great compliments on it</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good....</li>
            <li> Very classy fragrance and great deal</li>
            <li> The price is terrific and my order arrived incredibly quickly--just about 12 hours from placing it.</li>
            <li> Love this cool smell</li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure it is authentic</li>
            <li> It is my super&#x27;s wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is not too strong, not too light-- just the way I like.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it :) highly recommend to anyone who loves sweet smells :)</li>
            <li> absolutely love this smells fresh all day , like you just got out of the shower</li>
            <li> It has a light aroma that lasts.</li>
            <li> Then I sprayed it on my wrists, and I thought it smelled like cheap soap.</li>
            <li> I sniffed my wrist and sure enough it was my beloved Wish that I had sprayed at 8am that morning.</li>
            <li> This scent is beautiful and it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mystery why this perfume apparently never \\&quot;caught on\\&quot; and thus is available here for a great price.</li>
            <li> Strong sweet vanilla smell</li>
            <li> A caramelly-vanilla deliscious concoction, it will remind you of something wonderful to eat but is more complex than today&#x27;s sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li> :) the pink wish is very nice as well more flower smell ;)</li>
            <li> It is a nice fragrance, not overwhelming and a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I found this perfume originally on vacation in the caymans years ago and have since lost my original bottle in moving etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One spritz is nice and not too loud for the office, but this could be a special date-night fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> The end result is a comforting sweet bakery scent.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Many people comment on how much they like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> to the sweet side, but not overly sweet, just well balanced.</li>
            <li> Its young and fresh but still sexy!</li>
            <li> I saw that this wasn&#x27;t expensive and bought a couple bottles for Xmas gifts.it smells great but nothing like cashmere.the bottle is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious and the bottle is also super cute, the only issue I&#x27;ve had is that the little ring on the top of the cap has come off, but you can put it back in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite positive it smells completely different on everyone and may not be the ideal perfume for some, but at such affordable prices it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> (smile)</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> and he put his face right up</li>
            <li> Ordered the brand new product thru Amazon, free shipping and timely shipped.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I place an order and received it today, so I can say it super fast delivery,</li>
            <li> Nice and clean smell, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> First ever purchased Chopard when traveling in Paris.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Wish since 1998 when I bought my first bottle in London.  </li>
            <li> I get many complements every time I wear it, especially from my friends husbands.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> When I first found this perfume I had to get it in Europe at two to three times the price.</li>
            <li> Smells expensive and best for fall/winter.</li>
            <li> packaging was great but the scent does not last as long as i remembered it to</li>
            <li> Wish is a GREAT scent, reminds me a little bit of Angel but nothing near the price!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product previously for myself and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe, will purchase from them again very happy with product is so hard to find!!!</li>
            <li> It has a delicate fresh scent that is very appealing as one gets closer to the wearer.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> However, rather than show my immediate displeasure I sprayed a single spray on one wrist to which everyone in the room smelled and responded that it was a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> very well packed protecting the product.</li>
            <li> she wanted it so much that she wanted me to give up my bottle to her ..</li>
            <li> This one really stuck.</li>
            <li> Delicious on a cold</li>
            <li> You can really smell the incense.</li>
            <li> it is unusual, I don&#x27;t see in for sale in dept stores.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problem at all with color/age/packaging - box was wrapped and perfume is a gorgeous blue color.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s non-floral, sharp scent.</li>
            <li> I began to smell a more powdery sugary mix of toffee, caramel, vanilla and sandalwood notes, none of which emerged over the other.</li>
            <li> is the original blue liquid</li>
            <li> The smell is light and citrus and sophisticated you only need a little.</li>
            <li> If I new that shipping was almost as much as the cost of this product - I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit floral but really classic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for our daughter and it is a classic scent which she has used for years.</li>
            <li> the color of the perfume in the amazon picture looks very old!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume since my freshman year in high school</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it too...not too much heavy...</li>
            <li> I told him I got a new perfume</li>
            <li> I immediately opened the box to spray a bit into the cap only to be hit with a huge patchouli wave that instantly reminded me of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i had bought my first wish at a duty at the airport when i was going back home..</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Also, the scent does not seem to last as long as the scent of my original perfume.</li>
            <li> This stuff is completely intoxicating.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a tiny bit into the box at first and it smelled very much like Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel, which I am not a huge fan of.</li>
            <li> Now having it worn it nearly every day since Christmas I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate the different notes and character of this scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s haunting and mysterious yet soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> Asked at a store never heard of it, the color is blue not green like the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy, subtle scent without being overpowering!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little nervous buying it without having tried it on myself first, so</li>
            <li> I asked 3 friends for their opinions today; one said \\&quot;It smells classic, not old lady\\&quot; and the other two proffered \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; without me even asking leading questions.</li>
            <li> I can smell it when I first put it on and a few minutes later I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> The scent was as I expected, but the color seems different than the color of the same perfume I got in a cosmetics store a while ago.</li>
            <li> Little too sweet when you first put it on and then changes with body chemistry and becomes subtle and delicate</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of cashmere..</li>
            <li> Not the same as the previous version, fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> A few hours later as the general fruity florals gave way to the dry down notes</li>
            <li> It takes quite cold weather to bring out the true sugary beauty of this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Purchased this larger bottle for my wife at Christmas just after she ran out of the previous bottle.</li>
            <li> and i wouldnt do that.a few minutes later..</li>
            <li> like was mentioned in a few earlier reviews...</li>
            <li> is one of the few that last.  </li>
            <li> I try other perfumes but always return to this one.</li>
            <li> On my skin the patchouli smell died down and began to meld lusciously with my body chemistry and the myriad of floral fruity notes.</li>
            <li> - you cannot go wrong with $20 - you can&#x27;t go to a drug store and get anything decent for that amount of $$</li>
            <li> Lil fruity, little woody...</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m looking for something a little heavier, I use Obsession.  </li>
            <li> bought it a few times already and still one of my all time favorites</li>
            <li> It is just okay,nothing special,and the smell does not last , smells a little fake to me,and you can not return perfume</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that smell changed again a few hours later</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with a dry-down that smells a bit like something my grandma used to wear. :(  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch :/</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my sister did it for me.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it is so expensive and &amp;</li>
            <li> I feel that there are faint musk and oriental undertones.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wish\\&quot;...I became obsessed and knew I had to have it!!</li>
            <li> recommend using coconut oil as a base on your skin</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again, very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Best fragrance ever. First ever purchased Chopard when traveling in Paris.  Happy to have found this on Amazon</li>
            <li> Ordered this product previously for myself and I am very pleased with it.It is authentic. Yesterday, I place an order and received it today, so I can say it super fast delivery, very well packed protecting the product. Obviously, I like this perfume; therefore, I ordered to give this perfume for a friend of mine as a gift. I recommend.</li>
            <li> thank you merry cristmas</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this, I get compliments from both men and women.  I am almost out and hopefully Santa will bring more!</li>
            <li> This smells great.  Not everyone it smells the same on.  I guess its your chemistry.  I love it.  It is my super&#x27;s wife&#x27;s favorite.  I purchased it for a christmas present.</li>
            <li> i had bought my first wish at a duty at the airport when i was going back home..two days later my sister in law is all over me and how nice smelling my room was, my clothes and the air around me..she wanted it so much that she wanted me to give up my bottle to her ..well its a &#x27;gem&#x27; from shape to smell and i wouldnt do that.a few minutes later..i was online,found it on &#x27;amazon&#x27; and three business days later i was giving her a &#x27;wish&#x27;...i have not given anybody a better gift on a better day..its is sensual, woody and has a flair of erotic. Do you have a &#x27;wish&#x27;?</li>
            <li> This scent is beautiful and it lasts a very long time.  I try other perfumes but always return to this one.</li>
            <li> Great quality, fits well.</li>
            <li> The scent was as I expected, but the color seems different than the color of the same perfume I got in a cosmetics store a while ago. Also, the scent does not seem to last as long as the scent of my original perfume. But it&#x27;s a good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I tried so many samples before I bought this eau de parfum. This one really stuck. It is a nice fragrance, not overwhelming and a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> this perfume is so underrated. I love it&#x27;s non-floral, sharp scent. I also love the bottle</li>
            <li> If I new that shipping was almost as much as the cost of this product - I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Unfortunately, my sister did it for me.</li>
            <li> This scent is so sultry. I get compliments on it often. I wear it both day and night, but favorably for night life.</li>
            <li> Good Perfume for the money</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle but a bit too powdery for me. I gave it away as a gift :-)</li>
            <li> Ordered the brand new product thru Amazon, free shipping and timely shipped. It was for my Mother&#x27;s Birthday and she was very excited. I had purchased before in the Bahamas and could not find in the US.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on the scent. Very classy fragrance and great deal</li>
            <li> I like the scent of Wish, but I love Casmir even more! The price cannot be beat for either bottle and the service was great.</li>
            <li> I am purchasing my 3rd bottle and one as a gift!!  I receive SO many compliments on this everytime I wear it!  It&#x27;s a sexy, subtle scent without being overpowering!</li>
            <li> This fragrance will go to the top of my list as a favorite. The smell is light and citrus and sophisticated you only need a little. You will leave a trail of aroma that will have people asking what is that you are wearing. (smile)</li>
            <li> I found this perfume originally on vacation in the caymans years ago and have since lost my original bottle in moving etc.&lt;br /&gt;I went hunting for it recently in some shops around town and they all wanted an arm and a leg for it.&lt;br /&gt;This was a the best price I found online, and sneakily my husband bought it for me and it arrived very quickly on my doorstep two days later in perfect condition and smelling like heaven :)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using coconut oil as a base on your skin (the organic kind that still smells of coconuts) and then spritzing the hair and doing the walk through :)</li>
            <li> I DESPISE people who leave one line reviews for fragrances! When one reads reviews they want to know what the scent smells like! So here goes: Before ever having tested this scent I was enamored of the wonderful variety of notes listed. Imagine my surprise when I was gifted a bottle from my baby brother for Christmas. I immediately opened the box to spray a bit into the cap only to be hit with a huge patchouli wave that instantly reminded me of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;. However, rather than show my immediate displeasure I sprayed a single spray on one wrist to which everyone in the room smelled and responded that it was a lovely scent. On my skin the patchouli smell died down and began to meld lusciously with my body chemistry and the myriad of floral fruity notes. A few hours later as the general fruity florals gave way to the dry down notes I began to smell a more powdery sugary mix of toffee, caramel, vanilla and sandalwood notes, none of which emerged over the other. The end result is a comforting sweet bakery scent. Wonderful! Now having it worn it nearly every day since Christmas I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate the different notes and character of this scent. It takes quite cold weather to bring out the true sugary beauty of this fragrance! I went for a walk by the lake this afternoon in 35F degree temps one afternoon and as I walked I kept getting wafts of the scent of sugar cookies. I sniffed my wrist and sure enough it was my beloved Wish that I had sprayed at 8am that morning. Delicious on a cold day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely understand why this scent has such mixed reviews! I&#x27;m quite positive it smells completely different on everyone and may not be the ideal perfume for some, but at such affordable prices it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I use Wish by Chopard since 1999. It is really a great smell.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Mountain Man</li>
            <li> No surprises.  Was exactly what I was looking for.  Is a gift for my wife.  Smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> Love it, couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore and I love it</li>
            <li> Good price and lovely scented perfume. It has been my favorite for many years and it is nice to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> THis fragrance is SOOOO wonderful....the presentation is appropriate...it truly is a jewel..the fruity woodsy patchouli smell is wonderful!!! LOVE Love</li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and had difficulty finding it --until I thought to check Amazon (not expecting to see it, actually). The price is terrific and my order arrived incredibly quickly--just about 12 hours from placing it. (I didn&#x27;t even select expedited delivery.) I thought there had to be a catch but this is the real deal and a wonderful value for a great perfume. I&#x27;m definitely going to order this again from this seller in future. I&#x27;m so happy to have my favorite scent again.</li>
            <li> One of those interesting type smells.  Little too sweet when you first put it on and then changes with body chemistry and becomes subtle and delicate</li>
            <li> Gift for my gf...she loves it &amp; I love it too...not too much heavy...</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents - and at a great price.  It&#x27;s a bit floral but really classic.  I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our daughter and it is a classic scent which she has used for years. We were very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> Perfume smells good and the bottle design is beautiful.  Would keep the bottle even after the perfume runs out. Price is acceptable.</li>
            <li> Love it. Strong sweet vanilla smell</li>
            <li> Wish is a GREAT scent, reminds me a little bit of Angel but nothing near the price! Angel is so overused now if your looking for something comparable but different, not as in your face, then try this! Its young and fresh but still sexy! Its sweeter than Casmir (which I love too) but still has some of the warm, sexy woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best purchases for the money. It smells gorgeous. Lil fruity, little woody... I had to buy 4!! I liked it so much that I decided to gift my friends, they love it!  It smells like Angel by Thierry M.</li>
            <li> This stuff is completely intoxicating. My favorite perfume of all time is Casmir by Chopard, and this one is just as wonderful, though different. You can really smell the incense. It&#x27;s a coy and alluring scent.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this smells fresh all day , like you just got out of the shower</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Abollutely gorgeous scent. I&#x27;ve used it before and don&#x27;t waat to be out of it at any time. Will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this every time I wear it. Nice and clean smell, not too heavy. Will order this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume although I had never smelled it because it was by Chopard and I love love love Casmir so I figured it would smell good but I was pleasantly surprised! This perfume is awesome. It has a light aroma that lasts. I received several comments about the fragrance after I had been wearing it all day. This is now one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume...I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of cashmere..I saw that this wasn&#x27;t expensive and bought a couple bottles for Xmas gifts.it smells great but nothing like cashmere.the bottle is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Wish since 1998 when I bought my first bottle in London.  I get many complements every time I wear it, especially from my friends husbands.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells. It definatley reminds of Angel but it is actually very cheap. So you can not beat the smell for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this perfume. It smells amazing. However, nobody I know has ever even noticed that I&#x27;m wearing it. I can smell it when I first put it on and a few minutes later I can&#x27;t smell it anymore. I sprayed myself all over with like 10 spritzes once and by the time I got to my boyfriend&#x27;s house, the smell was gone. I told him I got a new perfume and he put his face right up where I sprayed it and he couldn&#x27;t tell that I was wearing anything. Maybe I got a bad batch :/</li>
            <li> shipping got messed up. the product is amazing though.</li>
            <li> Muy buena, recomendada</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful to fix the skin is good I recommend to all women and their husbands&lt;br /&gt;  and boyfriends who presentei and make a woman happy with it!!</li>
            <li> I get compliments whenever I wear this fragrance.  it is unusual, I don&#x27;t see in for sale in dept stores.</li>
            <li> I work in a clinic and walked by a patient one day who happened to be wearing this gorgeous, warm, sweet and rich-smelling perfume. I asked what she had on and she told me \\&quot;Wish\\&quot;...I became obsessed and knew I had to have it!! I&#x27;m a little nervous buying it without having tried it on myself first, so I hope it smells just as good on me as it did on her. I can&#x27;t wait to receive my order!! Bottle looks beautiful too. Hopefully there won&#x27;t be any issues with product color/age like was mentioned in a few earlier reviews...the color of the perfume in the amazon picture looks very old! :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I got my perfume last night. Absolutely no problem at all with color/age/packaging - box was wrapped and perfume is a gorgeous blue color. The bottle is the most beautiful one I&#x27;ve ever owned! The scent is very...transformative. I sprayed a tiny bit into the box at first and it smelled very much like Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel, which I am not a huge fan of. Then I sprayed it on my wrists, and I thought it smelled like cheap soap. Then a bit later, it morphed into the gorgeous, sweet, delicious smell I must have smelled on our patient, and I was soooooo excited and could not stop smelling myself. Unfortunately, that smell changed again a few hours later and I&#x27;m left with a dry-down that smells a bit like something my grandma used to wear. :(  I love my grandma to pieces, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like her. I asked 3 friends for their opinions today; one said \\&quot;It smells classic, not old lady\\&quot; and the other two proffered \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; without me even asking leading questions. So, I&#x27;m not quite sure about it. I think I&#x27;ll wear it this weekend and see what I think. I will probably keep it though, just because the bottle is so gorgeous and I want to be able to smell the lovely \\&quot;phase 2\\&quot; scent. ;)</li>
            <li> Get compliments all the time love the smell</li>
            <li> Love this cool smell and i am looking forward of buying one more</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it :) highly recommend to anyone who loves sweet smells :)</li>
            <li> bought it a few times already and still one of my all time favorites</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Long lasting. Received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good....somewhat like Angel, but doesn&#x27;t last on me or my clothes.  I will say that is a problem with many fragrances on me and Angel is one of the few that last.  I guess that&#x27;s why it is so expensive and &amp;#34;Wish&amp;#34; is not!</li>
            <li> When I first found this perfume I had to get it in Europe at two to three times the price. Amazon is the most reliable place I have found to purchase Wish.  It has a delicate fresh scent that is very appealing as one gets closer to the wearer.  I feel that there are faint musk and oriental undertones.  If I&#x27;m looking for something a little heavier, I use Obsession.  Many people comment on how much they like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> well, just smell it at the department stores or .... and you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s apure delight, don&#x27;t know how to explain the scent. I remembered have smelled it years ago and purchased it for my moms&#x27; birthday. It&#x27;s haunting and mysterious yet soft fragrance. I would recommend it for women from 30 and up.</li>
            <li> Purchased this larger bottle for my wife at Christmas just after she ran out of the previous bottle. Good timing and great gift. She loves it and I love it when she wears it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It smells so good.  I feel great when I have it on.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really good! I like it.</li>
            <li> It is just okay,nothing special,and the smell does not last , smells a little fake to me,and you can not return perfume</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance since purchasing it 15 years ago in Bermuda.  I always get compliments from men and women when I wear it.  Gorgeous bottle and the scent is unlike any others I&#x27;ve tried.  I received my perfume the day after I ordered it and I did not pay for overnight delivery!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Not the same as the previous version, fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long. Would not purchase again, very disappointed. Seems to be either a knock off, or cheaper version</li>
            <li> A wonderful perfume that would work well for both day and night. Long-lasting and not too &amp;#34;intrusive&amp;#34;, even if you overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;More to the sweet side, but not overly sweet, just well balanced. The price is also very good for this perfume. Very happy I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, fun bottle and great price - you cannot go wrong with $20 - you can&#x27;t go to a drug store and get anything decent for that amount of $$</li>
            <li> A caramelly-vanilla deliscious concoction, it will remind you of something wonderful to eat but is more complex than today&#x27;s sweet fragrances.It&#x27;s a mystery why this perfume apparently never \\&quot;caught on\\&quot; and thus is available here for a great price. Smells expensive and best for fall/winter. Reminds me a bit of Angel and Chantilly, if that makes any sense. One spritz is nice and not too loud for the office, but this could be a special date-night fragrance as well. Unique aroma that not everyone is wearing and great value.</li>
            <li> I remember using this fragrance years back and it was divine, I could always smell it on myself. The scent does not last.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and I am pretty sure it is authentic</li>
            <li> packaging was great but the scent does not last as long as i remembered it to</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this scent. It works for both day at the office as well as going out at night.</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe, will purchase from them again very happy with product is so hard to find!!! Asked at a store never heard of it, the color is blue not green like the picture so buy it with confidence is the original blue liquid :) the pink wish is very nice as well more flower smell ;)</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking, I bought it for the bottle! And after it arrived, I kept on looking at it and dangled it from various angles, and only after that I tried it on. And I was just fascinated the by the way it smells on me. It is not too strong, not too light-- just the way I like. I keep on sniffing myself when I put it on. I loove Wish by Chopard. It has captured my wishes in a bottle!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume. I have been wearing it for years. I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love amazing purfume have used this for over ten plus years and get great compliments on it</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume since my freshman year in high school and I absolutely love it.  I always get compliments on the scent.  It smells delicious and the bottle is also super cute, the only issue I&#x27;ve had is that the little ring on the top of the cap has come off, but you can put it back in place.  Buying this on amazon is a steal because in stores it costs $60+.  Love this!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they loved it!  Great price!  Every time I wear this I get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> love it...just love it</li>
