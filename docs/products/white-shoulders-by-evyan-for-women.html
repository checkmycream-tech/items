            <li>i own this perfume and this is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>The first is acrid chemical smells more on the line of fly spray.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purpose.</li>

            <li>My mother really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of the perfume</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, no one can get the top off, yes the shiny one you see in the&lt;br /&gt;image provided.</li>
            <li>Others tried to get the top off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top is NOT secure.&lt;br /&gt;Third, this stuff has NO APPEAL</li>
            <li>Simply the best perfume!  </li>
            <li>What could be better than that?  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too.</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS COLOGNE.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always love the way it smell.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, beautiful smell, and I&#x27;m using it every day.  </li>
            <li>how long it has been around tells you how good it is!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is getting harder to find in store and the price was awesome.</li>

            <li>however is so strong smelling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be fine when Amazon mailed it to me</li>
            <li>it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>More suitable for older women.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use it especially at this great price.</li>
            <li>$16.00 and free shipping.</li>
            <li>She wore it for a reason and it&#x27;s still available for a reason.  </li>
            <li>They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product.</li>
            <li>arrived on time -- great price for White Shoulders</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; lovely..resonably priced.</li>
            <li>always great present for my mother who has worn this for years its her signature perfume - it never goes out of style.</li>
            <li>The original version arrived as promised and will continue to evoke memories for all of us in the family since this is my 80-year-old mother&#x27;s signature scent.</li>
            <li>If only everyone smelled as nicely!</li>
            <li>or someone at the nursing home threw away the original box.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find a logical source on line.  </li>
            <li>This little gift came nicely packaged, right on time and brought joy to my friend.</li>
            <li>The bottle delivered to my doorstep by a human (not drone) lived up to its old wonderful image.</li>
            <li>I have always loved White Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I used to wear White Shoulders all the time and loved the fragrance</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most fragrances, but have always been able to wear White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I love White Shoulders; it&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I wore this long ago and loved it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using White Shoulders for almost 50 years, and I still love it!  </li>
            <li>The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>This is a great price on a fragrance that was a classic long before I started wearing it 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>This is the only cologne I have worn for years and the price is right LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li>Living in the South, I am known by my grandchildren&#x27;s friend as the grandmother that smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>Always an old time favorite..</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would need to smell the cologne right away in case they sent one that was rancid.  </li>
            <li>This has always been the perfume my husband likes me to wear and he also said it doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>, so perhaps I&#x27;m not in the right age bracket...</li>
            <li>I love White Shoulders &amp; am very grateful that I can easily get it through Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Ordered this bottle of White Shoulders for a female friend of mine that because of her illness, doesn&#x27;t get a lot of joy out of life.</li>
            <li>because I have long natural fingernails, I was able to get my&lt;br /&gt;fingernails underneath the edges of that pretty shiny top, and wiggle it&lt;</li>
            <li>However if one was to use an alluring scent there can be nothing better than a classically proven one.  </li>
            <li>White Shoulders continues to be my favorite</li>
            <li>My mother in law introduced me to White Shoulders many years ago.</li>
            <li>I FIRST STARTED BUYING &amp; WEARING &amp;</li>
            <li>got exactly when I was suppose to get too.</li>
            <li>but I love the initial scent and the price!</li>
            <li>I love White Shoulders!</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will most likely give it to my grandma.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the only one I wear because I have a problem with most perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I love how it smells, clean, and flowery,  but it is a little too grandma smelling for me</li>
            <li>A gift for a lovely lady, this White Shoulders By Evyan For Women, Eau De Cologne Spray (4.5 Ounces), was a little better than average in her honest opinion, and she enjoyed wearing it on several occasions.</li>
            <li>White Shoulders scent is not too strong like some floral scents can be.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a very Feminine scent.</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>the bottle i purchased from this seller lasted absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>Very feminine</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I buy this perfume every year for my Grandma, and she always tells me I spend too much on her.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I first started wearing it at age 14 when my father gave it to me as a Christmas present, and I instantly fell in love with this sweet, romantic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops.</li>
            <li>only wish that I could find a great price on White Shoulders perfume (only the cologne was available), as the fragrance is slightly different and longer lasting.</li>
            <li>Get tons of compliments on the fragrance, oddly, from more men than women.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this classic perfume for my mom who requested it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It was a gift to a woman who has wore this particular brand and scent for over 55 years....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems highly suspect and hypocritical on your part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SHOULDERS&amp;#34; WHEN A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL</li>
            <li>Love this scent and was having a hard time finding it, thanks, Amazon!  </li>
            <li>The second (including White Shoulders) is natural scents in this case more in the line of flowers.</li>
            <li>It was delivered safely in bubble wrap in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I wondered if this was a very old bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing White Shoulders since my first year in College.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume, hard to find anymore in stores.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for such a large selection of items &amp; thanks a bundle for selling White Shoulders by Evyan.</li>
            <li>This is an old fashioned scent and is the only one my husband wants me to wear.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells old or spoiled.  </li>
            <li>A soft, not overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li>I having been buying and giving this to my wife for 28 years so far.</li>
            <li>but I have been using this perfume since I was 16 yrs old and am now 65 years young.  </li>
            <li>Its a scent that a classy lady would wear.</li>
            <li>And will continue to so as long as the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li>I have used White Shoulders since I was 16 years old and hope to be using it when I am 106 years old!!!</li>
            <li>Stays with you for a very long time and has such a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>You an get a large bottle for the same price as a smaller one in the stores.</li>
            <li>For mature people it brings back memories; for the young it creates them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn White Shoulders also since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>White Shoulders&#x27; scent is soft, floral, and not at all overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Not a new fragrance but a timeless classic to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry, but &#x27;White Shoulders&#x27; perfume has to be THE most rancid-smelling fragrance that I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  </li>
            <li>Now I find I am unable to send it back because it is potentially hazardous or flammable.  </li>
            <li>With the plethora of scents reinventing them selves each year, this is one of the few that are immediately recognizable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the White Shoulders by Evyan as I have used it for years and have not found any other perfum that suit me like the White Shoulder</li>

            <li> The price is great, and I got free shipping when ordering another product with this one.  </li>
            <li> Great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> I loved it then and love it now.</li>
            <li> A nice floral feminine scent.</li>
            <li> I feel that this purchase was a good deal, and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my choice of scent.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders has attractive package and bottle and pleasant smell is great for gifts also</li>
            <li> i own this perfume and this is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> The first is acrid chemical smells more on the line of fly spray.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purpose.</li>
            <li> I guess I better check everything as soon as I get it.</li>
            <li> My mother really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of the perfume</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, no one can get the top off, yes the shiny one you see in the&lt;br /&gt;image provided.</li>
            <li> Others tried to get the top off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top is NOT secure.&lt;br /&gt;Third, this stuff has NO APPEAL</li>
            <li> Simply the best perfume!  </li>
            <li> What could be better than that?  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too.</li>
            <li> HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS COLOGNE.  </li>
            <li> No problems receiving my favorite fragrance, and I didn&#x27;t have to drive to the mall to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for my wife for over 46 years, and it is still her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> We both love this perfume,  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> is her favorite perfume</li>
            <li> and she was touched that I had remembered it after so many years.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite all time scent.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Flower aromas are my favorite for my lady to wear.</li>
            <li> I love jasmine.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne; have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> My wife has purchased and used this product for over 30 years and it still remains one of my favorite colognes she uses.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for more years than I&#x27;ll admit to.</li>
            <li> WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE FOR A PRECIOUS LADY AT CHURCH.  </li>

            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>

            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Price was fabulous!  </li>
            <li> This is her favorite scent, and I have been buying it for her for Christmas since I started getting an allowance.</li>

            <li> Great price, fast delivery,</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t cause me allergies</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;-type perfume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love the way it smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, beautiful smell, and I&#x27;m using it every day.  </li>
            <li> how long it has been around tells you how good it is!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is getting harder to find in store and the price was awesome.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells better than just clean.  </li>
            <li> however is so strong smelling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be fine when Amazon mailed it to me</li>
            <li> it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> More suitable for older women.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use it especially at this great price.</li>
            <li> $16.00 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> She wore it for a reason and it&#x27;s still available for a reason.  </li>
            <li> They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product.</li>
            <li> arrived on time -- great price for White Shoulders</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light &amp; lovely..resonably priced.</li>
            <li> always great present for my mother who has worn this for years its her signature perfume - it never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> The original version arrived as promised and will continue to evoke memories for all of us in the family since this is my 80-year-old mother&#x27;s signature scent.</li>
            <li> If only everyone smelled as nicely!</li>
            <li> or someone at the nursing home threw away the original box.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find a logical source on line.  </li>
            <li> This little gift came nicely packaged, right on time and brought joy to my friend.</li>
            <li> The bottle delivered to my doorstep by a human (not drone) lived up to its old wonderful image.</li>
            <li> I have always loved White Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I used to wear White Shoulders all the time and loved the fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most fragrances, but have always been able to wear White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders; it&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I wore this long ago and loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using White Shoulders for almost 50 years, and I still love it!  </li>
            <li> The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a great price on a fragrance that was a classic long before I started wearing it 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I have worn for years and the price is right LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> Living in the South, I am known by my grandchildren&#x27;s friend as the grandmother that smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> Always an old time favorite..</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would need to smell the cologne right away in case they sent one that was rancid.  </li>
            <li> This has always been the perfume my husband likes me to wear and he also said it doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> , so perhaps I&#x27;m not in the right age bracket...</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders &amp; am very grateful that I can easily get it through Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Ordered this bottle of White Shoulders for a female friend of mine that because of her illness, doesn&#x27;t get a lot of joy out of life.</li>
            <li> because I have long natural fingernails, I was able to get my&lt;br /&gt;fingernails underneath the edges of that pretty shiny top, and wiggle it&lt;</li>
            <li> However if one was to use an alluring scent there can be nothing better than a classically proven one.  </li>
            <li> White Shoulders continues to be my favorite</li>
            <li> My mother in law introduced me to White Shoulders many years ago.</li>
            <li> I FIRST STARTED BUYING &amp; WEARING &amp;</li>
            <li> got exactly when I was suppose to get too.</li>
            <li> but I love the initial scent and the price!</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will most likely give it to my grandma.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only one I wear because I have a problem with most perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I love how it smells, clean, and flowery,  but it is a little too grandma smelling for me</li>
            <li> A gift for a lovely lady, this White Shoulders By Evyan For Women, Eau De Cologne Spray (4.5 Ounces), was a little better than average in her honest opinion, and she enjoyed wearing it on several occasions.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders scent is not too strong like some floral scents can be.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a very Feminine scent.</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> the bottle i purchased from this seller lasted absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Very feminine</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume every year for my Grandma, and she always tells me I spend too much on her.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I first started wearing it at age 14 when my father gave it to me as a Christmas present, and I instantly fell in love with this sweet, romantic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops.</li>
            <li> only wish that I could find a great price on White Shoulders perfume (only the cologne was available), as the fragrance is slightly different and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Get tons of compliments on the fragrance, oddly, from more men than women.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this classic perfume for my mom who requested it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to a woman who has wore this particular brand and scent for over 55 years....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems highly suspect and hypocritical on your part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SHOULDERS&amp;#34; WHEN A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL</li>
            <li> Love this scent and was having a hard time finding it, thanks, Amazon!  </li>
            <li> The second (including White Shoulders) is natural scents in this case more in the line of flowers.</li>
            <li> It was delivered safely in bubble wrap in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I wondered if this was a very old bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing White Shoulders since my first year in College.  </li>
            <li> Love this perfume, hard to find anymore in stores.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for such a large selection of items &amp; thanks a bundle for selling White Shoulders by Evyan.</li>
            <li> This is an old fashioned scent and is the only one my husband wants me to wear.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells old or spoiled.  </li>
            <li> A soft, not overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I having been buying and giving this to my wife for 28 years so far.</li>
            <li> but I have been using this perfume since I was 16 yrs old and am now 65 years young.  </li>
            <li> Its a scent that a classy lady would wear.</li>
            <li> And will continue to so as long as the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> I have used White Shoulders since I was 16 years old and hope to be using it when I am 106 years old!!!</li>
            <li> Stays with you for a very long time and has such a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> You an get a large bottle for the same price as a smaller one in the stores.</li>
            <li> For mature people it brings back memories; for the young it creates them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn White Shoulders also since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders&#x27; scent is soft, floral, and not at all overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Not a new fragrance but a timeless classic to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but &#x27;White Shoulders&#x27; perfume has to be THE most rancid-smelling fragrance that I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  </li>
            <li> Now I find I am unable to send it back because it is potentially hazardous or flammable.  </li>
            <li> With the plethora of scents reinventing them selves each year, this is one of the few that are immediately recognizable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the White Shoulders by Evyan as I have used it for years and have not found any other perfum that suit me like the White Shoulder</li>
            <li> However perfume will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> the scent is so feminine and it last long.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box</li>
            <li> There should be expiration dates on these products as this one must have expired a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to wait a long period of time.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as some perfumes</li>
            <li> It goes very well with kissing if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> container is small enough and the essence is concentrated enough that you can transport it with you and use it when the time comes.  </li>
            <li> I paid half of what I would at a local store and didn&#x27;t have the sales</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not at all like the White Shoulders items I have previously bought for my wife</li>
            <li> way more expensive in stores and hard to find anywhere!</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t open the package for a week, I am past the \\&quot;time limit\\&quot; to get a refund.</li>
            <li> Extremely feminine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sour and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> just took a hit on this purchase and it is not at all of the quality of items I have previously bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it for everyday and everyday</li>
            <li> Acrid, harsh, with no staying power.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding it in town and when I did it was half the size for twice the price.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I have thrown $21 down the drain and will do my shopping for cologne elsewhere.</li>
            <li> However as I recently opened the bottle, I found that the scent was unpleasant and not at all as I expected.  </li>
            <li> the past I have given this scent (purchased elsewhere)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her usual perfume.</li>
            <li> Not sure what a majority of women smell in this so-called &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; perfume, but it&#x27;s just not my cup of tea at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> /&gt;YOU GET A BLACK EYE FOR BEING WHAT YOU ARE-DECEPTIVE IN EVERY WAY!!</li>
            <li> , arthritis makes the push button hard to use.</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to find.  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s dangerous for me to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Wherever I go people always ask what I am wearing because it has a very delicate scent, not the least bit overpowering, and they know that it has been around for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Its really hard to find this day and time!</li>
            <li> and I knew Christmas was going to be tough for her.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A nostalgic purchase.</li>
            <li> This is one perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume, it smells like a lilac bush, and it is not overwhelming!!!!</li>
            <li> so I was shocked to find that the cologne I purchased is rancid - it smells like chemicals (and not good Ones).  </li>
            <li> I hate to admit it</li>
            <li> product has a very bad and peculiar odor.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do t even know what this smells like. It was a gift to a friend which this is what they like. It was however the only place I could Fi d it!</li>
            <li> I really like the White Shoulders by Evyan as I have used it for years and have not found any other perfum that suit me like the White Shoulder</li>
            <li> Perfect from each point...</li>
            <li> I remember using this as a teenager. I loved it then and love it now. A nice floral feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells better than just clean.  However if one was to use an alluring scent there can be nothing better than a classically proven one.  With the plethora of scents reinventing them selves each year, this is one of the few that are immediately recognizable.  For mature people it brings back memories; for the young it creates them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is small enough and the essence is concentrated enough that you can transport it with you and use it when the time comes.  However perfume will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Also there are two camps with it comes to perfume.  The first is acrid chemical smells more on the line of fly spray.  The second (including White Shoulders) is natural scents in this case more in the line of flowers.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purpose.</li>
            <li> I found this cologne that I wore for years at Amazon.com Its really hard to find this day and time! Living in the South, I am known by my grandchildren&#x27;s friend as the grandmother that smells so fresh. White Shoulders scent is not too strong like some floral scents can be. Thank goodness for Amazon.com. I always buy books there but have never thought of buying perfume. Thank you Amazon for such a large selection of items &amp; thanks a bundle for selling White Shoulders by Evyan.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders continues to be my favorite and I give it five stars!!!</li>
            <li> I never did recieve this purchase. I got in touch with Amazon which sent me to the company. They told me it was sent to my town and told me to canvace the neighbors to see if any bof them got it. Do you think any of them would tell me? It was droped at that.I would not recommened ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have always trusted Amazon to send me the best products so I was shocked to find that the cologne I purchased is rancid - it smells like chemicals (and not good Ones).  There should be expiration dates on these products as this one must have expired a long time ago.  Now I find I am unable to send it back because it is potentially hazardous or flammable.  It seemed to be fine when Amazon mailed it to me but now it&#x27;s dangerous for me to send it back.  Since I didn&#x27;t open the package for a week, I am past the \\&quot;time limit\\&quot; to get a refund. I never thought that I would need to smell the cologne right away in case they sent one that was rancid.  I guess I better check everything as soon as I get it. In the mean time I have thrown $21 down the drain and will do my shopping for cologne elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered the White Shoulders for my mother for Christmas. It was delivered safely in bubble wrap in just a few days. She was very pleased with her gift.</li>
            <li> My wife loves White Shoulders!</li>
            <li> My mother really enjoyed this product.  It is something she continually uses.  This was at a very good price and came in excellent shape; no broken bottle and I didn&#x27;t have to wait a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the perfume</li>
            <li> The best cologne because I always get compliments</li>
            <li> She loves it!!  That is all that counts</li>
            <li> This is my mother&#x27;s perfume ..... and I will always remember her scent. I&#x27;ve worn White Shoulders also since my early 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m also a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; 40-some years later.</li>
            <li> This is a great price on a fragrance that was a classic long before I started wearing it 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> Ordered this classic perfume for my mom who requested it for Christmas. Only upon ordering did I realize there are two manufacturers of White Shoulders. The original version arrived as promised and will continue to evoke memories for all of us in the family since this is my 80-year-old mother&#x27;s signature scent. If only everyone smelled as nicely!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mother-In-Law; this is the ONLY perfume she&#x27;ll wear. She absolutely loves the smell of it. Arrived on time and in perfect condition and most of all...she&#x27;s happy lol</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for well over 25 years and never had one where the scent is gone&lt;br /&gt;almost the moment you apply it. Perhaps they have changed their formula - but if my next&lt;br /&gt;bottle is the same then I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. Why bother!</li>
            <li> Also purchased at the same time for my Mom......100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> A nostalgic purchase. Didn&#x27;t know she had another stashed in her bureau drawer.</li>
            <li> The scent smells old or spoiled.  This has always been the perfume my husband likes me to wear and he also said it doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years.  It was a great price and I still LOVE it!  Get tons of compliments on the fragrance, oddly, from more men than women.  Will continue to use it especially at this great price. $16.00 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years. It was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I had this sent to my mother who is in a nursing home.&lt;br /&gt;First, no one can get the top off, yes the shiny one you see in the&lt;br /&gt;image provided. My mother has arthritis. When I went to visit her&lt;br /&gt;I pushed, pulled, everything. Others tried to get the top off.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, because I have long natural fingernails, I was able to get my&lt;br /&gt;fingernails underneath the edges of that pretty shiny top, and wiggle it&lt;br /&gt;back and forth until it finally came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it leaks everywhere. The top is NOT secure.&lt;br /&gt;Third, this stuff has NO APPEAL whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;and from what I read here on line, I&#x27;m NOT the only one who can&#x27;t stand&lt;br /&gt;the smell of this junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m the last to know. I definitely feel suckered in.&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine your company laughing like hell, about now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, and this can&#x27;t be shipped back because it is considered&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;FLAMMABLE\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is it your company  can send it to me in the mail, and it&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;considered flammable AT THE TIME YOU MAILED IT????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems highly suspect and hypocritical on your part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom or someone at the nursing home threw away the original box. So I can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking to send it to whomever the CEO is, of Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps when they get a load of this, they will see why there are so many&lt;br /&gt;UNSATISFIED customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET A BLACK EYE FOR BEING WHAT YOU ARE-DECEPTIVE IN EVERY WAY!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using White Shoulders for almost 50 years, and I still love it!  I wish I could get the splash instead of the spray, arthritis makes the push button hard to use.</li>
            <li> My perfume for 50 years.  That says it all.</li>
            <li> Simply the best perfume!  I use it for everyday and everyday I get a compliment!  What could be better than that?  I have used White Shoulders since I was 16 years old and hope to be using it when I am 106 years old!!!</li>
            <li> My mother in law introduced me to White Shoulders many years ago. It doesn&#x27;t sour and lasts all day.  I have had a hard time finding it in town and when I did it was half the size for twice the price.</li>
            <li> My mom wore White Shoulders when I was growing up and I swore I would never wear that perfume.  Well, guess what?  She wore it for a reason and it&#x27;s still available for a reason.  It&#x27;s just timeless and smells good every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> i own this perfume and this is one of my favorite. if you like a flowery scent, then this one is for you. it kinda smells like jasmine or ylang-ylang. the scent is so feminine and it last long.</li>
            <li> My mother used this for years and years.  I haven&#x27;t used it in over 25 years myself; but thought I would give it another go.  I am pleased with the results.  And the price was very good.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as some perfumes but I like that..it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I have worn for years and the price is right LOVE IT! great service and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have always loved White Shoulders. A soft, not overpowering fragrance. A wonderful product for a great price!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the White Shoulders product your mother/grandmother used. The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting. Evyan went out of business in the 80&#x27;s I believe, and the name White Shoulders was bought by Elizabeth Arden (EA Fragrances) and Perfumes Intl. They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product. Acrid, harsh, with no staying power. Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed. Learn from my experience. I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops. There is also powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you see the cursive Evyan signature, a cursive &#x27;E&#x27;, or the trademark phrase &#x27;The Best the World Has to Offer&#x27;. You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box w/cellophane with a $15 price sticker. Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too. There&#x27;s even a market for empties, which I used to just stick in my dresser drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders. Looks like the Goodwill box for them!</li>
            <li> I FIRST STARTED BUYING &amp; WEARING &amp;#34;WHITE SHOULDERS&amp;#34; WHEN A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL &amp; I GRADUATED IN 1951, SO THAT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS COLOGNE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROMPT SERVICE.  BETTYE JENSEN</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a life-long White Shoulders wearer.  She loved it and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> No problems receiving my favorite fragrance, and I didn&#x27;t have to drive to the mall to buy it.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product, great price, thanks</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s nice, clean, and fresh. I feel that this purchase was a good deal, and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my choice of scent.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before ordering this.  Some said it was &amp;#34;not the same&amp;#34; others said it was &amp;#34;right on.&amp;#34;  The bottle delivered to my doorstep by a human (not drone) lived up to its old wonderful image.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this daily.I din&#x27;t think I would like it but it smells amazing! I would get this again for her.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my nose or the nose of the person next to me</li>
            <li> A gift for a lovely lady, this White Shoulders By Evyan For Women, Eau De Cologne Spray (4.5 Ounces), was a little better than average in her honest opinion, and she enjoyed wearing it on several occasions. Very good bargain price, may I add. 3.5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, hard to find anymore in stores.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Thank you....</li>
            <li> I having been buying and giving this to my wife for 28 years so far. I never let her run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a gift to myself it smells so great.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and the person has always loved this ,so it was a no brainer got exactly when I was suppose to get too.</li>
            <li> Marvelous, fragrance, and what a deal on the price! It will last a long time. Just one spray and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most fragrances, but have always been able to wear White Shoulders.  The price is great, and I got free shipping when ordering another product with this one.  I paid half of what I would at a local store and didn&#x27;t have the sales tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that I could find a great price on White Shoulders perfume (only the cologne was available), as the fragrance is slightly different and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> I have used White Shoulders for years and overpaying for it as well.  Will continure to use it</li>
            <li> Xmas gift and she was running low!!!! Can&#x27;t have that!!! way more expensive in stores and hard to find anywhere!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for my wife for over 46 years, and it is still her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> arrived on time -- great price for White Shoulders</li>
            <li> I used to wear White Shoulders all the time and loved the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;This however is so strong smelling I wouldn&#x27;t think of wearing it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take a loss on this one and throw it out</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a very Feminine scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is one perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume, it smells like a lilac bush, and it is not overwhelming!!!!</li>
            <li> Always an old time favorite..I have asthma &amp; I don&#x27;t know Y.it never has bothered me. It&#x27;s light &amp; lovely..resonably priced.</li>
            <li> Best cologne.  Been using it for more than 50 YEARS!</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this, reminds me of my grandma!  Which I now am!</li>
            <li> This is a scent that my Wife has worn for years.  I was pleased to find a logical source on line.  The product is good, the pricing was logical and the service was very good.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift and it sucked. I was so embarrassed after gifting this.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have given this scent (purchased elsewhere) and it smells very nice. very clean.&lt;br /&gt;but the bottle i purchased from this seller lasted absolutely NOTHING. almost disappeared as soon as my friend sprayed it on.&lt;br /&gt;Buy elsewhere!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this bottle of White Shoulders for a female friend of mine that because of her illness, doesn&#x27;t get a lot of joy out of life. This little gift came nicely packaged, right on time and brought joy to my friend. This perfume has been worn by the women in her family now for three generations.</li>
            <li> I have been using White Shoulders since I was 20 and now I am 76 so you can see that it is a MUST in my life.  Wherever I go people always ask what I am wearing because it has a very delicate scent, not the least bit overpowering, and they know that it has been around for quite some time.  It is something that I must have on my bathroom shelf always.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my sister&#x27;s birthday.  We both love this perfume,  I hate to admit it but I have been using this perfume since I was 16 yrs old and am now 65 years young.  I worked at a hospital for over 36 yrs, and each and every day a patient commented on the light wonderful smell of this perfume...</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s Christmas present</li>
            <li> Have used for years and I love it</li>
            <li> Really good bargain price. Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> I sent it to my girlfriend who had lost her husband this year and I knew Christmas was going to be tough for her.&lt;br /&gt;This is her favorite perfume and she was touched that I had remembered it after so many years.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s only perfume.  I love it.  It goes very well with kissing if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Product great, Shipping and handling good too.</li>
            <li> My favorite all time scent. Arrived on time and was packed great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing White Shoulders since my first year in College.  That was 1971.  It&#x27;s pretty much the only one I wear because I have a problem with most perfumes.  They give me a headache and often a sore throat.  White Shoulders&#x27; scent is soft, floral, and not at all overbearing.  It may be ancient, but it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite. Anything that reminds my of her... is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It is getting harder to find in store and the price was awesome.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. I&#x27;ve worn it for years. I get many compliments on it. It&#x27;s a white flower blend.</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders &amp; am very grateful that I can easily get it through Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Flower aromas are my favorite for my lady to wear. I love jasmine. I also now have 3 night blooming jasmines around my house.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> best price for the size and have been using it for 30 years - my husband loves the smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne; have been using this for years. Very feminine and I just love it. The only one I buy.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my wife for christmas. My wife has purchased and used this product for over 30 years and it still remains one of my favorite colognes she uses. I would recomend you give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Out of this world. I don&#x27;t think the scent lasts but I love the initial scent and the price!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for more years than I&#x27;ll admit to.</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders! It is a wonderful, light frangrance that is not overpowering. It is also the only Cologne that I am not allergic to - big plus!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.  WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE FOR A PRECIOUS LADY AT CHURCH.  THANKS</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume every year for my Grandma, and she always tells me I spend too much on her. Not now with Amazon&#x27;s prices! Nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments for this fragrance and the price was amazing!! Thanks Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Good job!  What more can I say.  My wife loved it.  May the Lord bless and keep you.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne that I wore many years ago, but somehow forgot about.  It&#x27;s a soft, beautiful smell, and I&#x27;m using it every day.  I gave it to my daughters for Christmas, had already given it to my granddaughters for their birthday.  So now it&#x27;s the family cologne - we call it our &amp;#34;Happy Perfume&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent and was having a hard time finding it, thanks, Amazon!  This is an old fashioned scent and is the only one my husband wants me to wear.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s mom. It&#x27;s her usual perfume. It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted. The price was fair. It arrived on time. We&#x27;ll probably order it again for her every Christmas.</li>
            <li> always great present for my mother who has worn this for years its her signature perfume - it never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> My perfume since I was in college has been White Shoulders--it&#x27;s my signature scent even though it is \\&quot;out-dated\\&quot; according to my daughter!  It&#x27;s me!</li>
            <li> Smells so lovely!  Price was fabulous!  Packaged well and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> again...... 1/2 the cost from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I wore this long ago and loved it and I still do. A light wonderful perfume for day or night. Extremely feminine. Not a new fragrance but a timeless classic to me.</li>
            <li> Stays with you for a very long time and has such a fresh smell. It was a gift to a woman who has wore this particular brand and scent for over 55 years....how long it has been around tells you how good it is!!</li>
            <li> Quite the cologne, smells great without overpowering. White Shoulders has attractive package and bottle and pleasant smell is great for gifts also</li>
            <li> This scent always makes me think of my mom.  This is her favorite scent, and I have been buying it for her for Christmas since I started getting an allowance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product arrived in great shape wonderful price for the size of bottle used this years ago n when I saw it I had to have it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it cheaper any place.</li>
            <li> It was bough as a gift.</li>
            <li> it got here ok everything ok well pleased</li>
            <li> This is a great not overpowering scent. Price is awesome as well. Its a scent that a classy lady would wear.</li>
            <li> This is my perfume! When I saw the great price an I ordered it. And will continue to so as long as the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LRISLU Evyan White Shoulders By Evyan - Eau De Cologne Spray - 4.5 fl. oz., 4.5 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very bad and peculiar odor.&lt;br /&gt;It is not at all like the White Shoulders items I have previously bought for my wife&lt;br /&gt;I checked the return information and it can not be sent back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I just took a hit on this purchase and it is not at all of the quality of items I have previously bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Wonderful perfume</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, not an intrusive statement.  Just lovely stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery,</li>
            <li> I love White Shoulders; it&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.  I first started wearing it at age 14 when my father gave it to me as a Christmas present, and I instantly fell in love with this sweet, romantic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great buy compared to the prices in the store. You an get a large bottle for the same price as a smaller one in the stores.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t cause me allergies</li>
            <li> I love how it smells, clean, and flowery,  but it is a little too grandma smelling for me, I&#x27;m 17. I will most likely give it to my grandma. Nonetheless it smells good.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li> Gift for mom and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Came intact and sealed box. Huge bottle and smells great!</li>
            <li> My mother inlaw loved this. thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but &#x27;White Shoulders&#x27; perfume has to be THE most rancid-smelling fragrance that I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  I literally gagged upon smelling this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 23, so perhaps I&#x27;m not in the right age bracket...it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;-type perfume.  More suitable for older women.  Not sure what a majority of women smell in this so-called &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; perfume, but it&#x27;s just not my cup of tea at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love the way it smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent and I find it hard to find.  I found it on Amazon and was delighted.  However as I recently opened the bottle, I found that the scent was unpleasant and not at all as I expected.  Friends even commented on it and reluctantly, I stopped using it.  I have never had this happen before, so I wondered if this was a very old bottle.  Now I&#x27;m in the same spot:  No White Shoulders to wear.</li>
