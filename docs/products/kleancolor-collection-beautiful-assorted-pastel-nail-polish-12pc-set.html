            <li>Honestly, you just need one coat.</li>
            <li>grand daughter  loved this.</li>
            <li>So cute and good quality</li>
            <li>I honestly would&#x27;ve bought a name brand polish like china glaze or opi rather than this.</li>

            <li>omg it worked totally bold and beautiful</li>
            <li>Perfect for new nail techs in need of affordable polish options.</li>
            <li>Great colors and lots of fun.  </li>
            <li>love the colors but chips very easy.</li>
            <li>So I contacted the sellers and they replied very quickly and kindly.</li>
            <li>I have ordered kleancolor before and love using it for stamping nail art.</li>
            <li>Just lovely set, and everyone should get it for themselves.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 12 and changes her nail color like most people change underwear.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love the colors</li>
            <li>so I can keep touching it up during the day.  </li>
            <li>When my package arrived I was real happy to see they took extra care to bubblewrap the bottles in the boxes.</li>
            <li>Four coats for a OK look.</li>
            <li>I love the pastel colors but</li>
            <li>Love...</li>
            <li>Glad to have pastel colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this brand one more chance, but after that, I&#x27;m removing everything</li>
            <li>I especially love the blue, Nude &amp; purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color accuracy:&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can see from the photo most colors are just l;ike the picture displayed</li>
            <li>Plus i got a bonus color :)</li>
            <li>So my lovely husband got me these as a gift</li>
            <li>Some are cute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having for the ladies at work, so I figured I&#x27;d better try them out.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love my polishes.</li>
            <li>i thought they were more for spring</li>
            <li>I love the colors.  </li>
            <li>My Favorite color they included would have to be the pastel purple</li>
            <li>it got to my house in 3 1/2 days, considering that the shipping is free!</li>
            <li>Thank you Kleancolor :)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, will purchase more!!</li>
            <li>They were not loud colors,  the pastels were perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost all the colors are opaque &amp; rich in color!</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick ( took about 4  days), and they were packed nicely.</li>
            <li>My problem with most nail polish is that it falls off way to easily (and I buy Opi, and Sally Hanson exc.),</li>
            <li>colors are nice, price is right</li>
            <li>The colors are light, but they go on just fine, and give off a lovely color/sheen to them.</li>
            <li>Some are too see through and you need to put more on, but overall the colors look great</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly &amp; chips easily.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful but you have to put multiple coats on.</li>
            <li>I was very delighted to see that all the colors were accounted for but the orange looked a lot like the pink.</li>
            <li>Huge flakes just pop off, and I sit a a desk all day.</li>
            <li>So many fun designs to make with these.</li>
            <li>Packaging came in a secure .</li>
            <li>/&gt;They came fast &amp; were shipped nicely.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any chipping yet [have had some colors on for only a day though].</li>
            <li>it looks like cheap paint on nails.  </li>
            <li>Nice colors they stay on very well</li>
            <li>I also did not get the free nail file gift that came with it</li>
            <li>The colors are fabulous.</li>
            <li>the cover-ups I purchased are almost all light summery shades.  </li>
            <li>Too cheap.</li>
            <li>Just to give you an idea of how cheap these polishes are....</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t paint well in 2 coats and it just looks cheap.</li>
            <li>I suppose this would be a good gift for a teenager or someone who frequently switches colors, etc.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find that most of the colors have a matching sheer color included in the set.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are pretty and the bottle shape is cute.</li>
            <li>ordered from Eye Candy, they filled my order quickly and resolved an issue I had with one of the bottles.</li>
            <li>color peels off super easy, lucky if it lasts a day</li>
            <li>but all of the other colors look just like in the picture and are good quality too :)</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is the color brown they give you which looks lik a nude color.</li>
            <li>Everything was fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Love the quality, but not in love with the pinks (seem like the same shade over and over).</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>, I got exactly the colors that I see in the picture, I recently tried the colors and they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Same as the Kleancolor matte glitter collection, love the colors!</li>
            <li>Even with a top clear coat!</li>
            <li>My nails look so pretty!</li>
            <li>so I thought the light colors would be best for her for a christmas gift to my sister as my sister is the only one that knows how to really paint her nails being so little.</li>
            <li>The colors are so sweet - very pastel - not in your face.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, and they glide right on.</li>
            <li>That means that you&#x27;re not actually getting 12 different colors, but they are coordinated colors that are great for nail art.</li>
            <li>So everything arrived quickly, and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>its super pretty, it goes really well with the pastel teal.</li>
            <li>Very economic, but one arrived leaking.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be back for more for gifts.</li>
            <li>got to love the different color&#x27;s</li>
            <li>first off I received all the colors that were listed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the colors and each bottle came individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>I am glad with the different colors!</li>
            <li>I was able to color my nails a different color they were a hit.</li>
            <li>I bought these hoping for a pretty pastel color nail polish.</li>
            <li>these colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of Kleancolor polish.</li>
            <li>only issue is the cap - it&#x27;s two pieces &amp; when you shake it while holding the top - the bottom/bottle flies off.  </li>
            <li>Just used my first color</li>
            <li>Pretty in bottle,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty in bottle</li>
            <li>i loved all my colors especially the light purple baby blue light ocean color the yellow on the coral</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this set I waited and waited</li>
            <li>a few are nice but most of them are too dry and does not apply smoothly on nails.</li>
            <li>The sheer ones are so nice and classy looking.  </li>
            <li>, blue hue was very pastely, both individuals were satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that I bought this set and am definitely going to buy other colors in the future!</li>
            <li>That was kinda disappointing but they&#x27;re all still really pretty &amp; great!</li>
            <li>but once you get it on and dry the colors are stunning and very glossy.</li>
            <li>I really like the selection and quality of this brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much use it.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied..</li>
            <li>completely nor worth a dollar let alone 12.</li>
            <li>You have to paint them about three times for the color to be solid and when it dries it looks cheap.</li>
            <li>really wanted pastels for nail art</li>
            <li>I really appreciated that.</li>
            <li>Very diappointing</li>
            <li>but they are very runny...</li>
            <li>right is practically CLEAR.</li>
            <li>Their other polishes are much better quality.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful but so sheer you need any least 3 coats.</li>
            <li>But with Kleancolor, it goes on extremely easy, and so far nothing has fallen off my nails yet (2 days later) .</li>
            <li>the light pink is like a tinted top cat [not much color] &amp;</li>
            <li>I had no problem with sipping or getting broken bottles and as for the polish, well, every nail polish is different and some colors need more coats than others but its all about being patient and at the end the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I dont know how in the heck the reviews above are true.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if it was an honest mistake or</li>
            <li>I use them for nail art, not the main color</li>
            <li>Most of the pastel colors were pretty but this polish goes on weird and is cheap.</li>
            <li>And once you get them dry, they&#x27;re full of air bubbles (without shaking the bottles).</li>
            <li>Chips so easy it&#x27;s not worth the effort to paint my nails with these.</li>
            <li>All the colors where sent on time and look great just a heads up the red nail Polish is not red at all :/</li>
            <li>but you live</li>
            <li>They sent me a new package</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Greenish&#x27; one 2nd from the top right is actually like a light baby blue, the sheer bottom white is like pretty petal champagne &amp; the deep red is of course not red at all, just super sheer.</li>
            <li>Not only was it in a package, but it was double packaged as well to keep it safe, while wrapped in paper to protect it inside the double package.</li>
            <li>Cheap but still not worth the price.</li>
            <li>You might as well apply clear polish if you&#x27;re applying these....and the other 6 in this set are pretty in bottle and pretty on nails</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, nowhere in the description does it mention that more than half the colors are sheer.</li>
            <li>Slapped a couple quick coats of five different colors on my left hand nails (over some chipped clear coat)</li>
            <li>All lids were screwed on tight &amp; the formula in every bottle was smooth &amp; not dried</li>
            <li>and I should know better to buy nail polish online, especially with a brand I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>
            <li>but I got a clear polish</li>
            <li>But my daughter likes having her nails painted (shes 3 yrs old)</li>
            <li>Received my nail polish set early and when I received them they were well packaged.</li>
            <li>The polish is very thin and liquidy (unlike good nail polishes).</li>
            <li>To save polish, I used a cheap white as a base coat and got a great look using only one coat of this polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors were exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>also dry really fast</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are a little gloppy, but a couple of drops of thinner fixed them right up.</li>
            <li>which of course means it stays there unless you do some major yard work.  </li>
            <li>only this time I will paint a white coat first, and then apply several coats of the pastel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I realized that two coats were necessary for complete coverage and that the first coat had to be completely dry before even attempting a second coat.</li>
            <li>so I can see how you might think there the same, but on the bottom of the nail polish it tells you the color of the nail polish, the 2 colors that really looked alike to me at first was Pastel Pink, and Sheer Pastel Pink, but now they look like complete different colors.</li>
            <li>Even with an expensive salon quality top coat it peels off in large sheets...almost the entire nail will come off if you try to scratch it once dry.</li>
            <li>Watch out if you put too much on it takes too long to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not smooth and consistent.</li>
            <li>so I also like the clean subtle look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add in the fact that they chip so much that half the polish is off in a day...</li>
            <li>I hope this helped a little bit with your decision, in choosing whether or not you should buy from this company, but I would really recommend them!&lt;br</li>

            <li> I honestly would&#x27;ve bought a name brand polish like china glaze or opi rather than this.</li>
            <li> Colour looked nice on the individuals nails</li>
            <li> omg it worked totally bold and beautiful</li>
            <li> Perfect for new nail techs in need of affordable polish options.</li>
            <li> Great colors and lots of fun.  </li>
            <li> love the colors but chips very easy.</li>
            <li> So I contacted the sellers and they replied very quickly and kindly.</li>
            <li> I have ordered kleancolor before and love using it for stamping nail art.</li>
            <li> Just lovely set, and everyone should get it for themselves.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 12 and changes her nail color like most people change underwear.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I love the colors</li>
            <li> so I can keep touching it up during the day.  </li>
            <li> When my package arrived I was real happy to see they took extra care to bubblewrap the bottles in the boxes.</li>
            <li> Four coats for a OK look.</li>
            <li> I love the pastel colors but</li>
            <li> Love...</li>
            <li> Glad to have pastel colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this brand one more chance, but after that, I&#x27;m removing everything</li>
            <li> I especially love the blue, Nude &amp; purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color accuracy:&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can see from the photo most colors are just l;ike the picture displayed</li>
            <li> Plus i got a bonus color :)</li>
            <li> So my lovely husband got me these as a gift</li>
            <li> Some are cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having for the ladies at work, so I figured I&#x27;d better try them out.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love my polishes.</li>
            <li> i thought they were more for spring</li>
            <li> I love the colors.  </li>
            <li> My Favorite color they included would have to be the pastel purple</li>
            <li> it got to my house in 3 1/2 days, considering that the shipping is free!</li>
            <li> Thank you Kleancolor :)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, will purchase more!!</li>
            <li> They were not loud colors,  the pastels were perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost all the colors are opaque &amp; rich in color!</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick ( took about 4  days), and they were packed nicely.</li>
            <li> My problem with most nail polish is that it falls off way to easily (and I buy Opi, and Sally Hanson exc.),</li>
            <li> colors are nice, price is right</li>
            <li> The colors are light, but they go on just fine, and give off a lovely color/sheen to them.</li>
            <li> Some are too see through and you need to put more on, but overall the colors look great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly &amp; chips easily.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but you have to put multiple coats on.</li>
            <li> I was very delighted to see that all the colors were accounted for but the orange looked a lot like the pink.</li>
            <li> Huge flakes just pop off, and I sit a a desk all day.</li>
            <li> So many fun designs to make with these.</li>
            <li> Packaging came in a secure .</li>
            <li> /&gt;They came fast &amp; were shipped nicely.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t experienced any chipping yet [have had some colors on for only a day though].</li>
            <li> it looks like cheap paint on nails.  </li>
            <li> Nice colors they stay on very well</li>
            <li> I also did not get the free nail file gift that came with it</li>
            <li> The colors are fabulous.</li>
            <li> the cover-ups I purchased are almost all light summery shades.  </li>
            <li> Too cheap.</li>
            <li> Just to give you an idea of how cheap these polishes are....</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t paint well in 2 coats and it just looks cheap.</li>
            <li> I suppose this would be a good gift for a teenager or someone who frequently switches colors, etc.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that most of the colors have a matching sheer color included in the set.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are pretty and the bottle shape is cute.</li>
            <li> ordered from Eye Candy, they filled my order quickly and resolved an issue I had with one of the bottles.</li>
            <li> color peels off super easy, lucky if it lasts a day</li>
            <li> but all of the other colors look just like in the picture and are good quality too :)</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is the color brown they give you which looks lik a nude color.</li>
            <li> Everything was fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Love the quality, but not in love with the pinks (seem like the same shade over and over).</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> , I got exactly the colors that I see in the picture, I recently tried the colors and they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Same as the Kleancolor matte glitter collection, love the colors!</li>
            <li> Even with a top clear coat!</li>
            <li> My nails look so pretty!</li>
            <li> so I thought the light colors would be best for her for a christmas gift to my sister as my sister is the only one that knows how to really paint her nails being so little.</li>
            <li> The colors are so sweet - very pastel - not in your face.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, and they glide right on.</li>
            <li> That means that you&#x27;re not actually getting 12 different colors, but they are coordinated colors that are great for nail art.</li>
            <li> So everything arrived quickly, and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> its super pretty, it goes really well with the pastel teal.</li>
            <li> Very economic, but one arrived leaking.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be back for more for gifts.</li>
            <li> got to love the different color&#x27;s</li>
            <li> first off I received all the colors that were listed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the colors and each bottle came individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I am glad with the different colors!</li>
            <li> I was able to color my nails a different color they were a hit.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for a pretty pastel color nail polish.</li>
            <li> these colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of Kleancolor polish.</li>
            <li> only issue is the cap - it&#x27;s two pieces &amp; when you shake it while holding the top - the bottom/bottle flies off.  </li>
            <li> Just used my first color</li>
            <li> Pretty in bottle,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty in bottle</li>
            <li> i loved all my colors especially the light purple baby blue light ocean color the yellow on the coral</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this set I waited and waited</li>
            <li> a few are nice but most of them are too dry and does not apply smoothly on nails.</li>
            <li> The sheer ones are so nice and classy looking.  </li>
            <li> , blue hue was very pastely, both individuals were satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I bought this set and am definitely going to buy other colors in the future!</li>
            <li> That was kinda disappointing but they&#x27;re all still really pretty &amp; great!</li>
            <li> but once you get it on and dry the colors are stunning and very glossy.</li>
            <li> I really like the selection and quality of this brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much use it.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied..</li>
            <li> completely nor worth a dollar let alone 12.</li>
            <li> You have to paint them about three times for the color to be solid and when it dries it looks cheap.</li>
            <li> really wanted pastels for nail art</li>
            <li> I really appreciated that.</li>
            <li> Very diappointing</li>
            <li> but they are very runny...</li>
            <li> right is practically CLEAR.</li>
            <li> Their other polishes are much better quality.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but so sheer you need any least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> But with Kleancolor, it goes on extremely easy, and so far nothing has fallen off my nails yet (2 days later) .</li>
            <li> the light pink is like a tinted top cat [not much color] &amp;</li>
            <li> I had no problem with sipping or getting broken bottles and as for the polish, well, every nail polish is different and some colors need more coats than others but its all about being patient and at the end the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I dont know how in the heck the reviews above are true.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if it was an honest mistake or</li>
            <li> I use them for nail art, not the main color</li>
            <li> Most of the pastel colors were pretty but this polish goes on weird and is cheap.</li>
            <li> And once you get them dry, they&#x27;re full of air bubbles (without shaking the bottles).</li>
            <li> Chips so easy it&#x27;s not worth the effort to paint my nails with these.</li>
            <li> All the colors where sent on time and look great just a heads up the red nail Polish is not red at all :/</li>
            <li> but you live</li>
            <li> They sent me a new package</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Greenish&#x27; one 2nd from the top right is actually like a light baby blue, the sheer bottom white is like pretty petal champagne &amp; the deep red is of course not red at all, just super sheer.</li>
            <li> Not only was it in a package, but it was double packaged as well to keep it safe, while wrapped in paper to protect it inside the double package.</li>
            <li> Cheap but still not worth the price.</li>
            <li> You might as well apply clear polish if you&#x27;re applying these....and the other 6 in this set are pretty in bottle and pretty on nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, nowhere in the description does it mention that more than half the colors are sheer.</li>
            <li> Slapped a couple quick coats of five different colors on my left hand nails (over some chipped clear coat)</li>
            <li> All lids were screwed on tight &amp; the formula in every bottle was smooth &amp; not dried</li>
            <li> and I should know better to buy nail polish online, especially with a brand I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>
            <li> but I got a clear polish</li>
            <li> But my daughter likes having her nails painted (shes 3 yrs old)</li>
            <li> Received my nail polish set early and when I received them they were well packaged.</li>
            <li> The polish is very thin and liquidy (unlike good nail polishes).</li>
            <li> To save polish, I used a cheap white as a base coat and got a great look using only one coat of this polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors were exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> also dry really fast</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are a little gloppy, but a couple of drops of thinner fixed them right up.</li>
            <li> which of course means it stays there unless you do some major yard work.  </li>
            <li> only this time I will paint a white coat first, and then apply several coats of the pastel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I realized that two coats were necessary for complete coverage and that the first coat had to be completely dry before even attempting a second coat.</li>
            <li> so I can see how you might think there the same, but on the bottom of the nail polish it tells you the color of the nail polish, the 2 colors that really looked alike to me at first was Pastel Pink, and Sheer Pastel Pink, but now they look like complete different colors.</li>
            <li> Even with an expensive salon quality top coat it peels off in large sheets...almost the entire nail will come off if you try to scratch it once dry.</li>
            <li> Watch out if you put too much on it takes too long to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth and consistent.</li>
            <li> so I also like the clean subtle look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add in the fact that they chip so much that half the polish is off in a day...</li>
            <li> I hope this helped a little bit with your decision, in choosing whether or not you should buy from this company, but I would really recommend them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But even with a base coat &amp; a top coat it chips right off in a matter of a day.</li>
            <li> But all in all I expected that for the price &amp; other reviews, but all the colors I happened to want of this set were vibrant</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit rough and the polish is a bit thick which makes it a little challenging to apply at times.....</li>
            <li> the worst is that that beautiful deep red at the bottom</li>
            <li> I use a small fan to dry my nails faster, but it&#x27;s not necessary really even with two coats if you are careful.</li>
            <li> (Pastel pink, sheer pastel pink, lavender, sheer lavender, etc.)</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry also.</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to.</li>
            <li> The other polishes were sheer colors</li>
            <li> Then you&#x27;re stuck waiting longer on them dry, which takes forever.</li>
            <li> only problem is that a few of the colors are REALLY sheer.</li>
            <li> I adore every single color.  </li>
            <li> Half are sheer which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> Today I received my product in the mail, I will Admit I was a little nervous from some of the reviews people commented, they said that they had some of the same colors or some of them broke.</li>
            <li> I received an email notifying me that because of severe weather they would arrive a little later than expected.</li>
            <li> I got two boxes of the same six colors and they shipped me out the ones I was missing at no charge</li>
            <li> I tried out a color yesterday, and when first applied it&#x27;s a little thin but</li>
            <li> As a stamper you know clear polish is no good to us</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these and other nail care products as a shower favor.</li>
            <li> My only issue is how hard it is to get it off...</li>
            <li> but I wish it would last at least a day.  </li>
            <li> Not worth your time.</li>
            <li> I understand they&#x27;re \\&quot;sheer\\&quot;, but these are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> but soo not worth it if you cant have an even consistency on your nail.</li>
            <li> Well, when I opened my package it was very well rapped and protected, so I had no worries about the nail polish being broken!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth your money</li>
            <li> I love the look of painted nails but hate the process</li>
            <li> And because of all the thick coats I&#x27;ve had to appy, I know this polish will be coming off shortly on its on.</li>
            <li> However not all the lids where in tight so 2 leaked all over the box and other polishes.</li>
            <li> but there were slight differences I thought I might point out.</li>
            <li> considering I was digging in dirt within a half hour!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff does not chip, peel and does not require one of those lights to dry it hard.  </li>
            <li> : my set included a clear which was not pictured, so I was a little disappointed that I got a clear</li>
            <li> Not worth your money, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Nail polish arrived a little &#x27; dried up &#x27; not sure if this was due to shipping, heat maybe?</li>
            <li> I wanted to return them but the return is not free and its costing me.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because of the pastel yellow, which can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> but application is difficult, takes 5 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the polish makes it hard to do even coats.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth buying!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> worst garbage ever, sticky clumpy mess real trash don&#x27;t ever buy this what a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never had KleanColor Nail polish.</li>
            <li> These are such bad quality.</li>
            <li> , the product itself is not good if you have porcelain skin like me, it doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> I sampled a few bottles randomly</li>
            <li> These colors go on very thick, streaky, blochy looking, which is nothing I would want to flaunt when signing something.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;None were broken, as I had my doubts since I never bought over the internet with this type of thing.</li>
            <li> Also poor vender service.  </li>
            <li> I am tired complaining to Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely not as happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> If this is supposed to be nail polish, I&#x27;m confused.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> but Im not to crazy about it.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> This polish is worthless.  </li>
            <li> The Polish them self are crap.</li>
            <li> very bad quality.</li>
            <li> so I am very disappointed that&#x27;s why I was giving this three stars.</li>
            <li> that where horrible to stamp with.</li>
            <li> and these polishes make it worst.</li>
            <li> Should have known it would be terrible.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The colors are horrible and aren&#x27;t even pastel.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful colors! The pastels are unique and perfect for Spring/Summer, and the neutrals are great too. I really like the selection and quality of this brand.</li>
            <li> The polish arrived very quickly and the colors are perfect pastel. Watch out if you put too much on it takes too long to dry. Some colors are see-through, i did not like these ones.</li>
            <li> I have ordered kleancolor before and love using it for stamping nail art. I was looking forward to this set of plastel polishes, but I did not receive what was pictured. From reading other reviews I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to. I also did not get the nail file that was a bonus with this order. I contacted the seller and got a run around and they did not resolve the issues with this purchase. As a stamper you know clear polish is no good to us and this was one of the polishes I received. The other polishes were sheer colors that where horrible to stamp with. If you are wanting pastels I recommend buy them from a different seller so you actually get them!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly never had KleanColor Nail polish. I don&#x27;t much use it. But my daughter likes having her nails painted (shes 3 yrs old) so I thought the light colors would be best for her for a christmas gift to my sister as my sister is the only one that knows how to really paint her nails being so little. The package itself was packed greatly. Not only was it in a package, but it was double packaged as well to keep it safe, while wrapped in paper to protect it inside the double package. The colors are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None were broken, as I had my doubts since I never bought over the internet with this type of thing. Everything was fresh and clean. Practically perfect for anyone wanting something as great as this. Can&#x27;t wait for her to have it on christmas morning when she wakes up. The colors are light, but they go on just fine, and give off a lovely color/sheen to them. Well balanced, and practical, but not overbearing. Just lovely set, and everyone should get it for themselves.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY unhappy with this product. I adore the colors like no tomorrow.. But even with a base coat &amp; a top coat it chips right off in a matter of a day. I am very unsatisfied..</li>
            <li> My daughter is 12 and changes her nail color like most people change underwear.  She received this set in her stocking and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The colors are pretty, and they glide right on.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but so sheer you need any least 3 coats. And once you get them dry, they&#x27;re full of air bubbles (without shaking the bottles). Add in the fact that they chip so much that half the polish is off in a day... completely nor worth a dollar let alone 12. Will NEVER buy another Klean Kolor product again!</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product. It serves it purpose and is good quality and I&#x27;ll be back for more for gifts.</li>
            <li> This polish is worthless.  It chips the minute you get in on.  I love the colors but I wish it would last at least a day.  I have to carry, the color I am wearing, in my handbag so I can keep touching it up during the day.  Also it is not a returnable item unless you pay the postage.  Not worth your time. Getting two stars because of the beautiful pastel colors.  Also poor vender service.  Amazon came to my rescue.</li>
            <li> When my package arrived I was real happy to see they took extra care to bubblewrap the bottles in the boxes. However not all the lids where in tight so 2 leaked all over the box and other polishes. The Polish them self are crap. Four coats for a OK look. The consistency of the polish makes it hard to do even coats. Never ordering this brand again.</li>
            <li> Love the quality, but not in love with the pinks (seem like the same shade over and over).</li>
            <li> Delivered on schedule. Colors not to my liking. Needs more than 2 coats for good coverage.</li>
            <li> Most of the pastel colors were pretty but this polish goes on weird and is cheap. It&#x27;s not smooth and consistent. You have to paint them about three times for the color to be solid and when it dries it looks cheap. I suppose this would be a good gift for a teenager or someone who frequently switches colors, etc. I love the look of painted nails but hate the process and these polishes make it worst. I would prefer something that I has shine and takes one or two coats. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this collection again.</li>
            <li> I love the colors they are beautiful. The seller is great with communication if there was a problem. I got two boxes of the same six colors and they shipped me out the ones I was missing at no charge and I got to keep all of them. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I had to do a review on this polish collection!!  I adore every single color.  The sheer ones are so nice and classy looking.  My only issue is how hard it is to get it off...which of course means it stays there unless you do some major yard work.  This stuff does not chip, peel and does not require one of those lights to dry it hard.  I use a small fan to dry my nails faster, but it&#x27;s not necessary really even with two coats if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Same as the Kleancolor matte glitter collection, love the colors! I bought this set because of the pastel yellow, which can be difficult to find. I was delighted to find that most of the colors have a matching sheer color included in the set. (Pastel pink, sheer pastel pink, lavender, sheer lavender, etc.) That means that you&#x27;re not actually getting 12 different colors, but they are coordinated colors that are great for nail art. Some of the colors are a little gloppy, but a couple of drops of thinner fixed them right up. For the price, great collection! One note: my set included a clear which was not pictured, so I was a little disappointed that I got a clear I didn&#x27;t need instead of another color.</li>
            <li> Chips so easy it&#x27;s not worth the effort to paint my nails with these. I purchased to do water marbeling with the different colors but it does not work well for that. Cheap but still not worth the price. Even with an expensive salon quality top coat it peels off in large sheets...almost the entire nail will come off if you try to scratch it once dry. Will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Half are sheer which is a bummer. I love the pastel colors but crack(looks like shattered glass) after two days wear. I use them for nail art, not the main color and they work great for that.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Quality. Awesome price.  Love...</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful,  just in time for spring! Glad to have pastel colors. So many fun designs to make with these. I&#x27;d recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> got to love the different color&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Good price for the price . The quality is good along with That the colors are very nice . I would recommend buying these. Packaging came in a secure .</li>
            <li> gloppy polishes...didn&#x27;t care for these pastels at all.  Their other polishes are much better quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nieces</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this a 2-star is because of the shipping and I should know better to buy nail polish online, especially with a brand I&#x27;m not familiar with. It arrived on time and someone took the time to wrap each individual bottle, and then package it twice to insure none of the bottles break. So, I do appreciate this company.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product itself is not good if you have porcelain skin like me, it doesn&#x27;t show up. I applied three times and when held in the lights, the color is non-exist ant. The polish is very thin and liquidy (unlike good nail polishes). I will be trying it again, only this time I will paint a white coat first, and then apply several coats of the pastel.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t buy the entire collection; next time I won&#x27;t be. I&#x27;ll give this brand one more chance, but after that, I&#x27;m removing everything Kleancolor off my wish list.</li>
            <li> SO PRETTY!&lt;br /&gt;Okay first off I received all the colors that were listed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;They came fast &amp; were shipped nicely. All lids were screwed on tight &amp; the formula in every bottle was smooth &amp; not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted pastels for nail art [flowers, dots, blah blah] and these were So inexpensive for a dollar a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality:&lt;br /&gt;Almost all the colors are opaque &amp; rich in color! I sampled a few bottles randomly and thats the nail polish with only ONE coat&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any chipping yet [have had some colors on for only a day though]. but with out a good top-coat I could see them peeling easily.&lt;br /&gt;They also dry really fast, I was really happy about this^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that a few of the colors are REALLY sheer. But all in all I expected that for the price &amp; other reviews, but all the colors I happened to want of this set were vibrant so it was all good!&lt;br /&gt;The white is slightly sheer [like a milky cover?] the light pink is like a tinted top cat [not much color] &amp; the worst is that that beautiful deep red at the bottom right is practically CLEAR. That was kinda disappointing but they&#x27;re all still really pretty &amp; great! I especially love the blue, Nude &amp; purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color accuracy:&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the photo most colors are just l;ike the picture displayed but there were slight differences I thought I might point out. The &#x27;Greenish&#x27; one 2nd from the top right is actually like a light baby blue, the sheer bottom white is like pretty petal champagne &amp; the deep red is of course not red at all, just super sheer.</li>
            <li> Bummer! This stuff chips off the very next day just hand washing. Huge flakes just pop off, and I sit a a desk all day. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and each bottle came individually wrapped. Plus i got a bonus color :)</li>
            <li> I am glad with the different colors! I was able to color my nails a different color they were a hit. They were not loud colors,  the pastels were perfect.</li>
            <li> a few are nice but most of them are too dry and does not apply smoothly on nails.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for a pretty pastel color nail polish. They turned out to be just some watery nail polish. The only way to get a pastel color is by adding a white bottom layer of nail polish &amp; adding 2 coats of the pastel nail polishes. Definitely not worth buying!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I just received these today. The shipping was quick ( took about 4  days), and they were packed nicely. I think these colors are extremely cute and are very good quality. Honestly, you just need one coat. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> So my lovely husband got me these as a gift and I must say that they are just beautiful colors, I got exactly the colors that I see in the picture, I recently tried the colors and they look gorgeous. I had no problem with sipping or getting broken bottles and as for the polish, well, every nail polish is different and some colors need more coats than others but its all about being patient and at the end the results are amazing. I am a stay home mommy so I do a lot of stuff around the house so obviously the paint (from any brand) comes off easier. I would definitely recommend this item is just a must have for any woman!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of KleanColors Polish!! All items arrived on time and as described!! Thank you so much, will purchase more!!</li>
            <li> After you applied the polish on the nail, it doesn&#x27;t look shiny.  it looks like cheap paint on nails.  I am tired complaining to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice  , beutifull colors .. I am happy</li>
            <li> these colors are so pretty. The polish arrived very quickly and the colors are great looking. Some are too see through and you need to put more on, but overall the colors look great</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of Kleancolor polish. The colors were exactly what I expected. I realized that two coats were necessary for complete coverage and that the first coat had to be completely dry before even attempting a second coat. To save polish, I used a cheap white as a base coat and got a great look using only one coat of this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from Eye Candy, they filled my order quickly and resolved an issue I had with one of the bottles. They responded to my email within hours, to my surprise and treated me very fairly. I would definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I dont know how in the heck the reviews above are true.  I guess you just dont how to apply polish.  I have been using this brand for over a year and have over 50 of their colors and not one problem with any of them.  Great polish and great coverage and an awesome price !!!!</li>
            <li> love the colors but chips very easy.</li>
            <li> poor quality--does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Nice colors they stay on very well</li>
            <li> I have finally found the colors and inexpensive nail polish I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about a week ago and he just came in the mail. I was very delighted to see that all the colors were accounted for but the orange looked a lot like the pink. I also did not get the free nail file gift that came with it so I am very disappointed that&#x27;s why I was giving this three stars.</li>
            <li> GRANDDAUGHTERS LOVED THEM!</li>
            <li> Great colors and lots of fun.  I bought them for party favors.  They didn&#x27;t arrive in time, but I&#x27;ll use them for a pedicure party.</li>
            <li> Beautiful  colors grand daughter  loved this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for new nail techs in need of affordable polish options.</li>
            <li> So everything arrived quickly, and was packaged very well. Just wanted to get that out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, nowhere in the description does it mention that more than half the colors are sheer. There are about 5 solid colors, the rest are sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did not get all the colors in the image. I never received the reddish color on the second row (2nd to last). Instead, I got another hue of peach. So I&#x27;m not sure if it was an honest mistake or what, but I&#x27;m definitely not as happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish. I&#x27;m using these and other nail care products as a shower favor. All of the colors are pretty and the bottle shape is cute. I received an email notifying me that because of severe weather they would arrive a little later than expected. I really appreciated that. They ended up being on time which was great. They came in perfect condition and will make a nice addition to the party favors. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very economic, but one arrived leaking.</li>
            <li> Some are cute but I got a clear polish and I thought I was getting all 12 polishes pastel colors</li>
            <li> All the colors where sent on time and look great just a heads up the red nail Polish is not red at all :/ but all of the other colors look just like in the picture and are good quality too :)</li>
            <li> If you like pastel polishes,  then this set of  pastel polish is for you. The colors are fabulous. I will recommend this set of polish, To my friends. I will buy from this seller again, also the packaging was excellent. Thank you</li>
            <li> I thought these would be mini bottles - they&#x27;re not!  Bought for a poolside mani/pedi party I&#x27;m having for the ladies at work, so I figured I&#x27;d better try them out.  Slapped a couple quick coats of five different colors on my left hand nails (over some chipped clear coat) then did some gardening. I was very pleased.  The colors are so sweet - very pastel - not in your face.  And the polish held up well considering I was digging in dirt within a half hour!&lt;br /&gt;I briefly worried the colors were too Spring, but we have a looong summer in San Antonio and the cover-ups I purchased are almost all light summery shades.  We are all in the health care field so I also like the clean subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the cap - it&#x27;s two pieces &amp; when you shake it while holding the top - the bottom/bottle flies off.  Scared the bejinkies outta me 3 times (yes, I did the same thing over &amp; over &amp; over.)  However the bottles didn&#x27;t break while bouncing across our tile floors, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> My gf loves this set, she is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Received my nail polish set early and when I received them they were well packaged. Just used my first color and I absolutely love it! Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> So cute and good quality</li>
            <li> If this is supposed to be nail polish, I&#x27;m confused.  Isn&#x27;t it actually supposed to stick to the nail OVERNIGHT? Well this stuff chipped in seconds.  Too cheap. Shame on me. Should have known it would be terrible.  Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> This nail polish streaks when put on. It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly &amp; chips easily. Also started clumping in bottle after painting one hand! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> colors are nice, price is right but application is difficult, takes 5 minutes to dry. By then I&#x27;ve touched something. I&#x27;ll use them up, I get compliments for the colors but Im not to crazy about it. I read these got a great review in a fashion mag but I don&#x27;t understand how.</li>
            <li> Just to give you an idea of how cheap these polishes are....I have applied 4 coats and you can still see my nail beds. Pretty in bottle, but I wish id bought something of a nicer quality cause these are like water. Very diappointing but you live and you learn.  I would agree with review given by Oscar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: there are 6 polishes labeled \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; pastel. ...those are the ones that are watery. I understand they&#x27;re \\&quot;sheer\\&quot;, but these are not worth the money. You might as well apply clear polish if you&#x27;re applying these....and the other 6 in this set are pretty in bottle and pretty on nails but they are very runny...like some areas need another coat on nail. Then you&#x27;re stuck waiting longer on them dry, which takes forever. I applied about three coats on some of my nails and some had to have a four on some (of these regular pastel colors, not sheer) and they are still needing another coat In some areas. These colors go on very thick, streaky, blochy looking, which is nothing I would want to flaunt when signing something.  Lol....my fingernails look embarrising. I honestly would&#x27;ve bought a name brand polish like china glaze or opi rather than this. They&#x27;re pretty in bottle but soo not worth it if you cant have an even consistency on your nail. And because of all the thick coats I&#x27;ve had to appy, I know this polish will be coming off shortly on its on. Even with a top clear coat! Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I love my polishes. Received them on time as promised.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but you have to put multiple coats on. Even then the polish still comes off sometimes. It takes a long time to dry also.</li>
            <li> Omg this is one of my favorite purchase that i have ever made i am so happy they just came in and i tried all of them on they are just beautiful i thought they were more for spring but when i tried them on it goes so good with summer and i usally buy yellow nail polish because im looking for one that actually works and i said to my srlf its not gonna work so who cares and I tried it omg it worked totally bold and beautiful i loved all my colors especially the light purple baby blue light ocean color the yellow on the coral one the white and the kinda brown color 5stars for you</li>
            <li> Nail polish arrived a little &#x27; dried up &#x27; not sure if this was due to shipping, heat maybe? Colour looked nice on the individuals nails, blue hue was very pastely, both individuals were satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
            <li> very bad quality. Dont bother. I guess if you do, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Bought these hoping they would water marble. They don&#x27;t.  Using them as regular polish shows the price. They don&#x27;t paint well in 2 coats and it just looks cheap.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.  The brush is a bit rough and the polish is a bit thick which makes it a little challenging to apply at times.....but once you get it on and dry the colors are stunning and very glossy. Would recommend it&#x27;s a great deal for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Today I received my product in the mail, I will Admit I was a little nervous from some of the reviews people commented, they said that they had some of the same colors or some of them broke. Well, when I opened my package it was very well rapped and protected, so I had no worries about the nail polish being broken! Some of the Colors do look alike so I can see how you might think there the same, but on the bottom of the nail polish it tells you the color of the nail polish, the 2 colors that really looked alike to me at first was Pastel Pink, and Sheer Pastel Pink, but now they look like complete different colors. Now to how they look on Nails...  My problem with most nail polish is that it falls off way to easily (and I buy Opi, and Sally Hanson exc.), But with Kleancolor, it goes on extremely easy, and so far nothing has fallen off my nails yet (2 days later) . My Favorite color they included would have to be the pastel purple its super pretty, it goes really well with the pastel teal. I hope this helped a little bit with your decision, in choosing whether or not you should buy from this company, but I would really recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the shipping was amazing it got to my house in 3 1/2 days, considering that the shipping is free!</li>
            <li> color peels off super easy, lucky if it lasts a day</li>
            <li> worst garbage ever, sticky clumpy mess real trash don&#x27;t ever buy this what a waste of time and money&lt;br /&gt;nice colors but totally useless, better off with kids toy nail polish my opinion</li>
            <li> These are such bad quality. I wanted to return them but the return is not free and its costing me.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money, don&#x27;t buy it! The colors are horrible and aren&#x27;t even pastel. it&#x27;s not worth your money just go out to the store and buy individual ones where you can see the colors. you have to apply 3-4 coats just so you can see the colors. The only good thing about this is the color brown they give you which looks lik a nude color.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this set I waited and waited but, my package had gotten lost in the mail. So I contacted the sellers and they replied very quickly and kindly. They sent me a new package and I just received it and I love it!! The bottles are very beautiful and intact no spillage, breakage, nothing! I tried out a color yesterday, and when first applied it&#x27;s a little thin but 2-3 coats gets you a gorgeous color!! I am very happy that I bought this set and am definitely going to buy other colors in the future! Thank you Kleancolor :) My nails look so pretty!</li>
