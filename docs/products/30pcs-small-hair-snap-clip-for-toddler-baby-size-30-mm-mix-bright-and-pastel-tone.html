            <li>Fits perfect and the color hasn&#x27;t even chipped off</li>
            <li>But they were so affordable and perfect for my toddler.</li>
            <li>These clips are wonderful!</li>
            <li>I did not receive colors even close to what is pictured, I received bright neon, club going, colors!</li>
            <li>The quality is not that great.  </li>
            <li>Great size for my 12 mo.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Clip quality seems okay not as good of quality as Goody brand metal clips!</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>Great quality fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Clips are cute but are neon colors (just like others have reported).  </li>
            <li>We had to make a special trip to the post office to pick them up.</li>
            <li>They work well on my daughters hair and were a good price, but beware if you&#x27;re looking for specific colors.</li>
            <li>I had to laugh at the added security measures to retrieve hair</li>
            <li>so I only use them when I can watch to make sure they don&#x27;t go in her mouth.</li>
            <li>They are very cute to put a couple in a toddlers hair, but do not expect them to have a TON of function as they can only hold back so much hair.</li>
            <li>do, however, really like the variety of colors and will find a way to use them.</li>
            <li>The description says a mixture of pastel and bright and just like other buyers we only got 2 sets of NEON.  </li>
            <li>Quality of clips are good but they are very small and will not work well in my toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>old as she does not have much hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping was slow, but these are the perfect size for little girls just starting to get some hair</li>

            <li> These are neon colored.  There were no pastel black or white in my set.  The items I received are not as shown.  Sending back.</li>
            <li> The quality is not that great.  They look like they are going to break any minute.  The description says a mixture of pastel and bright and just like other buyers we only got 2 sets of NEON.  I don&#x27;t mind the NEON but I don&#x27;t like that both sets are identical.  Seller needs to change their description.  I am keeping them because I need them to hold my toddler&#x27;s hair out of her eyes but I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and the color hasn&#x27;t even chipped off I use these daily on my daughter</li>
            <li> these do not hold as well as some of the brand names.  The clips are thinner in material and a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow, but these are the perfect size for little girls just starting to get some hair</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item twice now, from what I thought was different retailers - however, it continues to not be as described. Only a set of neon colors (not even shown here..) was given and it was the same 6 colors for all 24 pieces. I was looking for the colors pictured here 2 of each - as you described, very disappointing and frustrating.</li>
            <li> Was not as described. No Pastel clips. Only brights. Bummed.</li>
            <li> I got two sets of twelve clips - but ALL were neon colors. Meh.</li>
            <li> Great size for my 12 mo. old as she does not have much hair. Colors not as pictured though. Neon.</li>
            <li> The hair clips I received are not the ones pictured. As another reviewer stated, the hair clips I received are all neon. 4 neon orange, 4 neon yellow, 4 neon green, 4 neon pink, 4 blue, and 4 purple. I am very disappointed and will be returning them. Please send what you advertise!</li>
            <li> Clips are cute but are neon colors (just like others have reported).  They work well on my daughters hair and were a good price, but beware if you&#x27;re looking for specific colors.</li>
            <li> Is not what I want ! But thank you</li>
            <li> Love these!  My daughter had a lot of hair from birth and I wanted to add a little color to her hair.  I got these, and she has a hard time getting them out.  I got them when she was about 4 months and now she&#x27;s 8 months and we still use them all the time.  Just be careful if your little one starts pulling on them, my daughter gets them out sometimes so I only use them when I can watch to make sure they don&#x27;t go in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my toddler and totally didnt pay attention to size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very small! They are very cute to put a couple in a toddlers hair, but do not expect them to have a TON of function as they can only hold back so much hair.</li>
            <li> Quality of clips are good but they are very small and will not work well in my toddler&#x27;s hair. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I ordered. Also, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to where they shipped from. It took us extra time to get them because the package needed to be signed for and we couldn&#x27;t guarantee we&#x27;d be home to do so.  We had to make a special trip to the post office to pick them up. I had to laugh at the added security measures to retrieve hair clips.&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, really like the variety of colors and will find a way to use them.</li>
            <li> Colors are neon-not at all what is pictured.  The clips hold fine hair, but a bit disappointed in the colors.</li>
            <li> Great quality fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Took a little while to arrive. But they were so affordable and perfect for my toddler.</li>
            <li> These clips are wonderful! There is every color needed to match any outfit. I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not receive colors even close to what is pictured, I received bright neon, club going, colors! Not satisfied as these will not go with any of my toddlers clothes which completely defeats the purpose of purchasing these. Clip quality seems okay not as good of quality as Goody brand metal clips!</li>
