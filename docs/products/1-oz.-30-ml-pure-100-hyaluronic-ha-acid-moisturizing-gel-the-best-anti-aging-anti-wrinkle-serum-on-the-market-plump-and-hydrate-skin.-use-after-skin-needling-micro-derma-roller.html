            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product about 2 or 3 times and everytime it delivers great results.</li>
            <li>So to make sure it works properly, it&#x27;s best to apply it to damp skin.</li>

            <li>I love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>everything has started to make a lot more sense to me.</li>
            <li>The product itself is called a gel, but it is much more liquid than that.</li>
            <li>I can safely say that this literally feels as if you have nothing on your face.</li>
            <li>and it seems to make my eye cream work better.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of a serum versus a cream now.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels amazingly smooth!</li>
            <li>THIS KIND OF CHEAP THING IN MY CABINET..</li>
            <li>Gives the skin the perfect hydration and glow, especially age 40+.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin looked more even more toned and</li>
            <li>so I love I can apply w/o a oily feeling</li>
            <li>The best was Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum, next is Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, then Organics Vitamin C balancing Toner.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this</li>
            <li>i read that its not proven to be harmful but better to be in the safe side..</li>
            <li>Ok, I have been trying to get rid of my fine lines under my eyes for quite a while now...</li>
            <li>love the smooth feel it leaves on my face</li>
            <li>That way you&#x27;re sure there&#x27;s always water available to the hylaronic acid to hold on to.</li>
            <li>are was so much more smooth.</li>
            <li>I have some early signs of wrinkles in my forehead and this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Although it diminishes fine lines and does make your face smoother, it is not permanent.  </li>
            <li>It feels comfortable, even without moisturizer, and the flakes are gone.</li>
            <li>Great product especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>IT S LIGHT</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and plump.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>yes my under eye wrinkles was lessened...very happy with only one application I have combo.</li>
            <li>It is cheap also ..</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and feeling fresh even in the most radical temperature changes.</li>
            <li>just so so and not so special.</li>
            <li>Applying moisturizers didn&#x27;t really work - they just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t solve anything.</li>
            <li>Yes, you must adhere to the proper timing if you expect good results.</li>
            <li>with more very soon.</li>
            <li>, lotions go on feeling good but with in ten min.</li>
            <li>it take about 2 weeks and you see change, your face looks very soft,I love</li>
            <li>The main thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin just feels a lot more balanced.</li>
            <li>it can only get better and better..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hygienic and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The beauty is that it really helps the look of my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>An amazing product for my oily skin that still needs extra hydration.</li>
            <li>In the PM I like to add a bit of ascorbic acid to the serum on my hand, wait a minute for it to dissolve and then apply my fresh vit C to my face.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t claim that it has been a game changer for my skin yet, but it is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracle results right away though, give it some time.</li>
            <li>Found out that their product was every bit as good as the other brand I had been buying!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting, because when I put it on, my skin feels kind of tight and dry (that&#x27;s why 4 stars), but I just put a moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a regular essential oil or a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice product that does not leave your skin feeling dry with the H Acid.</li>
            <li>about  two weeks thank you very much</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been using it for very long or very consistently, but I love how it feels and</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, plump and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>I chose this seller initially because their price was better.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it for the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is exactly what I have been looking for because creams make me break out.</li>
            <li>While on vacation I noticed my skin getting less &#x27;nice&#x27;, but didn&#x27;t think it was because I stopped using this product.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t buy it pure anywhere</li>
            <li>I read about pure hyaluronic acid moisturizer gel on The Beauty Department after Lauren Conrad&#x27;s makeup artist specifically recommended this brand.</li>
            <li>Pure 100% Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer Gel -(D)</li>
            <li>This serum does reduce your fine wrinkles, but not deep ones.  </li>
            <li>It is in tons of moisturizers, but my skin is very clog prone and instead of trying dozens of creams hoping to find one that didn&#x27;t clog me, I just opted for this pure hyaluronic acid instead.</li>
            <li>I can tell this product smooth&#x27;s out my face prior to putting on my make up, I think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>So the chances of it breaking anyone out are very small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results: in the beginning I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li>The results have been very gradual, but now I notice that my skin is a lot happier.</li>
            <li>Used like that, it has really helped my dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;The price of this product is a steal.</li>
            <li>I really like this gel.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, am very satisfied with how moisturized and soft my skin feels after I shower every morning (and before I put on SPF 30 or higher) and plan to order more of this stuff once it&#x27;s re-stocked.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much difference in my skin or wrinkles</li>
            <li>and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>Feels very nourrishing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A drop the size of a chickpea can cover my whole</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very liquid</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d never think some serum, that feels like water could moisturize so much.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and well packaged,I will order it again.</li>
            <li>Nice to use something that retains moisture without grease or that synthetic dimethicone slick and doesn&#x27;t automatically clog the pores.</li>
            <li>I was using a much more expensive brand of HA that wasn&#x27;t nearly this nice.  </li>
            <li>Other big cosmetics companies sell products with this as a main ingredient for much more!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to know if it is actually doing any good though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, leaves your skin visably smoother.</li>
            <li>Because it has dry feel and doesn&#x27;t make my facial skin red, I liked it first.  </li>
            <li>Among four lotions/serums, this one left lest smoothness and hydration right after application also after 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>First off, the first time I applied this it stung pretty fiercely for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any  problems with my skin, one tiny crease above my lip and when I smile which I love to do, a few under my eyes</li>
            <li>My skin felt very soft and the under eye</li>
            <li>After just celebrating my 25th birthday I suddenly noticed my once oily skin becoming increasingly dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>The Professional Skin Therapist I go to, recommends Hyaluronic Acid Gel for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The ones around my eyes have disappeared, but not the medium one on my forehead or the vertical ones near my mouth.  </li>
            <li>sensitive skin</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s the perfect base for a DIY vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>When you apply it feels as if you just applied water to your face, except it sinks in right</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin feeling a little smoother, but otherwise I really can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference.</li>
            <li>then found &#x27;Super&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer and compared with other lotions including this product by applying different part of my arm.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (very oily t-zone, normal cheeks) and even though my skin would always be oily, it would still feel tight and be flaky.</li>
            <li>It became apparent to me that I have dehydrated oily skin and that I needed to use hydrating products, not just any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It felt exceptionally soft, but I didn&#x27;t actually see a difference.</li>
            <li>and wow... I could actually see the difference in the smoothness of my under eye area.</li>
            <li>poor quality; mostly water, would not buy this product again, don&#x27;t recommend it al all, don&#x27;t try it at all</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember any reviewer mentioning that hyaluronic acid makes your face feel tight and dry when applied with water (which you&#x27;re supposed to do), so I thought I&#x27;d mention it, but I see it really plumps up my face all day, and makes a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin, without oily residues from other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product that I&#x27;ve been using for a little less than a year now.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;d never think some serum, that feels like water could moisturize so much.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and well packaged,I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Nice to use something that retains moisture without grease or that synthetic dimethicone slick and doesn&#x27;t automatically clog the pores.</li>
            <li> I was using a much more expensive brand of HA that wasn&#x27;t nearly this nice.  </li>
            <li> Other big cosmetics companies sell products with this as a main ingredient for much more!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to know if it is actually doing any good though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, leaves your skin visably smoother.</li>
            <li> Because it has dry feel and doesn&#x27;t make my facial skin red, I liked it first.  </li>
            <li> Among four lotions/serums, this one left lest smoothness and hydration right after application also after 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> First off, the first time I applied this it stung pretty fiercely for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any  problems with my skin, one tiny crease above my lip and when I smile which I love to do, a few under my eyes</li>
            <li> My skin felt very soft and the under eye</li>
            <li> After just celebrating my 25th birthday I suddenly noticed my once oily skin becoming increasingly dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> The Professional Skin Therapist I go to, recommends Hyaluronic Acid Gel for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The ones around my eyes have disappeared, but not the medium one on my forehead or the vertical ones near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> sensitive skin</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s the perfect base for a DIY vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> When you apply it feels as if you just applied water to your face, except it sinks in right</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin feeling a little smoother, but otherwise I really can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference.</li>
            <li> then found &#x27;Super&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer and compared with other lotions including this product by applying different part of my arm.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (very oily t-zone, normal cheeks) and even though my skin would always be oily, it would still feel tight and be flaky.</li>
            <li> It became apparent to me that I have dehydrated oily skin and that I needed to use hydrating products, not just any moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It felt exceptionally soft, but I didn&#x27;t actually see a difference.</li>
            <li> and wow... I could actually see the difference in the smoothness of my under eye area.</li>
            <li> poor quality; mostly water, would not buy this product again, don&#x27;t recommend it al all, don&#x27;t try it at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember any reviewer mentioning that hyaluronic acid makes your face feel tight and dry when applied with water (which you&#x27;re supposed to do), so I thought I&#x27;d mention it, but I see it really plumps up my face all day, and makes a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin, without oily residues from other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that I&#x27;ve been using for a little less than a year now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not actual pure hyaluronic acid, but hyaluronic acid is the main ingredient and it has very few other ingredients (Hyaluronic Acid, distilled water, potassium sorbate, citric acid).</li>
            <li> ; I looked up phenoxyethanol on the EWG skin deep database, and it seems moderately okay in low concentrations, but if I had known this artificial preservative was in here</li>
            <li> should mean it&#x27;s pure, shouldn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old female with very pale skin and indented acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin look plumper.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only 15 dollars and you only need a few drops each time, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I want to try it mixed with other ingredients</li>
            <li> Ever since learning the difference between dry skin (needs oil) and dehydrated skin (needs water/moisture)</li>
            <li> you skin is dry again or broke out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only slightly thicker than water.</li>
            <li> I use it after shower on wet skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewer said this is just hyaluronic acid and water.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small ammount</li>
            <li> product comes in in a dark glass bottle with a pipette.</li>
            <li> But if the air is very dry then it will not work and might it might actually make it worse (by pulling the moisture out of your skin).</li>
            <li> and I still need to wear powder and blot during the day, just less often than before.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have slight allergy to this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Others are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lines were much less noticable than before.</li>
            <li> Basically, the serum and your moisturizer work together to hydrate your face, so wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with a base lotion and a few other products and the combination seems to be working well on the fine lines I have.  </li>
            <li> Really disliked.</li>
            <li> JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.I HAVE A COMBINATION SKIN AND WANT TO HYDRATE MY SKIN.WHEN</li>
            <li> you will notice the difference in few days..</li>
            <li> So even though I hate adding layers to my face, I don&#x27;t really see this as an extra step</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so bummed though because i am pregnant now and cant use it :(</li>
            <li> I just used plain soap and water to wash it off.</li>
            <li> - I think I might have allergy to this product, not sure.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Coconut oil , Argon oil so with the comb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just got it and it contains &amp;#34;Hyaluronics</li>
            <li> I -hate- the feeling of having a layer of product on my face, and</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can tell this product smooth&#x27;s out my face prior to putting on my make up, I think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> this is really great stuff.  love the smooth feel it leaves on my face I use it as I go to bed and before I put on make up,.  great mosturizer</li>
            <li> it is advertised as a gel--but it is a serum--i wanted a gel!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to know if it is actually doing any good though.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that I&#x27;ve been using for a little less than a year now. I have combination skin (very oily t-zone, normal cheeks) and even though my skin would always be oily, it would still feel tight and be flaky. Applying moisturizers didn&#x27;t really work - they just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t solve anything. Ever since learning the difference between dry skin (needs oil) and dehydrated skin (needs water/moisture) everything has started to make a lot more sense to me. It became apparent to me that I have dehydrated oily skin and that I needed to use hydrating products, not just any moisturizer. The ingredient best known to add/retain moisture to the skin is hyaluronic acid. It is in tons of moisturizers, but my skin is very clog prone and instead of trying dozens of creams hoping to find one that didn&#x27;t clog me, I just opted for this pure hyaluronic acid instead. It&#x27;s not actual pure hyaluronic acid, but hyaluronic acid is the main ingredient and it has very few other ingredients (Hyaluronic Acid, distilled water, potassium sorbate, citric acid). So the chances of it breaking anyone out are very small.&lt;br /&gt;Results: in the beginning I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my skin since using this. It felt exceptionally soft, but I didn&#x27;t actually see a difference. I just kept using it though, but once I went on a vacation I did not take it with me to save on weight. While on vacation I noticed my skin getting less &#x27;nice&#x27;, but didn&#x27;t think it was because I stopped using this product. Back home however, I started using this again and then I noticed the difference. My skin was getting nicer again. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily ever since and I&#x27;ve been loving it. The results have been very gradual, but now I notice that my skin is a lot happier. The main thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin just feels a lot more balanced. It feels comfortable, even without moisturizer, and the flakes are gone. I also noticed that my skin has actually gotten lessoily. I still have oily skin and I still need to wear powder and blot during the day, just less often than before.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in in a dark glass bottle with a pipette. It&#x27;s very hygienic and easy to use. I just squeeze out 3 drops and that is plenty for my face and neck. The product itself is called a gel, but it is much more liquid than that. It&#x27;s only slightly thicker than water. When you apply it feels as if you just applied water to your face, except it sinks in right away.&lt;br /&gt;As someone with oily skin I -hate- the feeling of having a layer of product on my face, and I can safely say that this literally feels as if you have nothing on your face. It&#x27;s gone instantly. So even though I hate adding layers to my face, I don&#x27;t really see this as an extra step and I have no problem using it day and night.&lt;br /&gt;A thing that I read about hyuluronic acid though, is that it pulls moisture to your skin from the air. But if the air is very dry then it will not work and might it might actually make it worse (by pulling the moisture out of your skin). So to make sure it works properly, it&#x27;s best to apply it to damp skin. That way you&#x27;re sure there&#x27;s always water available to the hylaronic acid to hold on to. Used like that, it has really helped my dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;The price of this product is a steal. It&#x27;s only 15 dollars and you only need a few drops each time, so it lasts a long time. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Also nice: it&#x27;s the perfect base for a DIY vitamin C serum. In the PM I like to add a bit of ascorbic acid to the serum on my hand, wait a minute for it to dissolve and then apply my fresh vit C to my face. When I do this I use 4 drops of the serum instead of 3.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product if you have dehydrated skin, for a great price. Don&#x27;t expect miracle results right away though, give it some time.</li>
            <li> I really like this gel. I use it around my eyes before I apply my eye cream and it seems to make my eye cream work better.</li>
            <li> Im so glad I bought it!!! I kept reading that it&#x27;s a great way to moisturize but I couldn&#x27;t buy it pure anywhere, only creams that contained it. So I decided to try and order. And i don&#x27;t regret that decision. Great product especially in the winter. It keeps my skin smooth and feeling fresh even in the most radical temperature changes.</li>
            <li> I have slight allergy to this&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know - I think I might have allergy to this product, not sure.  I want to try it mixed with other ingredients</li>
            <li> I love the feel of a serum versus a cream now.  I add a drop of Jojoba oil to this as well and my skin feels amazingly smooth! I&#x27;ll probably never go back to store bought creams.  100% serums are IT!</li>
            <li> After just celebrating my 25th birthday I suddenly noticed my once oily skin becoming increasingly dry and flaky. I read about pure hyaluronic acid moisturizer gel on The Beauty Department after Lauren Conrad&#x27;s makeup artist specifically recommended this brand. Needless to say, am very satisfied with how moisturized and soft my skin feels after I shower every morning (and before I put on SPF 30 or higher) and plan to order more of this stuff once it&#x27;s re-stocked.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product. I keep it in my purse and use it anytime I need: at home or at work on a regular basis. I noticed difference after using for who weeks. I use it after shower on wet skin. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Some other reviewer said this is just hyaluronic acid and water. I couldn&#x27;t find the ingredients in the description, but &amp;#34;Pure 100% Hyaluronic Acid&amp;#34; should mean it&#x27;s pure, shouldn&#x27;t it? Unfortunately, I just got it and it contains &amp;#34;Hyaluronics [sic] Acid, Distilled Water, Phenoxyethanol.&amp;#34; I looked up phenoxyethanol on the EWG skin deep database, and it seems moderately okay in low concentrations, but if I had known this artificial preservative was in here, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it. Can&#x27;t speak to how well it works, since I might return it yet. Bummer.</li>
            <li> This did NOTHING for me. Really disliked. I feel ripped off. I gave it a lot of time and still nothing...</li>
            <li> Feels like a regular essential oil or a great moisturizer.  Nothing different....maybe too soon.  Will update if there is a change!</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old female with very pale skin and indented acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin look plumper.&lt;br /&gt;Good for use with a derma roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product about 2 or 3 times and everytime it delivers great results. My skin is clearer and smoother after each use. Yes, you must adhere to the proper timing if you expect good results. I just used plain soap and water to wash it off.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much difference in my skin or wrinkles but I do like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Nice to use something that retains moisture without grease or that synthetic dimethicone slick and doesn&#x27;t automatically clog the pores.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day as a moisturizer and some of my wrinkles have disappeared all together. Others are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 6 months. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Ok, I have been trying to get rid of my fine lines under my eyes for quite a while now... I have used Vitamin c products, retinol products, moisturizers, etc. and nothing really worked. I smoothed this over my entire face last night including under my eye area and wow... I could actually see the difference in the smoothness of my under eye area. The lines were much less noticable than before. This morning I used it again... and same thing. My skin felt very soft and the under eye are was so much more smooth. Interested in what a few weeks will do! I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> if it s a miracle hyaluronic acid.I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT IT S JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.I HAVE A COMBINATION SKIN AND WANT TO HYDRATE MY SKIN.WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON MY FACE IT S LIGHT BUT DO NOTHING.NO MOUSTRIZE NO HYDRATE.ABSOLUTELY IT S GOING TO TRASH.I DONT HAVE A PLACE THIS KIND OF CHEAP THING IN MY CABINET..</li>
            <li> This made an obvious difference the morning after I used it. My skin felt smooth and plump.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase this when I run out - always.</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer.  I was using a much more expensive brand of HA that wasn&#x27;t nearly this nice.  My skin is soft, plump and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Thanks for a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product ow twice.  The Professional Skin Therapist I go to, recommends Hyaluronic Acid Gel for my skin.  I chose this seller initially because their price was better.  Found out that their product was every bit as good as the other brand I had been buying!  I make my choice based on the best price for the best product, and this was the way to go!  Also, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the order &amp; shipment experience going thru AMAZON.COM for these purchases.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Hyaluronic Acid before and found this one just so so and not so special.</li>
            <li> This serum does reduce your fine wrinkles, but not deep ones.  The ones around my eyes have disappeared, but not the medium one on my forehead or the vertical ones near my mouth.  Although it diminishes fine lines and does make your face smoother, it is not permanent.  If I stop using it for several days, I see my lines appearing again.  Basically, the serum and your moisturizer work together to hydrate your face, so wrinkles are less noticeable.  It works well especially for the money.</li>
            <li> An amazing product for my oily skin that still needs extra hydration. Tried another brand but the dropper is nothing in comparison than to this serum that is sturdy and made of glass rather than plastic. Purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Its a good hydrating.. just started to use it. I ordered it for the first time. with more very soon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin but it did feel like a good addition under my moisturizer.  I probably wont buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my cosmetic bag!  I cannot run out of this product as the elasticity in the skin depends on this serum!  It is an incredible maintenance product to help defy the signs of aging.  Not only do I use it, my former husband uses it!</li>
            <li> Gives the skin the perfect hydration and glow, especially age 40+. Feels very nourrishing. Can be used under another&lt;br /&gt;creme as well as alone. Love it!</li>
            <li> I mix this with a base lotion and a few other products and the combination seems to be working well on the fine lines I have.  I am 49 and I was starting to show my age.  I have recently gotten a lot of compliments about my glowing skin and people telling me I look well rested.  I am not well rested because I suffer from insomnia so the combination of products I use seem to be working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any  problems with my skin, one tiny crease above my lip and when I smile which I love to do, a few under my eyes but I applied this as soon as I got it yesterday, used it twice now and I work third shift so when I went to put on my B.M. I notice my skin looked more even more toned and yes my under eye wrinkles was lessened...very happy with only one application I have combo. sensitive skin so I love I can apply w/o a oily feeling, lotions go on feeling good but with in ten min. you skin is dry again or broke out I usually use Coconut oil , Argon oil so with the comb. of the oils and H.A. Serum it can only get better and better.. Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it work though out the winter months... [[ASIN:B006HWGSEM (1 oz. / 30 ml) Pure 100% Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer Gel -(D) AntiAging, Firming Serum]]</li>
            <li> I use this all the time this all time it does what it is supposed too be doing will reorder  in about  two weeks thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have difficulty determining if any of my altrnative medicine taken in pill form actually improves my health. The Hyaluronic Gel difintely improved healing of scar tissue from stitches and my wife has been using it on her scars after surgery.</li>
            <li> it take about 2 weeks and you see change, your face looks very soft,I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continuing to buy every monts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanks for your Product</li>
            <li> I bought this Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer when I ordered a micro needle derma roller. Because it has dry feel and doesn&#x27;t make my facial skin red, I liked it first.  However, thought it is over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then found &#x27;Super&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer and compared with other lotions including this product by applying different part of my arm. Among four lotions/serums, this one left lest smoothness and hydration right after application also after 2 hours.  The best was Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum, next is Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, then Organics Vitamin C balancing Toner.  This serum is the last one for short term effects on skin.</li>
            <li> poor quality; mostly water, would not buy this product again, don&#x27;t recommend it al all, don&#x27;t try it at all</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product that does not leave your skin feeling dry with the H Acid. I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been using it for very long or very consistently, but I love how it feels and how it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drop the size of a chickpea can cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very liquid and you get excellent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I have been looking for because creams make me break out. Well, practically everything makes me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t claim that it has been a game changer for my skin yet, but it is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting, because when I put it on, my skin feels kind of tight and dry (that&#x27;s why 4 stars), but I just put a moisturizer on top.  The beauty is that it really helps the look of my fine lines and wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t remember any reviewer mentioning that hyaluronic acid makes your face feel tight and dry when applied with water (which you&#x27;re supposed to do), so I thought I&#x27;d mention it, but I see it really plumps up my face all day, and makes a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin, without oily residues from other moisturizers.  You&#x27;d never think some serum, that feels like water could moisturize so much.</li>
            <li> First off, the first time I applied this it stung pretty fiercely for a few minutes. It does leave my skin feeling a little smoother, but otherwise I really can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference. I&#x27;ll keep using it, and if I notice a difference I will definitely update this.</li>
            <li> Still using it, very good results. Highly recommend it, leaves your skin visably smoother. You only need to use a small ammount nd make sure you have a good moisturizer to use with it</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on smooth and my skin drinks it up. A little goes a long way. The shipping was fast and well packaged,I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I have some early signs of wrinkles in my forehead and this product is amazing! It is cheap also .. Other big cosmetics companies sell products with this as a main ingredient for much more! this hydrate the skin, you should use it before your moisturizer (dont use it alone) you will notice the difference in few days..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so bummed though because i am pregnant now and cant use it :( i read that its not proven to be harmful but better to be in the safe side..</li>
