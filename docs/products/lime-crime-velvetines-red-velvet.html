            <li>Great look and feel of the gloss/matte finish.</li>
            <li>Great staying power</li>
            <li>The vendor packaged this lip gloss nicely, it arrived perfectly.</li>

            <li>but, it looks amazing on!  </li>
            <li>Very happy:)</li>
            <li>It does have that great signature smell though! :)</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I am fair.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good quality long-lasting color, that&#x27;s not it.</li>
            <li>But it is a good alternative to Ruby Woo by Mac.</li>
            <li>Goes on like a gloss and dries this gorgeous matte texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and lovely matte.</li>
            <li>Very very Pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>I will say that the pigment is lovely and the payoff is great, but even with a primer, this product is sooo drying.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I purchased it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is  also my first Lime Crime product and I am very impressed.</li>

            <li>AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love the way this color looks!</li>
            <li>No flaking and peeling like most &amp;#34; stay on &amp;#34; lipsticks!</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments when I wore this, goes on as a gloss and dries to a velvet matte finish that stays on!</li>
            <li>Love the look of it on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this came three days before the estimated date!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>so when I found this I fell in love!</li>
            <li>This is the most perfect product for the perfect red lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>One word: AMAZING.</li>
            <li>simply amazing.</li>
            <li>and i thought it was nice and decided to go on amazon since it was sold out one limecrime website.</li>
            <li>I applied it this morning and was impressed at how clean and completely smooth it went on.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 something fair complexioned lady who has been searching for a perfect red all my life.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and stays on quite well, unless you eat something with a good amount of grease in it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful true color and would most def.</li>
            <li>It wears off very easily on the middle/wet area of the lips.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lipstick/stain/gloss EVER!!!!!!</li>
            <li>love love love love love love !!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily like lip gloss but dries quickly and becomes a beautiful matte color.</li>
            <li>Since receiving it has quickly become one of my favorite make-up items I own!</li>
            <li>It is the most perfect red and it is amazing on the lips</li>
            <li>then you get a good &#x27;Joker Face&#x27; look and have to make an escape to the nearest bathroom to fix, which is easy &amp; quick to do as well!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t ware off bright and vibrant!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the color.  </li>
            <li>love you doe</li>
            <li>deer!!1 :)</li>
            <li>my favorite part: it is never sticky.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade of red!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this lip stick.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this lipstick.</li>
            <li>love the way the gloss looks and feels.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect red for all occasions.</li>
            <li>I have received only compliments from men and women when taking this perfect matte-finish lipstick for a spin.</li>
            <li>Take my word for it. :)</li>
            <li>It is the best red lipstick ever and the best red color you can have</li>
            <li>Wonderful matte red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Okay, I can&#x27;t decide if I like this or not.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s quite stunning, and a lip liner helps to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and it stays put for hours!</li>
            <li>Love the matte finish</li>
            <li>I love the application of this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>Why they were rushing to the bathroom to apply more lipstick.</li>
            <li>Perfect color of red...</li>
            <li>I do recommend this to anyone though! :)</li>
            <li>The color is stunning and no lip liner is needed to get definition and maintain coverage.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>Love the formula and the way it looks on my lips</li>
            <li>It can be a bit drying on the lips, but considering how great it looks it really does not bother me.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells (cookies) and the way it feels, it truly makes your lips feel like velvet and</li>
            <li>I love this lipstain</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s all amazing !!!</li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>:)))</li>
            <li>What they don&#x27;t mention is it dries your lips out, no matter how many times you exfoliate or care for your lips.</li>
            <li>A LOT MORE OF LIME CRIME PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Very rich and opaque colour.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is even better than a stain, and the color is incredibly true!</li>
            <li>It dries perfectly, and stays on all day long!  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t explain or express other than that this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Cool how it goes on as a gloss and then mattes out!</li>
            <li>most unique formula.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply stays put for hours even after a meal.  </li>
            <li>I received my order very quickly which tends to happen when I order from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Stays on well and doesn&#x27;t smear easily</li>
            <li>it dries quickly to matt- velvety and very light.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and it will last you a while.</li>
            <li>Beautiful red!</li>
            <li>Velvetine formulas are always the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>I reapplied it AGAIN, over the old gloss, and wasn&#x27;t happy with how quickly it clumped again.</li>
            <li>Never smears, you&#x27;ll look like a perfect little doll.</li>
            <li>I used a lip brush to apply it and it went on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product glides on smooth and dries matte.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy for a red lover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stays looking great even after several hours and eating without caution.</li>
            <li>Not the actual Lime Crime but a great knock off.</li>
            <li>This lipstick goes on so smooth and dries matte.</li>
            <li>The color is a great red, and it does not crack when it drys.</li>
            <li>beautiful color and long lasting/long wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the highest quality of sued/velvet on your lips in a GORGEOUS matte finish that is almost completely transfer resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is very rich and bright, and it stays on for several hours even after drinking or eating.</li>
            <li>You should be fine with one swipe, this stuff is pretty opaque. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how slick it is, easy to apply and incredibly beautiful color.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and it&#x27;s the most beautiful, vibrant red.</li>
            <li>Goes on wet (like a gloss) but dries to a beautiful matte finish.</li>
            <li>Lime crime is a really great brand and is money well spent.</li>
            <li>it really gives that beautiful velvet color that i have been looking for from all my red lipsticks that i never had</li>
            <li>I have say that the red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I reapply after lunch and it stays true until I arrive home after 6pm.</li>
            <li>bit of background: I work in quite a sedentary job and am always in a cool environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes them look so full.</li>
            <li>The lipstick actually taste good too</li>
            <li>overall a good product</li>
            <li>One suggestion: make sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li>and it is really a bright, fun red.  </li>
            <li>BUT A WORTHY KNOCK OFF.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and a beyond amazing product: perfect shade of red, highly pigmented, easy application, dries on matte without drying out lips, long lasting, and adorable packaging!</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty color</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>Just received my new favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing new, or innovative.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, great pigment, no transfer!</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s red velvet magic!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and as described!  </li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful deep red and it&#x27;s the first one I use that does not smear easily at all.</li>
            <li>Amazing red matte color!</li>
            <li>Amazing red velvet scent.  </li>
            <li>Over all totally worth every cent.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>As far as the product itself, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but this product its worth it</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite matte lip creams.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is a perfect gift from someone who enjoys classic looks, edgy looks, who likes to stand out...</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful red that last all day.</li>
            <li>Eitherway, great color, but be mindful of the small details.</li>
            <li>It does lasts long, but still wears off with time, other then that great product!</li>
            <li>AT ALL!!!! It&#x27;s worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve already ordered Red Velvet and I&#x27;m waiting for it to come in the mail any day now :)</li>
            <li>But it really is a very nice deep red shade, that I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Stays on great (really hard to get off tho).</li>
            <li>but it is absolutely gorgeous once you get applying it down!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I definitely like the color, but would have prefered more moisture and not having to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments - will definitely buy again soon!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buyin more.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend told me about this product because I love red lips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vibrant and bold.</li>
            <li>I just noticed after several pecks on my love&#x27;s lips, that he had slightly more color that looked suspiciously like my red velvet lipstick. . .</li>
            <li>This color not only works on me but all my friends (variety of skin types) have tried this and love it as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and would buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li>I am very thankful for one reason...it doesn&#x27;t rub off!</li>
            <li>First off I want to mention the staying power.</li>
            <li>And also those who wants to rock the pin up, matte, or vintage look!</li>
            <li>This shade is more of a candy red, akin to a pokeball.</li>
            <li>And I love me some red lips!!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, long lasting color and not leaving much stain.</li>
            <li>Even though the price was some what high, I found this product to be well worth it.</li>
            <li>I mean, I love the shade, but it&#x27;s definitely more of a spring/summer shade rather than a fall/winter shade.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this product has any wax in it like most of the stain long wear lip color products.</li>
            <li>Very matte and pretty.</li>
            <li>The best long lasting red ever will order again when need a new one!</li>
            <li>I love how creamy the velvetines is at first and then when you let it dry, it stays matte all day!</li>
            <li>You might want to use your own lipstick brush because it&#x27;s very vibrant and if you mess up</li>
            <li>Bought it a few months ago and i am in love with it!</li>
            <li>It is very vibrant and it will not come off until you are ready.</li>
            <li>I rate it very high, and it beats most of the high priced long wear matt products I&#x27;ve purchased at Sapora.</li>
            <li>It has real staying power.</li>
            <li>Was very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Some people might think that $20 is too much to spend for a lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And fast shipping</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and glossy and dries to a matte finish instantly!</li>
            <li>It applies way too much product on your lips, hence the clumping.</li>
            <li>As much as it stays on/stains, it also transfers on to things.</li>
            <li>It really stains your lips, which given I didn&#x27;t know that was a surprise.</li>
            <li>Dries beautifully matte without destroying my already constantly dry lips.</li>
            <li>Will buy more of these limecrime, perhaps the other color.</li>
            <li>I felt like Doe Deere made it out to be a original product, and it simply isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>is does not dry quickly so it may smear hear and there.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty rich and deep red.</li>
            <li>And I thought it would be a deep, sexy red</li>
            <li>Has a classic look.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it was slightly more bluish red.</li>
            <li>I am an amateur at make-up period,but this product made it very easy for me to look like a pro.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a long time but red velvet was much better</li>
            <li>Never will I use normal lip stick</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the &amp;#34;Perfect Red Lips.&amp;#34; Also, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great long lasting RED stain, however it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for new Velvetine colors this fall.</li>
            <li>i have super dry lips</li>
            <li>On the downside, it DOES transfer in some situations: heavy kissing, greasy food, and don&#x27;t EVER apply lip balm on top, that will cause a huge mess.</li>
            <li>The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5stars is because I really hoped this was more of a deeper red (blue red instead of true red)</li>
            <li>The shade is a deep red that color remains true- doesn&#x27;t wear or wear off to some bizarre orange or pink.</li>
            <li>It is what it is- from first application at 6am to 5 hrs later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THIS IS NO ORDINARY LIP STAIN.</li>
            <li>the color looks nothing like it did on the website or the youtube video of a woman applying her&#x27;s on plus you half to apply it so many times to acheive a deep look and</li>
            <li>Other than the pretty packaging, I don&#x27;t really get the hype of this product.</li>
            <li>and it is hard to correct mistakes because it more smears the color than wipe off.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft as you wear it and</li>
            <li>It seems completely undisturbed by hours of sipping from glasses and smooching your lover.</li>
            <li>This looks classy or packed with attitude depending on how you wear it.</li>
            <li>Was so surprised bec</li>
            <li>It dries like a stain and is completely matte.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s not TOTALLY COMPLETELY TRANSFER PROOF, it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheaper product alternative: NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream for $5.99 and comes in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed in swatches of this shade (especially in the ones on the Limecrime site itself), it appears way darker than it really is.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and opaque and it actually stays on for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the color is super flattering and is totally what I expected.</li>
            <li>It lasts long but doesn&#x27;t really stay as you&#x27;d expect from a stay-on color.</li>
            <li>It does everything everyone said it would--went on super-easy and cleanly and dried to a total matte finish within a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>It really does give your lips that velvety appearance, but if you aren&#x27;t careful it will stain your lips.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get it right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lush, romantic matte red with a liberal dash of glamor.</li>
            <li>There is no excuse for the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>but with this no matter how dry my lips feel it keeps them VELVETy soft.</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to get it right when putting it on because it does take some precision due to it drying fast</li>
            <li>quite content with my lip gloss purchase, received it really quickly just find the texture of the lip gloss is very watery which makes it difficult to apply but</li>
            <li>Overall, this give a beautifully classy red lip that will last all day long.</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a good quality long-lasting color, that&#x27;s not it.</li>
            <li> But it is a good alternative to Ruby Woo by Mac.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a gloss and dries this gorgeous matte texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and lovely matte.</li>
            <li> Very very Pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I will say that the pigment is lovely and the payoff is great, but even with a primer, this product is sooo drying.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is  also my first Lime Crime product and I am very impressed.</li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love the way this color looks!</li>
            <li> No flaking and peeling like most &amp;#34; stay on &amp;#34; lipsticks!</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments when I wore this, goes on as a gloss and dries to a velvet matte finish that stays on!</li>
            <li> Love the look of it on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this came three days before the estimated date!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> so when I found this I fell in love!</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect product for the perfect red lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> One word: AMAZING.</li>
            <li> simply amazing.</li>
            <li> and i thought it was nice and decided to go on amazon since it was sold out one limecrime website.</li>
            <li> I applied it this morning and was impressed at how clean and completely smooth it went on.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 something fair complexioned lady who has been searching for a perfect red all my life.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily and stays on quite well, unless you eat something with a good amount of grease in it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful true color and would most def.</li>
            <li> It wears off very easily on the middle/wet area of the lips.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lipstick/stain/gloss EVER!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love love love love love love !!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily like lip gloss but dries quickly and becomes a beautiful matte color.</li>
            <li> Since receiving it has quickly become one of my favorite make-up items I own!</li>
            <li> It is the most perfect red and it is amazing on the lips</li>
            <li> then you get a good &#x27;Joker Face&#x27; look and have to make an escape to the nearest bathroom to fix, which is easy &amp; quick to do as well!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t ware off bright and vibrant!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the color.  </li>
            <li> love you doe</li>
            <li> deer!!1 :)</li>
            <li> my favorite part: it is never sticky.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lip stick.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this lipstick.</li>
            <li> love the way the gloss looks and feels.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect red for all occasions.</li>
            <li> I have received only compliments from men and women when taking this perfect matte-finish lipstick for a spin.</li>
            <li> Take my word for it. :)</li>
            <li> It is the best red lipstick ever and the best red color you can have</li>
            <li> Wonderful matte red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Okay, I can&#x27;t decide if I like this or not.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s quite stunning, and a lip liner helps to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and it stays put for hours!</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish</li>
            <li> I love the application of this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> Why they were rushing to the bathroom to apply more lipstick.</li>
            <li> Perfect color of red...</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to anyone though! :)</li>
            <li> The color is stunning and no lip liner is needed to get definition and maintain coverage.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> Love the formula and the way it looks on my lips</li>
            <li> It can be a bit drying on the lips, but considering how great it looks it really does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells (cookies) and the way it feels, it truly makes your lips feel like velvet and</li>
            <li> I love this lipstain</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s all amazing !!!</li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> :)))</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t mention is it dries your lips out, no matter how many times you exfoliate or care for your lips.</li>
            <li> A LOT MORE OF LIME CRIME PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Very rich and opaque colour.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is even better than a stain, and the color is incredibly true!</li>
            <li> It dries perfectly, and stays on all day long!  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t explain or express other than that this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Cool how it goes on as a gloss and then mattes out!</li>
            <li> most unique formula.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply stays put for hours even after a meal.  </li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly which tends to happen when I order from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Stays on well and doesn&#x27;t smear easily</li>
            <li> it dries quickly to matt- velvety and very light.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and it will last you a while.</li>
            <li> Beautiful red!</li>
            <li> Velvetine formulas are always the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> I reapplied it AGAIN, over the old gloss, and wasn&#x27;t happy with how quickly it clumped again.</li>
            <li> Never smears, you&#x27;ll look like a perfect little doll.</li>
            <li> I used a lip brush to apply it and it went on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product glides on smooth and dries matte.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy for a red lover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stays looking great even after several hours and eating without caution.</li>
            <li> Not the actual Lime Crime but a great knock off.</li>
            <li> This lipstick goes on so smooth and dries matte.</li>
            <li> The color is a great red, and it does not crack when it drys.</li>
            <li> beautiful color and long lasting/long wearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the highest quality of sued/velvet on your lips in a GORGEOUS matte finish that is almost completely transfer resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is very rich and bright, and it stays on for several hours even after drinking or eating.</li>
            <li> You should be fine with one swipe, this stuff is pretty opaque. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how slick it is, easy to apply and incredibly beautiful color.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and it&#x27;s the most beautiful, vibrant red.</li>
            <li> Goes on wet (like a gloss) but dries to a beautiful matte finish.</li>
            <li> Lime crime is a really great brand and is money well spent.</li>
            <li> it really gives that beautiful velvet color that i have been looking for from all my red lipsticks that i never had</li>
            <li> I have say that the red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I reapply after lunch and it stays true until I arrive home after 6pm.</li>
            <li> bit of background: I work in quite a sedentary job and am always in a cool environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes them look so full.</li>
            <li> The lipstick actually taste good too</li>
            <li> overall a good product</li>
            <li> One suggestion: make sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li> and it is really a bright, fun red.  </li>
            <li> BUT A WORTHY KNOCK OFF.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and a beyond amazing product: perfect shade of red, highly pigmented, easy application, dries on matte without drying out lips, long lasting, and adorable packaging!</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty color</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> Just received my new favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing new, or innovative.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, great pigment, no transfer!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s red velvet magic!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and as described!  </li>
            <li> The color is a beautiful deep red and it&#x27;s the first one I use that does not smear easily at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing red matte color!</li>
            <li> Amazing red velvet scent.  </li>
            <li> Over all totally worth every cent.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> As far as the product itself, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> but this product its worth it</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite matte lip creams.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is a perfect gift from someone who enjoys classic looks, edgy looks, who likes to stand out...</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful red that last all day.</li>
            <li> Eitherway, great color, but be mindful of the small details.</li>
            <li> It does lasts long, but still wears off with time, other then that great product!</li>
            <li> AT ALL!!!! It&#x27;s worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve already ordered Red Velvet and I&#x27;m waiting for it to come in the mail any day now :)</li>
            <li> But it really is a very nice deep red shade, that I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Stays on great (really hard to get off tho).</li>
            <li> but it is absolutely gorgeous once you get applying it down!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I definitely like the color, but would have prefered more moisture and not having to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments - will definitely buy again soon!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buyin more.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend told me about this product because I love red lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so vibrant and bold.</li>
            <li> I just noticed after several pecks on my love&#x27;s lips, that he had slightly more color that looked suspiciously like my red velvet lipstick. . .</li>
            <li> This color not only works on me but all my friends (variety of skin types) have tried this and love it as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and would buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I am very thankful for one reason...it doesn&#x27;t rub off!</li>
            <li> First off I want to mention the staying power.</li>
            <li> And also those who wants to rock the pin up, matte, or vintage look!</li>
            <li> This shade is more of a candy red, akin to a pokeball.</li>
            <li> And I love me some red lips!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, long lasting color and not leaving much stain.</li>
            <li> Even though the price was some what high, I found this product to be well worth it.</li>
            <li> I mean, I love the shade, but it&#x27;s definitely more of a spring/summer shade rather than a fall/winter shade.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this product has any wax in it like most of the stain long wear lip color products.</li>
            <li> Very matte and pretty.</li>
            <li> The best long lasting red ever will order again when need a new one!</li>
            <li> I love how creamy the velvetines is at first and then when you let it dry, it stays matte all day!</li>
            <li> You might want to use your own lipstick brush because it&#x27;s very vibrant and if you mess up</li>
            <li> Bought it a few months ago and i am in love with it!</li>
            <li> It is very vibrant and it will not come off until you are ready.</li>
            <li> I rate it very high, and it beats most of the high priced long wear matt products I&#x27;ve purchased at Sapora.</li>
            <li> It has real staying power.</li>
            <li> Was very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Some people might think that $20 is too much to spend for a lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And fast shipping</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and glossy and dries to a matte finish instantly!</li>
            <li> It applies way too much product on your lips, hence the clumping.</li>
            <li> As much as it stays on/stains, it also transfers on to things.</li>
            <li> It really stains your lips, which given I didn&#x27;t know that was a surprise.</li>
            <li> Dries beautifully matte without destroying my already constantly dry lips.</li>
            <li> Will buy more of these limecrime, perhaps the other color.</li>
            <li> I felt like Doe Deere made it out to be a original product, and it simply isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> is does not dry quickly so it may smear hear and there.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty rich and deep red.</li>
            <li> And I thought it would be a deep, sexy red</li>
            <li> Has a classic look.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it was slightly more bluish red.</li>
            <li> I am an amateur at make-up period,but this product made it very easy for me to look like a pro.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time but red velvet was much better</li>
            <li> Never will I use normal lip stick</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the &amp;#34;Perfect Red Lips.&amp;#34; Also, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great long lasting RED stain, however it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for new Velvetine colors this fall.</li>
            <li> i have super dry lips</li>
            <li> On the downside, it DOES transfer in some situations: heavy kissing, greasy food, and don&#x27;t EVER apply lip balm on top, that will cause a huge mess.</li>
            <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5stars is because I really hoped this was more of a deeper red (blue red instead of true red)</li>
            <li> The shade is a deep red that color remains true- doesn&#x27;t wear or wear off to some bizarre orange or pink.</li>
            <li> It is what it is- from first application at 6am to 5 hrs later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THIS IS NO ORDINARY LIP STAIN.</li>
            <li> the color looks nothing like it did on the website or the youtube video of a woman applying her&#x27;s on plus you half to apply it so many times to acheive a deep look and</li>
            <li> Other than the pretty packaging, I don&#x27;t really get the hype of this product.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to correct mistakes because it more smears the color than wipe off.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft as you wear it and</li>
            <li> It seems completely undisturbed by hours of sipping from glasses and smooching your lover.</li>
            <li> This looks classy or packed with attitude depending on how you wear it.</li>
            <li> Was so surprised bec</li>
            <li> It dries like a stain and is completely matte.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s not TOTALLY COMPLETELY TRANSFER PROOF, it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> If you want a cheaper product alternative: NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream for $5.99 and comes in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed in swatches of this shade (especially in the ones on the Limecrime site itself), it appears way darker than it really is.</li>
            <li> The color is vibrant and opaque and it actually stays on for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the color is super flattering and is totally what I expected.</li>
            <li> It lasts long but doesn&#x27;t really stay as you&#x27;d expect from a stay-on color.</li>
            <li> It does everything everyone said it would--went on super-easy and cleanly and dried to a total matte finish within a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It really does give your lips that velvety appearance, but if you aren&#x27;t careful it will stain your lips.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get it right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lush, romantic matte red with a liberal dash of glamor.</li>
            <li> There is no excuse for the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> but with this no matter how dry my lips feel it keeps them VELVETy soft.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get it right when putting it on because it does take some precision due to it drying fast</li>
            <li> quite content with my lip gloss purchase, received it really quickly just find the texture of the lip gloss is very watery which makes it difficult to apply but</li>
            <li> Overall, this give a beautifully classy red lip that will last all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several red lipsticks none of them have have lasted as long or had the same pigment pay off</li>
            <li> , the price is a little high</li>
            <li> Long lasting even after food and drinks.  </li>
            <li> and it is long lasting which means no re-applying!</li>
            <li> Definitely lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> About 1 min later my lips were completely dry.</li>
            <li> If I want red dry, clumpy, sandpaper texture on your lips--</li>
            <li> This matt lip color is wand-applied, and a tiny dab is enough coverage, so this product will last a LONG time!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on liquid and dried completely matte.</li>
            <li> and I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t run and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep buying this as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I will wear this as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> Buying any other product for red lips would be a mistake.</li>
            <li> and stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> But I do need to moisturize my lips when I&#x27;m wearing this product because my lips do tend to dry out.</li>
            <li> It will dry out your lips no matter what.</li>
            <li> my lips have a tendency to dry and peel</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s been wearing this every single day.</li>
            <li> Is good as a base to other reds.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips or fade at all!</li>
            <li> the price that this vendor is charging is excessive especially because you can get this same product for 17 dollars on the lime crime website!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle may seem small, but there&#x27;s definitely enough product in there to last you a while.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, I would just reapply to get the velvet look after a few hours.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a true RED to me.</li>
            <li> Not really me.  </li>
            <li> The color goes on wet and is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I put the color to the test by drinking a glass of water, no color was on the glass, even after my lips got wet.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> You get very little product for the price, the container is tiny.</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> There are other liquid lipsticks</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> will order the other color ASAP!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is if you mess up on your outter lip line on your face you have to wipe off ASAP</li>
            <li> i would half to buy five a month to acheive my look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s can get a bit messy</li>
            <li> I was in the mood for a pop of color in my humble makeup bag and decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> It does not make your lips look dried out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait til hopefully lime crime has a black !</li>
            <li> The product goes on wet, thin but heavily pigmented.</li>
            <li> However, you MUST exfoliate and moisturize at least a few hours before applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cashmere is my everyday color!</li>
            <li> It is very messy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s is so difficult to come off, my ONLY complaint.</li>
            <li> i hardly wear make up</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister for Christmas and had told her that it was coming late.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go a day wearing it without getting at LEAST one compliment on it.</li>
            <li> When it does wear off there it looks really ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as cherry red as I would like. :(</li>
            <li> It can be super-pigmented and tough to remove without cleansing oils or makeup</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong but</li>
            <li> bought this item because I wanted something in a tube that wasn&#x27;t difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, overpriced, and over-hyped.</li>
            <li> I became obsessed with having this lipstick and since the Limecrime website was sold out</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the best i was so happy when i got it in the mail it&#x27;s wonderfully the best xoxox</li>
            <li> This is the BEST lipstick ever. It has real staying power. Only had to re-aply it once, and that was after i ate lunch. A little goes a long way with this stuff. I used a lip brush to apply it and it went on so smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips or fade at all!</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because it was sold out on the Lime crime website!  I absolutely LOVE the color.  This is definitely a going out lipstick.  It is VERY red!</li>
            <li> beautiful color and long lasting/long wearing. not transfer resistant but still an amazing color and product!!! love you doe deer!!1 :)</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty rich and deep red. It took me a few tries to get it right when putting it on because it does take some precision due to it drying fast and it is hard to correct mistakes because it more smears the color than wipe off. It is a very pretty color and I am glad that I purchased it!</li>
            <li> The best long lasting red ever will order again when need a new one! Can&#x27;t wait til hopefully lime crime has a black !</li>
            <li> Amazing red matte color! Easy to apply stays put for hours even after a meal.  I&#x27;ve tried several red lipsticks none of them have have lasted as long or had the same pigment pay off</li>
            <li> Great stuff, long lasting color and not leaving much stain. Will buy more of these limecrime, perhaps the other color. Thanks!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t explain or express other than that this is perfect. i have super dry lips and it goes on like a gloss but dries like a matte. will order the other color ASAP!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it is $47 on Amazon. The Lime Crime website sells it for $20.00. I have say that the red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This matt lip color is wand-applied, and a tiny dab is enough coverage, so this product will last a LONG time!!!!!! The product goes on wet, thin but heavily pigmented. it dries quickly to matt- velvety and very light. I do not believe this product has any wax in it like most of the stain long wear lip color products. Nor does it have a weird fruity taste like many of them. It wont stain your tongue either. Thank goodness! I rate it very high, and it beats most of the high priced long wear matt products I&#x27;ve purchased at Sapora. The shade is a deep red that color remains true- doesn&#x27;t wear or wear off to some bizarre orange or pink. It is what it is- from first application at 6am to 5 hrs later. I reapply after lunch and it stays true until I arrive home after 6pm. I will purchase this again and again, as it is my &#x27;go to&#x27; red. You will be as happy as I am if you order it.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful color.  It feels so soft as you wear it and my favorite part: it is never sticky. Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red!  This product glides on smooth and dries matte.  Definitely found a forever lipstick in this one!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lip stick. I received my order very quickly which tends to happen when I order from Amazon.  Was at a competitive price.  Cute bottle.  Amazing red velvet scent.  Long lasting even after food and drinks.  Perfect matte finish.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lipstick. It goes on liquid and dried completely matte. The color is vibrant and opaque and it actually stays on for quite a while. I want too get all of the Velvetines colors now!</li>
            <li> The Holy Grail of red lippies.  I am a 30 something fair complexioned lady who has been searching for a perfect red all my life.  I can see now why this has been sold out and people are paying 50.00 a tube for it.  It is just that beautiful.  I will wear this as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I love how creamy the velvetines is at first and then when you let it dry, it stays matte all day! and it is long lasting which means no re-applying! I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the &amp;#34;Perfect Red Lips.&amp;#34; Also, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this enough!!! It goes on easily like lip gloss but dries quickly and becomes a beautiful matte color. I can&#x27;t wait for new Velvetine colors this fall.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and received it very quickly. I was ecstatic about receiving it because I follow the pin-up lifestyle religiously and anyone else who does too, knows how often red lipstick has to be applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background: I work in quite a sedentary job and am always in a cool environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way the gloss looks and feels. I applied it this morning and was impressed at how clean and completely smooth it went on. About two hours later, I noticed some clumping on my lips and associated it with me drinking coffee this morning. So I took it off and reapplied the gloss - another two hours later, with no drinking or eating, I noticed it was fuzzing around the edges and getting clumpy and sticky. I reapplied it AGAIN, over the old gloss, and wasn&#x27;t happy with how quickly it clumped again. I&#x27;ve taken it off for the third time today, but will try a different method tomorrow. Perhaps applying lip liner with help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the money, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. If anyone has a tip on how to make the gloss last, please let me know. My NARS lip liner and Besame lipstick lasts me all day and I only have to touch-up, not reapply, once or twice a day. And for someone living the pin-up lifestyle, red lips are everything.</li>
            <li> This was a really great product.You will not regret buying this,it is a matte lipstick that has a very nice color.It goes on like a lip gloss but dries like a lip stick.Lime crime is a really great brand and is money well spent.The color is beautiful and it will last you a while.It is the perfect red for all occasions.Over all totally worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I have received only compliments from men and women when taking this perfect matte-finish lipstick for a spin. It seems completely undisturbed by hours of sipping from glasses and smooching your lover. Never smears, you&#x27;ll look like a perfect little doll. ;-) By the time it FINALLY wears off, it&#x27;s time to go home anyway! This looks classy or packed with attitude depending on how you wear it.</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive lipstick I have ever bought. And let me tell you, you get your money&#x27;s worth. The color is perfect just like the picture. Stays on great (really hard to get off tho). Smells good, Looks good. It shipped very fast! Very very Pleased. Take my word for it. :)</li>
            <li> I just received mine and the color is gorgeous!!!!!!! It is the most perfect red and it is amazing on the lips it makes them look so full. This is  also my first Lime Crime product and I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  It&#x27;s can get a bit messy but, it looks amazing on!  I always get plenty of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Since receiving it has quickly become one of my favorite make-up items I own! Goes on easily and stays on quite well, unless you eat something with a good amount of grease in it then you get a good &#x27;Joker Face&#x27; look and have to make an escape to the nearest bathroom to fix, which is easy &amp; quick to do as well! Some water and paper towel will handle&lt;br /&gt;Over all I adore this</li>
            <li> This is the best lip stain! I am having a vintage wedding and I tried this on….I AM IN LOVE! It is very vibrant and it will not come off until you are ready. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was in the mood for a pop of color in my humble makeup bag and decided to try this product. I definitely like the color, but would have prefered more moisture and not having to reapply throughout the day. Not to mention that is does not dry quickly so it may smear hear and there. Eitherway, great color, but be mindful of the small details.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews about this lipstick and saw that a lot of youtube beauty blogges have it and decided to order it. Was so surprised bec It is the best red lipstick ever and the best red color you can have</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great long lasting RED stain, however it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and it&#x27;s not a true RED to me.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great purchase! I would buy it again and again for the rest of my life! Every woman needs this lipgloss!</li>
            <li> Love this! It stays on all day and it&#x27;s the most beautiful, vibrant red. Very matte and pretty. Get it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and a beyond amazing product: perfect shade of red, highly pigmented, easy application, dries on matte without drying out lips, long lasting, and adorable packaging! Honestly, it&#x27;s red velvet magic! Buying any other product for red lips would be a mistake.</li>
            <li> Wonderful matte red. Great on every skin tone that I&#x27;ve seen it on. I&#x27;m in love. Took away one star because though it is matte and stays well, sometimes it bleeds. But I will be purchasing again. It&#x27;s beautiful and lovely matte.</li>
            <li> Great color! Definitely lasts a long time. The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5stars is because I really hoped this was more of a deeper red (blue red instead of true red) but I have no complaints otherwise.</li>
            <li> Okay, I can&#x27;t decide if I like this or not.  It goes on really liquidy and is messy. And I thought it would be a deep, sexy red and it is really a bright, fun red.  Not really me.  Is good as a base to other reds.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the way this color looks! It does lasts long, but still wears off with time, other then that great product!</li>
            <li> The color here can&#x27;t be described, but I&#x27;ll try. It&#x27;s a very lush, romantic matte red with a liberal dash of glamor. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and photographs and films well. It does smear a bit and feathers at the edges, which is the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a five star. But it&#x27;s quite stunning, and a lip liner helps to keep it in place. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is even better than a stain, and the color is incredibly true! It&#x27;s a great buy for a red lover.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and it stays put for hours! Great color also! No flaking and peeling like most &amp;#34; stay on &amp;#34; lipsticks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my sister turned me on to it.  Received it two days after I ordered it.  As far as the product itself, I love it.  Love the matte finish and I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t run and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great look and feel of the gloss/matte finish. I have gotten so many compliments - will definitely buy again soon!</li>
            <li> Just received my new favorite lipstick. Goes on wet (like a gloss) but dries to a beautiful matte finish. Will definitely be buyin more.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I wanted and as described!  Very happy:) Worth the price. If you want red lips this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I love the application of this product.  Great staying power and I love the matte finish. Has a classic look.</li>
            <li> must buy must try and must have!.. it really gives that beautiful velvet color that i have been looking for from all my red lipsticks that i never had and i know after im done with this one i will buy one again!</li>
            <li> So I bought this product based on all the reviews I saw on Youtube for this product--and it&#x27;s awesome. It does everything everyone said it would--went on super-easy and cleanly and dried to a total matte finish within a couple minutes. I didn&#x27;t need to use liner or primer or anything else and it just stays and stays, even after eating and drinking. Not to mention the color is super flattering and is totally what I expected. I will probably keep buying this as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Bought it a few months ago and i am in love with it! I wore it out when i was eating sushi with friends. Why they were rushing to the bathroom to apply more lipstick. I sat perfectly content. It&#x27;s a beautiful true color and would most def. Suggest it to friends.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments when I wore this, goes on as a gloss and dries to a velvet matte finish that stays on!</li>
            <li> Perfect color of red...just what I&#x27;ve been looking for and stays on forever...will definitely continue to order again and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. But I don&#x27;t like how it crakles. It stays on for a long time but red velvet was much better</li>
            <li> Even though the price was some what high, I found this product to be well worth it. When I opened it, I immediately tried it and found it to be a great product! It really does give your lips that velvety appearance, but if you aren&#x27;t careful it will stain your lips. But I do need to moisturize my lips when I&#x27;m wearing this product because my lips do tend to dry out. I do recommend this to anyone though! :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend told me about this product because I love red lips but he does not wish to wear it as well. I did lots of research before buying this product and concurrent with the overall reviews. The color is stunning and no lip liner is needed to get definition and maintain coverage. However, you MUST exfoliate and moisturize at least a few hours before applying. It will dry out your lips no matter what. It&#x27;s stays looking great even after several hours and eating without caution. On the downside, it DOES transfer in some situations: heavy kissing, greasy food, and don&#x27;t EVER apply lip balm on top, that will cause a huge mess. Overall, this give a beautifully classy red lip that will last all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome looks good doesn&#x27;t ware off bright and vibrant!!! Love the look of it on! Never will I use normal lip stick</li>
            <li> :(  It&#x27;s like an blood orange color. ----Bummed it wasn&#x27;t as cherry red as I would like. :( I have to mix it with a brownish lipstick.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome don&#x27;t get me wrong but the price that this vendor is charging is excessive especially because you can get this same product for 17 dollars on the lime crime website!!!</li>
            <li> Was very dissapointed the color looks nothing like it did on the website or the youtube video of a woman applying her&#x27;s on plus you half to apply it so many times to acheive a deep look and about time you do that the whole contents are gone waste on money i would half to buy five a month to acheive my look</li>
            <li> The pigment payoff is incredible. It&#x27;s so vibrant and bold. I get compliments every time I wear it!  It dries like a stain and is completely matte. I can wear this all day without reapplying. This is a definite must have!!!</li>
            <li> The vendor packaged this lip gloss nicely, it arrived perfectly. The color is very rich and bright, and it stays on for several hours even after drinking or eating. It will not feather, it stays put. No lip liner needed.</li>
            <li> Hands down. Dries beautifully matte without destroying my already constantly dry lips. It can be super-pigmented and tough to remove without cleansing oils or makeup removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item because I wanted something in a tube that wasn&#x27;t difficult to apply. It&#x27;s amazing. Wear it and hear the compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cashmere is my everyday color! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how slick it is, easy to apply and incredibly beautiful color. I would totally buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase this velvetine ever since they came out. It is the PERFECT color for my very fair skin and it literally lasts all day. Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful red that last all day. The color is matte. So if you&#x27;re looking for a shinny red then this one isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Some people might think that $20 is too much to spend for a lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NO ORDINARY LIP STAIN. This goes on LITERALLY like water and when it dries? It&#x27;s like the highest quality of sued/velvet on your lips in a GORGEOUS matte finish that is almost completely transfer resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this is a perfect gift from someone who enjoys classic looks, edgy looks, who likes to stand out...THIS is just a perfect gift for anyone or a splurge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. This is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All though it&#x27;s not TOTALLY COMPLETELY TRANSFER PROOF, it&#x27;s pretty darn close. You can kiss on your boyfriend or girlfriend and basically leaves nothing. I just noticed after several pecks on my love&#x27;s lips, that he had slightly more color that looked suspiciously like my red velvet lipstick. . . hehee &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, great pigment, no transfer! And fast shipping, the price is a little high but this product its worth it, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not the actual Lime Crime but a great knock off. Color is on point. Formula seems correct. Looks great and matted.&lt;br /&gt;Smells a bit like sugar. SO NOT THE ACTUAL LIME CRIME BUT A WORTHY KNOCK OFF.</li>
            <li> The best matte color I have ever used! The color is a beautiful deep red and it&#x27;s the first one I use that does not smear easily at all. I am a Lime Crime fan now. The lipstick actually taste good too</li>
            <li> LOVE this color. I have been struggling to find a red lipstick to work with my skintone. I am fair. This color not only works on me but all my friends (variety of skin types) have tried this and love it as well. The color goes on wet and is easier to apply. It does not make your lips look dried out. About 1 min later my lips were completely dry. I put the color to the test by drinking a glass of water, no color was on the glass, even after my lips got wet. PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Love the formula and the way it looks on my lips but I wish it was darker. The color swatches seen on the lime crime website are deceiving. You think you&#x27;re getting a darker, deeper red like red velvet but it&#x27;s literally like taking fire hydrant paint and putting it on your lips. Which isn&#x27;t necessarily this vendors fault since it&#x27;s lime crimes product.</li>
            <li> One word: AMAZING. This lipstick goes on so smooth and dries matte. The brightest red lipstick i&#x27;ve ever used...bye bye Ruby Woo</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite matte lip creams.  It dries perfectly, and stays on all day long!  It can be a bit drying on the lips, but considering how great it looks it really does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I was told this product would come after Christmas, but it came the day before! I bought this product for my sister for Christmas and had told her that it was coming late. I&#x27;m so glad that this came three days before the estimated date!  My sister loves it so it is a very good buy!! I highly recommend the product and would buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful red! Cool how it goes on as a gloss and then mattes out! beautiful! Stays on well and doesn&#x27;t smear easily</li>
            <li> The color is a great red, and it does not crack when it drys. BUT you have to wear lip liner because it bleeds and it stains your mouth and you end up looking like the Joker.</li>
            <li> Saw this online on Instagram and i thought it was nice and decided to go on amazon since it was sold out one limecrime website.BEST choice I made! I love the way it smells (cookies) and the way it feels, it truly makes your lips feel like velvet and my lips have a tendency to dry and peel but with this no matter how dry my lips feel it keeps them VELVETy soft. My only complaint is if you mess up on your outter lip line on your face you have to wipe off ASAP or it will stain and it&#x27;s is so difficult to come off, my ONLY complaint.</li>
            <li> The color is great and has great wear. Can&#x27;t go a day wearing it without getting at LEAST one compliment on it. Goes on like a gloss and dries matte.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstain it&#x27;s awasome I recommend it to every girl that loves red lips this product is very similar to SEPHORAS RED LIPSTAIN !!!!! Overall it&#x27;s all amazing !!! Love love love love love love love love !! :)))</li>
            <li> It is very messy. It lasts long but doesn&#x27;t really stay as you&#x27;d expect from a stay-on color. If you are looking for a good quality long-lasting color, that&#x27;s not it. But it really is a very nice deep red shade, that I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Great color deposit&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant color&lt;br /&gt;Very matte&lt;br /&gt;Loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;You can wear this color all day with only one application!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lipstick/stain/gloss EVER!!!!!! It goes on smooth and glossy and dries to a matte finish instantly! I&#x27;ve been wearing Suedeberry for hours and it hasn&#x27;t bled or faded the slightest bit! I&#x27;ve been eating, drinking soda out of cans, licking my lips and it has not changed AT ALL!!!! It&#x27;s worth every penny, and I&#x27;ve already ordered Red Velvet and I&#x27;m waiting for it to come in the mail any day now :)</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my wife and she&#x27;s been wearing this every single day. I am very thankful for one reason...it doesn&#x27;t rub off!</li>
            <li> So I bought this because it had raving reviews on Tumblr, and on LC&#x27;s facebook account. Other than the pretty packaging, I don&#x27;t really get the hype of this product. It&#x27;s nothing new, or innovative. It&#x27;s expensive, overpriced, and over-hyped. I felt like Doe Deere made it out to be a original product, and it simply isn&#x27;t. As a makeup enthusiast, I can&#x27;t stand this product. First off I want to mention the staying power. Yes it will stain you lips. What they don&#x27;t mention is it dries your lips out, no matter how many times you exfoliate or care for your lips. It also will clump up. The applicator is a pain. It applies way too much product on your lips, hence the clumping. If I want red dry, clumpy, sandpaper texture on your lips-- this is the product for you! As much as it stays on/stains, it also transfers on to things. And once it transfers you cannot get it off. You get very little product for the price, the container is tiny. There is no excuse for the performance of this product. Especially the amount you pay for. If you&#x27;re going to spend $17 on matte lipsticks (shipping is $5 on their website BTW), I recommend sticking to high-end. If you want a cheaper product alternative: NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream for $5.99 and comes in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> simply amazing. most unique formula. dries matte. and stays on for a very long time. i eve slept in it to test it, and it was still there in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> quite content with my lip gloss purchase, received it really quickly just find the texture of the lip gloss is very watery which makes it difficult to apply but overall a good product</li>
            <li> Every retro girl should grab one! And also those who wants to rock the pin up, matte, or vintage look!</li>
            <li> ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT IM OBSSESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT, I&#x27;LL BE BUYING A LOT MORE OF LIME CRIME PRODUCTS. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Very rich and opaque colour. Stays put for hours without need for reapplication. I had no problems with the product at all. My only wish is that it was slightly more bluish red. But it is a good alternative to Ruby Woo by Mac.</li>
            <li> This matte red liquid lipstick stays on for hours and hours.  It has a pleasant scent and I like it a lot.  You might want to use your own lipstick brush because it&#x27;s very vibrant and if you mess up it&#x27;s obvious.</li>
            <li> Velvetine formulas are always the best, hands down. Goes on like a gloss and dries this gorgeous matte texture. The bottle may seem small, but there&#x27;s definitely enough product in there to last you a while. One suggestion: make sure not to use too much. Wipe any excess off on the sides of the bottle. You should be fine with one swipe, this stuff is pretty opaque. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve noticed in swatches of this shade (especially in the ones on the Limecrime site itself), it appears way darker than it really is. Do not be fooled! This shade is more of a candy red, akin to a pokeball. I mean, I love the shade, but it&#x27;s definitely more of a spring/summer shade rather than a fall/winter shade. But that&#x27;s just my 2 cents~</li>
            <li> omg i can&#x27;t begin to explain how beautiful this stuff is.  i hardly wear make up but when i do i want to make an impression.</li>
            <li> This is probably the BEST waterproof lip color I have ever tried!!! It literally lasts all day even with eating and drinking! I&#x27;m an esthetician so I know a lot about makeup and skin care so when I found this I fell in love! And I love me some red lips!!!</li>
            <li> I became obsessed with having this lipstick and since the Limecrime website was sold out and I didn&#x27;t want to wait, I ordered here.  I will say that the pigment is lovely and the payoff is great, but even with a primer, this product is sooo drying. It wears off very easily on the middle/wet area of the lips.  When it does wear off there it looks really ridiculous.  I have no plans to repurchase this again.  There are other liquid lipsticks hat I would rather try.</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect product for the perfect red lip.I am an amateur at make-up period,but this product made it very easy for me to look like a pro.</li>
            <li> It really stains your lips, which given I didn&#x27;t know that was a surprise. It takes a little practice to get it right but it is absolutely gorgeous once you get applying it down! Long lasting, I would just reapply to get the velvet look after a few hours. I would prefer if it were cheaper though. It does have that great signature smell though! :)</li>
