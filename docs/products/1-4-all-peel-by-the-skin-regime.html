            <li>I believe in The Skin Regime and hope you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The Skin Regime book was good, and the peel is really worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li>However the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>have  olive complexion and with the melasma  the warm weather heat impacts my skin and brings out my melasma</li>
            <li>sampled the 1-4-All Peel, and, to be honest, I was a bit nervous.</li>
            <li>I used the 1-4-All-Peel and I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>But once that was done new wonderful skin was revealed!</li>
            <li>The book was well written, with a conversational tone, making it a very easy and understandable read.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product so far, and can&#x27;t wait to update you after I have finished the bottle.</li>
            <li>I felt quite confident undertaking this on my own.  </li>
            <li>How amazing that I can safely do this at home once a week and get spa results.</li>
            <li>I did not see the temporary increase in pimples that some people do experience, so I was pretty happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so affordable and easy to apply in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>The peel along with the tips from the author has worked amazingly and has helped minimize fine lines, acne, pores and even discoloration of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the book.  </li>
            <li>I love how it gives cheaper prices of products that work.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, I have tried many peels.  </li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of this peel program.  </li>
            <li>I grew up in the 70s and 80s when sun protection was nothing more than Bain de Soleil or baby oil with iodine in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, adding the additional treatments was a way for me to be more proactive in defeating melasma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>(more of a flush/blushed look) which went away in about an hour.  </li>
            <li>more pimples now.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what made me fall in love with this peel: consistency.  </li>
            <li>doing the face peel, to get the best results you should apply it once a week (the same day) for a 6-8 week interval.</li>
            <li>Gloves are not required however if you feel more comfortable using gloves or have a nice manicure, I would recommend gloves.</li>
            <li>Be sure to avoid going to close to the eye area and do not apply to your lips.</li>
            <li>Gloves are not required however if you feel more comfortable using gloves or have a nice manicure, I would recommend gloves.</li>
            <li>Be sure to avoid going to close to the eye area and do not apply to your lips.</li>
            <li>and i love how it makes me feel.</li>
            <li>I tried before for sure.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>It changed my life and my confident of my look</li>
            <li>I will continue to do my peels as often as suggested because my skin looks glowing and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m really pleased with my progress.  </li>
            <li>directions are very precise and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I am very very very pleased with the results and highly recommend if you are looking for an easy, effective at home chemical peel.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to watch my skin get better and better from using this</li>
            <li>My skin looked great the day after doing my peel, and I experienced very little if any irritation.tation.</li>
            <li>important follow-up to a peel routine is to be sure to use sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li>so one layer of the peel is right for me, but friends have used stronger (2 and 3 layer) applications, and everyone is thrilled with results.</li>
            <li>The closest comparison I can make is the way your skin looks and feels after microdermabrasion, but the results are way more significant.</li>
            <li>The great part about this process is that most of what you should use on your skin is easily purchased in my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When applied the skin just absorbs it easily.</li>
            <li>I had never used a peel before this, and it was shockingly easy.</li>
            <li>After 3 days I had a really strong peeling all over my face- just like after a sunburn.</li>
            <li>Right now, given the schedule of the Beauty Boot Camp, I have been able to use two peels, waiting more than seven days in between to give my skin a chance to rest.</li>
            <li>We have both becomes true fans, mostly Jess, who is always asking questions of the writer on facebook and stuff.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt a lot softer after just the first peel, and I noticed that I had that &amp;#34;after peel&amp;#34; kind of flush/glow that is described in The Skin Regime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cool thing about this peel is that the intensity changes depending on how many layers you apply.</li>
            <li>I saw it after the first use and the results just get better and better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this peel a few times now, and I think the best part is that you can adjust it to your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, cost-effective way to get glowing skin.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>My skin looked great the next morning, no irritation or flaking.</li>
            <li>, I have tried 3 differences peel Before i tried 1-4 peel by skin Regime, this is my 3rd peeled so far, im pleased and very happy with the result</li>
            <li>Right now my skin feels amazing, and I can only imagine it will get better and better.</li>
            <li>really excited about The Skin Regime Boot Camp and maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I’m excited to share it with you.  </li>
            <li>I saw it after the first use and the results just get better and better.cessaries\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>After I used the peel the first time, I felt and saw an immediate difference in my skin - - so smooth!</li>
            <li>Dana Ramos was the first person to introduce me to the at home peels and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>However, now that I have crossed the magical threshold of 40 years (ugh), skin health is a topic about which I am extremely interested.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done two peels so far, but I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>My skin is not totally clear yet, but it is better than it has been in over a decade!!</li>
            <li>I incorporated some other things that you can learn about in The Skin Regime: Boot Camp for Beautiful Skin by Dana Ramos.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very thorough (and do make sure you read through all the precautions &amp; &amp;#34;boring, but important&amp;#34; stuff before you attempt to use it)</li>
            <li>Like baby soft kind of skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels youthful and full of life.</li>
            <li>So, now The Skin Regime has there own peel, which was advertised as mild or strong because it is applied in layers, and Jess said it was way better than other stuff we were using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still fairly young and don&#x27;t have too many fine lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li>After 47 years of my life, my skin looks more beautiful and I look younger simply because I’ve changed my skin care</li>
            <li>but I actually started to see soft, glowing, smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear foundation any more because my skin tone has evened out so much.</li>
            <li>cleansing my face with a mild cleanser</li>
            <li>I started to feel a mild tingling and maybe a hint of burning.</li>
            <li>That time there was more tingling sensation (which I actually enjoyed) and a little more heat.</li>
            <li>The dark spots are gone, my skin has a rosy glow and it feels great.</li>
            <li>However if you are new to peeling, be sure to stick with an astringent, as it is milder than rubbing alcohol and not as irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However if you are new to peeling, be sure to stick with an astringent, as it is milder than rubbing alcohol and not as irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very informative and is easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>Once you are ready for the peel be sure to wash and scrub your face first with soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Once you are ready for the peel be sure to wash and scrub your face first with soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>This was so easy to use and the product is really high quality!</li>
            <li>But until then, if you like watching youtube reviews you can find me there (user name agapelovegirl) because I will share an update there first as well as show before and after photos!</li>
            <li>Once I washed my face clean, my face looked absolutely RADIANT!</li>
            <li>The next time I tried it with 2, and then 3.&lt;br /&gt;The difference you will see in your skin is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you do these things, your skin has the potential to look truly amazing.</li>
            <li>And how amazing that YOU have the ultimate control over</li>
            <li>You then follow-up with rubbing alcohol to remove any soap residue or an astringent if you have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You then follow-up with rubbing alcohol to remove any soap residue or an astringent if you have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have not yet posted photos, because I want to complete as many peels as I can with my sample sized bottle before showing you my results.</li>
            <li>I started to go to dermatologist and stopped for awhile,and had treatments where it would go away only to have nice skin for a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to compare my own before and after photos and my sisters are following my progress to see if this is something they would like to try as well.  </li>
            <li>I am no expert on skin care or at home chemical peels but this product has changed my life in a positive way!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been very into skin care and have tried to take good care of it through the years, but this peel has really taken my skin to the next level.  </li>
            <li>But I can say that I am really liking the peel so far, and I am very excited about the results to come.</li>
            <li>I also used a very gentle, all-natural skincare line while I used this.</li>
            <li>I also used a very gentle, all-natural skincare line while I used this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I suggest you read The Skin Regime to learn more about the additional products I found necessary to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have a clear smooth complexion</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and so clear...</li>
            <li>On sensitive skin days, I&#x27;ll use one layer, but on more normal skin days I can use anywhere from 2-4 layers.</li>
            <li>I did my first application on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>The fact that you can actually LAYER it is insanely ingenious.</li>
            <li>But playing it safe I left it at 2.</li>
            <li>you a first time peeler?</li>
            <li>You decide how much of a peel you want or need!</li>
            <li>,it looked like a hot marshmellow was targeted,and my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I did my first official peel today to start my skin boot camp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was recommended that I read The Skin Regime before trying the peel, and that is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what I intend to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The peel was a breeze, and the results were exactly what the author predicted.</li>
            <li>The peel does feel hot when applying it</li>
            <li>You can apply 1 layer for sensitive skin or  for those new to peels, all the way up to four layers for more tolerant skin.</li>
            <li>After, be sure to follow-up with a good facial moisturizer and don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen, especially if you are in the middle of a peeling routine.n on their forearm, before applying the peel, to see if they can tolerate it.</li>
            <li>After, be sure to follow-up with a good facial moisturizer and don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen, especially if you are in the middle of a peeling routine.</li>
            <li>first time I tried it I was hesitant because I have sensitive skin that turns red and gets blotchy and breaks out very easily.  </li>
            <li>To be safe and risk damaging my skin, the first time I used this, I put on 1 layer and let it dry for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It provides you with clear instructions and advice on how to obtain great looking skin for very little money.</li>
            <li>There are  a few different reasons why this new 1-4 Peel is ideal for the first time peeler.</li>
            <li>Well, like others I am victim to melasma,and I have tried everything,came to the point where I could not afford going to dermatologist an more so not seeing any reults.</li>
            <li>I have done 3 peels so far with about 8 to 9 days in between and I am loving my new younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Skin Regime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, you have to wash your face with a gentle cleanser and then use a toner or alcohol to remove anything from your skin.</li>
            <li>It was very helpful in helping me understand how the peel works.  </li>
            <li>It felt tingly and there was some heat, but was very tolerable.</li>
            <li>After the peel I had very noticeably softer skin...</li>
            <li>Apply the peel in one layer to your whole face and feather around the jaw line.</li>
            <li>Apply the peel in one layer to your whole face and feather around the jaw line.</li>
            <li>I used a gentle moisturizer and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a much stronger peeling then with the Lactic Acid</li>
            <li>I never had to wear make up,just eyeliner and lipliner,I really have no wrinkles</li>
            <li>Thanks Dana and Nancy C.</li>
            <li>She spent many years battling problem skin.</li>
            <li>It really work for me</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal, cheaper than other peels, but way better.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and vibrant looking....</li>
            <li>but this one just about right beside almost no down time after peel just some redness</li>
            <li>Between using the 1-4-All-Peel, as well as the recommended moisturizers and other products, I really feel like I have a chance at squashing my mild acne and getting a more even tone for my skin overall.</li>
            <li>There are warnings that many reactions are possible (and all within normal range, apparently) from almost no discernible change, to redness, to flaking and outright peeling.</li>
            <li>I only wear foundations when I&#x27;m going for a &#x27;look&#x27; that calls for a full coverage makeup.</li>
            <li>of it is as easy as a rough washcloth and Dove soap.  </li>
            <li>how deep or mild you peel is?</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PEEL and will likely purchase a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>but I swear, one use and even some of my older acne scars looked somewhat faded.</li>
            <li>No bad side effects, no burning sensation and no red skin (although it is totally normal if this does happen to you).</li>
            <li>I mentioned before I will do the peel for a 3rd time tomorrow night, and still have a few more weeks of the Skin Regime boot camp to do, before I can do a full review...</li>
            <li>The first peel was new to my sensitive skin, so I did experience some redness and flakiness, but I knew not to be alarmed.</li>
            <li>Still very tolerable, as I do not have sensitive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>but I read that it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I have super sensitive skin or anything, but I have heard and seen horror stories of women who go lobster red after doing a chemical peel on their face.</li>
            <li>I mean, amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about this product - you&#x27;re missing out if you&#x27;re not using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is more dull, dry and not as smooth and soft as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>For my first attempt, I was cautious and opted to try only one “layer” of the peel.</li>
            <li>Trust me, this works better than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li>The exact process, experience, and results will vary on an individual basis, but everyone who has reviewed this seems to have glowing reviews as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This peel worked much better than the peel I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>You can find my initial review of my first peeling routine on my blog at The Skin Care Regime.</li>
            <li>Using a cotton ball, clean cotton gauze or similar small clean pad used for face cleansing, pour some of the peel onto the pad.</li>
            <li>Using a cotton ball, clean cotton gauze or similar small clean pad used for face cleansing, pour some of the peel onto the pad.</li>
            <li>First of all, I was quite skeptical of this peel - but it truly does deliver amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other peels that were okay, but I would peel horribly in small patches of my face, while 90 percent of my face seemed completely unaffected.</li>
            <li>1st layer mild, 2nd layer moderate and 3rd layer much stronger, for those who are already tolerate to peeling.</li>
            <li>This product seems to address dull skin, firmness, pore size, acne and more....</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have ordered a bunch of times directly from the owner, Dana, and everytime she handles each shipment herself with care and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really like how I can control the intensity with different layers, so</li>
            <li>, though, makes my skin really soft and baby-like, need to protect that with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>experience so far is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As they say, old habits die-hard.</li>
            <li>I have found the corners of my nose are sensitive, so I avoid that</li>
            <li>I have found the corners of my nose are sensitive, so I avoid that</li>
            <li>What did I notice so far?</li>
            <li>next day my skin felt really</li>
            <li>I even went every 6 weeks for professional treatments for years.  </li>
            <li>,actually my skin gets an automatic tan in between,my melasma really started at 35</li>
            <li>The author, Dana Ramos is not a health care professional, but a writer who is a skin care enthusiast.</li>
            <li>Glowing, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going to be an early Christmas gift to myself.  </li>
            <li>Worth every single penny!!</li>
            <li>I was given the boot camp book, a while back and never really glanced through it,till I ordered the product,started using it and reading the instructions and seeing results,alot better, and reading the book again given,and surprised how all along I was not doing it correctly,still getting results,and advice from Dana,and yes,you need to read the book,and yes my skin is alot better,and yes just a slight touch of foundation till my goal is reached,with no foundtion at all,just suncreen and moisterizer.  </li>
            <li>My sun damage was reduced and spots in general.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had just had a professional facial.  </li>
            <li>I went through the &#x27;bootcamp&#x27; (12 weeks) and I haven&#x27;t looked back at my old skin care habits since.</li>
            <li>Used it twice so far and will be using it for the 3rd time tomorrow night!</li>
            <li>Dana Ramos instructs on double cleansing the face with alcohol (or if you have sensitive skin with witch hazel).</li>
            <li>Finally, I can get professional results at home for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I had always had regular facials and professional  glycolic peels</li>
            <li>In turn, I begin to develop dry patches, white heads and really oily skin which turns into acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing some research, and working in conjunction with a dermatologist for technical advice, she wrote this book, and developed a simple peel to help rejuvenate and clarify your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am always afraid to try a different product because I doubt they will work as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Just because you do the peel routine and your face looks fabulous, doesn&#x27;t mean you should go out unprotected, especially if you have sun spots like I do.</li>
            <li>this peel is difference with others, some too strong or too weak</li>
            <li>With the first layer being mild enough for any skin type, if you feel uncomfortable, you can stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She does three layers because she really likes to get a little flaking and peeling.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to get this near the corners of your mouth or nose because those are particularly sensitive areas and can burn a little bit.</li>

            <li> The Skin Regime book was good, and the peel is really worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> However the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> have  olive complexion and with the melasma  the warm weather heat impacts my skin and brings out my melasma</li>
            <li> sampled the 1-4-All Peel, and, to be honest, I was a bit nervous.</li>
            <li> I used the 1-4-All-Peel and I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> But once that was done new wonderful skin was revealed!</li>

            <li> I love how it gives cheaper prices of products that work.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried many peels.  </li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this peel program.  </li>
            <li> I grew up in the 70s and 80s when sun protection was nothing more than Bain de Soleil or baby oil with iodine in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, adding the additional treatments was a way for me to be more proactive in defeating melasma.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> (more of a flush/blushed look) which went away in about an hour.  </li>
            <li> more pimples now.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what made me fall in love with this peel: consistency.  </li>
            <li> doing the face peel, to get the best results you should apply it once a week (the same day) for a 6-8 week interval.</li>
            <li> Gloves are not required however if you feel more comfortable using gloves or have a nice manicure, I would recommend gloves.</li>
            <li> Be sure to avoid going to close to the eye area and do not apply to your lips.</li>
            <li> Gloves are not required however if you feel more comfortable using gloves or have a nice manicure, I would recommend gloves.</li>
            <li> Be sure to avoid going to close to the eye area and do not apply to your lips.</li>
            <li> and i love how it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> I tried before for sure.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> It changed my life and my confident of my look</li>
            <li> I will continue to do my peels as often as suggested because my skin looks glowing and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m really pleased with my progress.  </li>
            <li> directions are very precise and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I am very very very pleased with the results and highly recommend if you are looking for an easy, effective at home chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to watch my skin get better and better from using this</li>
            <li> My skin looked great the day after doing my peel, and I experienced very little if any irritation.tation.</li>
            <li> important follow-up to a peel routine is to be sure to use sunscreen all the time.</li>
            <li> so one layer of the peel is right for me, but friends have used stronger (2 and 3 layer) applications, and everyone is thrilled with results.</li>
            <li> The closest comparison I can make is the way your skin looks and feels after microdermabrasion, but the results are way more significant.</li>
            <li> The great part about this process is that most of what you should use on your skin is easily purchased in my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When applied the skin just absorbs it easily.</li>
            <li> I had never used a peel before this, and it was shockingly easy.</li>
            <li> After 3 days I had a really strong peeling all over my face- just like after a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Right now, given the schedule of the Beauty Boot Camp, I have been able to use two peels, waiting more than seven days in between to give my skin a chance to rest.</li>
            <li> We have both becomes true fans, mostly Jess, who is always asking questions of the writer on facebook and stuff.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt a lot softer after just the first peel, and I noticed that I had that &amp;#34;after peel&amp;#34; kind of flush/glow that is described in The Skin Regime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cool thing about this peel is that the intensity changes depending on how many layers you apply.</li>
            <li> I saw it after the first use and the results just get better and better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this peel a few times now, and I think the best part is that you can adjust it to your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, cost-effective way to get glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> My skin looked great the next morning, no irritation or flaking.</li>
            <li> , I have tried 3 differences peel Before i tried 1-4 peel by skin Regime, this is my 3rd peeled so far, im pleased and very happy with the result</li>
            <li> Right now my skin feels amazing, and I can only imagine it will get better and better.</li>
            <li> really excited about The Skin Regime Boot Camp and maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I’m excited to share it with you.  </li>
            <li> I saw it after the first use and the results just get better and better.cessaries\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After I used the peel the first time, I felt and saw an immediate difference in my skin - - so smooth!</li>
            <li> Dana Ramos was the first person to introduce me to the at home peels and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> However, now that I have crossed the magical threshold of 40 years (ugh), skin health is a topic about which I am extremely interested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done two peels so far, but I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> My skin is not totally clear yet, but it is better than it has been in over a decade!!</li>
            <li> I incorporated some other things that you can learn about in The Skin Regime: Boot Camp for Beautiful Skin by Dana Ramos.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very thorough (and do make sure you read through all the precautions &amp; &amp;#34;boring, but important&amp;#34; stuff before you attempt to use it)</li>
            <li> Like baby soft kind of skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels youthful and full of life.</li>
            <li> So, now The Skin Regime has there own peel, which was advertised as mild or strong because it is applied in layers, and Jess said it was way better than other stuff we were using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fairly young and don&#x27;t have too many fine lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li> After 47 years of my life, my skin looks more beautiful and I look younger simply because I’ve changed my skin care</li>
            <li> but I actually started to see soft, glowing, smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear foundation any more because my skin tone has evened out so much.</li>
            <li> cleansing my face with a mild cleanser</li>
            <li> I started to feel a mild tingling and maybe a hint of burning.</li>
            <li> That time there was more tingling sensation (which I actually enjoyed) and a little more heat.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are gone, my skin has a rosy glow and it feels great.</li>
            <li> However if you are new to peeling, be sure to stick with an astringent, as it is milder than rubbing alcohol and not as irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is very informative and is easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> Once you are ready for the peel be sure to wash and scrub your face first with soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Once you are ready for the peel be sure to wash and scrub your face first with soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to use and the product is really high quality!</li>
            <li> But until then, if you like watching youtube reviews you can find me there (user name agapelovegirl) because I will share an update there first as well as show before and after photos!</li>
            <li> Once I washed my face clean, my face looked absolutely RADIANT!</li>
            <li> The next time I tried it with 2, and then 3.&lt;br /&gt;The difference you will see in your skin is amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you do these things, your skin has the potential to look truly amazing.</li>
            <li> And how amazing that YOU have the ultimate control over</li>
            <li> You then follow-up with rubbing alcohol to remove any soap residue or an astringent if you have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You then follow-up with rubbing alcohol to remove any soap residue or an astringent if you have more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have not yet posted photos, because I want to complete as many peels as I can with my sample sized bottle before showing you my results.</li>
            <li> I started to go to dermatologist and stopped for awhile,and had treatments where it would go away only to have nice skin for a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to compare my own before and after photos and my sisters are following my progress to see if this is something they would like to try as well.  </li>
            <li> I am no expert on skin care or at home chemical peels but this product has changed my life in a positive way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very into skin care and have tried to take good care of it through the years, but this peel has really taken my skin to the next level.  </li>
            <li> But I can say that I am really liking the peel so far, and I am very excited about the results to come.</li>
            <li> I also used a very gentle, all-natural skincare line while I used this.</li>
            <li> I also used a very gentle, all-natural skincare line while I used this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I suggest you read The Skin Regime to learn more about the additional products I found necessary to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have a clear smooth complexion</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and so clear...</li>
            <li> On sensitive skin days, I&#x27;ll use one layer, but on more normal skin days I can use anywhere from 2-4 layers.</li>
            <li> I did my first application on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The fact that you can actually LAYER it is insanely ingenious.</li>
            <li> But playing it safe I left it at 2.</li>
            <li> you a first time peeler?</li>
            <li> You decide how much of a peel you want or need!</li>
            <li> ,it looked like a hot marshmellow was targeted,and my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I did my first official peel today to start my skin boot camp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was recommended that I read The Skin Regime before trying the peel, and that is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li> That is exactly what I intend to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The peel was a breeze, and the results were exactly what the author predicted.</li>
            <li> The peel does feel hot when applying it</li>
            <li> You can apply 1 layer for sensitive skin or  for those new to peels, all the way up to four layers for more tolerant skin.</li>
            <li> After, be sure to follow-up with a good facial moisturizer and don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen, especially if you are in the middle of a peeling routine.n on their forearm, before applying the peel, to see if they can tolerate it.</li>
            <li> After, be sure to follow-up with a good facial moisturizer and don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen, especially if you are in the middle of a peeling routine.</li>
            <li> first time I tried it I was hesitant because I have sensitive skin that turns red and gets blotchy and breaks out very easily.  </li>
            <li> To be safe and risk damaging my skin, the first time I used this, I put on 1 layer and let it dry for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It provides you with clear instructions and advice on how to obtain great looking skin for very little money.</li>
            <li> There are  a few different reasons why this new 1-4 Peel is ideal for the first time peeler.</li>
            <li> Well, like others I am victim to melasma,and I have tried everything,came to the point where I could not afford going to dermatologist an more so not seeing any reults.</li>
            <li> I have done 3 peels so far with about 8 to 9 days in between and I am loving my new younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Skin Regime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, you have to wash your face with a gentle cleanser and then use a toner or alcohol to remove anything from your skin.</li>
            <li> It was very helpful in helping me understand how the peel works.  </li>
            <li> It felt tingly and there was some heat, but was very tolerable.</li>
            <li> After the peel I had very noticeably softer skin...</li>
            <li> Apply the peel in one layer to your whole face and feather around the jaw line.</li>
            <li> Apply the peel in one layer to your whole face and feather around the jaw line.</li>
            <li> I used a gentle moisturizer and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a much stronger peeling then with the Lactic Acid</li>
            <li> I never had to wear make up,just eyeliner and lipliner,I really have no wrinkles</li>
            <li> Thanks Dana and Nancy C.</li>
            <li> She spent many years battling problem skin.</li>
            <li> It really work for me</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal, cheaper than other peels, but way better.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother and vibrant looking....</li>
            <li> but this one just about right beside almost no down time after peel just some redness</li>
            <li> Between using the 1-4-All-Peel, as well as the recommended moisturizers and other products, I really feel like I have a chance at squashing my mild acne and getting a more even tone for my skin overall.</li>
            <li> There are warnings that many reactions are possible (and all within normal range, apparently) from almost no discernible change, to redness, to flaking and outright peeling.</li>
            <li> I only wear foundations when I&#x27;m going for a &#x27;look&#x27; that calls for a full coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> of it is as easy as a rough washcloth and Dove soap.  </li>
            <li> how deep or mild you peel is?</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PEEL and will likely purchase a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> but I swear, one use and even some of my older acne scars looked somewhat faded.</li>
            <li> No bad side effects, no burning sensation and no red skin (although it is totally normal if this does happen to you).</li>
            <li> I mentioned before I will do the peel for a 3rd time tomorrow night, and still have a few more weeks of the Skin Regime boot camp to do, before I can do a full review...</li>
            <li> The first peel was new to my sensitive skin, so I did experience some redness and flakiness, but I knew not to be alarmed.</li>
            <li> Still very tolerable, as I do not have sensitive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I read that it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I have super sensitive skin or anything, but I have heard and seen horror stories of women who go lobster red after doing a chemical peel on their face.</li>
            <li> I mean, amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about this product - you&#x27;re missing out if you&#x27;re not using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is more dull, dry and not as smooth and soft as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> For my first attempt, I was cautious and opted to try only one “layer” of the peel.</li>
            <li> Trust me, this works better than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> The exact process, experience, and results will vary on an individual basis, but everyone who has reviewed this seems to have glowing reviews as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This peel worked much better than the peel I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> You can find my initial review of my first peeling routine on my blog at The Skin Care Regime.</li>
            <li> Using a cotton ball, clean cotton gauze or similar small clean pad used for face cleansing, pour some of the peel onto the pad.</li>
            <li> Using a cotton ball, clean cotton gauze or similar small clean pad used for face cleansing, pour some of the peel onto the pad.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was quite skeptical of this peel - but it truly does deliver amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other peels that were okay, but I would peel horribly in small patches of my face, while 90 percent of my face seemed completely unaffected.</li>
            <li> 1st layer mild, 2nd layer moderate and 3rd layer much stronger, for those who are already tolerate to peeling.</li>
            <li> This product seems to address dull skin, firmness, pore size, acne and more....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have ordered a bunch of times directly from the owner, Dana, and everytime she handles each shipment herself with care and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really like how I can control the intensity with different layers, so</li>
            <li> , though, makes my skin really soft and baby-like, need to protect that with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> experience so far is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As they say, old habits die-hard.</li>
            <li> I have found the corners of my nose are sensitive, so I avoid that</li>
            <li> I have found the corners of my nose are sensitive, so I avoid that</li>
            <li> What did I notice so far?</li>
            <li> next day my skin felt really</li>
            <li> I even went every 6 weeks for professional treatments for years.  </li>
            <li> ,actually my skin gets an automatic tan in between,my melasma really started at 35</li>
            <li> The author, Dana Ramos is not a health care professional, but a writer who is a skin care enthusiast.</li>
            <li> Glowing, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going to be an early Christmas gift to myself.  </li>
            <li> Worth every single penny!!</li>
            <li> I was given the boot camp book, a while back and never really glanced through it,till I ordered the product,started using it and reading the instructions and seeing results,alot better, and reading the book again given,and surprised how all along I was not doing it correctly,still getting results,and advice from Dana,and yes,you need to read the book,and yes my skin is alot better,and yes just a slight touch of foundation till my goal is reached,with no foundtion at all,just suncreen and moisterizer.  </li>
            <li> My sun damage was reduced and spots in general.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had just had a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> I went through the &#x27;bootcamp&#x27; (12 weeks) and I haven&#x27;t looked back at my old skin care habits since.</li>
            <li> Used it twice so far and will be using it for the 3rd time tomorrow night!</li>
            <li> Dana Ramos instructs on double cleansing the face with alcohol (or if you have sensitive skin with witch hazel).</li>
            <li> Finally, I can get professional results at home for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I had always had regular facials and professional  glycolic peels</li>
            <li> In turn, I begin to develop dry patches, white heads and really oily skin which turns into acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing some research, and working in conjunction with a dermatologist for technical advice, she wrote this book, and developed a simple peel to help rejuvenate and clarify your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am always afraid to try a different product because I doubt they will work as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> Just because you do the peel routine and your face looks fabulous, doesn&#x27;t mean you should go out unprotected, especially if you have sun spots like I do.</li>
            <li> this peel is difference with others, some too strong or too weak</li>
            <li> With the first layer being mild enough for any skin type, if you feel uncomfortable, you can stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She does three layers because she really likes to get a little flaking and peeling.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to get this near the corners of your mouth or nose because those are particularly sensitive areas and can burn a little bit.</li>
            <li> I tried a different peel in the past and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The main problem I have is just plain forgetting to put on the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> you are a first timer, leave the peel on at least 1-3 minutes or as tolerated.</li>
            <li> you are a first timer, leave the peel on at least 1-3 minutes or as tolerated.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how firm and clear my skin looked after only using it one time.  </li>
            <li> I expected some serious irritation since my skin can be so finicky and sensitive but once applied, I felt nothing but a little mild discomfort, almost like an itch.</li>
            <li> let it dry for 1 minute, then apply 1more layer and let that dry for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> dry-</li>
            <li> did a single layer application after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> The instructions said you can repeat the peel after a week and you can put up to 4 layers on during a single application.  </li>
            <li> That worked wonders, but I wanted to go a little bit stronger, so the next 3 times, I applied 1 layer,</li>
            <li> Maybe next week I&#x27;ll go a little stronger, and the next a little milder.</li>
            <li> The next couple days I did notice a little peeling of my skin.</li>
            <li> The second time you use the peel you can go a little longer.</li>
            <li> The second time you use the peel you can go a little longer.</li>
            <li> The last time I had used a peel was back between late June and July.</li>
            <li> but my skin has changed over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> My forehead has been a bit rough and sort of bumpy.  </li>
            <li> the result is what i expected thank you</li>
            <li> I was beyond excited when I not only didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to this</li>
            <li> I had some very slight flaking once, but it cleared up with moisturizer by the next day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was a very slight burning, but it was almost nothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The regimen is designed to be done with minimal other products, so no toner or serum or \\&quot;unnecessaries\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> ,it took a week for it to disappear,and it shifted my melasma to other places where I never really had it and still leaving my  forehead, and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I will be honest, I was a little nervous about trying this at first, I had a terrible experience in the past with an at-home-peel.</li>
            <li> I let the single layer sit on for about a minute and a half.  </li>
            <li> results are incredible and I wish so badly that I would have taken a \\&quot;Before\\&quot; picture to show the difference, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be so obvious because I didn&#x27;t think my face was that bad before.</li>
            <li> results are incredible and I wish so badly that I would have taken a \\&quot;Before\\&quot; picture to show the difference, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be so obvious because I didn&#x27;t think my face was that bad before.</li>
            <li> My wife read The Skin Regime book, we both did other peels</li>
            <li> and I get a ton of questions and compliments from people on what skin care I use.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other lines I have used, this one takes the cake.  </li>
            <li> I will start by saying that it WORKS... extremely well.</li>
            <li> Having been disappointed with so many expensive yet useless beauty products, I thought I&#x27;d try this nicely priced peel.  </li>
            <li> My only concern was that it made my face a little stiff</li>
            <li> and I desperately wanted that fresh, glowing skin again</li>
            <li> For me, I had to purchase a couple of other things, that while expensive in my eyes, when used sparingly, will last over multiple months.  </li>
            <li> I did what I could to cut down on exfoliants, masks, toners, harsh makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> I did what I could to cut down on exfoliants, masks, toners, harsh makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You’ll notice my skin is a little redder.  </li>
            <li> So, when I received a sample of the 1-4-All Peel, I was a little bit… nervous.</li>
            <li> people have a little sensitivity for a day or so after using this, but I had none.</li>
            <li> and I put two layers on for a little stronger peel.  </li>
            <li> The instructions recommended using alcohol, but I used a toner because alcohol is just too harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that I can tell when I need to do another peel routine, as the dead skin begins to build up and clog my pores.</li>
            <li> After the alcohol dried off I applied the peel with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I cried and cried,and was out of work for a few days.</li>
            <li> To see my full review check: [...]</li>
            <li> There was not a huge difference in my skin after that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I confess that I have never tried a skin peel before, and I knew very little about the subject.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any bad side effects with this peel other than just a tiny bit of expected redness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure where to begin with this peel.</li>
            <li> Never more than once per week.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that after, you then use them every few months or a couple of times a year at the least.</li>
            <li> (Usually peels have a percentage ranging anywhere from 10-30 %).&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than a chemical burn due to operator error.</li>
            <li> I usually do three or four layers, and I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects.</li>
            <li> After after having two kids my skin was looking dull and tired and I started noticing dark spots appearing on my face.  </li>
            <li> After years of going without sunscreen this is one habit I am having a hard time breaking.</li>
            <li> It also smells a little caustic, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know, using glycolic acid on your face sounds scary, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> Dana Ramos advices strictly to see how the tolerance of this product is for at least a minute before you decide if you want to apply another layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a slow gradual change</li>
            <li> I will stick to one layer just to keep it slow and</li>
            <li> then even another (but do not more then 4 layers!).</li>
            <li> I mean, a chemical peel and that too at home?</li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of burning/tingling but nothing unbearable and not too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Even carrying sunscreen in my purse does me no good after my makeup is on.</li>
            <li> thank you Million, for those who tried other peel before and unhappy with the result</li>
            <li> layer is applied thinly with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Im still hiding in closet and hate to go out in public</li>
            <li> It wasnt too bad though, I exfoliated a little with a wash cloth and used lotion to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not at all surprised to not see a bad review for this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat relieved that my reaction was not too dramatic, although my skin truly did glow afterward!</li>
            <li> I am hesitant to try products like these because I am always afraid of what it might do to my skin.</li>
            <li> So I washed it off with cold water.</li>
            <li> Some very expensive ones too.  </li>
            <li> mostly bad...</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well</li>
            <li> The humidity has been brutal to my skin</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin, and have struggled with all sorts of acne products since I was eleven.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife read The Skin Regime book, we both did other peels the writer suggested (we share this Amazon account, so she is helping me write this).  So, now The Skin Regime has there own peel, which was advertised as mild or strong because it is applied in layers, and Jess said it was way better than other stuff we were using.  I use it to help my acne, she uses it for skin discoloration and skin tone.  She does three layers because she really likes to get a little flaking and peeling.  I go with one layer, which keeps my zits in control.  We have both becomes true fans, mostly Jess, who is always asking questions of the writer on facebook and stuff.  We both like the humor and honesty of the Skin Regime approach and style.</li>
            <li> I love the book.  It is very informative and is easy to follow.  I love how it gives cheaper prices of products that work.  I always thought the more expensive products were the way to go.  My malasma has lightened with only one peel.  I applied it twice.  It was been 2 weeks and will be doing another peel.  This 1-in-4 peel is really awesome.  Believe me, I have tried many peels.  Some very expensive ones too.  I believe I will be doing the 6-8 week program.  I love the simplicity of this peel program.  Thanks Skin Regime.</li>
            <li> My melasma is from sun damage.  I grew up in the 70s and 80s when sun protection was nothing more than Bain de Soleil or baby oil with iodine in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have completed the 8 week Boot Camp from The Skin Regime and used the 1-4-All Peel.  I incorporated some other things that you can learn about in The Skin Regime: Boot Camp for Beautiful Skin by Dana Ramos. For me, adding the additional treatments was a way for me to be more proactive in defeating melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is noticeable.  People who know me have remarked at the difference. Check out the before and after pictures that I&#x27;ve posted with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll notice my skin is a little redder.  I’m continuing with the aftercare and it makes my skin red for a while after I wash my face.  This isn’t permanent, but it does show up in these pictures.  My skin isn’t perfect after 8 week, but I got the damage over years and it will take some time to get my skin back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing to work the maintenance on my skin.  The great part about this process is that most of what you should use on your skin is easily purchased in my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of it is as easy as a rough washcloth and Dove soap.  For me, I had to purchase a couple of other things, that while expensive in my eyes, when used sparingly, will last over multiple months.  This was the perfect justification for me to spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I suggest you read The Skin Regime to learn more about the additional products I found necessary to purchase.  The Skin Regime Boot Camp works in conjunction with the additional products.  My skin is healthier.  I’m not breaking out with acne.  My skin glows.  I haven’t seen my skin glow ever that I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m really excited about The Skin Regime Boot Camp and maintenance.  I’m excited to share it with you.  After 47 years of my life, my skin looks more beautiful and I look younger simply because I’ve changed my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I’m doing can be duplicated.  Even Tan Mom, Patricia Krentcil&#x27;s skin is amazing after using 1-4-All Peel.  She is unrecognizable from the woman that was in the news. I believe in The Skin Regime and hope you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I’m doing can be duplicated.

            <li> The Skin Regime book was good, and the peel is really worthwhile.  I have sensitive skin so one layer of the peel is right for me, but friends have used stronger (2 and 3 layer) applications, and everyone is thrilled with results. The peel even works on back acne.</li>
            <li> I am not at all surprised to not see a bad review for this product!!! I am no expert on skin care or at home chemical peels but this product has changed my life in a positive way! I have ordered a bunch of times directly from the owner, Dana, and everytime she handles each shipment herself with care and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I was hesitant because I have sensitive skin that turns red and gets blotchy and breaks out very easily.  So as the instructions stated I started with one layer.  The next time I tried it with 2, and then 3.&lt;br /&gt;The difference you will see in your skin is amazing.  Lines, scars, brown spots, wrinkles, all disappear.  I have a clear smooth complexion and I get a ton of questions and compliments from people on what skin care I use.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other lines I have used, this one takes the cake.  I am always afraid to try a different product because I doubt they will work as good as this one.  I am very very very pleased with the results and highly recommend if you are looking for an easy, effective at home chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks but the results are immediate.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how firm and clear my skin looked after only using it one time.  I felt like I had just had a professional facial.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks.  This product seems to address dull skin, firmness, pore size, acne and more....AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve used this peel for quite some time now and I do like the results. My sun damage was reduced and spots in general. My only concern was that it made my face a little stiff and I think it was because I didnt use a moisturizer at times. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this!  After using the peel, my skin looks amazing.  I&#x27;m especially thrilled by the compliments I receive.  That my skin glows.</li>
            <li> Having been disappointed with so many expensive yet useless beauty products, I thought I&#x27;d try this nicely priced peel.  No hyperbole, it does what it professes to do.</li>
            <li> I’ve never had a chemical peel anywhere – in the dermatologist’s office, at a salon, or at home. So, when I received a sample of the 1-4-All Peel, I was a little bit… nervous. After reading the directions thoroughly, I decided to give it a try. There are warnings that many reactions are possible (and all within normal range, apparently) from almost no discernible change, to redness, to flaking and outright peeling. For my first attempt, I was cautious and opted to try only one “layer” of the peel. I was somewhat relieved that my reaction was not too dramatic, although my skin truly did glow afterward! Since you can only do it once a week, I am looking forward to my next one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure where to begin with this peel. I will start by saying that it WORKS... extremely well. The effectiveness of this peel means that you MUST follow directions. There&#x27;s nothing worse than a chemical burn due to operator error. Follow directions. Be diligent about sunscreen, and do NOT pick at your skin for any reason. If you do these things, your skin has the potential to look truly amazing. Dana Ramos took my skin from sometimes good/mostly bad... to ALWAYS good. I can wear mascara and lip gloss (and sunscreen, of course) and head out the door. I only wear foundations when I&#x27;m going for a &#x27;look&#x27; that calls for a full coverage makeup. My skin is so smooth and so clear... I can&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m impressed and amazed, and grateful. I went through the &#x27;bootcamp&#x27; (12 weeks) and I haven&#x27;t looked back at my old skin care habits since.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by this peel. I know, using glycolic acid on your face sounds scary, but it&#x27;s really not. I&#x27;ve tried this peel a few times now, and I think the best part is that you can adjust it to your skin. On sensitive skin days, I&#x27;ll use one layer, but on more normal skin days I can use anywhere from 2-4 layers. This is a cheap, cost-effective way to get glowing skin. Don&#x27;t pay hundreds of dollars for low-percentage glycolic formulas - just get this one! Trust me, this works better than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the best peel I&#x27;ve ever used, bar none. I mean, amazing. I was shocked at how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I Used It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to space out how often you do this. Never more than once per week. I waited about 7-8 days between each peel and applied it a total of four times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to wash your face with a gentle cleanser and then use a toner or alcohol to remove anything from your skin. The instructions recommended using alcohol, but I used a toner because alcohol is just too harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each layer is applied thinly with a cotton ball. To be safe and risk damaging my skin, the first time I used this, I put on 1 layer and let it dry for 5 minutes. That worked wonders, but I wanted to go a little bit stronger, so the next 3 times, I applied 1 layer, let it dry for 1 minute, then apply 1more layer and let that dry for 2 minutes. That&#x27;s a total of 2 layers and 3 minutes waiting time altogether and that is perfect for me. Then you wash your face again and use a great moisturizer and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to get this near the corners of your mouth or nose because those are particularly sensitive areas and can burn a little bit. Otherwise, this is not bothersome at all. The results are instantly noticeable, no questions asked. This makes any acne instantly smaller and makes them heal way faster. This has made my skin just glow. The closest comparison I can make is the way your skin looks and feels after microdermabrasion, but the results are way more significant. The exact process, experience, and results will vary on an individual basis, but everyone who has reviewed this seems to have glowing reviews as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have a little sensitivity for a day or so after using this, but I had none. Definitely nothing like you would expect from a chemical peel though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regimen is designed to be done with minimal other products, so no toner or serum or \\&quot;unnecessaries\\&quot;. I did what I could to cut down on exfoliants, masks, toners, harsh makeup, etc. while I was testing this out. I also used a very gentle, all-natural skincare line while I used this. The Skin Regimen recommends using Dove bar soap, even for your face, and a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are incredible and I wish so badly that I would have taken a \\&quot;Before\\&quot; picture to show the difference, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be so obvious because I didn&#x27;t think my face was that bad before. I saw it after the first use and the results just get better and better.cessaries\\&quot;.

            <li> I&#x27;ve only done two peels so far, but I am very happy with the results! I have terrible skin, and have struggled with all sorts of acne products since I was eleven. Nothing has ever cleared my skin for any length of time. My skin is not totally clear yet, but it is better than it has been in over a decade!! I really like how I can control the intensity with different layers, so I can see how my skin reacts each time. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like once I am done with the Skin Regime&#x27;s boot camp!! Excellent product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve done three more peels, and I am loving this product!!! I rarely wear foundation any more because my skin tone has evened out so much. I usually do three or four layers, and I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects. I had some very slight flaking once, but it cleared up with moisturizer by the next day. I give this my highest recommendation!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my results!  I tried a different peel in the past and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference afterwards.  But I was very pleased with my results from this peel.  I did my first application on my forehead.  I&#x27;m still fairly young and don&#x27;t have too many fine lines or wrinkles but my skin has changed over the last few years.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is more dull, dry and not as smooth and soft as it used to be.  My forehead has been a bit rough and sort of bumpy.  So I thought that would be the perfect test area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a single layer application after cleansing my face.  I let the single layer sit on for about a minute and a half.  I did have a little bit of burning/tingling but nothing unbearable and not too uncomfortable. I moisturized with some organic moisturizer after washing off the solution.  I didn&#x27;t notice a drastic change but I did notice a change.  My forehead is definitely smoother and softer.  I like the idea of a slow gradual change so I definitely plan on repeating with another application.  The instructions said you can repeat the peel after a week and you can put up to 4 layers on during a single application.  I will stick to one layer just to keep it slow and gradual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the results.  This peel worked much better than the peel I used in the past.  And The Skin Regime book is a great resource to use along with the peel. It was very helpful in helping me understand how the peel works.  I would definitely recommend this peel and the book as well.  I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> After I used the peel the first time, I felt and saw an immediate difference in my skin - - so smooth! The instructions are very thorough (and do make sure you read through all the precautions &amp; &amp;#34;boring, but important&amp;#34; stuff before you attempt to use it) I put one layer on starting out and I wait a week in between peels. I&#x27;m now on peel #3 and I put two layers on for a little stronger peel.  I didn&#x27;t experience any bad side effects with this peel other than just a tiny bit of expected redness (more of a flush/blushed look) which went away in about an hour.  My face also feels warm for the rest of the day following a wrap, but I&#x27;m always cold - so I find it a plus!! I&#x27;ve always been very into skin care and have tried to take good care of it through the years, but this peel has really taken my skin to the next level.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal, cheaper than other peels, but way better.  I&#x27;m 21--no more pimples now.  Have to give up suntanning, though, makes my skin really soft and baby-like, need to protect that with sunscreen.  They tell you that in the instructions, too.  Book is good, too, saved a lot of money with suggestions.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product. The fact that you can actually LAYER it is insanely ingenious. Here&#x27;s what made me fall in love with this peel: consistency.  I&#x27;ve tried many other peels that were okay, but I would peel horribly in small patches of my face, while 90 percent of my face seemed completely unaffected. Not the case here at all. Even peeling throughout. And how amazing that YOU have the ultimate control over how deep or mild you peel is? Maybe next week I&#x27;ll go a little stronger, and the next a little milder. Just a really incredible product. Everyone is commenting on my skin. I&#x27;m getting stopped on the street with comments. Thank you, Dana.</li>
            <li> I am just starting out with this peel (going on week 3 of the skin regime boot camp)... Used it twice so far and will be using it for the 3rd time tomorrow night! However I am already very impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience so far is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time use I only did 1 layer to be &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;. It felt tingly and there was some heat, but was very tolerable. There was not a huge difference in my skin after that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second time I did 2 layers... I probably could have done another layer... But playing it safe I left it at 2. That time there was more tingling sensation (which I actually enjoyed) and a little more heat. Still very tolerable, as I do not have sensitive. After the peel I had very noticeably softer skin... Like baby soft kind of skin. The next couple days I did notice a little peeling of my skin. It wasnt too bad though, I exfoliated a little with a wash cloth and used lotion to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before I will do the peel for a 3rd time tomorrow night, and still have a few more weeks of the Skin Regime boot camp to do, before I can do a full review... But I can say that I am really liking the peel so far, and I am very excited about the results to come. I will definitely post an update review once my boot camp is finished. But until then, if you like watching youtube reviews you can find me there (user name agapelovegirl) because I will share an update there first as well as show before and after photos!</li>
            <li> Dana Ramos was the first person to introduce me to the at home peels and I am so glad she did. You can find my initial review of my first peeling routine on my blog at The Skin Care Regime. The last time I had used a peel was back between late June and July. I had wanted to start it before Summer was in and another reason for the peels was my acne coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important follow-up to a peel routine is to be sure to use sunscreen all the time. Just because you do the peel routine and your face looks fabulous, doesn&#x27;t mean you should go out unprotected, especially if you have sun spots like I do. After years of going without sunscreen this is one habit I am having a hard time breaking. As they say, old habits die-hard. The main problem I have is just plain forgetting to put on the sunscreen. Even carrying sunscreen in my purse does me no good after my makeup is on. Ramos would differ, but once I am out and about, applying sunscreen over my makeup just won&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When doing the face peel, to get the best results you should apply it once a week (the same day) for a 6-8 week interval. It is recommended that after, you then use them every few months or a couple of times a year at the least. I have found that I can tell when I need to do another peel routine, as the dead skin begins to build up and clog my pores. In turn, I begin to develop dry patches, white heads and really oily skin which turns into acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you a first time peeler? There are  a few different reasons why this new 1-4 Peel is ideal for the first time peeler. The 1-4 Peel, allows you the user, to layer the face peel. 1st layer mild, 2nd layer moderate and 3rd layer much stronger, for those who are already tolerate to peeling. With the first layer being mild enough for any skin type, if you feel uncomfortable, you can stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1-4 peel is just as described and works well if you follow the directions. First timers should test a small area of skin on their forearm, before applying the peel, to see if they can tolerate it. Once you are ready for the peel be sure to wash and scrub your face first with soap and a washcloth. Ramos recommends using Dove soap for cleansing your skin before applying the face peel. You then follow-up with rubbing alcohol to remove any soap residue or an astringent if you have more sensitive skin. I have currently moved up to using the alcohol to cleanse before the peel, as my face can tolerate it. However if you are new to peeling, be sure to stick with an astringent, as it is milder than rubbing alcohol and not as irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready? Gloves are not required however if you feel more comfortable using gloves or have a nice manicure, I would recommend gloves. Using a cotton ball, clean cotton gauze or similar small clean pad used for face cleansing, pour some of the peel onto the pad. I like to use a medicine cup and dab my pad into the solution squeeze the excess then apply. Apply the peel in one layer to your whole face and feather around the jaw line. Be sure to avoid going to close to the eye area and do not apply to your lips. I have found the corners of my nose are sensitive, so I avoid that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a first timer, leave the peel on at least 1-3 minutes or as tolerated. The second time you use the peel you can go a little longer. I leave my peel on for 5-9 minutes. I then rinse and although not a requirement, I follow-up with baking soda mixed with water to neutralize it. After, be sure to follow-up with a good facial moisturizer and don&#x27;t forget the sunscreen, especially if you are in the middle of a peeling routine.n on their forearm, before applying the peel, to see if they can tolerate it.

            <li> Right now, given the schedule of the Beauty Boot Camp, I have been able to use two peels, waiting more than seven days in between to give my skin a chance to rest. I have not yet posted photos, because I want to complete as many peels as I can with my sample sized bottle before showing you my results. What did I notice so far? The first peel was new to my sensitive skin, so I did experience some redness and flakiness, but I knew not to be alarmed. I did not see the temporary increase in pimples that some people do experience, so I was pretty happy. My skin felt a lot softer after just the first peel, and I noticed that I had that &amp;#34;after peel&amp;#34; kind of flush/glow that is described in The Skin Regime. Between using the 1-4-All-Peel, as well as the recommended moisturizers and other products, I really feel like I have a chance at squashing my mild acne and getting a more even tone for my skin overall. I am very happy with this product so far, and can&#x27;t wait to update you after I have finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> The peel along with the tips from the author has worked amazingly and has helped minimize fine lines, acne, pores and even discoloration of my skin. It’s the best regime to exfoliate the skin in a budget friendly manner. The peel doesn’t feel greasy. When applied the skin just absorbs it easily. It’s very light and gives great moisture to the skin. My skin feels youthful and full of life. My glow is back and i love how it makes me feel. Overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review. However the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I am hesitant to try products like these because I am always afraid of what it might do to my skin. I was SO pleased I decided to give the peel a try! After just one use, I noticed a big difference in the way my skin felt. The next day, I could see that my pores are visibly smaller! No bad side effects, no burning sensation and no red skin (although it is totally normal if this does happen to you). Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Here is my experience with the 1-4- All Peel (a Glycolic Acid):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing my face with a mild cleanser Dana Ramos instructs on double cleansing the face with alcohol (or if you have sensitive skin with witch hazel). After the alcohol dried off I applied the peel with a cotton ball. Dana Ramos advices strictly to see how the tolerance of this product is for at least a minute before you decide if you want to apply another layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product you can layer! You decide how much of a peel you want or need! (Usually peels have a percentage ranging anywhere from 10-30 %).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I waited as instructed a minute. I had no tingling- no nothing and so I applied another layer and then even another (but do not more then 4 layers!). After a couple of minutes (don´t wait longer then 5 minutes!)  I started to feel a mild tingling and maybe a hint of burning. So I washed it off with cold water. My face looked a bit red on the forehead- that was it. I used a gentle moisturizer and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day my skin felt really dry- but nothing a moisturizer could not handle. After 3 days I had a really strong peeling all over my face- just like after a sunburn. The peeling took a couple of days. This was a much stronger peeling then with the Lactic Acid I tried before for sure. But once that was done new wonderful skin was revealed! YAY! Results are fabulous. Got rid of some darker spots on my skin. Loved it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I was quite skeptical of this peel - but it truly does deliver amazing results.  I have a lot of sun damage/wrinkles, thinning skin and uneven skin tones, so I was very cautious with the amount of peel applied...just a teeny but did wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are very precise and easy to understand. I felt quite confident undertaking this on my own.  I have done 3 peels so far with about 8 to 9 days in between and I am loving my new younger looking skin. My skin is so much smoother and vibrant looking....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so affordable and easy to apply in the privacy of your own home. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. You gotta try it!</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing.  I have tried everything on the market.  I even went every 6 weeks for professional treatments for years.  Then I met Dana!!  Her peel is life changing!!!  My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> Well, like others I am victim to melasma,and I have tried everything,came to the point where I could not afford going to dermatologist an more so not seeing any reults.I never had to wear make up,just eyeliner and lipliner,I really have no wrinkles and I am 52,I have  olive complexion and with the melasma  the warm weather heat impacts my skin and brings out my melasma,actually my skin gets an automatic tan in between,my melasma really started at 35 once I stopped being a sun goddess in Italy and came here in USA and stopped going to beaches here.&amp;#34;You would understand why&amp;#34;,and gradually they appeared,the forhead,it looked like a hot marshmellow was targeted,and my cheeks.I started to go to dermatologist and stopped for awhile,and had treatments where it would go away only to have nice skin for a week and it would all come back without sun.I would use mosterizers,cover my self with hats,add ice cubes to my skin before goiing out,till one day I had this procedure,it was like a laser,forgot what it was called,it actually after it was done looked like someone ironed my face,it took a week for it to disappear,and it shifted my melasma to other places where I never really had it and still leaving my  forehead, and cheeks.I sweared never again will I get this one again,.I cried and cried,and was out of work for a few days.I was given the boot camp book, a while back and never really glanced through it,till I ordered the product,started using it and reading the instructions and seeing results,alot better, and reading the book again given,and surprised how all along I was not doing it correctly,still getting results,and advice from Dana,and yes,you need to read the book,and yes my skin is alot better,and yes just a slight touch of foundation till my goal is reached,with no foundtion at all,just suncreen and moisterizer.  Thanks Dana and Nancy C.</li>
            <li> Look no further! This one is layer-able, you can use 1 to 4 layers. WOW!!! Easy and VERY effective. Worth every single penny!! To see my full review check: [...]</li>
            <li> I did my first official peel today to start my skin boot camp. Right now my skin feels amazing, and I can only imagine it will get better and better. I had never used a peel before this, and it was shockingly easy. And the results are immediate. The only thing I noticed was a very slight burning, but it was almost nothing. It also smells a little caustic, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about this peel is that the intensity changes depending on how many layers you apply. You can apply 1 layer for sensitive skin or  for those new to peels, all the way up to four layers for more tolerant skin. I started with just 1 layer, but today I did 4 layers and I have had no issues. I LOVE THIS PEEL and will likely purchase a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I confess that I have never tried a skin peel before, and I knew very little about the subject. However, now that I have crossed the magical threshold of 40 years (ugh), skin health is a topic about which I am extremely interested. I am all about trying to optimize the appearance of my skin, without any cosmetic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended that I read The Skin Regime before trying the peel, and that is exactly what I did. The premise of the book is simple: a 6-8 week regimen to optimize the health of your skin. The author, Dana Ramos is not a health care professional, but a writer who is a skin care enthusiast. She spent many years battling problem skin. After doing some research, and working in conjunction with a dermatologist for technical advice, she wrote this book, and developed a simple peel to help rejuvenate and clarify your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I sampled the 1-4-All Peel, and, to be honest, I was a bit nervous. It&#x27;s not that I have super sensitive skin or anything, but I have heard and seen horror stories of women who go lobster red after doing a chemical peel on their face. However, after following Dana&#x27;s instructions to the letter, I applied one layer of peel (the recommendation for a novice), left it on for five minutes, and washed it off. I experienced very mild tingling, and no redness at all. My skin looked great the next morning, no irritation or flaking. The recommendation for The Skin Regime is to do 6-8 peels (one week apart) to obtain the maximum effect. That is exactly what I intend to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I was very happy with my 1-4-All Peel and The Skin Regime book. The book was well written, with a conversational tone, making it a very easy and understandable read. It provides you with clear instructions and advice on how to obtain great looking skin for very little money. The peel was a breeze, and the results were exactly what the author predicted. My skin looked great the day after doing my peel, and I experienced very little if any irritation.tation.</li>
            <li> The Best home peel i ever tried It blow my mind, I have tried 3 differences peel Before i tried 1-4 peel by skin Regime, this is my 3rd peeled so far, im pleased and very happy with the result It changed my life and my confident of my look this peel is difference with others, some too strong or too weak but this one just about right beside almost no down time after peel just some redness the result is what i expected thank you Dana Ramos thank you Skin regime with out this peel Im still hiding in closet and hate to go out in public but you changed my life thank you Million, for those who tried other peel before and unhappy with the result You should try this one before giving up and I will leave to You to judge. It really work for me and I hope will work for others too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about this product - you&#x27;re missing out if you&#x27;re not using this. I will be honest, I was a little nervous about trying this at first, I had a terrible experience in the past with an at-home-peel. I was beyond excited when I not only didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to this but I actually started to see soft, glowing, smooth, beautiful skin. This was so easy to use and the product is really high quality! I am so excited to watch my skin get better and better from using this &amp; I love the price!!! How amazing that I can safely do this at home once a week and get spa results. I could NEVER afford going to the spa to get this done weekly. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can get professional results at home for a fraction of the cost. After after having two kids my skin was looking dull and tired and I started noticing dark spots appearing on my face.  I had always had regular facials and professional  glycolic peels and I desperately wanted that fresh, glowing skin again but I could no longer find the time for or justify the expense of regular facials. Then a good friend introduced me to The Skin Regime.  I contacted Dana and she guided me on the products.  I used the 1-4-All-Peel and I am thrilled with the results.  Even though I have completed the peels, my skin just keeps getting brighter and fresher looking.  The dark spots are gone, my skin has a rosy glow and it feels great. I wish I had found out about it sooner. Thank you Dana!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, despite the copious amounts of instructions I received, I was a bit nervous about using this product. I mean, a chemical peel and that too at home? This is my FACE we&#x27;re talking about! But I swallowed my hesitation and tried this peel...and let me tell you, I&#x27;m floored! I expected some serious irritation since my skin can be so finicky and sensitive but once applied, I felt nothing but a little mild discomfort, almost like an itch. Once I washed my face clean, my face looked absolutely RADIANT! Glowing, smooth and firm. The humidity has been brutal to my skin and I have endured acne that I haven&#x27;t seen since my teenage years but I swear, one use and even some of my older acne scars looked somewhat faded. Can I just say...SOLD! I fully intend to repeat this peel just before my sister&#x27;s wedding!</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh, this stuff should be called miracle in a bottle.  I will continue to do my peels as often as suggested because my skin looks glowing and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m really pleased with my progress.  I&#x27;m going to compare my own before and after photos and my sisters are following my progress to see if this is something they would like to try as well.  The peel does feel hot when applying it but I read that it&#x27;s normal and I haven&#x27;t been concerned with that.  I&#x27;ve added the Value Pack #1 by The Skin Regime to my wish list and it&#x27;s going to be an early Christmas gift to myself.  I deserve it.</li>
