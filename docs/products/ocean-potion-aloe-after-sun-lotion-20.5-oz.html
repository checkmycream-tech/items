            <li>I love the lotion though.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This lotion has mostly ingrediants that are good, although one of the last items is Methyl-paraben which is not supposed to be good.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this and will be buying more!!</li>
            <li>I grew up in Arizona where tanning and burns were super popular</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, the ingredients are all natural, and it is solo good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I have Very sensitive skin and for some reason this works great for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs really quickly, leaves a gorgeous sweet scent, keeps you moisturized all day</li>
            <li>It is also available at most Walmarts for $3.97.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, hydrating and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Ocean Potion&#x27;s lotion has a very clean and fresh, yet outdoorsy smell and feel that both men and women will love.  </li>

            <li>Thanks for the great deal, surprisingly its been a pain finding the product locally!</li>
            <li>It feels light on and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I bought this because Vaseling Intensive Care isn&#x27;t available anymore.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, lotion does go on smoothly without sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel great after being in the sun all day, it smells awesome and really does make your tan last longer!</li>

            <li>It goes on smooth, has no scent (which is important to me since I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry either way, once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin you&#x27;ll no longer be able to smell it.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to ask questions in the comments.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, light peachy smell and it really hydrates.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, and makes your skin feel soft and full of moisture for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to body shop lotion, which is VERY emolient, so this one is not quite up to my standards, but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>As for it&#x27;s original purpose for aftersun and as a moisturizer...wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s just my observation, results may vary, every one is individually unique,</li>
            <li>We burn easily, so we bought three bottles, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Plus I am from the Space Coast and this this is made right here!</li>
            <li>It is natural, it smells so nice</li>
            <li>Keeps elbows, hands and feet soft and nice to look at.  </li>
            <li>Lotion smells sweet, almost like a mixture of shea butter, almond, coconut to my nose.</li>
            <li>My son in law loves his tan many weeks after leaving Florida, thanks.</li>
            <li>So I was pretty excited to see that you had it in stock and shipped it quickly!</li>
            <li>, it feels nice on the skin, and most of all, it seems to work miracles with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheap, yet loaded with healthy ingredients that keep my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Contains retinyl palmitate thus would not recommend using it if you&#x27;re pregnant.</li>
            <li>Later I found it was one of the best facial cremes I have ever used.</li>
            <li>all time favorite, main, number one go-to lotion is....</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very light skinned, and very sensitive to the sun, so that&#x27;s not why I bought this.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on and is absorbed quickly with no greasiness at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair-skinned and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>Ocean Potion is great to use all year round.  </li>
            <li>This is a great everyday moistuizer.</li>
            <li>A great moisturizer for year round.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s truly a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Ocean Potion&#x27;s lotion (try saying that 5 times really fast) has a natural scent and is made with natural ingredients and works great.  </li>
            <li>The Ocean Potion Aloe After Sun Lotion has such a nice fragrence that I use it all th time, not just for after sun use.  </li>
            <li>Because I am naturally tan (being born in the tropics)I love suntanning and getting the sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
            <li>not heavy but has a refreshing fragrance ...</li>
            <li>Check out the ingredients: Deionized Water, Canola Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Extracts of Burdock, Calendula, Matricaria, Comfrey, Golden Seal, Honey and Linden, Seaweed Extract (Macrocystis Pyrifera), Tocopherol Acetate    </li>
            <li>Has paraben (5 different kind fact).</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday lotion: light, easy to apply, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>My main go-to is Lubriderm Advanced Therapy.  </li>
            <li>A nice light moisturizer with a slightly fruity scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy, not thick.  </li>
            <li>i was itchy in certain spots, and noticed my skin started making marks (on my gluteous luckily).</li>
            <li>The reason y i picked up this lotion vs that coco butter shea or bio-oil (which bio-oil felt nice at first, then just too greasy and too long</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, actually my skin reacts in hives, itchiness and a rash to almost anything I put on it, this lotion is the best I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li>Good aloe, leaves you feeling a little greasy though</li>
            <li>It is an absolute miracle after sun lotion, a must have at my house!</li>
            <li>I wanted one that had as many as possible.</li>
            <li>43lbs and am gestational diabetic with first baby.</li>
            <li>But of course the first time I go to the beach in years, I end up underestimating the sun&#x27;s rays AGAIN and put no SPF or the lowest one I could manage.  </li>
            <li>Smells funny</li>
            <li>Also aloe is not one of the first ingredients, but canola oil is.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this a number of years ago after I had knee replacement surgery.</li>
            <li>I bought many bottles and gave them to my various hosts.</li>
            <li>It simply melts into the skin and does not just lay there on top leaving a film.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>:) Sometimes you can actually find it cheaper at Walgreens though.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted in a Very timely manor.</li>
            <li>It is very economical and does the job better than more expensive lotions.  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out any more.</li>
            <li>Now, i have sensitive skin to begin with- eczema, so im super picky with the lotions i use.</li>
            <li>I also have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>With my already fair and genetically crappy dry skin, the dozens of times I&#x27;ve been sunburned every summer mixed with the</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even get in the sun, but I do brush my skin everyday before I bath,(google; T-Tapp it amazing), and my instructions is to use lotion without alcohol, but to use an Aloe based lotion.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for sunburns and preventing them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and leaves skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>anything u put on after 6weeks isnt ganna help much.</li>
            <li>absolutely ❤ ❤</li>
            <li>The aloe vera gel that we had didn&#x27;t really help</li>
            <li>so I took a chance on Ocean Potion when I saw it at the store -- plus the price was so reasonable for the amount of lotion I was getting</li>
            <li>This lotion smells like an orange creamsicle and really softens your skins.  </li>
            <li>It really does soak in well.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper at Walmart though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>absolutely yuck...</li>
            <li>This aloe lotion works really well, and smells so coconut-y and tropical.</li>
            <li>Really takes the heat away from a sunburn and helps healing.</li>
            <li>My love affair with this stuff started in Barbados, I bought it to treat expected sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to add though, that you can find this for much cheaper at WalMart.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>It has a surprisingly low price given the many natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t slimy or sticky like many other lotions.</li>
            <li>It soothes the sunburn without leaving a sticky residue that so many other types are known for.</li>
            <li>I checked every store in my area of Washington, but Amazon was the only place that had it for quick shipping at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>i am pale as paper and get burnt very easily.  </li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m 65 years old</li>
            <li>Love this - it&#x27;s lighter so not super moisturizing</li>
            <li>It also smells much better than any aloe I&#x27;ve used and has a less slimy texture.</li>
            <li>and I find that I burn a lot less, tan a lot more, and stay tan a lot longer with</li>
            <li>main thing about this lotion is it helps to extend tan life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live on the beach and myself, as well as many other locals, live by this product.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, my skin doesn&#x27;t react and it has a slightly tropical scent that isn&#x27;t offending and actually makes you feel kind of summery.  </li>
            <li>Great product-way too expensive on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It really soaks into your skin, and makes it sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>Yet again, a person with normal skin should have no problem using this stuff year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A normal person, with normal skin (aka.</li>
            <li>Oh and it arrived super fast, 2 days sooner than expected</li>
            <li>I still have my deep tan too and no more peel after one week of consistent use! :)</li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t all natural, which the older</li>
            <li>i originally found this product while visiting in Florida and spending a little too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frustrated that I will not be able to use the product that I love so much.</li>
            <li>I recommend doing exactly that, to apply often daily to keep skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li>bottle is under 4 bucks all day long at Walmart, right?</li>
            <li>(im very religous about lotion after showers) and those very days- prob about 8-10 hours later (and definately by my next shower)</li>
            <li>By the way, ive gained so far-</li>
            <li>Totally natural ingredients</li>
            <li>, I was.very surprised to understand</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, soothes overexposure to the sun, prevents peeling and saves my tan for weeks.</li>
            <li>I also like that is all natural ingrediants</li>
            <li>If you use this lotion on a regular basis you&#x27;ll find that you get a tan easier, lower your chances of being sunburned, and maintain that tan far longer than you normally would.  </li>
            <li>During the cold months I use Lubriderm Advanced Therapy because it moisturizes far more and keeps me from drying out like a raisin on daily basis.  </li>
            <li>We love the product because my husband uses it everyday for his dry skin</li>
            <li>I love that you can put it on, and actually get dressed a few minutes later without your clothes sticking to you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried steroid creams, prescription lotions, expensive designer moisturizers, all natural creams, and holistic herbal remedies - almost all of them have not worked as good as this simple, inexpensive lotion.  </li>
            <li>my favorite and hard to find!</li>
            <li>The pump on my lotion is a cheap green not yellow as pictured.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and urge you to try and find another that works better; I&#x27;m betting you will have a difficult time.  </li>
            <li>After I ran out of in the states, I was really shocked and extremely happy to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>And last- start early-</li>
            <li>Even after 4-6 hours offroading if I apply this, I end up with no peeling, sensitive, or even as red skin.  </li>
            <li>It has multiple natural oils in the ingredients</li>
            <li>This stuff is so much cheaper than other products out there</li>
            <li>In the winter after exposure to sun and cold icy winds it works great too.</li>
            <li>and they are never dry anymore.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin that is genetically far dryer than you can imagine -</li>
            <li>all natural, long lasting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I share this with you because I want you to know that when I say I&#x27;ve tried HUNDREDS of lotions on a DAILY basis over the 25 years I&#x27;ve been alive - I mean exactly that.  </li>
            <li>Out of the hundreds of lotions I&#x27;ve used on a daily basis throughout my life I have narrowed down 2 main &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; lotions that I use on a daily basis and have for the last several years and will continue to use for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve literally tried hundreds of lotions, both expensive and cheap, natural and not, scented and unscented throughout my life.  </li>

            <li> I love the lotion though.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion has mostly ingrediants that are good, although one of the last items is Methyl-paraben which is not supposed to be good.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this and will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I grew up in Arizona where tanning and burns were super popular</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, the ingredients are all natural, and it is solo good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have Very sensitive skin and for some reason this works great for me.  </li>

            <li> It is also available at most Walmarts for $3.97.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t worry either way, once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin you&#x27;ll no longer be able to smell it.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to ask questions in the comments.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, light peachy smell and it really hydrates.</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and makes your skin feel soft and full of moisture for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to body shop lotion, which is VERY emolient, so this one is not quite up to my standards, but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> As for it&#x27;s original purpose for aftersun and as a moisturizer...wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s just my observation, results may vary, every one is individually unique,</li>
            <li> We burn easily, so we bought three bottles, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Plus I am from the Space Coast and this this is made right here!</li>
            <li> It is natural, it smells so nice</li>
            <li> Keeps elbows, hands and feet soft and nice to look at.  </li>
            <li> Lotion smells sweet, almost like a mixture of shea butter, almond, coconut to my nose.</li>
            <li> My son in law loves his tan many weeks after leaving Florida, thanks.</li>
            <li> So I was pretty excited to see that you had it in stock and shipped it quickly!</li>
            <li> , it feels nice on the skin, and most of all, it seems to work miracles with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap, yet loaded with healthy ingredients that keep my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Contains retinyl palmitate thus would not recommend using it if you&#x27;re pregnant.</li>
            <li> Later I found it was one of the best facial cremes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> all time favorite, main, number one go-to lotion is....</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very light skinned, and very sensitive to the sun, so that&#x27;s not why I bought this.  </li>
            <li> , it goes on and is absorbed quickly with no greasiness at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> Ocean Potion is great to use all year round.  </li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moistuizer.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for year round.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s truly a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Ocean Potion&#x27;s lotion (try saying that 5 times really fast) has a natural scent and is made with natural ingredients and works great.  </li>
            <li> The Ocean Potion Aloe After Sun Lotion has such a nice fragrence that I use it all th time, not just for after sun use.  </li>
            <li> Because I am naturally tan (being born in the tropics)I love suntanning and getting the sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
            <li> not heavy but has a refreshing fragrance ...</li>
            <li> Check out the ingredients: Deionized Water, Canola Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Extracts of Burdock, Calendula, Matricaria, Comfrey, Golden Seal, Honey and Linden, Seaweed Extract (Macrocystis Pyrifera), Tocopherol Acetate    </li>
            <li> Has paraben (5 different kind fact).</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday lotion: light, easy to apply, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> My main go-to is Lubriderm Advanced Therapy.  </li>
            <li> A nice light moisturizer with a slightly fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy, not thick.  </li>
            <li> i was itchy in certain spots, and noticed my skin started making marks (on my gluteous luckily).</li>
            <li> The reason y i picked up this lotion vs that coco butter shea or bio-oil (which bio-oil felt nice at first, then just too greasy and too long</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, actually my skin reacts in hives, itchiness and a rash to almost anything I put on it, this lotion is the best I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li> Good aloe, leaves you feeling a little greasy though</li>
            <li> It is an absolute miracle after sun lotion, a must have at my house!</li>
            <li> I wanted one that had as many as possible.</li>
            <li> 43lbs and am gestational diabetic with first baby.</li>
            <li> But of course the first time I go to the beach in years, I end up underestimating the sun&#x27;s rays AGAIN and put no SPF or the lowest one I could manage.  </li>
            <li> Smells funny</li>
            <li> Also aloe is not one of the first ingredients, but canola oil is.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this a number of years ago after I had knee replacement surgery.</li>
            <li> I bought many bottles and gave them to my various hosts.</li>
            <li> It simply melts into the skin and does not just lay there on top leaving a film.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> :) Sometimes you can actually find it cheaper at Walgreens though.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted in a Very timely manor.</li>
            <li> It is very economical and does the job better than more expensive lotions.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out any more.</li>
            <li> Now, i have sensitive skin to begin with- eczema, so im super picky with the lotions i use.</li>
            <li> I also have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> With my already fair and genetically crappy dry skin, the dozens of times I&#x27;ve been sunburned every summer mixed with the</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even get in the sun, but I do brush my skin everyday before I bath,(google; T-Tapp it amazing), and my instructions is to use lotion without alcohol, but to use an Aloe based lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for sunburns and preventing them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, and leaves skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> anything u put on after 6weeks isnt ganna help much.</li>
            <li> absolutely ❤ ❤</li>
            <li> The aloe vera gel that we had didn&#x27;t really help</li>
            <li> so I took a chance on Ocean Potion when I saw it at the store -- plus the price was so reasonable for the amount of lotion I was getting</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like an orange creamsicle and really softens your skins.  </li>
            <li> It really does soak in well.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper at Walmart though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> absolutely yuck...</li>
            <li> This aloe lotion works really well, and smells so coconut-y and tropical.</li>
            <li> Really takes the heat away from a sunburn and helps healing.</li>
            <li> My love affair with this stuff started in Barbados, I bought it to treat expected sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to add though, that you can find this for much cheaper at WalMart.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> It has a surprisingly low price given the many natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t slimy or sticky like many other lotions.</li>
            <li> It soothes the sunburn without leaving a sticky residue that so many other types are known for.</li>
            <li> I checked every store in my area of Washington, but Amazon was the only place that had it for quick shipping at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> i am pale as paper and get burnt very easily.  </li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m 65 years old</li>
            <li> Love this - it&#x27;s lighter so not super moisturizing</li>
            <li> It also smells much better than any aloe I&#x27;ve used and has a less slimy texture.</li>
            <li> and I find that I burn a lot less, tan a lot more, and stay tan a lot longer with</li>
            <li> main thing about this lotion is it helps to extend tan life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I live on the beach and myself, as well as many other locals, live by this product.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, my skin doesn&#x27;t react and it has a slightly tropical scent that isn&#x27;t offending and actually makes you feel kind of summery.  </li>
            <li> Great product-way too expensive on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It really soaks into your skin, and makes it sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> Yet again, a person with normal skin should have no problem using this stuff year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A normal person, with normal skin (aka.</li>
            <li> Oh and it arrived super fast, 2 days sooner than expected</li>
            <li> I still have my deep tan too and no more peel after one week of consistent use! :)</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t all natural, which the older</li>
            <li> i originally found this product while visiting in Florida and spending a little too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated that I will not be able to use the product that I love so much.</li>
            <li> I recommend doing exactly that, to apply often daily to keep skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li> bottle is under 4 bucks all day long at Walmart, right?</li>
            <li> (im very religous about lotion after showers) and those very days- prob about 8-10 hours later (and definately by my next shower)</li>
            <li> By the way, ive gained so far-</li>
            <li> Totally natural ingredients</li>
            <li> , I was.very surprised to understand</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, soothes overexposure to the sun, prevents peeling and saves my tan for weeks.</li>
            <li> I also like that is all natural ingrediants</li>
            <li> If you use this lotion on a regular basis you&#x27;ll find that you get a tan easier, lower your chances of being sunburned, and maintain that tan far longer than you normally would.  </li>
            <li> During the cold months I use Lubriderm Advanced Therapy because it moisturizes far more and keeps me from drying out like a raisin on daily basis.  </li>
            <li> We love the product because my husband uses it everyday for his dry skin</li>
            <li> I love that you can put it on, and actually get dressed a few minutes later without your clothes sticking to you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried steroid creams, prescription lotions, expensive designer moisturizers, all natural creams, and holistic herbal remedies - almost all of them have not worked as good as this simple, inexpensive lotion.  </li>
            <li> my favorite and hard to find!</li>
            <li> The pump on my lotion is a cheap green not yellow as pictured.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and urge you to try and find another that works better; I&#x27;m betting you will have a difficult time.  </li>
            <li> After I ran out of in the states, I was really shocked and extremely happy to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> And last- start early-</li>
            <li> Even after 4-6 hours offroading if I apply this, I end up with no peeling, sensitive, or even as red skin.  </li>
            <li> It has multiple natural oils in the ingredients</li>
            <li> This stuff is so much cheaper than other products out there</li>
            <li> In the winter after exposure to sun and cold icy winds it works great too.</li>
            <li> and they are never dry anymore.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that is genetically far dryer than you can imagine -</li>
            <li> all natural, long lasting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I share this with you because I want you to know that when I say I&#x27;ve tried HUNDREDS of lotions on a DAILY basis over the 25 years I&#x27;ve been alive - I mean exactly that.  </li>
            <li> Out of the hundreds of lotions I&#x27;ve used on a daily basis throughout my life I have narrowed down 2 main &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; lotions that I use on a daily basis and have for the last several years and will continue to use for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally tried hundreds of lotions, both expensive and cheap, natural and not, scented and unscented throughout my life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things to keep in mind when applying the lotion, wen ur in the shower, u hve to exfoliate reeeaaall good first- like actal brush in small circular motions to get all that dead skin off, and every time i apply, i exfoliate at least a little so lets say i did it twice that day, the second time i&#x27;ll at least use a wash cloth to exfoliate the itchy part gently.</li>
            <li> Although I did peel a lot due to burning the first day, it also helped minimize the flaking/blotchy spots, and both disappeared after a few days.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only thing that helped my dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> This is such a disappointment because this was my favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face daily, and anywhere else that feels dry.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally but found here at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it keeps my skin moist for a long time</li>
            <li> Nothing comes close to the sort of care Ocean Potion provides skin, whether its after a long day at the beach or after exposure from outdoor work.  </li>
            <li> On the first day I got burned pretty badly and needed to find some sort of after-sun lotion to help.  </li>
            <li> AT ALL), AND RELEIF OF DRY SKIN, (NOT GREASY).</li>
            <li> I experience a problem with dry feet</li>
            <li> even if you think your skin is dry, it isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.  </li>
            <li> This thing was a miracle worker on my single and basically saved it.</li>
            <li> so expect a slight sheen and extremely minor greasy feel for a short time after applying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily for years and year round.</li>
            <li> Not very well packaged at all.</li>
            <li> A person with average skin, or even moderately dry skin, should have no problem with this stuff at all.  </li>
            <li> However, i would NOT be repurchasing it after this one bottle mainly due to the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Next, apply a decent amount so ur not spreading it too thin and let it sit before any clothes for at least a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So i started as early as second month and been putting it on daily (minus three days, which i see the results now :(.</li>
            <li> The average person wont,</li>
            <li> But remember, the average person will not have to do this.  </li>
            <li> If I were to give this lotion a star less than five it would be a lie.</li>
            <li> It helps cool off bad burns and reduce peeling.</li>
            <li> We keep it in stock every summer and it preserves our tans and is cooling if we&#x27;re a little crispy.</li>
            <li> That was my mistake #1, i thought a little couldnt hurt.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money by buying anything else.</li>
            <li> I usually stock up when I find it.</li>
            <li> and I usually burn before I tan,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not able to use this product.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, or afraid that others might think you stink, this is not the product for you (at least around others).</li>
            <li> I use it year round -- to battle sun/wind damage and also against the cold, dry winter weather damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> a mixture of coconut and orange, hard to describe, but the resulting scent is not very pleasant (to me at least).</li>
            <li> The furnace heat, layers of itchy clothing, and the bitter, frigid cold take a huge toll on my skin in the winter</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is its smell...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually on the watery side but not in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> The item I received was poorly packaged in a bubble envelope instead of a box.</li>
            <li> But not happy with the way it was shipped.</li>
            <li> The smell made me ill.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to disappoint you.  </li>
            <li> Remember, I was born with awful, awful dry, itchy skin and these are my opinions based off of my experience with my body and this product.  </li>
            <li> - I had a bad sunburn this summer and tried this lotion.  </li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t think it was that bad, but to me it was unbearable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to face lotion when my skin is having a bad moment.</li>
            <li> I bought this while I was in Mexico, after I got badly sunburnt.</li>
            <li> but I hated the smell.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed they will be taking jobs away form Brevard County and moving them to Georgia.</li>
            <li> BUT the packaging was terrible as all three bottles leaked inside the box!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best aftersun lotion we&#x27;ve found at our house. We keep it in stock every summer and it preserves our tans and is cooling if we&#x27;re a little crispy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my all time favorite after-sun lotion. It helps cool off bad burns and reduce peeling. It feels light on and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It isn&#x27;t slimy or sticky like many other lotions. It also smells delicious and tropical. That being said, the seller I ordered from (ToysandGamesetc) sent me an opened, unsealed bottle that had its sell by dates blacked out. I&#x27;m frustrated that I will not be able to use the product that I love so much. Make sure that you are buying from a reputable seller! With an opened bottle, contents could have been altered in any way.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for sunburns and preventing them. We burn easily, so we bought three bottles, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not greasy and it keeps my skin moist for a long time, I use this twice a week on my feet, legs, and arms and they are never dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Soothsayer my sunburn and keeps my tan. My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out any more.</li>
            <li> This product is really good to help prevent my skin to peel (I got huge sunburns!), good hydration, and I am keeping a nice tan. The only bad thing about it is its smell... a mixture of coconut and orange, hard to describe, but the resulting scent is not very pleasant (to me at least). Better if it would have been more discreet...</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Potion for over 6 years and would not make it thru the summer without it! My family refers to it as the &#x27;magic lotion&#x27; because it smells wonderful, soaks right in, prolongs your tan and takes the sting out of sunburn. It is an absolute miracle after sun lotion, a must have at my house!</li>
            <li> Best after sun lotion! Great smelling. No greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> If I were to give this lotion a star less than five it would be a lie. This is the most amazing lotion ever created and everyone needs to have it. It smells amazing, the ingredients are all natural, and it is solo good for your skin. Any skin for that matter. Love ittttt.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. It&#x27;s perfect to use after tanning, being out in the sun/wind, or after showering. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and has a nice fruity scent. My skin looks amazing after applying it. Best of all, it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the lotion at a local store, but they stopped carring it.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  I like the smell and texture of the lotion.  It does not feel greasy, and dries quickley. I will be purchasing this lotion again.</li>
            <li> i am pale as paper and get burnt very easily.  this lotion is great- soothing but not sticky like pure aloe. it also help prevent peeling</li>
            <li> This is my favorite all-weather lotion. It has a nice, light peachy smell and it really hydrates.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion after salon tanning, and it has definitely extended my tan life! It goes on without being greasy and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. It is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> We Love this lotion. In our family we consider this one of the best body lotions available out there. It is natural, it smells so nice, it feels nice on the skin, and most of all, it seems to work miracles with dry skin. We use it as a daily lotion, not just for after the sun, and during skin emergencies - works every time. Highly recommend this! Great product!</li>
            <li> this lotion is the best after sun care lotion I have used.  It is not greasy, and leaves skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is without question, the BEST after sun care lotion that we&#x27;ve ever tried.  It smells clean and fresh, it goes on and is absorbed quickly with no greasiness at all.  Excellent after-sun tan prolonging, pain relieveing stuff.  Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a tanning bed, and she turned me on to this luscious stuff. First off I&#x27;m 65 years old so I need good stuff like this, I don&#x27;t even get in the sun, but I do brush my skin everyday before I bath,(google; T-Tapp it amazing), and my instructions is to use lotion without alcohol, but to use an Aloe based lotion. This stuff has that and so much more. I love it and can see my skin tightening already. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my tan! Love it!</li>
            <li> So! Ive found that this stuff is awesome for PREGNANCY STRETCH MARKS. Im 38 weeks, bearly any stretch marks- and the reason y i say its the lotion and not genetics, because 1) my mom had lots of stretch marks, 2) i neglected to put it on three times after month 3 (im very religous about lotion after showers) and those very days- prob about 8-10 hours later (and definately by my next shower) i was itchy in certain spots, and noticed my skin started making marks (on my gluteous luckily). Now, i have sensitive skin to begin with- eczema, so im super picky with the lotions i use. The reason y i picked up this lotion vs that coco butter shea or bio-oil (which bio-oil felt nice at first, then just too greasy and too long a wait for it to soak) is because of the ingredients: aloe, vit A, vit E, seaweed extract, tea tree oil, and honey extract. Each one has all these reviews online to be naturally good for your skin. I wanted one that had as many as possible. Although i didnt use it for sun tan/burn, im sure it would have been just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind when applying the lotion, wen ur in the shower, u hve to exfoliate reeeaaall good first- like actal brush in small circular motions to get all that dead skin off, and every time i apply, i exfoliate at least a little so lets say i did it twice that day, the second time i&#x27;ll at least use a wash cloth to exfoliate the itchy part gently. Dont skratch! That was my mistake #1, i thought a little couldnt hurt. And im paying for it still. Next, apply a decent amount so ur not spreading it too thin and let it sit before any clothes for at least a few minutes. And last- start early- it takes minimum 6weeks for ur skin to renew, so anything u put on after 6weeks isnt ganna help much. So i started as early as second month and been putting it on daily (minus three days, which i see the results now :(. By the way, ive gained so far- 43lbs and am gestational diabetic with first baby. Make sure u hit the commom spots for prego stretch marks- belly, sides, lower back, glut, upper thighs, calfs/behind knees, upper arms and breast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely ❤ ❤ this stuff! Great for stretch marks!!</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR MEN AND WOMEN.. I LIKE IT FOR THE SMELL, (NOT SMELLY AT ALL), AND RELEIF OF DRY SKIN, (NOT GREASY). HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> The Ocean Potion Aloe After Sun Lotion has such a nice fragrence that I use it all th time, not just for after sun use.  Keeps elbows, hands and feet soft and nice to look at.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I will be purchasing for gifts in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome  I grew up in Arizona where tanning and burns were super popular and I tried this and it&#x27;s so lightweight and the smell is amazing, like orange creamscicles. Can&#x27;t find it here in washington!</li>
            <li> Because I am naturally tan (being born in the tropics)I love suntanning and getting the sun&#x27;s rays.  But of course the first time I go to the beach in years, I end up underestimating the sun&#x27;s rays AGAIN and put no SPF or the lowest one I could manage.  On the first day I got burned pretty badly and needed to find some sort of after-sun lotion to help.  The aloe vera gel that we had didn&#x27;t really help so I took a chance on Ocean Potion when I saw it at the store -- plus the price was so reasonable for the amount of lotion I was getting, I had to try it ($4.18 for the 20.5 oz at a Wal-Mart in NJ).  I used this twice a day or as soon as I remembered to put it on, and within days my burn and itch was gone.  I recommend doing exactly that, to apply often daily to keep skin from drying out.  Although I did peel a lot due to burning the first day, it also helped minimize the flaking/blotchy spots, and both disappeared after a few days.  My skin stayed super-hydrated and moisturized, and left a dewy look.  I used it on my face as well and didn&#x27;t clog my pores at all.  The tea trea soothed the itching and pain most of all, and has a lot of emollients.  I usually love Banana Boat stuff but I will never use anything else again.  I also picked up their sunscreens and will going forward avoid going out in the sun with anything under SPF 50 again. I highly recommend this product and urge you to try and find another that works better; I&#x27;m betting you will have a difficult time.  I still have my deep tan too and no more peel after one week of consistent use! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion - I had a bad sunburn this summer and tried this lotion.  It not only helped with the pain but it also kept me from peeling.  I continue to use it on a regular basis - it&#x27;s a great moisturizer !!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, actually my skin reacts in hives, itchiness and a rash to almost anything I put on it, this lotion is the best I have EVER used.  It&#x27;s gentle, my skin doesn&#x27;t react and it has a slightly tropical scent that isn&#x27;t offending and actually makes you feel kind of summery.  (Which is especially nice in February!)  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells like an orange creamsicle and really softens your skins.  I use it as a year-round moisturizer.  It has a surprisingly low price given the many natural ingredients.  It works better than moisturizers my dermatologist recommended. I discovered this at a beach store in Florida and was delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this as my everyday moisturizer but its also very soothing if you have a sunburn. I love the ingle I get (presumably from the tea tree). This stuff is so much cheaper than other products out there yet does the trick in every way.m</li>
            <li> I tried this in FL, borrowed from a friend. Loved the smell, consistency, and performance. Got home and couldnt find it  so settled for Banana Boat&#x27;s similar product. I found out that it was not similar at all. Dont waste your money by buying anything else. Ocean Potion is the absolute best. Smells so good, and makes your skin feel soft and full of moisture for hours. A bonus is your skin will glisten. I Highly recommend this and will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> The smell made me ill.  My husband didn&#x27;t think it was that bad, but to me it was unbearable. If you are sensitive to smells, or afraid that others might think you stink, this is not the product for you (at least around others).</li>
            <li> A nice light moisturizer with a slightly fruity scent.  I&#x27;m used to body shop lotion, which is VERY emolient, so this one is not quite up to my standards, but it is pretty good.  Just not as moisturizing as I wanted.  This lotion has mostly ingrediants that are good, although one of the last items is Methyl-paraben which is not supposed to be good.</li>
            <li> I did not order this lotion as an aid to sunscreen.  I experience a problem with dry feet which I know others experience as well.  I decided to try this lotion and liked the smell.To my surprise it worked wonders with my problem.  I am very impressed with the satisfaction of using this lotion.  Smooth, soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> This is our go-to sunburn lotion. It soothes the sunburn without leaving a sticky residue that so many other types are known for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily for years and year round. Best daily body moisturer I&#x27;ve ever found at 10 times the price. That said - Hello Amazon - you do realize the 20+ oz. bottle is under 4 bucks all day long at Walmart, right?</li>
            <li> Nothing comes close to the sort of care Ocean Potion provides skin, whether its after a long day at the beach or after exposure from outdoor work.  This has always cooled the burn and provided the best tan preservation I know of.  Ocean Potion is great to use all year round.  In the winter after exposure to sun and cold icy winds it works great too.</li>
            <li> Can not ind this in the store anymore.....not heavy but has a refreshing fragrance ...very good moisture providing lotion..been using it for years</li>
            <li> Love this - it&#x27;s lighter so not super moisturizing like you think aloe lotion would be but it smells great. Great for after tanning!</li>
            <li> We love Ocean Potion sunblock!  This lotion is great for when the people to whom you trusted your childrens&#x27; care forget to use it!</li>
            <li> I have Very sensitive skin and for some reason this works great for me.  I love it for the consistency, great smell, price, and the ingredients list is cool as well.</li>
            <li> Great after sun lotion. Totally natural ingredients, I was.very surprised to understand/recognize just about every ingredient in the bottle. It&#x27;s my go-to face lotion when my skin is having a bad moment.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite lotion, great smell, not too thick or greasy and a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this while I was in Mexico, after I got badly sunburnt. This thing was a miracle worker on my single and basically saved it. Not to mention, I think it smells AMAZING. After I ran out of in the states, I was really shocked and extremely happy to find it on amazon. I also have super sensitive skin and this has really good ingredients and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product-way too expensive on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t test on animals! Will buy this again once I&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Vaseling Intensive Care isn&#x27;t available anymore.  That&#x27;s the only thing that helped my dry skin in the winter.  Well, not any more!  Oh my gosh this stuff is great.  I love that you can put it on, and actually get dressed a few minutes later without your clothes sticking to you.  It really soaks into your skin, and makes it sooo soft.  And the smell, ahhhh, I bought 2 bottles and gave one to my girlfriend, and she loves it too.  It really does soak in well.  I don&#x27;t tan in the summer, I&#x27;m very light skinned, and very sensitive to the sun, so that&#x27;s not why I bought this.  Strictly for winter use, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion.  It works well whether you have a tan or not.  it is not greasy or sticky.  It has a nice refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Lotion is good.  I did find it at walmart later for drastically cheaper so I was dissapointed</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I got burnt and used it. My burn actually turned into a tan in 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!!  It takes the sting and tightness out of sunburn and helps prevent peeling.  We have been using it for many years and absolutely love it!  It also has a nice scent - reminds me of orange creamsicles.  Wouldn&#x27;t give it up for anything!!</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moistuizer. Check out the ingredients: Deionized Water, Canola Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Extracts of Burdock, Calendula, Matricaria, Comfrey, Golden Seal, Honey and Linden, Seaweed Extract (Macrocystis Pyrifera), Tocopherol Acetate    It is also available at most Walmarts for $3.97.</li>
            <li> Smells funny but when it comes to its effectiveness....no doubt it&#x27;s a great skin moisturizer. I am using it for after - sun-care. Much cheaper at Walmart though.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday lotion: light, easy to apply, absorbs well.  It does have the summery after-sun lotion scent that some don&#x27;t like, but I like that scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger on me, so I can still use perfume if I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned and burn easily.  Even after 4-6 hours offroading if I apply this, I end up with no peeling, sensitive, or even as red skin.  It also smells much better than any aloe I&#x27;ve used and has a less slimy texture.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market. Keeps my skin soft, soothes overexposure to the sun, prevents peeling and saves my tan for weeks. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Parabins are likely to cause cancer and considering this is being used on skin that is already damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a shame because otherwise the product is the best on the market !</li>
            <li> Ingredient list on this product isn&#x27;t the greatest. Has paraben (5 different kind fact). Also aloe is not one of the first ingredients, but canola oil is. Contains retinyl palmitate thus would not recommend using it if you&#x27;re pregnant. Lotion smells sweet, almost like a mixture of shea butter, almond, coconut to my nose. I was hoping for more of a refreshing aloe scent.  Would not recommend on men for that reason.  The item I received was poorly packaged in a bubble envelope instead of a box. Lotion arrived opened and everywhere! Sold by Etailz and fulfilled by Amazon. The pump on my lotion is a cheap green not yellow as pictured. On the plus side, lotion does go on smoothly without sticky feeling afterwards. However, i would NOT be repurchasing it after this one bottle mainly due to the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I live on the beach and myself, as well as many other locals, live by this product. Not only does it feel great after being in the sun all day, it smells awesome and really does make your tan last longer! I wouldn&#x27;t get sun exposure without having this on hand!</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally but found here at a decent price.  Smells nice, helps maintain a tan longer, not greasy...even on the face.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this a number of years ago after I had knee replacement surgery. I bought many bottles and gave them to my various hosts. It simply melts into the skin and does not just lay there on top leaving a film.&lt;br /&gt;Then several years ago I found that the Martinez Wal-Mart stopped carrying it.  Boo Hoo.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon and order two bottles.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> great stuff! My grandaughter loves the fragrance.  My son in law loves his tan many weeks after leaving Florida, thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this when was in Malibu 10 years ago and had been looking for it since my last sunburn last year. When I found it on Amazon for free shipping with Prime at a great price I was exited. It arrived quickly, smells great, and is one of the most soothing after care lotions! I checked every store in my area of Washington, but Amazon was the only place that had it for quick shipping at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> excellent lotion, i use daily</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lotion. It is very light and has a wonderful citrus scent. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, hydrating and absorbs quickly but I hated the smell. It smells like cheap orange candy...? Fanta? like.... absolutely yuck...</li>
            <li> Good aloe, leaves you feeling a little greasy though</li>
            <li> By far the best lotion ever. This is by far the best lotion I have ever used. Keeps my tan longer during the summer and keeps it from drying during the winter. Plus I am from the Space Coast and this this is made right here! Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that at all.  Edit: This brand was recently sold to a Canadian company. I am very disappointed they will be taking jobs away form Brevard County and moving them to Georgia. This is such a disappointment because this was my favorite lotion ever. I will not be looking forward to searching for another after sun lotion to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years can&#x27;t find it in stores any more so found it at amazon smells great and is very good for the skin just love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it is the best. The smell is like coconut marshmallows. :) Sometimes you can actually find it cheaper at Walgreens though.</li>
            <li> This aloe lotion works really well, and smells so coconut-y and tropical. I love it. My reason for 4 stars is that it arrived to me with the cover unscrewed partway and leaking all over the inside of the box.  Not very well packaged at all. I managed to save most of it though, so I&#x27;ll keep it. But not happy with the way it was shipped.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my skin great.</li>
            <li> bought this accidentally in the store the first time, and its great. Really takes the heat away from a sunburn and helps healing.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for year round. I usually stock up when I find it.</li>
            <li> My love affair with this stuff started in Barbados, I bought it to treat expected sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs really quickly, leaves a gorgeous sweet scent, keeps you moisturized all day and I swear it has made my legs look gorgeous. Also prolongs a tan and I find that it helps to reduce ingrown hairs! They used to be a problem sometimes but not anymore. As for the seller, product arrived in perfect condition, quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> i originally found this product while visiting in Florida and spending a little too much time in the sun. It made my sunburn bearable. Later I found it was one of the best facial cremes I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used expensive and inexpensive, but this works better than any of them. As for it&#x27;s original purpose for aftersun and as a moisturizer...wonderful. It dries quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and smells good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap, yet loaded with healthy ingredients that keep my skin super soft. I use it on my face daily, and anywhere else that feels dry. I&#x27;ve used it as a personal lubricant for alone time, and I&#x27;ve used it as a massage oil. I&#x27;ve used a lot of this stuff. I have to add though, that you can find this for much cheaper at WalMart.</li>
            <li> Best. Lotion. Ever. Soaks in instantly and leaves no residue. Smells great. Makes my skin soft and smooth. I use it year round -- to battle sun/wind damage and also against the cold, dry winter weather damage to my skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! So does my family. Bought one for myself &amp; two others. Smells like orange sherbert. It seems to extend tan &amp; help prevent peeling.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8 years.  It is very economical and does the job better than more expensive lotions.  Natural ingredients that work to not only save a tan but keep skin soft all year round. Love the smell. Use it twice a day and ALWAYS take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal, surprisingly its been a pain finding the product locally! So I was pretty excited to see that you had it in stock and shipped it quickly!</li>
            <li> Feels great all the time. Best lotion to use after a burn or for regular use. I use it every day</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this stuff.  It is a great after sun lotion and def helps extend your tan life by keeping your skin well moisturized.  It also has a great &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent. Oh and it arrived super fast, 2 days sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Excellent kids love it</li>
            <li> Great for after sun no greasey moisturization!</li>
            <li> I was born with severe eczema all over my body (its not as gross as it sounds).  I&#x27;ve literally tried hundreds of lotions, both expensive and cheap, natural and not, scented and unscented throughout my life.  I share this with you because I want you to know that when I say I&#x27;ve tried HUNDREDS of lotions on a DAILY basis over the 25 years I&#x27;ve been alive - I mean exactly that.  My experience and opinion should hold a lot of weight with potential buyers.  My skin has always given me issues when it comes to needing to be moisturized; especially living in Michigan where we have a very diverse climate system that wreaks havoc on my skin all year round. Out of the hundreds of lotions I&#x27;ve used on a daily basis throughout my life I have narrowed down 2 main &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; lotions that I use on a daily basis and have for the last several years and will continue to use for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My all time favorite, main, number one go-to lotion is....*drum roll*... Not this product. Sorry to disappoint you.  My main go-to is Lubriderm Advanced Therapy.  It goes on smooth, has no scent (which is important to me since I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t want to smell like lavender-Vanilla all day), doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, isn&#x27;t greasy, and most importanltly - keeps me from drying out like a prune.  However, it isn&#x27;t all natural, which the older I get the more I get concerned with this fact.  With my already fair and genetically crappy dry skin, the dozens of times I&#x27;ve been sunburned every summer mixed with the, literally, hundreds of gallons of this lotion I&#x27;ve put on my body over two decades - I&#x27;m starting to worry about the side effects to my future health such as skin cancer.  This made me seek out an alternative, all natural, long lasting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I found my second go-to lotion - Ocean Potion&#x27;s Moisturizing Aloe Lotion.  Its amazing.  Really, it&#x27;s truly a fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve tried steroid creams, prescription lotions, expensive designer moisturizers, all natural creams, and holistic herbal remedies - almost all of them have not worked as good as this simple, inexpensive lotion.  The price point alone beats out anything on the market.  Ocean Potion&#x27;s lotion (try saying that 5 times really fast) has a natural scent and is made with natural ingredients and works great.  It&#x27;s light and creamy, not thick.  It&#x27;s actually on the watery side but not in a bad way.  It&#x27;s a great consistency.  It has multiple natural oils in the ingredients so expect a slight sheen and extremely minor greasy feel for a short time after applying.  Both the sheen and the extremely minor greasy feel go away after its absorbed into the skin - usually within 10 minutes after applying.  Ocean Potion&#x27;s lotion has a very clean and fresh, yet outdoorsy smell and feel that both men and women will love.  Don&#x27;t worry either way, once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin you&#x27;ll no longer be able to smell it.  If you use this lotion on a regular basis you&#x27;ll find that you get a tan easier, lower your chances of being sunburned, and maintain that tan far longer than you normally would.  I don&#x27;t care about tanning.  At all.  I&#x27;m very white and I usually burn before I tan, but I do spend my summers outside and I find that I burn a lot less, tan a lot more, and stay tan a lot longer with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, just like everything else in life, there are cons to even the greatest of products.  I&#x27;m rating Ocean Potion&#x27;s lotion 4 stars and not 5 because I have to use a lot of this stuff.  The average person wont, but I do.  I apply liberally and I sometimes have to do 2 coats.  But remember, the average person will not have to do this.  I have extremely dry skin that is genetically far dryer than you can imagine - even if you think your skin is dry, it isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.  Is this the products fault? No, but I&#x27;m still taking off a star.  A person with average skin, or even moderately dry skin, should have no problem with this stuff at all.  I also only use this inthe summer when the weather is hot/warm and there&#x27;s lots of sun shine.  Summer weather is very easy on my skin.  The furnace heat, layers of itchy clothing, and the bitter, frigid cold take a huge toll on my skin in the winter and I&#x27;m not able to use this product.  During the cold months I use Lubriderm Advanced Therapy because it moisturizes far more and keeps me from drying out like a raisin on daily basis.  I wish I could use Ocean Potion all year but it doesn&#x27;t provide the moisture I need in the winter.  Yet again, a person with normal skin should have no problem using this stuff year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s just my observation, results may vary, every one is individually unique, yadda yadda, but this has been my experience. This is just me and my situation. Remember, I was born with awful, awful dry, itchy skin and these are my opinions based off of my experience with my body and this product.  A normal person, with normal skin (aka. you, unless you were born with a disease too) will have no problems with this lotion not meeting your expectations.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments.  Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> We love the product because my husband uses it everyday for his dry skin BUT the packaging was terrible as all three bottles leaked inside the box!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted in a Very timely manor.</li>
            <li> Great on your skin after tanning and taking shower</li>
            <li> my favorite and hard to find!</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, my lotion had leaked all over the container and plastic bag it had been packaged in. Cleaned it up when I opened it. I love the lotion though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it for burns and skin irritation.  I also like that is all natural ingrediants</li>
            <li> What we wanted and good price.</li>
            <li> My cousin works at a marina and everyone there uses this. It is great for sun burns but I use it as a daily moisturizer. It has a wonderful tropical scent and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short.&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Ocean Potion Aloe Lotion for about 1 year now and its all I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses:&lt;br /&gt;-After tan lotion&lt;br /&gt;-Daily Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The main thing about this lotion is it helps to extend tan life.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed after a tanning bed or laying in the sun then using&lt;br /&gt;this product it helps to extend my tan life, I never peal, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most lotions out there tend to leave your skin oily and messy.&lt;br /&gt;However, this lotion &amp;#34;DOESN&#x27;T&amp;#34; do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you will find this review helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and good tanning!</li>
            <li> Best after sun lotion ever.</li>
    </ol>
