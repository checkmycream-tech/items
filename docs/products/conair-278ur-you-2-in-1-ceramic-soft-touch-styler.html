            <li>This was purchased because I was looking for a good, inexpensive hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it does a superior job.  </li>
            <li>It is nice, I like to use it.</li>
            <li>However, because this one heats the air up so well, it kind of balances things out.</li>

            <li>I strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I think this blow dryer will work just fine.</li>
            <li>A good price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t blow air as strongly which you need for lift and quick drying.</li>

            <li>I have no idea why someone would want to spend many dollars when you could have gotten this outstanding one for less than $10.  </li>
            <li>but it does not shoot out powerful hot air.  </li>

            <li>My ten year old hair dryer was fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I use this to dry my hair at the most two times a week.  </li>
            <li>It only has two speeds but works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Way better than I could have expected.</li>

            <li>I really like the  volume attachment a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full sized hair dryer, but the weight feels more like one of those small, crappy ones they have in hotel rooms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair dries pretty quickly, and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy (but the real test of that will be when summer rolls back around!)</li>

            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t that long, but it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty durable, only two years old now and not much signs of wear.</li>

            <li> I have very fine, frizzy, thick curly hair and need a good diffuser. Tried 2 other conair dyers -one was very loud (it was purple) and the other (it was pink) didn&#x27;t blow air as strongly which you need for lift and quick drying. This one is lighter than the other two and works great!!</li>
            <li> Sturdy  and a bit heavy for a hair dryer but I&#x27;ll compromise weight for something that will hold up and last. Low speed is like medium and high speed is very strong. Heat is not too hot</li>
            <li> It works as it is supposed.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for a steal in 2012 for $15 on here, when my old dryer had about had it. Way better than I could have expected. really like the soft touch feel on it. Blows really hot, and dries hair quickly. Seems to be pretty durable, only two years old now and not much signs of wear. The drier is easily cleaned as well. I really like the metal on the sides that protects the dryer when you lay it down. Would definitely reccomend!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present for my daughters.  IConair usually has good products. I think this blow dryer will work just fine. It arrived in a timely manner. Brand new still in box.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and do not have a complicated hair style - my hair is long and straight.  I use this to dry my hair at the most two times a week.  I bought this at a departments store five years ago and it has worked fine for my minimal needs. It seems to dry hair quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy.  Just this week my drier seems to be dying on me and I am leaning toward replacing it with the exact same model.</li>
            <li> Air output is good, but there does not seem to be much difference in the temperatures of the low and high settings. For the price, it is okay.</li>
            <li> Weighs a ton.  I can&#x27;t control it with just one hand; it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece and she seems to like it a lot.</li>
            <li> this is a nice simple hair dryer</li>
            <li> Works great. Dries my head in haft the time. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and the quality, look and feel are very good.  Price and service from the vendor were excellent.</li>
            <li> It is nice, I like to use it. Using it hair quickly dry. But it is a little heavy to me.</li>
            <li> My previous dryer bit the dust, so I needed a replacement. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, but didn&#x27;t want to get some cheap model that was going to stop working in a few months. This one had good reviews and seemed like a good option, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now, and here are my thoughts so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. PRO - It&#x27;s really lightweight - I&#x27;m actually surprised. It&#x27;s a full sized hair dryer, but the weight feels more like one of those small, crappy ones they have in hotel rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. PRO - The surface of it has a very slightly grippy feel. Not sticky, but the plastic has something of a texture to it. Even when my hands are still a bit damp out of the shower, I don&#x27;t feel like the dryer is going to slip out of my hands, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. PRO - The filter cover at the back is a flip-down design, rather than being completely removable. I find that the removable filter covers on other hair dryers tend to fall off completely, so this is a nice design choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. PRO - The cord connects to the handle via a swivel joint, so it doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up as you&#x27;re using it. I definitely like this feature. It should be a no-brainer in hair-dryer design that you use this kind of connection, as most people are going to move the hair dryer as they use it, and the cord will need some freedom of movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. PRO - The air is really hot. I don&#x27;t like to spend forever under the hair dryer, so having one with a good amount of heat makes the job go by more quickly. My hair isn&#x27;t that long, but it&#x27;s kind of thick so it can take a while. This dryer makes pretty quick work of it, even given that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. CON (sort of) - The air doesn&#x27;t blow with a lot of force. This would be a real annoyance if it weren&#x27;t for #5. As I said, I don&#x27;t like having to take forever drying my hair, and if the force of the air coming out of the dryer is weak, it usually means it&#x27;s going to take a long time. However, because this one heats the air up so well, it kind of balances things out. My hair dries pretty quickly, and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy (but the real test of that will be when summer rolls back around!) I did take one star off simply for the lack of air speed of this hair dryer, but if I could have, I would&#x27;ve only taken half a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. NEITHER PRO nor CON - The switches that control the speed and temperature of the air are on the side of the handle, as opposed to the front, as they normally are on hair dryers. I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily any better or worse, it&#x27;s just different that what I&#x27;ve normally encountered, and thought it worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - As I said, I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a week, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it. A lot more good points than bad at the moment, so I can&#x27;t complain. The price was good, it does its job, and it even looks kinda snazzy! As long as this hair dryer ends up lasting me more than a couple of years, I&#x27;ll consider this a win!is one heats the air up so well, it kind of balances things out. My hair dries pretty quickly, and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy (but the real test of that will be when summer rolls back around!) I did take one star off simply for the lack of air speed of this hair dryer, but if I could have, I would&#x27;ve only taken half a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. NEITHER PRO nor CON - The switches that control the speed and temperature of the air are on the side of the handle, as opposed to the front, as they normally are on hair dryers.

            <li> Like the controls on the side so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn the darn thing off.  Good power and plenty of heat.  Cord swivels so it won&#x27;t get kinked as badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK basic dryer, but with 3 heat settings I was hoping low would be cool/room temperature. Unfortunately the 3 temps are fairly warm, hot, and really hot.</li>
            <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;A most excellent deal! A good price and super fast shipping. I really like the  volume attachment a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight styler and was priced well below similar ones. It only has two speeds but works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, and looks stylish but it does not shoot out powerful hot air.  Air flow is decent, but it is on the cooler side.</li>
            <li> This was purchased because I was looking for a good, inexpensive hair dryer.  It has exceeded expectations.  I use it almost daily and it does a superior job.  I have no idea why someone would want to spend many dollars when you could have gotten this outstanding one for less than $10.  I strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It is a very good dryer. It comes with an assortment of attachments for diffusing the air. I use it on everything from drying my dog, to drying my hair, to drying clothes. I like it alot.</li>
            <li> My ten year old hair dryer was fine, but nothing special. One day it finally died. I bought this one because of the price and I liked the idea that it was ceramic. Plus I trust the name Conair. I was so surprised the first time I used it. This dryer felt as close to professional quality as I have ever experienced. It had a directed stream of air and I was very impressed. Very happy.</li>
