            <li>The sugaring is smooth and goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I&#x27;d like to say that shipping was amazing.</li>
            <li>someone from the company answered all my questions and started explaining step by step over the phone which was really amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>I hardly warm it at all and often just use it at room temperature.</li>

            <li>I have made our own sugaring many times before...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much painless and highly effective, but no product is perfect.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to watch some you tube videos in order to help you learn the technique.</li>
            <li>I just bought this to see the differences and if it was better, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Longer will hurt more to pull out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too scared to use it most of the time because I know it will hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too scared to use it most of the time because I know it will hurt.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product to use on my underarms because there&#x27;s no pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It defiantly works and no pain I&#x27;ve tried several of the hair removable products and the sugar is with out a dout the best</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get many uses out of this 10 oz pot.</li>
            <li>and I was able to pull the hair from all of the body parts</li>
            <li>I was able to reach using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this procduct.</li>
            <li>Just wish there was a stick or something to take the wax out better</li>
            <li>I love sugaring wax.  </li>
            <li>but I had such a great experience with cocojojo sugaring that I had to write something!</li>
            <li>The best (and now the only) hair removal product I use!</li>
            <li>Love the washable demin strips just throw it in the washer.</li>
            <li>So obviously most of the product had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use once you get use to it, saving your time and very convenient.</li>
            <li>It was effective from the first time I used it, and I was pleased with the results, but over time I have gotten better and better at using it and now I love it.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of trial and error till you get the right technique, but is absolutely better than waxing!</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>all you have to do is wash the wax with warm water and it leaves your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I used to make my own wax at home, however getting it just right wasn&#x27;t always the easiest.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you bruise easily because you need to apply pressure to stretch it.</li>
            <li>If you are unfamiliar with what soft arabic sugar wax is supposed to look like, then this would be a great product so that you can get familiar with it</li>
            <li>I used to prepare sugar paste by my own, which is obviously much cheaper</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good product to use at home to do my own hair removal but its way too messy.</li>
            <li>This is as good as you can realistically expect from a hair removal product for areas with coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe others would be able to use it for the whole pubic area, but I find it too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li>I still use this on my arms and legs and occasionally other parts if I feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;-Electric Shaver (Philips Satin Perfect Epilator Shaving Head): Painless, great for doing area that are hard to reach and see because you can do it in front of a mirror.</li>

            <li>Then pull quickly in the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then pull quickly in the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely natural, so it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I highly recommend it; it&#x27;s so much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>You can be very exact.</li>
            <li>You can be very exact.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t leave any irritation on your skin afterwards, very gentle!</li>
            <li>bought more because it is so much better than my homemade sugaring that it is worth the extra money to buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but I can make this for less than a dollar at home versus the $20 I paid for this.</li>
            <li>when I used it a certain way it worked just fine,</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the best option available from many not-so-great options for an unpleasant task.</li>
            <li>I tried to make my own sugar wax from scratch because it&#x27;s way cheaper and simple.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally manageable and honestly doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You will not be able to get your skin completely hairless.</li>
            <li>For this price it is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love that there are no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, however, I have learned how to make my own natural sugar wax at home that is exactly like this.</li>
            <li>You will probably need to experiment to find the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;-Press</li>
            <li>You will probably need to experiment to find the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;-Press</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any strips, and get right to it.</li>
            <li>contacted the company right away.</li>
            <li>I liked that it had 100% natural ingredients because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>But I will update this review after a few weeks, when hopefully I will be quicker and more skilled at this.</li>
            <li>I am female and have found that it&#x27;s also good for the front of the pubic area (pubic bone) but just the front, as it&#x27;s easier to reach and not as sensitive.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure your skin is clean and dry, including your hands.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much a basic arabic sugar wax and for the money and the amount, it is better to just practice making it at home until you can get it right and using the homemade wax.</li>
            <li>I first assumed this was a problem with the product but learned that it was a problem with my technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li>your hair first.</li>
            <li>for me, its better than regular wax.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I tried sugaring for the first time</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done several times now and each time can not say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li>It stayed at just the right temperature the whole time instead of overheating and then cooling too much like my home-made variety.</li>
            <li>I get about a tablespoon and a half and warm it up in my hands.</li>
            <li>It removed all the hair from my legs on the first try and left my legs feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>a large ball of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat messy, but because it&#x27;s water-soluble (unlike wax), it&#x27;s easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>But this stuff really takes the hair out.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t work out very well.</li>
            <li>Sugar waxing really isn&#x27;t my thing I guess.</li>
            <li>but this just takes too much time and a ton of practice.</li>
            <li>If it were wax, you&#x27;d have no choice but to rip it off no matter how much it hurts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t heat it too much.</li>
            <li>It irritates the skin a bit more than wet shaving because there is no gel and</li>
            <li>It irritates the skin a bit more than wet shaving because there is no gel and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really hurt like at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel much pain when using this wax.</li>
            <li>sure that the piece of the ball you press against your skin is soft enough.</li>
            <li>sure that the piece of the ball you press against your skin is soft enough.</li>
            <li>The issues I ran into the first few times had mostly to do with me using one piece for too long and it becoming too drippy and ineffective.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>The sugar itself is difficult to warm evenly and did not remove hair evenly or easily.  </li>
            <li>Go over the area once or twice to make sure it is pressed down all the way.</li>
            <li>Go over the area once or twice to make sure it is pressed down all the way.</li>
            <li>The jar easily last for several months depending on how many areas you are waxing.</li>
            <li>the skin is left soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And I would highly recommend them to anyone I know.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me, it only removed about half of hair and my hands are always really warm</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to explain.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be too soft or it will not be very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not nearly as painful as waxing, unless you have REALLY long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using cocojojo sugaring was such a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews</li>
            <li>I realize it&#x27;s because I live close to the shipping point, but wow, it was literally a 1 day turnaround.</li>
            <li>The wax is made properly and the instructions are pretty clear.</li>
            <li>Waxing also pulls hair out against the grain, which is more likely to cause ingrown hairs and just makes less sense.</li>
            <li>the hair follicles are more closed when dry.</li>
            <li>the hair follicles are more closed when dry.</li>
            <li>Since you are pulling in the same direction of hair growth, you get more root pulls and less break off.</li>
            <li>The consistency is kind of hard to work with, especially if your hands sweat like mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s nearly painless to use.</li>
            <li>Paste that is too soft will not pull well.</li>
            <li>: painless, but creates razor bumps on sensitive areas and there is stubble regrowth within a day.</li>
            <li>The device also just scares me whenever I bring it near areas that have dense hair growth, like the underarms.</li>

            <li>/&gt;10 Oz Cocojojo Sugaring Hair Removal Sugar Wax 100% Natural Paste - 100% Organic and Natural with Egyptian Calendula and Chamomile - Epilation</li>
            <li>This is a sugar hair removal wax that is supposed to be used as a soft wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft and it pulls apart.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for natural products with no harsh chemicals and this fits the bill</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for customers who like a natural product</li>
            <li>You may have a little trouble using it when you first start out, but will get better.</li>
            <li>Be careful with getting the paste too hot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not idiot-proof -- you will run into problem if if gets too warm or too cold or if you get too much residue on your fingers.</li>
            <li>I also had hard waxing done which was fine, but when I attempted to do it myself it was a disaster.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because waxing hurts and shaving is a pain, but I&#x27;m not sure I would use it again.</li>
            <li>(apparently you need nitrile gloves)</li>
            <li>so I ended up using my bare hands.</li>
            <li>It was messy to try to get the right consistency.</li>
            <li>I have worked with other sugars, they were  so much easier.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for getting small hairs that are difficult to grab with tweezers.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to use too much, or too little.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than hard or soft wax for self application because it stays together in a wad</li>

            <li> I used to make my own wax at home, however getting it just right wasn&#x27;t always the easiest.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you bruise easily because you need to apply pressure to stretch it.</li>
            <li> If you are unfamiliar with what soft arabic sugar wax is supposed to look like, then this would be a great product so that you can get familiar with it</li>
            <li> I used to prepare sugar paste by my own, which is obviously much cheaper</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good product to use at home to do my own hair removal but its way too messy.</li>
            <li> This is as good as you can realistically expect from a hair removal product for areas with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe others would be able to use it for the whole pubic area, but I find it too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> I still use this on my arms and legs and occasionally other parts if I feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;-Electric Shaver (Philips Satin Perfect Epilator Shaving Head): Painless, great for doing area that are hard to reach and see because you can do it in front of a mirror.</li>

            <li> Then pull quickly in the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely natural, so it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I highly recommend it; it&#x27;s so much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> You can be very exact.</li>
            <li> You can be very exact.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leave any irritation on your skin afterwards, very gentle!</li>
            <li> bought more because it is so much better than my homemade sugaring that it is worth the extra money to buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but I can make this for less than a dollar at home versus the $20 I paid for this.</li>
            <li> when I used it a certain way it worked just fine,</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the best option available from many not-so-great options for an unpleasant task.</li>
            <li> I tried to make my own sugar wax from scratch because it&#x27;s way cheaper and simple.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally manageable and honestly doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You will not be able to get your skin completely hairless.</li>
            <li> For this price it is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love that there are no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, however, I have learned how to make my own natural sugar wax at home that is exactly like this.</li>
            <li> You will probably need to experiment to find the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;-Press</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use any strips, and get right to it.</li>
            <li> contacted the company right away.</li>
            <li> I liked that it had 100% natural ingredients because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> But I will update this review after a few weeks, when hopefully I will be quicker and more skilled at this.</li>
            <li> I am female and have found that it&#x27;s also good for the front of the pubic area (pubic bone) but just the front, as it&#x27;s easier to reach and not as sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure your skin is clean and dry, including your hands.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much a basic arabic sugar wax and for the money and the amount, it is better to just practice making it at home until you can get it right and using the homemade wax.</li>
            <li> I first assumed this was a problem with the product but learned that it was a problem with my technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> your hair first.</li>
            <li> for me, its better than regular wax.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I tried sugaring for the first time</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done several times now and each time can not say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> It stayed at just the right temperature the whole time instead of overheating and then cooling too much like my home-made variety.</li>
            <li> I get about a tablespoon and a half and warm it up in my hands.</li>
            <li> It removed all the hair from my legs on the first try and left my legs feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> a large ball of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat messy, but because it&#x27;s water-soluble (unlike wax), it&#x27;s easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> But this stuff really takes the hair out.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t work out very well.</li>
            <li> Sugar waxing really isn&#x27;t my thing I guess.</li>
            <li> but this just takes too much time and a ton of practice.</li>
            <li> If it were wax, you&#x27;d have no choice but to rip it off no matter how much it hurts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t heat it too much.</li>
            <li> It irritates the skin a bit more than wet shaving because there is no gel and</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really hurt like at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel much pain when using this wax.</li>
            <li> sure that the piece of the ball you press against your skin is soft enough.</li>
            <li> sure that the piece of the ball you press against your skin is soft enough.</li>
            <li> The issues I ran into the first few times had mostly to do with me using one piece for too long and it becoming too drippy and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> The sugar itself is difficult to warm evenly and did not remove hair evenly or easily.  </li>
            <li> Go over the area once or twice to make sure it is pressed down all the way.</li>
            <li> Go over the area once or twice to make sure it is pressed down all the way.</li>
            <li> The jar easily last for several months depending on how many areas you are waxing.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> And I would highly recommend them to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me, it only removed about half of hair and my hands are always really warm</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to explain.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be too soft or it will not be very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not nearly as painful as waxing, unless you have REALLY long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using cocojojo sugaring was such a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s because I live close to the shipping point, but wow, it was literally a 1 day turnaround.</li>
            <li> The wax is made properly and the instructions are pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Waxing also pulls hair out against the grain, which is more likely to cause ingrown hairs and just makes less sense.</li>
            <li> the hair follicles are more closed when dry.</li>
            <li> the hair follicles are more closed when dry.</li>
            <li> Since you are pulling in the same direction of hair growth, you get more root pulls and less break off.</li>
            <li> The consistency is kind of hard to work with, especially if your hands sweat like mine.</li>

            <li> /&gt;10 Oz Cocojojo Sugaring Hair Removal Sugar Wax 100% Natural Paste - 100% Organic and Natural with Egyptian Calendula and Chamomile - Epilation</li>
            <li> This is a sugar hair removal wax that is supposed to be used as a soft wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft and it pulls apart.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural products with no harsh chemicals and this fits the bill</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Recommended for customers who like a natural product</li>
            <li> You may have a little trouble using it when you first start out, but will get better.</li>
            <li> Be careful with getting the paste too hot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not idiot-proof -- you will run into problem if if gets too warm or too cold or if you get too much residue on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I also had hard waxing done which was fine, but when I attempted to do it myself it was a disaster.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because waxing hurts and shaving is a pain, but I&#x27;m not sure I would use it again.</li>
            <li> (apparently you need nitrile gloves)</li>
            <li> so I ended up using my bare hands.</li>
            <li> It was messy to try to get the right consistency.</li>
            <li> I have worked with other sugars, they were  so much easier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for getting small hairs that are difficult to grab with tweezers.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to use too much, or too little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than hard or soft wax for self application because it stays together in a wad</li>
            <li> The thick wax requires working with your hands to get it the right texture, so it takes longer to use.</li>
            <li> It is pretty hard at room temperature, but if you work with it a bit in your hands it will soften and you can use it.</li>
            <li> It should be about 1/4 inch long, enough for the paste to grip the hair.</li>
            <li> After trying a few other sugar wax products, I was really disappointed with the hair removal, the messiness, and how incredibly sticky they were.</li>
            <li> Sugar paste in general is a way much better way to get rid of unwanted hair,less painful than wax</li>
            <li> However, it would be unrealistic to expect completely smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I personally have never really waxed (except ineffective Nads strips), but I hear it hurts a lot</li>
            <li> A lot of the trouble I had with it early on was because the piece I had gotten was too small for all of the areas I wanted to depilate and the paste became too soft from overuse and became ineffective.</li>
            <li> Upon trying COCOJOJO, however, I immediately noticed how different this is from the other sugaring products.</li>
            <li> The paste should be relatively hard (but malleable) overall, but the part you put on your skin needs to be soft in order to stick.</li>
            <li> The paste should be relatively hard (but malleable) overall, but the part you put on your skin needs to be soft in order to stick.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t managed to do a full sugaring, because it was taking a long time and my skin was getting angry.</li>
            <li> what I found works with this is to heat just a little bit, like just maybe 10 seconds, use something to spread it on desired area, and then use a separate cloth, like they do a regular wax, to take it off.</li>
            <li> Also, if you make it at home, you can make a hard wax or a soft wax, whatever you want.</li>
            <li> This uproots the entire hair without pulling it the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;-This has nothing to do with hair removal, but it&#x27;s edible and really tasty.</li>
            <li> Wax is much harder to remove.</li>
            <li> I was curious</li>
            <li> It is not really &amp;#34;fragranced&amp;#34; or anything like that, which i prefer.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes a mess and it takes forever because I&#x27;m not a professional, but this s</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s difficult to use at first.</li>
            <li> I usually get bigger size</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d try picking it off with other sugar or just waiting for it to harden a little bit to pull off-I was left with a few bruises on my leg.</li>
            <li> Less mess, no need to be near a heating source, easier to get to the difficult spots (back thighs),</li>
            <li> Not worth the time commitment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li> seems to grow back less thick.</li>
            <li> Before using it, watch lots of sugaring videos on YouTube to get the technique down.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to prepare sugar paste by my own, which is obviously much cheaper but since I moved to the US I can&#x27;t work with sugar here :( I could&#x27;t figure out what I was doing wrong so I decided to get it via Internet. Sugar paste in general is a way much better way to get rid of unwanted hair,less painful than wax and there is no problem with ingrown hair anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect itself although could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Oh man. This stuff definitely takes some getting used to. I&#x27;ve never tried sugaring before, so I&#x27;m definitely having some beginner difficulties. I only have latex gloves, which I soon found out would not work for this (apparently you need nitrile gloves) so I ended up using my bare hands. The consistency is kind of hard to work with, especially if your hands sweat like mine. It&#x27;s hard to get a balance between hard and goopy, and not too sticky. Kind of hard to explain. But this stuff really takes the hair out. I have very thick, coarse body hair and if I apply this correctly and remove it in the proper direction, 99% of the hair comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I think this is a quality product. I haven&#x27;t managed to do a full sugaring, because it was taking a long time and my skin was getting angry. But I will update this review after a few weeks, when hopefully I will be quicker and more skilled at this.</li>
            <li> perfect and easy for use !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Make sure to watch some you tube videos in order to help you learn the technique. It is a bit tricky. Also, your hands will get a bit tired because you have keep needing and working the sugar as you are using it.</li>
            <li> Was really hard to use and just gave up.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, however, I have learned how to make my own natural sugar wax at home that is exactly like this. I just bought this to see the differences and if it was better, but it&#x27;s not. Lol. It&#x27;s a great product, but I can make this for less than a dollar at home versus the $20 I paid for this.</li>
            <li> I tried to make my own sugar wax from scratch because it&#x27;s way cheaper and simple. That didn&#x27;t work out very well. Every batch was either too sticky or too hard. So I just decided to order it instead. Sugar waxing really isn&#x27;t my thing I guess. I was really hoping it was because I hate shaving but this just takes too much time and a ton of practice. The company was awesome with the shipment though!</li>
            <li> ABBREVIATED VERSION&lt;br /&gt;Love this product. I use it on my underarms and pubic region. It&#x27;s pretty much painless and highly effective, but no product is perfect. You may have a little trouble using it when you first start out, but will get better. Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s very easy and quick. This is as good as you can realistically expect from a hair removal product for areas with coarse hair. It&#x27;s a keeper. I will continue to repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USE IT&lt;br /&gt;I use it on myself. I have just experimented with the product and found what works for me. I have thin, blond hair on my arms and legs and am content to just shave those areas. I use it on my underarms about once every 20 days. I am female and have found that it&#x27;s also good for the front of the pubic area (pubic bone) but just the front, as it&#x27;s easier to reach and not as sensitive. Maybe others would be able to use it for the whole pubic area, but I find it too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s nearly painless to use. You can feel it pulling and stinging a bit, but if you use small sections it&#x27;s totally manageable and honestly doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s effective. It clears away the vast majority of hairs, pulling them out by the root.&lt;br /&gt;Hair seems to grow back less thick. That may be because it is pulled by the root and hair has different growth cycles so not all the hair grows back at once.&lt;br /&gt;-All the benefits of waxing without the drawbacks. I personally have never really waxed (except ineffective Nads strips), but I hear it hurts a lot and I don&#x27;t doubt it. Additionally, sugaring paste is water soluble, so you can wash your hands with the stuff on it or just hop in the shower if you have residue on your body. It washes off easily. Wax is much harder to remove. If you have already put the paste on over your hair, but it&#x27;s hurting or not pulling, you can just wash it off. If it were wax, you&#x27;d have no choice but to rip it off no matter how much it hurts. Waxing also pulls hair out against the grain, which is more likely to cause ingrown hairs and just makes less sense. This uproots the entire hair without pulling it the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;-This has nothing to do with hair removal, but it&#x27;s edible and really tasty. I was curious so I tried a small amount. Sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s difficult to use at first. When you&#x27;re still getting the hang of it, expect to have a bit of trouble. It was effective from the first time I used it, and I was pleased with the results, but over time I have gotten better and better at using it and now I love it. Before using it, watch lots of sugaring videos on YouTube to get the technique down. I did, and it worked, but I still was no expert. The issues I ran into the first few times had mostly to do with me using one piece for too long and it becoming too drippy and ineffective. It would no longer pull off of my skin. I first assumed this was a problem with the product but learned that it was a problem with my technique.&lt;br /&gt;-You will not be able to get your skin completely hairless. It will always leave some hairs (mostly short ones). However, it would be unrealistic to expect completely smooth skin. You can tweeze, shave, or some combination, after sugaring in order to be totally smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS FOR USE&lt;br /&gt;-Trim your hair first. It should be about 1/4 inch long, enough for the paste to grip the hair. Longer will hurt more to pull out.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t heat it too much. I hardly warm it at all and often just use it at room temperature. It is pretty hard at room temperature, but if you work with it a bit in your hands it will soften and you can use it. It can&#x27;t be too soft or it will not be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;-Use a large ball of it. A lot of the trouble I had with it early on was because the piece I had gotten was too small for all of the areas I wanted to depilate and the paste became too soft from overuse and became ineffective. It was too drippy and would stay on my skin rather than coming off and taking hair with it when I pulled.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure that the piece of the ball you press against your skin is soft enough. The paste should be relatively hard (but malleable) overall, but the part you put on your skin needs to be soft in order to stick. Hard paste will not adhere to the skin or grip hair. Paste that is too soft will not pull well. You will probably need to experiment to find the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;-Press the paste onto the skin in small sections, against the direction of hair growth. Go over the area once or twice to make sure it is pressed down all the way. Then pull quickly in the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER METHODS I HAVE TRIED/HOW THEY COMPARE&lt;br /&gt;-Wet Shaving (Venus Embrace + Bump Patrol Shave Gel): painless, but creates razor bumps on sensitive areas and there is stubble regrowth within a day. I still use this on my arms and legs and occasionally other parts if I feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;-Electric Shaver (Philips Satin Perfect Epilator Shaving Head): Painless, great for doing area that are hard to reach and see because you can do it in front of a mirror. It irritates the skin a bit more than wet shaving because there is no gel and the hair follicles are more closed when dry. It&#x27;s very easy, though, and I still use this for parts of the pubic area and sometimes my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;-Epilation (Philips Satin Perfect Epilator): hurts notably more than sugaring. The device also just scares me whenever I bring it near areas that have dense hair growth, like the underarms. I&#x27;m too scared to use it most of the time because I know it will hurt. I have also noticed that after epilation, the area will feel sore for a while like it took a beating. Not so with sugaring.&lt;br /&gt;-Tweezing: I have actually resorted to tweezing out individual hairs one by one. It takes forever and does hurt a bit. You can be very exact. Not worth the time commitment.&lt;br /&gt;-Self-waxing with pre-made strips (Nads Body Hair Removal Strips): These just don&#x27;t work. I may have used them incorrectly, but they did not remove hair. They also hurt. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not tried: waxing in a salon or with separate wax and strips, chemical depilatories (hair removal creams like Nair), Infomercial hair removal products like No!no! or that product whose name escapes me but is similar to sandpaper. I have not tried any of these because I try to do my research before buying something, and these are all apparently either too painful or ineffective. Sugaring is the way to go for coarse hair!d taking hair with it when I pulled.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure that the piece of the ball you press against your skin is soft enough.

            <li> This is my favorite product to use on my underarms because there&#x27;s no pain whatsoever. it works great and gets all the hair every time. There&#x27;s plenty of product to use for smaller areas like your underarms, and once you figure out how to do it, it&#x27;s very simple. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now so I have no problems at all. if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I highly recommend it; it&#x27;s so much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> It defiantly works and no pain I&#x27;ve tried several of the hair removable products and the sugar is with out a dout the best</li>
            <li> This is a review for the following product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 Oz Cocojojo Sugaring Hair Removal Sugar Wax 100% Natural Paste - 100% Organic and Natural with Egyptian Calendula and Chamomile - Epilation Waxing - Sugaring Hair Remover - Sugaring Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;d like to say that shipping was amazing. I realize it&#x27;s because I live close to the shipping point, but wow, it was literally a 1 day turnaround. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I love this stuff. I use it for my underarms and my bikini area, and it&#x27;s great. This being my second pot, I&#x27;ve learned what works for me. I get about a tablespoon and a half and warm it up in my hands. I don&#x27;t use any strips, and get right to it. I&#x27;m going to get many uses out of this 10 oz pot. You don&#x27;t want to use too much, or too little. Also, make sure your skin is clean and dry, including your hands. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This hair removal wax works great! I liked that it had 100% natural ingredients because my skin is very sensitive. It removed all the hair from my legs on the first try and left my legs feeling smooth. I didn&#x27;t start to feel the hair growing back until about 2 weeks later. I&#x27;m so happy I found this, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar over the counter products that were crap. No move shaving or waxing for me! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is great and adjustable hair removal product!&lt;br /&gt;For me, itâ€™s the ideal solution for hair removal, if you do not mind. It might surprise you to know that the sugaring hair removal hardness from this company is adjustable according to your needs!!</li>
            <li> I am a (relatively hairy) man and I was able to pull the hair from all of the body parts I was able to reach using this stuff. It&#x27;s much easier than hard or soft wax for self application because it stays together in a wad and you don&#x27;t have to use strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not idiot-proof -- you will run into problem if if gets too warm or too cold or if you get too much residue on your fingers. You just have to learn as you go. However, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the best option available from many not-so-great options for an unpleasant task.</li>
            <li> I love this procduct. for me, its better than regular wax. No strips, no pain.. all you have to do is wash the wax with warm water and it leaves your skin super smooth. Just wish there was a stick or something to take the wax out better</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me, it only removed about half of hair and my hands are always really warm so it just sort of melted and got all sticky. The customer support was awesome though...they did everything they could to help me out but it just wasn&#x27;t for me and they refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I used to make my own wax at home, however getting it just right wasn&#x27;t always the easiest. For this price it is definitely worth the purchase. Works exactly as expected and a little goes a long way. The jar easily last for several months depending on how many areas you are waxing.</li>
            <li> This is a sugar hair removal wax that is supposed to be used as a soft wax. The wax is made properly and the instructions are pretty clear. In the instructions, the manufacturers reccomend using the &amp;#34;circular&amp;#34; hair removal method. I have no idea what that is, googled it, and looked on their website and saw no mention of it. This is pretty much a basic arabic sugar wax and for the money and the amount, it is better to just practice making it at home until you can get it right and using the homemade wax. There are all kinds of tutorials online and on youtube. The product came in the amount of time that it was supposed to and arrived in good condition. The smell of the product is just a honey-sugar smell. It is not really &amp;#34;fragranced&amp;#34; or anything like that, which i prefer. If you are unfamiliar with what soft arabic sugar wax is supposed to look like, then this would be a great product so that you can get familiar with it and then you might as well just make it at home. Also, if you make it at home, you can make a hard wax or a soft wax, whatever you want.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this yet, I&#x27;m afraid to actually.</li>
            <li> Knocked off one star because I have to microwave it but it comes in a plastic jar - plastic shouldn&#x27;t be microwaved!! It makes a mess and it takes forever because I&#x27;m not a professional, but this s*** works and it doesn&#x27;t really hurt like at all.</li>
            <li> I like this. However, I refuse to roll it around on my skin to remove hair. I use strips to remove as of it was wax.</li>
            <li> After trying a few other sugar wax products, I was really disappointed with the hair removal, the messiness, and how incredibly sticky they were. Upon trying COCOJOJO, however, I immediately noticed how different this is from the other sugaring products. It&#x27;s completely natural, so it washes off very easily. It does not irritate my sensitive skin AT ALL, and is a lot less painful than regular wax.The smell is even pleasant.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly, but the lid was broken.  The sugar itself is difficult to warm evenly and did not remove hair evenly or easily.  It was really expensive for the amount of product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for getting small hairs that are difficult to grab with tweezers. It gets rid of EVERYTHING. Of course, it&#x27;s a bit painful, but it&#x27;s no worse than waxing. It&#x27;s somewhat messy, but because it&#x27;s water-soluble (unlike wax), it&#x27;s easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I had a very difficult time using this. I never could pull any hair out hardly, and the wax would always get stuck on my hands and legs. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t have a great technique, but shaving is just way easier than this..</li>
            <li> very difficult to work with.  I have worked with other sugars, they were  so much easier.  Be careful with getting the paste too hot.</li>
            <li> the past sticks to your skin and its tough to get off</li>
            <li> I totally love it! I used to go to the salon and spend hundreds of $$$ but after i started to get this product, i forgot about salons. Great product, easy to use once you get use to it, saving your time and very convenient. Good quality and all organic, it doesn&#x27;t leave any irritation on your skin afterwards, very gentle! I usually get bigger size but this one it perfect for a minimum 3 months.</li>
            <li> Been using Gigi wax for years now and couldn&#x27;t stand the mess it made. Washes off easily with water. Not nearly as painful as waxing, unless you have REALLY long hair. Since you are pulling in the same direction of hair growth, you get more root pulls and less break off. It&#x27;s less dangerous in the sensitive areas and cuts down on ingrown hairs. It takes a bit of trial and error till you get the right technique, but is absolutely better than waxing!</li>
            <li> Its to messy for me! I thought it would be a good product to use at home to do my own hair removal but its way too messy. on the instructions and the instructional video they said you can apply it and pull it up without using a strip and that process did not work for me. It&#x27;s too soft and it pulls apart.</li>
            <li> I love sugaring wax.  Once you try sugaring you will not go back to waxing. Less painful and less messy.  This is a great product and they have great customer service.</li>
            <li> this product is not VEGAN, as claimed in the description. scroll down to the ingredients, and the 1st one is HONEY.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews but I had such a great experience with cocojojo sugaring that I had to write something! I&#x27;ve done several times now and each time can not say enough good things about the product. Definitely (never deal with shaving and waxing again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i have to say that in the beginning it was messy and could not handle the product so i watched the CD coming with the product which helped me a lot to improve my skill also i called the phone number which i found on the product to ask about how to remove short hair and someone from the company answered all my questions and started explaining step by step over the phone which was really amazing now i can remove all my body unwanted hair in less than 20 minutes without any mess and i feel my skin like baby skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Excellent to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different sugar-based product (MOOM) for hair removal with strips. I also had hard waxing done which was fine, but when I attempted to do it myself it was a disaster. Yesterday I tried sugaring for the first time and I prefer it. Less mess, no need to be near a heating source, easier to get to the difficult spots (back thighs), and it hurts less than waxing. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you bruise easily because you need to apply pressure to stretch it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this. I was excited to try it because waxing hurts and shaving is a pain, but I&#x27;m not sure I would use it again. It was messy to try to get the right consistency. It also took me an hour just to do the lower part of my leg. I had gotten the hang of the pull method but it didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs the first time so I would have to go over the spots. Occasionally some would get stuck and I&#x27;d try picking it off with other sugar or just waiting for it to harden a little bit to pull off-I was left with a few bruises on my leg. Maybe the hair was too short as it worked on my underarms. I may try it again or I may find something else.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I prefer the thinner wax. The thick wax requires working with your hands to get it the right texture, so it takes longer to use.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural products with no harsh chemicals and this fits the bill&lt;br /&gt;Natural sugar hair removing gel. Most chemical hair removing treatments have a horrible smell but this is different&lt;br /&gt;After hair removal the skin is left soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for customers who like a natural product</li>
            <li> When I got this product maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough, but I thought what I was going to get was the easier one that you can hold in your hand and spread with your hand to remove the hair. Not this one. This one was very hard and definitely don&#x27;t want to use your hand to spread (I tried that).&lt;br /&gt;But what I found works with this is to heat just a little bit, like just maybe 10 seconds, use something to spread it on desired area, and then use a separate cloth, like they do a regular wax, to take it off. I tried using my fingers to take it off like it said I could do in the pamphlet, but it was extremely hard and messy.&lt;br /&gt;So when I used it a certain way it worked just fine, but I still wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have made our own sugaring many times before... It is a time-consuming process for me and the consistency of the sugaring isn&#x27;t always right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using cocojojo sugaring was such a breath of fresh air. The sugaring is smooth and goes on beautifully. It stayed at just the right temperature the whole time instead of overheating and then cooling too much like my home-made variety. It has a numbing/pain relieving effect on the skin. It smells delightful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought more because it is so much better than my homemade sugaring that it is worth the extra money to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
            <li> The best (and now the only) hair removal product I use! It is much less painful than waxing, and lasts longer than shaving. Love the washable demin strips just throw it in the washer. No worries about messiness on sheets or towels since it just wahses off.</li>
            <li> This works really nice. I didn&#x27;t feel much pain when using this wax. I love that there are no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to using this product. However there was a problem. My Husband opened up this package not knowing what it was.  When I saw it I opened it up and noticed there was not alot of product in it and the lid was cracked. So obviously most of the product had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company right away. I am giving them 4 stars because of the Customer Service.  They handled this so efficiently, and took care of me. I was very impressed.  I will definitely buy another jar and retry it. Based on you wonderfully I was treated. And I would highly recommend them to anyone I know.</li>
