            <li>I have the hair mask and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product but the only problem I have with it is the amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more drying than hydrating.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair is happier and more shining.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It smells good, and the smell certainly stays a while.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell though.</li>
            <li>Best hair oil hands down.</li>

            <li>It makes my hair shiny and healthy however it&#x27;s pretty oily and makes my hair a bit greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product for hot humid days.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t spray it just right</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde and is very fine.</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>but after each use ponytail looks thicker ;-)</li>
            <li>I did not care much for the powdery smell of it which i could even smell after washing my hair (and I lathered, rinsed, and repeated!)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be repurchasing when I use this all up. :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast with no problems and the price is right.</li>

            <li>I dont really find it helping my frizz very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>putting this on after straightening it REALLY helps it out, and gives it some moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful if my hair is feeling a little extra dry</li>
            <li>particularly like the spray.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair smooth, shinny, and calms down the frizz.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look very oily on hair, like other products, it looks just right.</li>
            <li>Little bit too light for Straightener/curly iron use though.</li>
            <li>Theirs is light not much fragrance I assumed all would be equal...</li>
            <li>Extremely masculine.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome product.  It is non-greasy in your hair and it can double as a conditioner for your skin.  The spray bottle is great for traveling and allows you to manage the amount applied to your hair or skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product - makes my hair very sleek and they smell AWESOME. Love it, love it, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it after each hair wash and it makes my hair look thicker - don&#x27;t know why but after each use ponytail looks thicker ;-)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and healthy however it&#x27;s pretty oily and makes my hair a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;So if I use this I definitely have to wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li> Great travel size  I love this product for hot humid days.  The shipping was fast with no problems and the price is right. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am growing out a perm and have been using moroccan oil to help straighten my hair.  I find that it helps with straightening, leaves my hair looking shiny, and smells great.  I decided to try something different and got the macadamia oil.  It did help with straightening my hair but did not give the same shine as moroccan oil and left a residue.  I did not care much for the powdery smell of it which i could even smell after washing my hair (and I lathered, rinsed, and repeated!)</li>
            <li> I use this as sun protection shield on wet hair before blow drying.Has a strong smell though.Little bit too light for Straightener/curly iron use though.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy Macadamia products, so after hearing a lot about this one, I thought I had to try it out! Well, I love it. It truly does leave my hair feeling smooth &amp; silky. My hair can get very dry, so putting this on after straightening it REALLY helps it out, and gives it some moisture. I will definitely be repurchasing when I use this all up. :)</li>
            <li> It smells divine! Very similar to Moroccan oil but a little bit heavier. I find the same dose of this product will leave my hair greasier looking than Moroccan oil. It&#x27;s wonderful if my hair is feeling a little extra dry and it smells absolutely delicious! Their hair mask is amazing too!</li>
            <li> It helps manage frizz</li>
            <li> Best hair oil hands down. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have the hair mask and love it. I usually use dermorganics hair oil spray. Theirs is light not much fragrance I assumed all would be equal...&lt;br /&gt;This one I found to be very heavy scented. Extremely masculine. I could smell it all day long... If you don&#x27;t spray it just right it leaves greasy looking streaks in your hair.</li>
            <li> Another product that my niece likes. She puts a little of this in the deep conditioner. She also applies it to the hair ends.</li>
            <li> This p is lightweight, smells good and works well. It&#x27;s a wonderful product but the only problem I have with it is the amount of product in the bottle. Otherwise this is a great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more drying than hydrating.</li>
            <li> Very good smell, pleasant but not too strong. I noticed that my hair is happier and more shining.&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the spray. It spreads evenly. Love it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and shiny and has an amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so the price on the small bottle is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt WILL order again!</li>
