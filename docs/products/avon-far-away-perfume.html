            <li>I had smelled it on a person in a doctor&#x27;s waiting room and asked her what was the name of the perfume; she gladly gave it to me.</li>
            <li>its pretty good.</li>
            <li>My wife is happy with the new perfume as it is closest to Coty Nikomos as we have found yet.  </li>
            <li>It came fast and in good shape, package undamaged.</li>
            <li>its definitely a unique and lovely scent just as I wished for so five stars.</li>
            <li>Sweet aroma, not sickening as many may think, just go easy with it and give it time, of course some may feel overpowering but there are likes and dislikes, for me, is a keep!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for those nights when you want to cuddle with your significant other</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t exactly as I remembered but its still really nice and light.</li>
            <li>The smell was fine for me.</li>
            <li>I just love love love far away and have been wearing it over 15 years.</li>
            <li>This is such a knockout scent &amp; for a great price I bought two bottles.</li>
            <li>Always loved Far Away.  </li>
            <li>I loved the old product -</li>
            <li>There were waaay to many notes at first, as the creator did not know what to use</li>
            <li>For the price you can not do any better for such a lovely smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon, almost half off.</li>
            <li>But when I sprayed it on me, all I got was an overly strong, very aggressive smell.</li>
            <li>Its scent is long lasting and just awesome!!!</li>
            <li>I love avon far away perfume.</li>
            <li>By far this is one of my favorite purfumes for years now</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for shipping my favorite scent (and my hubby&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>It came super fast!  </li>
            <li>This product was just as expected - I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product for everyday use as I love to wear perfume.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful feminine fragrance, leaves a trail of men right behind you!</li>
            <li>I first bought it, what has to be over 15 years ago, and decided to buy it again, expecting to be transported in time...</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>have gotten very fond of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really really don&#x27;t like this one.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for a prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>the original bottle with some perfume still left in it from Avon.</li>
            <li>Came in super fast, and smells the same.</li>
            <li>Ordered it by reading the reviews, and I must say that it is extremely sweet smell and cheap, does not last long</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a soft, feminine, pretty scent.</li>
            <li>for the low price its worth it</li>
            <li>On too of the the bottle seemed like it was used it was not filled to the top.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered this product, it said it was brand new, but guess what?</li>
            <li>It was not worth $10.00 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>This scent is a little deeper and a bit heavier than light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I order any Avon products, it will be ordered directly from Avon company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a romantic scent and you don&#x27;t need to use much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how long ago you smelled it at first?  </li>
            <li>I am feeling compelled to buy Far Away from the Avon site just to compare this one with it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s old lady meets sneaker perfume.</li>
            <li>NOT the old</li>
            <li>soft n flowery.</li>
            <li>lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>I had the same perfume for 16 years, this time it looks different and smells slightly different, maybe my oldie changed over the years and got stronger but the same I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I am so sorry, but if this is Avons best scent, then I am not sure what to think about...</li>
            <li>Far Away by Avon - this is a completely different smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sooo feminine and vibrant and I must add long lasting.</li>

            <li> The smell is sooo feminine and vibrant and I must add long lasting.</li>
            <li> Hope the bottle last me as long as the last one, and AVON keeps manufacturing it.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all is needed, last all day long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but this is NOT far away perfume</li>
            <li> She actually opened it at the post office and shared it with the post lady (we live in a very small town, post lady is a friend).</li>
            <li> After an hour it settled on me a little but instead of being flowery and feminine, it became masculine and sour.</li>
            <li> I brought it based off the reviews and must say it was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the perfume liquid is pink.  </li>
            <li> Order came when expected.</li>
            <li> One of the few scents that I can actually wear.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume from Avon, just hate paying that Avon price.</li>
            <li> jasmine, osmanthus, orange flower, vanilla musk, sandalwood and amber, it&#x27;s a scent I prefer in winter, for some odd reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for something different but this was not good for me.</li>
            <li> It was strong, annoying.</li>
            <li> something is missing in the scent.</li>
            <li> This product is not strong at all</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> But I did not really love it.</li>
            <li> Seriously tho.</li>
            <li> Mother is obsessed with this perfume.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The odor is actually annoying.  </li>

            <li> I love avon far away perfume.</li>
            <li> Ordered it by reading the reviews, and I must say that it is extremely sweet smell and cheap, does not last long</li>
            <li> Came on time and for a great price was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This perfume is both the longest lasting perfume I&#x27;ve used, and the one that whenever I wear it, I&#x27;m guaranteed someone will ask me what it is. For the price you can not do any better for such a lovely smelling perfume. I always have a bottle on hand. (And a travel size in my purse)</li>
            <li> I just realized you even sell AVON. This is one of my favorites!!  Thank You</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift.  They loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this product for years now. The price is reasonable. This product is not strong at all I will continue buying</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it so who am I to complain.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume just last week, Its here already!! I brought it based off the reviews and must say it was exactly as I expected. The smell is sooo feminine and vibrant and I must add long lasting. its definitely a unique and lovely scent just as I wished for so five stars. Great for the price too.</li>
            <li> By far this is one of my favorite purfumes for years now</li>
            <li> I just love love love far away and have been wearing it over 15 years. Not only does it smells wonderful but, it lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> The package delivered on time and customer service is very good! That is about all of the good things I can say about this perfume! I was placing my order based on the reviews I read here and was so waiting for this gem! I was hoping for a soft, feminine, pretty scent. But when I sprayed it on me, all I got was an overly strong, very aggressive smell. There were waaay to many notes at first, as the creator did not know what to use so he put it all in. It was strong, annoying. I sat in the car and did not want to move because then I smelled myself. After an hour it settled on me a little but instead of being flowery and feminine, it became masculine and sour. I was on the way to my chiropractor and honestly, I was ashamed of my smell. I am so sorry, but if this is Avons best scent, then I am not sure what to think about...&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I only have problems with the product and NOT with who sells it!!!!</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this product, it said it was brand new, but guess what? When I ordered this, I&#x27;ve found out that the bottle was dated 2006 and it stunk. It was not worth $10.00 with free shipping. If I order any Avon products, it will be ordered directly from Avon company.</li>
            <li> This scent is a little deeper and a bit heavier than light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a romantic scent and you don&#x27;t need to use much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With jasmine, osmanthus, orange flower, vanilla musk, sandalwood and amber, it&#x27;s a scent I prefer in winter, for some odd reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten very fond of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received an incorrect item.  Customer service was so responsive and helpful, I have to give them a 5 star.  I got the correct item and did not have to bother with returning the talc powder I received in error.  My wife is happy with the new perfume as it is closest to Coty Nikomos as we have found yet.  I like the talc powder and will probably order that again with more perfume.</li>
            <li> You know how you can smell something and it will take you back in time no matter how long ago you smelled it at first?  For some reason this fragrance isn&#x27;t doing that for me.  I first bought it, what has to be over 15 years ago, and decided to buy it again, expecting to be transported in time... and I swear this is a different smell.  I used to be in love with this perfume.  Legit packaging, same bottle as before... tassel and all, but something is missing in the scent. This one smells more old-ladyish. Different. Also, the perfume liquid is pink.  On the Avon website the perfume looks yellow.  What happened?  Does anyone know?  I am feeling compelled to buy Far Away from the Avon site just to compare this one with it.  Also on the Avon site this perfume is something like 23 bucks but this one was about 6 bucks before shipping.  I&#x27;m quite a bit vexed by this.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s one of my favorites. But when I ordered this, it doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like it should. It smells completely different. And I would know as I have the original bottle with some perfume still left in it from Avon. I don&#x27;t know what happened, but this is NOT far away perfume , it&#x27;s old lady meets sneaker perfume. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice perfume, it didn&#x27;t quite smell like I remembered. I&#x27;ve had nice comments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I sold Avon for many years, and this was one of my favorite fragrances.  Great price on Amazon, almost half off.</li>
            <li> Mother is obsessed with this perfume.</li>
            <li> Its a fragrance that I love. It&#x27;s sexy. And not over powering. Perfect for those nights when you want to cuddle with your significant other</li>
            <li> I really like it, I always smelling so good :) everyone asking what the name of it, and I don&#x27;t hasitate to tell them</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted . Loved it</li>

            <li> I love this perfume from Avon, just hate paying that Avon price. So I buy from here! It&#x27;s great and very convientent.</li>
            <li> It came super fast!  The smell wasn&#x27;t exactly as I remembered but its still really nice and light. I like it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and she loved it! Came in super fast, and smells the same. Plus its cheaper, than the $23-25 price tag from the avon store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be getting more.</li>
            <li> It was great and it arrived before time I will order again and I recommend to get it.</li>
            <li> NOT the old Far Away by Avon - this is a completely different smell.  I loved the old product - I have some left from years ago - just a smidgen and I can compare the smells side by side.  Not only is it not the same - I really really don&#x27;t like this one.  The odor is actually annoying.  PLEASE don&#x27;t wear this around me!</li>
            <li> A wonderful feminine fragrance, leaves a trail of men right behind you! haha. This is such a knockout scent &amp; for a great price I bought two bottles. It&#x27;s very long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever! It arrived a week after I ordered it. Its scent is long lasting and just awesome!!! Buy this item, you won&#x27;t regret it I swear! Seriously tho.</li>
            <li> Great.  I will always buy this product</li>

            <li> Fast delivery!!!!!!!!!!! Product great!</li>
            <li> Its good. soft n flowery. calming smell. Smells like a baby wipe, or baby lotion. lasts pretty long. for the low price its worth it yes. its pretty good.</li>
            <li> Order came when expected. Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell was fine for me. But I did not really love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> In love with this perfume</li>
            <li> This perfume is the same as the ones you&#x27;d buy at macy&#x27;s or wherever you&#x27;d buy perfume. I bought this for my mom and she loves it</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom&#x27;s birthday.  It came quickly and she loved it.  She actually opened it at the post office and shared it with the post lady (we live in a very small town, post lady is a friend).</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for shipping my favorite scent (and my hubby&#x27;s). It came fast and in good shape, package undamaged. I had the same perfume for 16 years, this time it looks different and smells slightly different, maybe my oldie changed over the years and got stronger but the same I enjoyed it. I spritz once and that&#x27;s all is needed, last all day long! Hope the bottle last me as long as the last one, and AVON keeps manufacturing it. My grandmother used it, my mother still uses it and I brought it from Mexico. My husband thinks of Mexico where we met. Sweet aroma, not sickening as many may think, just go easy with it and give it time, of course some may feel overpowering but there are likes and dislikes, for me, is a keep!&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks again for a prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something different but this was not good for me. It has a pesticide smell to it and in no way is it a good smelling perfume. On too of the the bottle seemed like it was used it was not filled to the top. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this fragrance. Hope Avon will never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This product was just as expected - I was very pleased. I had smelled it on a person in a doctor&#x27;s waiting room and asked her what was the name of the perfume; she gladly gave it to me.</li>
            <li> One of the few scents that I can actually wear. I hope they never discontinue this one. I know I can count on Avon for good products.</li>
