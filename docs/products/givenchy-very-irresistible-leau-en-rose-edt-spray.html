            <li>Not the elegant fragrance I am comparing to.</li>
            <li>I love it:-)</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with so</li>
            <li>VI is more floral than fruity to me.</li>
            <li>Can,t be anymore satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>I have so many complements wearing this fragrance</li>
            <li>I tell them and also let them know to purchase on Amazon much more affordable here than in the department stores.</li>
            <li>It stays on for hours (probably more than 5 hours).</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The name ought to be more sophistocated, to suit the perfume, which I love.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this scent.</li>

            <li>I recommend excellent product and fast delivery thanks</li>
            <li>Love the scent it is fantastic</li>
            <li>Very good price and shipping was fast and very well packaged.</li>
            <li>This is a rather non-descript but pleasant floral/spice type perfume, not bad, and here I see it at a significant discount which seems right.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp; very sexy.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really as light or sweet as a strict floral, which I think of as girly, but has a more grown up sensuality to it.  </li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THIS smells like alcohol then fades into a cheap floral musk from a hospital gift shop.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is an original product... seems like a cheap copy.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it was priced right &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Thank goodness I still have the original to know its not my imagination.</li>
            <li>The fragance its like the original...</li>
            <li>Excellent perfume for the day or night, for a formal occasion or casual, can be for work or leave, very elegant yet cool ..</li>
            <li>the original fragance from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an original product.</li>
            <li>smell is not as original.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of givenchy perfumes, the smell is fascinating ..</li>
            <li>and I love it very Irresistible</li>
            <li>I love it when guys pass me by and go wow!!!</li>
            <li>i love strong and loud scents</li>
            <li>Love this perfume &amp; it was delivered super fast.  </li>
            <li>El tiempo de env&amp;iacute;o fue super rapido.</li>
            <li>is the one I love more than white diamond and UPS</li>
            <li>My order arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon does a very good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reviews by customers about the pros and cons of the product were honest and very helpful, in fact it was the reason why I selected this particular Eau De Toilette Spray for my wife&#x27;s mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li>Great service, and half of what you pay at the department store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s young, flirty, fresh, bright, clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I first bought this fragrance in 2007 and this has become my signature perfume!</li>
            <li>Love this perfume so much, my favorite one for the past 5 years, and the price was just as Irresistible &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>When I first saw this perfume I was really excited about the price since it was only $45 for 75ml of perfume which is very good for this specific perfume.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume for anyone looking for a light sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Im definitely getting one of my own soon</li>
            <li>VI is another fragrance that offers a take on a modern rose without being all about roses, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>is worth it</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as my own supply was getting low...</li>
            <li>I have received numerous compliments on this fragrance and it has made a nice addition to my collection.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li>All one can say that this gift was right on target.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for getting it to me quickly...!</li>
            <li>People giving this the high rating must have never had the original.</li>
            <li>but cologne did not smell as good as the stuff I had previously purchased from a retail store.  </li>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT: it smells the same in any type of skin, I know some people that use it</li>
            <li>Wel,l first...</li>
            <li>then I would have preferred to pay more for the eau de perfume that would really last</li>
            <li>and it never fails someone always stops to ask....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even seen smaller boxes priced for more than this.</li>
            <li>I have thoroughly enjoyed this present for myself; I think I have found my signature scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume &amp; get constant compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>It has such a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>Make sure you sample this on your skin since some skins absorb scents differently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Smells good but is not genuine Givency</li>
            <li>love perfume has a really nice smell not overwhelming other people love also</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a beautiful, long lasting, Irrisistable smell.</li>
            <li>Just suits pretty much all occasions.</li>
            <li>Any woman of any ages will enjoy this perfume and I feel like it&#x27;s easy to wear (everyday for work or in the evening).</li>
            <li>bottle of Very Irresistible by Givenchy was the 1 oz.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received from my fiance, though it was wrapped and in a real box, was a FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom loves this scent, very feminine.</li>
            <li>Gentle, not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Once I received my bottle, I questioned whether it was real or not.</li>
            <li>After my wife saw a sample of Very Irresistible in a magazine, it was all she could talk about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that it&#x27;s not obnoxious</li>
            <li>It came fast and there were no problems with the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only was the bottle a gorgeous pink to purple shade of glass that could be a decorative accent all in itself</li>
            <li>When I tried this perfume out in a store, I did not expect it to be as nice as it is, and the piece of paper which they gave me with the scent on it, held the scent for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay for the original next time.</li>
            <li>This is not the same as the original</li>
            <li>I have been using this for most of my days, I dont want to change my perfume to other brand at all</li>
            <li>Someone who likes complex florals would love this, as would someone who likes bold fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It was very clear from the package and the plastic bottle!</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for a few years now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Instead of a new bottle, I got a package that had been opened and used.  </li>
            <li>It was unopened and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>The internal pack was open, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original that my wife have.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and it&#x27;s half of the price as my local department store.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 star because although it smelled like the original product it felt watered down.</li>
            <li>Enter smart husband - stage left.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, a little powdery and flowery.</li>
            <li>Amazing perfume, but silver plastic was broken.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s Day and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;resist\\&quot; giving it to her early.  </li>
            <li>however I did not mind much since it was only the box.</li>
            <li>I prefer he very irresistible sensual (the purple one) because it lasts longer on you, but the both smell almost the same.</li>
            <li>, I think it was just old and had turned.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t at all flowery but is much more complex and alluring.  </li>
            <li>I bought \\&quot;Very Irresistable\\&quot; by Givenchy from this selller and the perfume looked and smelled different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because once I spray it on myself I find that the scent is pretty much gone in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The scent initially smelled exactly like Very Irresistible, but now only 2 weeks later it is noticably different.  </li>
            <li>This was a much larger bottle than what I was expecting from the old bottle I had hung onto in hopes of someday finding it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much of it at one time and the scent seemed to stay with me for hours unlike some other perfumes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is so many similar fragrances, yet one could do a lot worse that VI.</li>
            <li>I am not usually into the floral type fragrances, however a co-worker introduced to me Very Irresistible Sensual by Givenchy a few years back</li>

            <li> It stays on for hours (probably more than 5 hours).</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The name ought to be more sophistocated, to suit the perfume, which I love.</li>
            <li> My favorite go-to perfume.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume-more than any</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend as this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite all around fragrance.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is her favorite</li>
            <li> I know that it is her favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> She had me order 2 more</li>
            <li> It smells strong but sexy.</li>
            <li> I recommend excellent product and fast delivery thanks</li>
            <li> Love the scent it is fantastic</li>
            <li> Very good price and shipping was fast and very well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is a rather non-descript but pleasant floral/spice type perfume, not bad, and here I see it at a significant discount which seems right.</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp; very sexy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really as light or sweet as a strict floral, which I think of as girly, but has a more grown up sensuality to it.  </li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THIS smells like alcohol then fades into a cheap floral musk from a hospital gift shop.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is an original product... seems like a cheap copy.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it was priced right &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I still have the original to know its not my imagination.</li>
            <li> The fragance its like the original...</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume for the day or night, for a formal occasion or casual, can be for work or leave, very elegant yet cool ..</li>
            <li> the original fragance from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an original product.</li>
            <li> smell is not as original.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of givenchy perfumes, the smell is fascinating ..</li>
            <li> and I love it very Irresistible</li>
            <li> I love it when guys pass me by and go wow!!!</li>
            <li> i love strong and loud scents</li>
            <li> Love this perfume &amp; it was delivered super fast.  </li>
            <li> El tiempo de env&amp;iacute;o fue super rapido.</li>
            <li> is the one I love more than white diamond and UPS</li>
            <li> My order arrived really quickly.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon does a very good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews by customers about the pros and cons of the product were honest and very helpful, in fact it was the reason why I selected this particular Eau De Toilette Spray for my wife&#x27;s mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> Great service, and half of what you pay at the department store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s young, flirty, fresh, bright, clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I first bought this fragrance in 2007 and this has become my signature perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume so much, my favorite one for the past 5 years, and the price was just as Irresistible &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When I first saw this perfume I was really excited about the price since it was only $45 for 75ml of perfume which is very good for this specific perfume.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume for anyone looking for a light sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Im definitely getting one of my own soon</li>
            <li> VI is another fragrance that offers a take on a modern rose without being all about roses, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> is worth it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as my own supply was getting low...</li>
            <li> I have received numerous compliments on this fragrance and it has made a nice addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li> All one can say that this gift was right on target.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for getting it to me quickly...!</li>
            <li> People giving this the high rating must have never had the original.</li>
            <li> but cologne did not smell as good as the stuff I had previously purchased from a retail store.  </li>
            <li> VERY IMPORTANT: it smells the same in any type of skin, I know some people that use it</li>
            <li> Wel,l first...</li>
            <li> then I would have preferred to pay more for the eau de perfume that would really last</li>
            <li> and it never fails someone always stops to ask....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even seen smaller boxes priced for more than this.</li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this present for myself; I think I have found my signature scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume &amp; get constant compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> It has such a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Make sure you sample this on your skin since some skins absorb scents differently.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Smells good but is not genuine Givency</li>
            <li> love perfume has a really nice smell not overwhelming other people love also</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a beautiful, long lasting, Irrisistable smell.</li>
            <li> Just suits pretty much all occasions.</li>
            <li> Any woman of any ages will enjoy this perfume and I feel like it&#x27;s easy to wear (everyday for work or in the evening).</li>
            <li> bottle of Very Irresistible by Givenchy was the 1 oz.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received from my fiance, though it was wrapped and in a real box, was a FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom loves this scent, very feminine.</li>
            <li> Gentle, not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Once I received my bottle, I questioned whether it was real or not.</li>
            <li> After my wife saw a sample of Very Irresistible in a magazine, it was all she could talk about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that it&#x27;s not obnoxious</li>
            <li> It came fast and there were no problems with the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only was the bottle a gorgeous pink to purple shade of glass that could be a decorative accent all in itself</li>
            <li> When I tried this perfume out in a store, I did not expect it to be as nice as it is, and the piece of paper which they gave me with the scent on it, held the scent for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pay for the original next time.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the original</li>
            <li> I have been using this for most of my days, I dont want to change my perfume to other brand at all</li>
            <li> Someone who likes complex florals would love this, as would someone who likes bold fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It was very clear from the package and the plastic bottle!</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for a few years now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Instead of a new bottle, I got a package that had been opened and used.  </li>
            <li> It was unopened and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> The internal pack was open, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original that my wife have.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it&#x27;s half of the price as my local department store.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because although it smelled like the original product it felt watered down.</li>
            <li> Enter smart husband - stage left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, a little powdery and flowery.</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume, but silver plastic was broken.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s Day and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;resist\\&quot; giving it to her early.  </li>
            <li> however I did not mind much since it was only the box.</li>
            <li> I prefer he very irresistible sensual (the purple one) because it lasts longer on you, but the both smell almost the same.</li>
            <li> , I think it was just old and had turned.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t at all flowery but is much more complex and alluring.  </li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Very Irresistable\\&quot; by Givenchy from this selller and the perfume looked and smelled different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because once I spray it on myself I find that the scent is pretty much gone in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The scent initially smelled exactly like Very Irresistible, but now only 2 weeks later it is noticably different.  </li>
            <li> This was a much larger bottle than what I was expecting from the old bottle I had hung onto in hopes of someday finding it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of it at one time and the scent seemed to stay with me for hours unlike some other perfumes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is so many similar fragrances, yet one could do a lot worse that VI.</li>
            <li> I am not usually into the floral type fragrances, however a co-worker introduced to me Very Irresistible Sensual by Givenchy a few years back</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s much to like about this fragrance but not much to love imo.</li>
            <li> Everything was normal and went smoothly, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> She was really surprised and let me spray a little.  </li>
            <li> Seems rather diluted and the smell does last as long as previous Very Irresistible perfumes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The perfume fades away within 1/2 hour, seems different from what you get at Macy&#x27;s or the other stores.</li>
            <li> It is different from any other Givenchy fragrance I have.  </li>
            <li> So, if you want a not so intense fragrance, choose this one, but don&#x27;t expect to be remembered, because the fragrance its really weak, plain an simple.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money as a present.</li>
            <li> Perfume was just as expected.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, nothing wrong with the actual perfume itself but the lid on the bottle was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Same product I usually buy at macys.</li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> color of the bottle was two shades too dark-</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with any very irresistible.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> The security plastic was like half opened....</li>
            <li> The price is much less on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for this particular fragrance for the longest and its so expensive</li>
            <li> wasted my 50+  bucks</li>
            <li> Bottle showed missing product and cap showed use.  </li>
            <li> They also wear it everyday which signifies that they like it.</li>
            <li> Wasted $50.</li>
            <li> Its soft and casual.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered, like usual, on time.</li>
            <li> , the spritz though had a hard time doing its job, that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> it was either old, or a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;...and it smells so bad...</li>
            <li> Disappointed in amazon for selling me used and new.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, the staying power is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if the lid wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> hazardously FAKE</li>
            <li> you should know Eau De Toilette is not Perfume, I knew that, but I thought maybe because its for women it would be stronger than EdT for men, wrong.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel dizzy, nauseous and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Some will like it, a few will hate it, but it won&#x27;t rock anyone&#x27;s world-pardon the expression-if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> so I know I couldn&#x27;t go wrong buying her this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does not smell bad, it is just not quite it, so I would describe it as a close knock-off.</li>
            <li> I bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because I also purchased Beyonce Heat for 20usd(bigger, cheaper and perfume) and everyone preferred that one.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years and there is no mistaking a fake!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell was horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> This stuff is sexy &amp; delicious!  I bought it for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s Day and couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;resist\\&quot; giving it to her early.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume and the smell, size and price it was ok. Size and price satisfied</li>
            <li> People giving this the high rating must have never had the original. THIS smells like alcohol then fades into a cheap floral musk from a hospital gift shop. Not the elegant fragrance I am comparing to. Thank goodness I still have the original to know its not my imagination. I have one on each arm, and after 5 minutes they smell NOTHING alike one bit! DO NOT BUY THIS ONLINE. And please, people, STOP rating this 5 stars!! I was tricked by this alone. I&#x27;m a fool, and can&#x27;t even return. &amp;#34;Hazardous materials&amp;#34; is the posted reason...Suure....hazardously FAKE</li>
            <li> Same product I usually buy at macys. Only difference is the price. I love it:-)</li>
            <li> The security plastic was like half opened....i didnt return it because i had to travel. The fragance its like the original...but you keep some quality doubts with that issue.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister in law for her bday and I fell in love with so Im definitely getting one of my own soon</li>
            <li> VI is more floral than fruity to me. It&#x27;s young, flirty, fresh, bright, clean and clear. VI is another fragrance that offers a take on a modern rose without being all about roses, if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s much to like about this fragrance but not much to love imo. There is so many similar fragrances, yet one could do a lot worse that VI. However at this price, I&#x27;d go for something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample-worthy, not bottle-worthy.</li>
            <li> Can,t be anymore satisfied with my order. The package was delivered, like usual, on time. The produce was beyond satisfactory to my expectation. The reviews by customers about the pros and cons of the product were honest and very helpful, in fact it was the reason why I selected this particular Eau De Toilette Spray for my wife&#x27;s mother&#x27;s day gift.</li>

            <li> Purchased this for my wife, you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this perfume I was really excited about the price since it was only $45 for 75ml of perfume which is very good for this specific perfume. When I got the package and saw the box it came in it was not in the best condition however I did not mind much since it was only the box.

If I had known it was like this then I would have preferred to pay more for the eau de perfume that would really last</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I really love this perfume! It&#x27;s amazing and lasts a long time, plus this was an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years.  It has a wonderful scent that lasts all day.  I get compliments on how beautiful it smells from both men and women.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a beautiful, long lasting, Irrisistable smell.</li>
            <li> All one can say that this gift was right on target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was just what she wanted and was like the wind on a warm day flowing thru a flower garden in the tropics...</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong even if u just spray it once. It makes me feel dizzy, nauseous and uncomfortable. wasted my 50+  bucks</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it&#x27;s half of the price as my local department store.  Well worth it. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes perfume that is not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfume at a good price</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume for the day or night, for a formal occasion or casual, can be for work or leave, very elegant yet cool ..I am a big fan of givenchy perfumes, the smell is fascinating .. I love is the best thing and bought</li>
            <li> NIce price, Love this!!</li>
            <li> I have always bought this fragance for my wife. She loves it. The price was great. The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because the bottle and packaging were different from I have always bought at retail stores and this is the second time this happens with pertumes I bought on Amazon. I just hope this is, indeed, the original fragance from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for years and adore it.  Having bought perfume from amazon before, I trusted this would be what it was advertised.  Instead of a new bottle, I got a package that had been opened and used.  Bottle showed missing product and cap showed use.  Disappointed in amazon for selling me used and new.  5 stars for fragrance, 1 for service.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent....one of my favorites.  Thanks so much for getting it to me quickly...!</li>
            <li> great seller - delivered as promised!</li>
            <li> I am not usually into the floral type fragrances, however a co-worker introduced to me Very Irresistible Sensual by Givenchy a few years back and I just loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was the bottle a gorgeous pink to purple shade of glass that could be a decorative accent all in itself but it smells just sexy and like walking through a flower garden! This is in my opinion a great spring and summertime scent.  My husband just loved this frangrance on me as well.  I even got a miniature version of the bottle to carry in my purse, along with body lotion and body wash, one of the nice things about buying the sets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle of Very Irresistible by Givenchy was the 1 oz. Eau de Toilette spray and it retailed at the time for around $65.  You don&#x27;t need to use much of it at one time and the scent seemed to stay with me for hours unlike some other perfumes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An uplifting, sexy, floral scent that stays with you and comes in a gorgeous bottle.  What more can I say!  I do highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> I have so many complements wearing this fragrance and it never fails someone always stops to ask....What are you wearing? ...I tell them and also let them know to purchase on Amazon much more affordable here than in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I paid about forty bucks for this item which was listed at 80.00 in a local J.C. Penney. I&#x27;ve even seen smaller boxes priced for more than this.</li>
            <li> love perfume has a really nice smell not overwhelming other people love also</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because although it smelled like the original product it felt watered down. It stays on for hours (probably more than 5 hours). It&#x27;s light, a little powdery and flowery. Any woman of any ages will enjoy this perfume and I feel like it&#x27;s easy to wear (everyday for work or in the evening). Just suits pretty much all occasions.</li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this present for myself; I think I have found my signature scent.  I appreciated it being perfectly packaged, too.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is the 2nd time I bought this perfume and I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Mistakenly ordered 2, shame  you cannot return them or1 if there is intake</li>
            <li> El perfume llego en perfectas condiciones en todo sentido. El tiempo de env&amp;iacute;o fue super rapido. Recomiendo ampliamente a este vendedor</li>
            <li> Seems rather diluted and the smell does last as long as previous Very Irresistible perfumes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> my wife loves the item and looks forward to getting it on mothers day or Christmas--but they need to bring back the 5 pc. travel items</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product. I have used this perfume for a few years now, and I love it. Perfect for day or night.</li>
            <li> Had a gift exchange in work and the person loved their gift. They also wear it everyday which signifies that they like it. Its very mild in scent which was good for the person unlike myself i love strong and loud scents</li>

            <li> My wife loves this scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received from my fiance, though it was wrapped and in a real box, was a FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the bottle was two shades too dark-it was almost red-and had particles embedded in the glass; the box was cut open, the lining removed, and glued back together and re-wrapped.  When I sprayed it on, I was hit immediately by the aroma of rubbing alcohol.  When it hit my skin, it burned.  Save your sanity and health, and go buy it in person from the Givenchy counter.</li>
            <li> When I tried this perfume out in a store, I did not expect it to be as nice as it is, and the piece of paper which they gave me with the scent on it, held the scent for a few days.  The name ought to be more sophistocated, to suit the perfume, which I love.</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled as i remember, the spritz though had a hard time doing its job, that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars. My mom loves this scent, very feminine.</li>
            <li> Good buying experience.Good item.</li>
            <li> After my shower , I wear a baby doll and 2 spritz of this perfume is enough for every night that I wear it. Believe me all  men likes it. This is my signature perfume. is worth it</li>
            <li> The perfume fades away within 1/2 hour, seems different from what you get at Macy&#x27;s or the other stores. I will keep this one, but stick to buying it from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an original product. They stole me. The internal pack was open, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the original that my wife have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as my own supply was getting low...upon receipt...it didn&#x27;t appear to be the same thing...the bottle was a slightly different design and color..and the perfume did not smell the same...I tested it on my skin...on paper and on cloth...it definately was not the same product...it was either old, or a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;...and it smells so bad...it is not usable...</li>
            <li> gets you laid when you give as a gift and smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells good but is not genuine Givency</li>
            <li> My favorite go-to perfume.  Gentle, not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto! Recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> I prefer he very irresistible sensual (the purple one) because it lasts longer on you, but the both smell almost the same. you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with any very irresistible. VERY IMPORTANT: it smells the same in any type of skin, I know some people that use it and it smells the same always.</li>
            <li> Great price! Perfume was just as expected. The scent is a very exotic to me but not over bearing. Perfect</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this perfume. Smells great, great price.  I would order again &amp; recommend it to anyone..</li>
            <li> smell is not as original. and lasts for short time</li>
            <li> I recommend excellent product and fast delivery thanks</li>
            <li> Love this perfume &amp; it was delivered super fast.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I got it at a great price as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s elegant and sexy as I am often told when I ware it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume &amp; get constant compliments when I wear it.  I would highly recommend this perfume for anyone looking for a light sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Item well packed and delivered promptly but cologne did not smell as good as the stuff I had previously purchased from a retail store.  Did not look like a knockoff, I think it was just old and had turned.</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever, I get so many compliments on it. I have lost count! Packaged well and shipped fast. Highly reccomend.  Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Any woman would like this fragance. Its soft and casual. I bought it as a gift. Recommended for all ocassions.</li>
            <li> This is not the genuine product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was very clear from the package and the plastic bottle! I have used this perfume for years and there is no mistaking a fake!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. I first bought this fragrance in 2007 and this has become my signature perfume! I always get compliments on this perfume. It has such a lovely fragrance. But beware, this scent is not for everyone. Make sure you sample this on your skin since some skins absorb scents differently. My friend loves this scent but can&#x27;t stand how it smells on her. Great service, and half of what you pay at the department store.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume so much, my favorite one for the past 5 years, and the price was just as Irresistible &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This was a much larger bottle than what I was expecting from the old bottle I had hung onto in hopes of someday finding it. (there was a tad left that I could not recover and had put it in my lingerie drawer). Grea buy!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, nothing wrong with the actual perfume itself but the lid on the bottle was broken when I received it. Other than that, it was priced right &amp; smells wonderful! I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if the lid wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I would give 6 starts if there was an option, wife love it and would use it all of the time if she could!!  Just purchased another bottle today for her.</li>
            <li> Once I received my bottle, I questioned whether it was real or not. I went and bought a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bottle at the store, and this was definitely not the same as the store bought. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does not smell bad, it is just not quite it, so I would describe it as a close knock-off. I kept the store bought bottle, and gave away the knock-off, since returns are not allowed. I bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have searched for this particular fragrance for the longest and its so expensive so I just gave up on it until I searched here and found it the cheapest. It was unopened and in brand new condition. The shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li> After my wife saw a sample of Very Irresistible in a magazine, it was all she could talk about. Enter smart husband - stage left. I immediately ordered a bottle for her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume-more than any I&#x27;ve ever worn. Clean, crisp; very sexy. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume, but silver plastic was broken.</li>
            <li> It is so awsome and the packaging and everything else was great.  As usual, Amazon does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thans!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend as this is her favorite.  She was really surprised and let me spray a little.  It is a nice scent and I might get one for myself now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so awesome like a breath of fresh air I love it when guys pass me by and go wow!!! What is that smell its intoxicating... So I tell them its Irresistible by Givenchy its 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  I am always happy with Amazon and their quick response.  The bottle is beautiful and packed for non breakage and the price is RIGHT!  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perfume of good quality. Recommended seller...</li>
            <li> This is a rather non-descript but pleasant floral/spice type perfume, not bad, and here I see it at a significant discount which seems right. Some will like it, a few will hate it, but it won&#x27;t rock anyone&#x27;s world-pardon the expression-if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, sexy, feminine fragrance.  A floral scent with a deep amber and musk undertone.  Someone who likes complex florals would love this, as would someone who likes bold fragrances.  It isn&#x27;t really as light or sweet as a strict floral, which I think of as girly, but has a more grown up sensuality to it.  It isn&#x27;t at all flowery but is much more complex and alluring.  And a spray or two lasts all day.  I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it.  It is different from any other Givenchy fragrance I have.  I prefer buying perfume rather than eau de toilette, simply because the fragrance lasts longer on the skin.  I always wear french perfume.  The french have the very best perfumiers in the world and this is one of their best creations. I simply love it!  I purchased my bottle at Macy&#x27;s for $100.  The price is much less on Amazon.  Hope it&#x27;s authentic!  I have received numerous compliments on this fragrance and it has made a nice addition to my collection. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite all around fragrance. It&#x27;s my signature scent. It&#x27;s light enough that it&#x27;s not obnoxious but you can&#x27;t mistake the scent.</li>
            <li> My order arrived really quickly. I love love love my perfume and was thrilled with the price! Everywhere i go people always ask me what im wearing. It smells strong but sexy. Im going to buy more soon! :-)</li>
            <li> Great fragrance with notes of peony and musk. Unfortunately, though, the staying power is pretty bad. For that reason I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time; my wife loves it and was for a good price. Iâ€™m completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Dios, Una excelente frangancia, que comprare cada vez que se me termine por lo buena que puede llegar a ser!&lt;br /&gt;Gracias.!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent it is fantastic</li>
            <li> Excellent time delivery and good product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is an original product... seems like a cheap copy.  The scent initially smelled exactly like Very Irresistible, but now only 2 weeks later it is noticably different.  Also, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last after applied....  It wears off almost immediately.  Not worth the price.  I&#x27;ll pay for the original next time.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of sister Loren Loretta, the hottest bride of the church ever to help me cook for the homeless.  She&#x27;s left the order years ago, and was given a diplomatic post to Greenland.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister&#x27;s birthday. This is her favorite so I know I couldn&#x27;t go wrong buying her this.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the original</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this great product for my Mom a while ago.  I know that it is her favorite perfume.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend loves it. She had me order 2 more just incase she ran out</li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Very Irresistable\\&quot; by Givenchy from this selller and the perfume looked and smelled different. The smell was horrible! It smelled like a car freshner instead of perfume. Wasted $50. NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> It came fast and there were no problems with the product.  Everything was normal and went smoothly, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife as a gift and simply she loves it. Very good price and shipping was fast and very well packaged. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for most of my days, I dont want to change my perfume to other brand at all</li>
