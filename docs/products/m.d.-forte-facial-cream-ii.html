            <li>Perfect face cream for normal/dry skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>The best glycolic acid cream out there.</li>
            <li>Coming up on 62 on Thursday, and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li>This product was referred to me by a dermatologist and is great to eliminate wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give it a try and it works great for my needs.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy when you apply it and makes your face feel good.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to discover I could purchase it easily now.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing - clear complexion, evens out my skin tone and great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Lotion II much more.  </li>
            <li>I need it more for hormone induced acne control.</li>
            <li>I liked it but was not crazy about it, so I was hesitant about buying this cream.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I watched my face transform and smooth out.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar it was not as filled as I was use to.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to mature women who see signs of changes in complexion.</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin so smooth, clear , even toned and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Of course, I do have great genes, but I am 69 years old, and most people think I am early 50s.  </li>
            <li>Although I love the product, this was my first time ordering it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>a week once a day, since I personally don&#x27;t think its good to overuse the glycol acid products.</li>
            <li>This  facial cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice. not much different than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>The glycolic in this cream is not too strong, but strong enough to help with exfoliation.   </li>
            <li>great product but being discontinued so hard to find - don&#x27;t like the substitute -&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon receipt, I immediately opened the first cream and began using it.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first try, M.D. Forte 11 may be your first choice.</li>
            <li>However, I realize the M.D. Forte  11 is not quite strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>I have found that the prices here are very competitive as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks M.D Jenny</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only moisturizer I have found that keeps my skin rejuvenated and free of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>After using this cream for about a month (at night only) I noticed significant benefits.</li>
            <li>For a 60 yr old woman - WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I get compliments all the time about how young my skin looks and it really does.</li>
            <li>If your skin is very sensitive, you might want to see if there is a lower strength than M.D. Forte11.</li>
            <li>I alternate and even take days off and use Seabuckthorn Serum which is 100 percent natural or living bentonite clay on alternate days for a smooth complexion.</li>
            <li>It stings just a little bit when applied, which is fine.</li>
            <li>It made me wonder if product was old.</li>
            <li>I really like the facial cream .</li>
            <li>this was different for some reason it is very thick or not solid but more solid than it normally is...  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive combinational skin on my face, dry though out but oily in the T-zone, nose and chin.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for years, and I love it, however, the cream is a little too thick for my type skin.  </li>

            <li> Not only it prevents stubborn acne from appearing in the same spots every month, but it also moisturizes very well, despite its extremely thick consistency and containing 20% glycol acid.</li>
            <li> I recently opened the second jar of cream only to find that the cream had dried up into a paste-like substance.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> Glycolic concentration in the Facial Cream II is not strong enough to make a difference.</li>

            <li> I am 60 yrs old and had used it in my 40&#x27;s - found it hard to find and switched to other products.  </li>
            <li> Plan to try other products</li>
            <li> I am having problems with one side of my face being allergic to face creams and this cream made it far worse, also I did not like the texture or smell of this cream.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone , I&#x27;ve tried other products in between M.D Forte over the past 8 years and nothing compares to M.D</li>
            <li> Just wait a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It is a must have for dull looking skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this brand after Glytone reformulated their products.  Glycolic concentration in the Facial Cream II is not strong enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and it helps to exfoliate and make the skin look younger and healthier. I orignally got it at the dermatologists&#x27; but now get it at Amazon--it&#x27;s a terrific product and coordinates well with Retin A therapies--mix them together.  I have found that the prices here are very competitive as well.  I can&#x27;t say enough for the entire MD forte line.</li>
            <li> I purchased two jars of M.D. Forte Facial Cream II back in April of this year.  Upon receipt, I immediately opened the first cream and began using it.  The quality of the product was what I expected.  I recently opened the second jar of cream only to find that the cream had dried up into a paste-like substance.  I attempted to &amp;#34;stir&amp;#34; the cream, hoping to bring it back to use, but it was to no avail.  Moral of story: check all products upon delivery.  Don&#x27;t assume that all received products are of equal quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to mature women who see signs of changes in complexion. However, I realize the M.D. Forte  11 is not quite strong enough for me. I think  M.D. Forte 111 is better&lt;br /&gt;for me and that is what I will order next time. If this is your first try, M.D. Forte 11 may be your first choice. If your skin is very sensitive, you might want to see if there is a lower strength than M.D. Forte11.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It works well on smoothing the skin and removing keratosis.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone , I&#x27;ve tried other products in between M.D Forte over the past 8 years and nothing compares to M.D it leaves your skin so smooth, clear , even toned and very healthy looking. Thanks M.D Jenny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products since the mid &#x27;90s. They are efficient, and you will not find any others with this level of retinol in them. This level is 20 percent. I alternate and even take days off and use Seabuckthorn Serum which is 100 percent natural or living bentonite clay on alternate days for a smooth complexion. Coming up on 62 on Thursday, and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It makes my face glow. Perfect face cream for normal/dry skin. The glycolic in this cream is not too strong, but strong enough to help with exfoliation.   It is a must have for dull looking skin.</li>
            <li> MD Forte was recommended by my dermatologist years ago, and I have used it religiously since then.  I graduated from I to II some years ago, and I swear by it.  Of course, I do have great genes, but I am 69 years old, and most people think I am early 50s.  I credit a lot of this to MD Forte cream.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  A Doctor gave it to me when I moved to Salt Lake City years ago.  I couldn&#x27;t keep my skin hydrated.  This cream locks in the moisture with clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It is not greasy when you apply it and makes your face feel good.  It stings just a little bit when applied, which is fine. I find if I wash my face and wait a few minutes it doesn&#x27;t sting as much as if I wash my face and apply it immediately.  Just wait a few minutes. This product was referred to me by a dermatologist and is great to eliminate wrinkles.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This  facial cream is amazing.  I am 60 yrs old and had used it in my 40&#x27;s - found it hard to find and switched to other products.  I was delighted to discover I could purchase it easily now.  The results are amazing - clear complexion, evens out my skin tone and great moisturizer.  I started using it this time same way my dermatologist recommended the last time.  Once a day for 2 or 3 weeks, then twice a day from that point.  On days I&#x27;m in a hurry, mascara, lip gloss and I&#x27;m ready to go.  For a 60 yr old woman - WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is amazing! I watched my face transform and smooth out. It even felt different to the touch. The best glycolic acid cream out there. Didn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, and I love it, however, the cream is a little too thick for my type skin.  I prefer the Lotion II much more.  I give the Lotion II 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Nice. not much different than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I was amazed that it did not leave my skin greasy.  I didn&#x27;t have any tingling or redness using this product.  I liked it very much.  May try the Facial Cream III</li>
            <li> I am having problems with one side of my face being allergic to face creams and this cream made it far worse, also I did not like the texture or smell of this cream.</li>
            <li> I have used MD Forte facial cream for 20 years. My dermatologist back then, sold it in his office and told me to use it. I am 52 and I get compliments all the time about how young my skin looks and it really does.</li>
            <li> Great product, and it&#x27;s the only moisturizer I have found that keeps my skin rejuvenated and free of blemishes.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It was recommended by dermatologist.  Although I love the product, this was my first time ordering it through Amazon.  When I opened the jar it was not as filled as I was use to.  It made me wonder if product was old.</li>
            <li> Before buying this cream I&#x27;ve used MD Forte II cleanser, recommended by my dermatologist. I liked it but was not crazy about it, so I was hesitant about buying this cream. However, I decided to give it a try and it works great for my needs. I am in 28-33 age category, thus I don&#x27;t yet care about using it for the anti-aging benefits. I need it more for hormone induced acne control. I have a sensitive combinational skin on my face, dry though out but oily in the T-zone, nose and chin. After using this cream for about a month (at night only) I noticed significant benefits. I got a prescription for the Retin-A three weeks after I got this cream, but I didn&#x27;t bother picking it up because this cream works so well. Not only it prevents stubborn acne from appearing in the same spots every month, but it also moisturizes very well, despite its extremely thick consistency and containing 20% glycol acid. It lasted me for almost three month using it 4 times a week once a day, since I personally don&#x27;t think its good to overuse the glycol acid products. I now purchased the Vivite version of this cream, after MD Forte has reformulated and renamed its products. I hope it will work as well.</li>
            <li> this was different for some reason it is very thick or not solid but more solid than it normally is...  should have returned it.&lt;br /&gt;it did not come sealed.  may try a different retailer next time.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial cream . My skin is really starting to look healthier. Plan to try other products</li>
            <li> great product but being discontinued so hard to find - don&#x27;t like the substitute -&lt;br /&gt;no problems with shipment even though pricey</li>
    </ol>
