            <li>and I think that is preety good.  </li>

            <li>These tweezers surely get the job done!</li>
            <li>Had been using this ancient pair of tweezers which were amazing</li>
            <li>The colors and patterns that are available make them a great gift for friends.</li>
            <li>Nice color though.</li>
            <li>If you want a good quality tweezers, just go for this, the best so far.</li>
            <li>Very good at first, but after a week was already getting blunt, even though i kept the plastic cap on it whenever not in use.  </li>
            <li>Very precise with a nice slant.  </li>
            <li>have been the best so far.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very precise and work well.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a more effective and easy to use pair of tweezers than these.  </li>
            <li>They allow you to pull the hair out with much more gripping power,  The pointed end of the tweezer blade allows you to dig out ingrown hairs with ease.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE HAD MANY OVER THE YEARS.  </li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>, also I wish they were an inch longer for a better grip..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most tweezers, if they get moisture on the working end, or even one hair stuck between the pinchers, will not continue to grab more hairs without wiping or blowing off.  </li>
            <li>I would love to find this quality product with rounded pincher ends.  </li>
            <li>However, for the price, I don&#x27;t think they are significantly better than my cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>Serisouly, Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Used them for years and love them.</li>
            <li>But it mostly doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>They work great and the company with sharpen them as much as needed, free!</li>
            <li>Have had it for more than a year now</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>I have used many tweezers and these</li>
            <li>In addition, I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>These worked much better than I had even hoped.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to friends, they grab eyebrow hairs easily and pull them out flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I have resisted the higher price for Tweezerman, but I&#x27;m delighted with its functionality.  </li>
            <li>most of them cheap $2 ones in beauty supply shops.</li>
            <li>They are great tweezers, these are not quite as good as my old ones though, thanks</li>
            <li>Loved them so much that my mom ended up buying a pair for herself.</li>
            <li>Got tge turquoise - they are easy to find in my cosmetics box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to find in my make up drawer.</li>
            <li>I purchased these based on the high # of good reviews.  </li>
            <li>The points are so fine that you can grab even the tiniest hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>As a man who strives to prevent his unibrow from coming to fruition, I appreciate how painless and precise these tweezers are.  </li>
            <li>Also, it would be great if it included an extra carrying case.</li>
            <li>The slant edge is precise, as intended, but if I flip them around to use the point, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any strength to them to grab hairs.  </li>
            <li>My cheap Revlon tweezers could grab on the edge and on the point.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought the same tweezers a couple of years ago and they still work great.</li>
            <li>Always precise.</li>
            <li>but my daughter liked using them so much.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the old Revlon tweezer, but the closest I have found</li>
            <li>What a breath of fresh air!</li>
            <li>These are totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>Plus the color is fun!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the $20!</li>
            <li>It does the job right!</li>
            <li>I should have probably just gone to the store and paid full price for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That should be a good enough recommendation.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old, favorite, can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re bent, I&#x27;ve had them forever tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li>These are costly, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>A far, far better product than many other tweezers I&#x27;ve tried, especially good with small eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>Hand down, the best tweezers I have ever used - can easily grab small eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Tweezerman!</li>
            <li>Expensive but work great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many different tweezers I have tried in my 60+ years.  </li>
            <li>It works first time, every time.  </li>
            <li>but they work really well!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li>Color exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first pair in the store</li>
            <li>far as Tweezerman is concerned, the other 5 tweezers I&#x27;ve bought from them (in stores) are amazing!</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>well priced and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I SPENT WAY MORE ON ALL THE OTHERS I TRIED.  </li>
            <li>and now I am exceedingly more careful.  </li>
            <li>im a straight man.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These make it so much easier to tweeze.</li>
            <li>My absolute fave and</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this is either a knock-off, a defective one (you get what you pay for), or their quality is going down hill.</li>
            <li>ive used many crappy tweezers in my lifetime where i would try to pluck the same hair over and over for several minutes but just couldnt quite get the right &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Not that I dropped my previous pair but reading something like that can make you more aware</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>with the high quality build and precision of these tweezers, plucking eyebrows is now a short, quick pleasure.</li>
            <li>They do tend to be a little sharp, but has great accuracy.</li>
            <li>The product is awesome, to bad</li>
            <li>I had a pair and lost them, so I came right back to replace them.</li>
            <li>Every hair out of line was plucked easily the first time; I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area 3-4 times like I would with my other tweezers.</li>
            <li>so I had no clue where to get a new pair.</li>
            <li>The only tweezers I&#x27;d ever used where cheap ones from Walmart or Target and always thought plucking my eyebrows was such a chore.</li>
            <li>You can tell they are much better quality than other tweezers, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>These tweezers can easily get very short hairs and even dig out ingrown ones, they&#x27;re so sharp.</li>
            <li>These are much sharper than I expected and they work really really well.</li>
            <li>As I said, so far these work well.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit narrower than my old ones</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my 91-year old mother.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable grip, Very sharp with a extremely thin tip allowing for a better grip. .</li>
            <li>They are sharp and the slant is just right.</li>
            <li>After buying three different brands at store (every time I kept spending a bit more) and not being satisfied with any of them because they wouldn&#x27;t pull the thin hairs, I finally decided to try this one (which is half the price from what you pay at stores for this brand).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the age where a few chin hairs really really shouldn&#x27;t be there and these puppies really work well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>After using the very precise tips on these for a few months, I will probably never be content with any other tweezers.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying one at the grocery store for less than half the price and works way better.</li>
            <li>I frequently cut hairs I meant to pull out, especially in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love the thin tweezer edges to grasp the hair with.  </li>
            <li>I bought myself a new pair and gave her my old pink ones...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for eye brows and other tweezing areas.</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy and grab tightly.</li>
            <li>Item was new, tips are sharp, packaging was satisfactory.</li>

            <li> with the high quality build and precision of these tweezers, plucking eyebrows is now a short, quick pleasure.</li>
            <li> They do tend to be a little sharp, but has great accuracy.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, to bad</li>
            <li> I had a pair and lost them, so I came right back to replace them.</li>
            <li> Every hair out of line was plucked easily the first time; I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area 3-4 times like I would with my other tweezers.</li>
            <li> so I had no clue where to get a new pair.</li>
            <li> The only tweezers I&#x27;d ever used where cheap ones from Walmart or Target and always thought plucking my eyebrows was such a chore.</li>
            <li> You can tell they are much better quality than other tweezers, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> These tweezers can easily get very short hairs and even dig out ingrown ones, they&#x27;re so sharp.</li>
            <li> These are much sharper than I expected and they work really really well.</li>
            <li> As I said, so far these work well.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit narrower than my old ones</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 91-year old mother.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable grip, Very sharp with a extremely thin tip allowing for a better grip. .</li>
            <li> They are sharp and the slant is just right.</li>
            <li> After buying three different brands at store (every time I kept spending a bit more) and not being satisfied with any of them because they wouldn&#x27;t pull the thin hairs, I finally decided to try this one (which is half the price from what you pay at stores for this brand).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the age where a few chin hairs really really shouldn&#x27;t be there and these puppies really work well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> After using the very precise tips on these for a few months, I will probably never be content with any other tweezers.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying one at the grocery store for less than half the price and works way better.</li>
            <li> I frequently cut hairs I meant to pull out, especially in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love the thin tweezer edges to grasp the hair with.  </li>
            <li> I bought myself a new pair and gave her my old pink ones...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for eye brows and other tweezing areas.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy and grab tightly.</li>
            <li> Item was new, tips are sharp, packaging was satisfactory.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very sturdy but they usually got the job done.</li>
            <li> I feel they are a little over priced but as far as function</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep them, and use them, I&#x27;m just not thrilled with how much I paid and what I ended up with.</li>
            <li> But who can be without their tweezers for that long?</li>
            <li> Ordered Blue Jewel but received pink.</li>
            <li> only quibble is that the pointy bits are, well, quite sharply pointy.  </li>
            <li> For the longest time I would purchase the cheapest tweezers at the drug store and wonder why I couldn&#x27;t actually pluck my eyebrows without grabbing half of the skin, too.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different kinds over the past couple of years, but they didn&#x27;t grip well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sharp to cut you, but sharp enough to pull even the thinest hairs</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that these would be worth the price, but they definitely are.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the tips are so sharp they do cut hairs quite often, as others had stated in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li> However,  I&#x27;ve had these for several months and the tips are still a little too sharp.  </li>
            <li> I hoped that it would really get those small, hard to grasp hairs.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and grab even the smallest hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other ladies, but I can&#x27;t do without my Tweezerman tweezers.  </li>
            <li> No more struggling to get that short stub of a hair.</li>
            <li> They tend to last me about one year before I have to go and get another one, but I do use them every day so they&#x27;re bound to get dull.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re almost too well-chiseled - that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> But after the newness wore off slightly, they seem to be doing less of that.</li>
            <li> My previous tweezer was about an inch longer than these Tweezerman&#x27;s</li>
            <li> These seem to need less cleaning during use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how badly my previous tweezers worked until I tried these.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> do these get every little one of them.</li>
            <li> Been using these tweezer for approximately two months and my only complaints are</li>
            <li> My mother had bought those when she was young at a random store</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 full-sized Tweezerman tweezers from stores (Sephora, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Ulta, etc) in the past, and this one is unlike any of the previous purchased from stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned quite a few tweezers over the past few years...</li>
            <li> If doing delicate areas like inside the nose, one needs to go slow and careful.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to spring for an expensive tweezer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> No more tweezers losing grip on hairs.</li>
            <li> the mean time I ordered another pair, and they came with a small spoolie brush.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut the hair as some users complained.  </li>
            <li> i just do not like how it feels on the skin, i am never going to buy it at least from this store...</li>
            <li> I got a very small gain for the price.</li>
            <li> I might be addicted.</li>
            <li> I have some Revlon ones also and now if I try those, they feel bumbling and nearly useless.</li>
            <li> but I lost them, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have always had mediocre tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing for the price.  </li>
            <li> Paying $5 or $6 for crappy tweezers is annoying paying $20 is infuriating.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I paid a lot for it, and it doesn&#x27;t work as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Because of that, they will sometimes just break off finer hairs before they&#x27;re pulled out, which can be annoying.</li>

            <li> After using the very precise tips on these for a few months, I will probably never be content with any other tweezers. I have some Revlon ones also and now if I try those, they feel bumbling and nearly useless. These tweezers can easily get very short hairs and even dig out ingrown ones, they&#x27;re so sharp. They&#x27;re almost too well-chiseled - that&#x27;s my only complaint. Because of that, they will sometimes just break off finer hairs before they&#x27;re pulled out, which can be annoying. But after the newness wore off slightly, they seem to be doing less of that.</li>
            <li> I love the thin tweezer edges to grasp the hair with.  They allow you to pull the hair out with much more gripping power,  The pointed end of the tweezer blade allows you to dig out ingrown hairs with ease.  I&#x27;ve never had a more effective and easy to use pair of tweezers than these.  Thanks, Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> well priced and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Ordered a different color than what I received. Item was new, tips are sharp, packaging was satisfactory. Only downside is that the tips are so sharp they do cut hairs quite often, as others had stated in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Color and size are perfect.  However,  I&#x27;ve had these for several months and the tips are still a little too sharp.  I frequently cut hairs I meant to pull out, especially in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These are much sharper than I expected and they work really really well. Highly recommended for eye brows and other tweezing areas.</li>
            <li> As a man who strives to prevent his unibrow from coming to fruition, I appreciate how painless and precise these tweezers are.  Unless you plan on buying several tweezers, you might as well pay for solid ones once - on amazon or at a local store.</li>
            <li> Expensive but work great!</li>
            <li> Very good at first, but after a week was already getting blunt, even though i kept the plastic cap on it whenever not in use.  Disappointing for the price.  Nice color though.</li>
            <li> THIS TWEEZER IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER HAD.  I HAVE HAD MANY OVER THE YEARS.  I RESISTED BUYING TWEEZERMAN TWEEZERS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE---I AM SURE I SPENT WAY MORE ON ALL THE OTHERS I TRIED.  SHOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT TWEEZERMAN!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very precise and work well. I feel they are a little over priced but as far as function I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Been using these tweezer for approximately two months and my only complaints are I wish I had a case for them, also I wish they were an inch longer for a better grip..  I had my last pair of tweezers last me about 15 years and I think that is preety good.  I only realized recently that they lost their \\&quot; springiness \\&quot;.  My previous tweezer was about an inch longer than these Tweezerman&#x27;s but I am getting use to the shorter grip.  I never realized that if you drop tweezers you can damage them, their tips and spring.  Not that I dropped my previous pair but reading something like that can make you more aware and now I am exceedingly more careful.  I suggest taking a chance on these Blue Jewel - I like em.</li>
            <li> No need to compare or read a lot. If you want a good quality tweezers, just go for this, the best so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on the high # of good reviews.  They do work the best of all that I&#x27;ve owned.  These seem to need less cleaning during use.  I&#x27;ve found that most tweezers, if they get moisture on the working end, or even one hair stuck between the pinchers, will not continue to grab more hairs without wiping or blowing off.  Some also are made of metal that bends over time, reducing the pinching ability.  As I said, so far these work well.  I like the choice of colors too.  Got tge turquoise - they are easy to find in my cosmetics box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that the pointy bits are, well, quite sharply pointy.  If doing delicate areas like inside the nose, one needs to go slow and careful.  I would love to find this quality product with rounded pincher ends.  Otherwise, excellent for tweezering.</li>
            <li> BEST TWEEZER YOU CAN BUY! YOU&#x27;LL NEVER REGRET IT. YOU&#x27;LL TWEEZE THINGS YOU NEVER DID BEFORE!</li>
            <li> Yet another pair of great Tweezerman tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;These last a bit over a year until they dulled, will send them into tweezerman to have them sharpened for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time I ordered another pair, and they came with a small spoolie brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many different tweezers I have tried in my 60+ years.  I finally tried tweezerman.  It works first time, every time.  What a breath of fresh air!</li>
            <li> These tweezers pluck out even the smallest hair. I&#x27;ve been tweezing my eyebrows for years. Had been using this ancient pair of tweezers which were amazing but I lost them, unfortunately. My mother had bought those when she was young at a random store so I had no clue where to get a new pair. Thankfully, I came across these. They are a bit narrower than my old ones but they work really well!</li>
            <li> These are a good pair of tweezers.  However, for the price, I don&#x27;t think they are significantly better than my cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers! I just wish they would stay sharper. I think that you can send them in to the company and they&#x27;ll sharpen them for you. But who can be without their tweezers for that long? Is there a way to sharpen them at home? Also, it would be great if it included an extra carrying case.</li>
            <li> I have always had mediocre tweezers.  Paying $5 or $6 for crappy tweezers is annoying paying $20 is infuriating.  These are totally worth it!  They are sharp and grab even the smallest hairs with ease. Plus the color is fun!</li>
            <li> Not the &amp;#34;end all be all&amp;#34; of tweezers that I thought they&#x27;d be.  Especially for the price.  The slant edge is precise, as intended, but if I flip them around to use the point, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any strength to them to grab hairs.  My cheap Revlon tweezers could grab on the edge and on the point.  I&#x27;ll keep them, and use them, I&#x27;m just not thrilled with how much I paid and what I ended up with.</li>
            <li> I have some hairy brows and boy do these get every little one of them. Serisouly, Love this thing. Very sharp and not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 full-sized Tweezerman tweezers from stores (Sephora, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Ulta, etc) in the past, and this one is unlike any of the previous purchased from stores. The weight is noticeably lighter, and the precision is waaay off. I am pretty sure this is either a knock-off, a defective one (you get what you pay for), or their quality is going down hill. Only the middle part of this tweezer is actually picking up any hair, the pointed tip and the back edge do not pick up any hairs. I should have probably just gone to the store and paid full price for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Tweezerman is concerned, the other 5 tweezers I&#x27;ve bought from them (in stores) are amazing! They do tend to be a little sharp, but has great accuracy. They tend to last me about one year before I have to go and get another one, but I do use them every day so they&#x27;re bound to get dull.</li>
            <li> Great. Quality product</li>
            <li> No big deal:  tweezers?  YES.....couldn&#x27;t believe there are awesome tweezers.  These are it!  Didn&#x27;t realize all tweezers weren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I would purchase the cheapest tweezers at the drug store and wonder why I couldn&#x27;t actually pluck my eyebrows without grabbing half of the skin, too. So I decided to splurge on these and I don&#x27;t regret it. The points are so fine that you can grab even the tiniest hair with no problem. Loved them so much that my mom ended up buying a pair for herself.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 91-year old mother.  When I asked if they were satisfactory her reply was that the were the &amp;#34;best ever&amp;#34; tweezer that she&#x27;d ever used.  That&#x27;s about 76 years of product testing. That should be a good enough recommendation.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old, favorite, can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re bent, I&#x27;ve had them forever tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews and decided to splurge on these. It was totally worth it.  They grab everything. They don&#x27;t cut the hair as some users complained.  I&#x27;m at the age where a few chin hairs really really shouldn&#x27;t be there and these puppies really work well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I found</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned quite a few tweezers over the past few years...most of them cheap $2 ones in beauty supply shops. They weren&#x27;t very sturdy but they usually got the job done. NONE of them compare to these tweezers, though! They feel sturdy and are great quality. Along with the Tweezerman scissors, I have the perfect brow. Every hair out of line was plucked easily the first time; I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area 3-4 times like I would with my other tweezers.</li>
            <li> Used them for years and love them. Best tweezers ever. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. This one bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to spring for an expensive tweezer.  I hoped that it would really get those small, hard to grasp hairs.  But it mostly doesn&#x27;t.  I was disappointed that I paid a lot for it, and it doesn&#x27;t work as I had hoped.  I don&#x27;t recommend it. I got a very small gain for the price.</li>
            <li> They are great tweezers, these are not quite as good as my old ones though, thanks Linda- I would recomend</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these tweezers.  I have bought several different kinds over the past couple of years, but they didn&#x27;t grip well.  These are very sturdy and grab tightly.</li>
            <li> My wife bought the same tweezers a couple of years ago and they still work great.Finding facial hair growing wear it never did before, I decided to buy a pair for myself.</li>
            <li> Color exactly as shown. Comfortable grip, Very sharp with a extremely thin tip allowing for a better grip. . Very precise with a nice slant.  Sturdy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other ladies, but I can&#x27;t do without my Tweezerman tweezers.  They work great and the company with sharpen them as much as needed, free!</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the old Revlon tweezer, but the closest I have found</li>
            <li> Best tweezer ever. Always precise. Have had it for more than a year now and it is still not blunt. Totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Ordered Blue Jewel but received pink. The product is awesome, to bad it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a great, precision tweezer but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I ended up buying one at the grocery store for less than half the price and works way better. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have resisted the higher price for Tweezerman, but I&#x27;m delighted with its functionality.  A far, far better product than many other tweezers I&#x27;ve tried, especially good with small eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> After using these tweezers for the first time I was really impressed by how well they work.  Absolutely worth the $20!</li>
            <li> After buying three different brands at store (every time I kept spending a bit more) and not being satisfied with any of them because they wouldn&#x27;t pull the thin hairs, I finally decided to try this one (which is half the price from what you pay at stores for this brand). I love it!!! It&#x27;s not too sharp to cut you, but sharp enough to pull even the thinest hairs</li>
            <li> im a straight man. i pluck my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now that that&#x27;s out of the way, i have nothing but praise for these tweezers. ive used many crappy tweezers in my lifetime where i would try to pluck the same hair over and over for several minutes but just couldnt quite get the right &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but with the high quality build and precision of these tweezers, plucking eyebrows is now a short, quick pleasure.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have my color so they gave me an additional travel size to make up for it. Even if it wasn&#x27;t necessary.  Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Great for the fine women&#x27;s whiskers! A must have for every woman over 40!! A quality product! I bought 5 of them</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive tweezer I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the quality lives up to the price.  This tweezer is good for pulling out not-quite-in or barely-there hairs as well as for pulling out longer, easier to access hair.</li>
            <li> i just do not like how it feels on the skin, i am never going to buy it at least from this store...</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Hand down, the best tweezers I have ever used - can easily grab small eyebrow hairs.  I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman are exactly what I needed. They are sharp and the slant is just right. I have used many tweezers and these have been the best so far. In addition, I love the color. Would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Who&#x27;d have thought life would get easier with good tweezers? Recommended and I&#x27;ll purchase again when I&#x27;ve worn these out.</li>
            <li> These are costly, but worth it.  I had a pair and lost them, so I came right back to replace them.</li>
            <li> The tweezers get every hair, every time.The colors and patterns that are available make them a great gift for friends.</li>
            <li> The only tweezers I&#x27;d ever used where cheap ones from Walmart or Target and always thought plucking my eyebrows was such a chore. These tweezers are GREAT! I love them. They are perfect for eyebrows!</li>
            <li> These make it so much easier to tweeze. I didn&#x27;t realize how badly my previous tweezers worked until I tried these.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> This is a great tweezer.  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  It does the job right! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> They work so well! My absolute fave and I am a big tweezer... I tweeze every day in my magnifying mirror. I might be addicted. I purchased my first pair in the store but my daughter liked using them so much. I bought myself a new pair and gave her my old pink ones... I no longer have to worry about where my tweezers went. Easy to find in my make up drawer. Well made. work great.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows are TAMED.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are comfortable to hold and use. Hairs don&#x27;t slip through them. Blue handles make them easier to find in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> These tweezers surely get the job done! You can tell they are much better quality than other tweezers, especially considering the price. I would definitely recommend to friends, they grab eyebrow hairs easily and pull them out flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that these would be worth the price, but they definitely are. No more tweezers losing grip on hairs. No more struggling to get that short stub of a hair. These worked much better than I had even hoped. Very highly recommended.</li>
