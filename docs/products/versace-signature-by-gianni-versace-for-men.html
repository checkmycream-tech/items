            <li>Nice light smell that doesn&#x27;t over power the room.</li>
            <li>One of the better cologne values on Amazon</li>
            <li>And, I love the scent...  </li>
            <li>This cologne will remain one of my staples for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife bought this cologne for me, and I love it.</li>
            <li>for those of you who say you&#x27;re using 10 sprays or more and still can&#x27;t smell it, two things:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon kindly refunded my money.</li>
            <li>I was complimented on this colonge on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li>Glad to have it in my collection.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>The price for the 3.4oz is awesome you would pay double at a retailer.</li>
            <li>The lid doesn&#x27;t click in place and if you grab it by the top (which a ton of people do I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li>He really enjoyed his cologne</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent that&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but overall it is really good!</li>
            <li>Versace pour homme has a very strong, fresh opening with notes of neroli and other citruses (diamante citron, bergamot) that quickly envelop anyone close by in a delicious aroma.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;Versace&#x27; 3.4 Oz bottle is huge and smells transcending.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear more than one spray and it lasts from 7 am until around 2 or 3 in the afternoon,</li>
            <li>this on is a combination of both clean crisp and a nice a spicy undertone, projects nice and you can smell it on your skin over 24hr, you can shower and still smell it, my new signature scent!</li>
            <li>your odds of ending up alone tonight significantly decrease.</li>
            <li>Similar, but honestly the knockoff is WAAAY better.</li>
            <li>pleased, fragrance pleasing, not over intense.</li>
            <li>The only problem might be that it smells too good.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh and citrusy scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong and will stay with you throughout the day</li>
            <li>price - Quick ship&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell good and lasted long.</li>
            <li>Well First of all I payed 40$ for a 3.4 ounce Cologne, and I received a 1.0 ounce!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s really picky!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for $42 for the large bottle with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is fresh &amp; timeless.</li>
            <li>Its much more inexpensive on amazon and has a masculine smell without being overbearing.</li>
            <li>Keeps me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells like original but doesnt last more than 1 hr..</li>
            <li>Smell good is no fake like other people say</li>
            <li>It is very light and disappear after 5-10 minutes, also color is different ,</li>
            <li>this is a great product I absolutely love smelling my other half in this drives</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The order I received was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s first cologne.</li>
            <li>I researched some generic knockoff cologne I had that I LOVE.</li>
            <li>Love to spray it daily.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have some of the original to compare it to, and it is not the same.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>First off, the color of the cologne is different from the original I had bought before.  </li>
            <li>is a classic cologne for men that will not fail to impress.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this cologne!</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, and my wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>and he really loves it.</li>
            <li>It came so fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adjustment: already refunded thanks Amazon(best online shopping experience)</li>
            <li>Very recommended buy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not smell the real......</li>
            <li>But it seems like its he real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like this spray.  </li>
            <li>This was absolutely a counterfeit cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Versace Pour Homme must be strong and extremely long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Next, the smell is nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin, but I love the scent!</li>
            <li>It has such a clean scent and not over bearing for an 81 year young man.</li>
            <li>This came in a different colored box than what I purchased the last time, so it may not have been exactly what I wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li>Very similar to Chanel&#x27;s Allure Homme Sport at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>I compared it to a sampler I got directly from a department store and</li>
            <li>I saved nearly 40 dollars on the 3.4 EDT compared to a department store, and it was still 20 dollars cheaper than even the 1.7 in a department store.  </li>
            <li>one receives wafts of the citrus top notes while enjoying the intriguing and manly base notes of musk and bean (similar to a vanilla / cinnamon mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, if you look at the labels on the bottom, the real version has a serial number, or authenticity stamp.  </li>
            <li>Dont last whole day</li>
            <li>Very crisp and clean but has a faint floral undertone that makes it one of my favorites...</li>
            <li>The scent was so faint and barely lasted an hour, nothing like the authentic I got from Sephora.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> one receives wafts of the citrus top notes while enjoying the intriguing and manly base notes of musk and bean (similar to a vanilla / cinnamon mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, if you look at the labels on the bottom, the real version has a serial number, or authenticity stamp.  </li>
            <li> Dont last whole day</li>
            <li> Very crisp and clean but has a faint floral undertone that makes it one of my favorites...</li>
            <li> The scent was so faint and barely lasted an hour, nothing like the authentic I got from Sephora.</li>
            <li> The cheapest I found this was for $72 for the large bottle and $57 for the small bottle.  </li>
            <li> scent didnt last as long</li>
            <li> Fragrance stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> when it becomes subtle enough that you can really only smell it if you&#x27;re in my personal space.</li>
            <li> This fragrance exudes \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; through the middle notes as it dries and transitions to notes of germanium and cedar wood - but never overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> Counter to other reviewers, I have yet to receive any complements from anyone while wearing this product.</li>
            <li> If i wanted the little bottle I would of got it at my local store for half of that!</li>
            <li> smell is to weak to last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***As always, use your nose before your wallet and try this out at a local shop; wear the scent for a couple hours (your wrist will do) and see for yourself if you appreciate the complex smells that shift and change as the cologne dries.</li>
            <li> The only reason this is 4 stars is because the bottle design sucks.</li>
            <li> Stop spraying down your clothes.</li>
            <li> It was called Bay of Biscany Black Onyx.</li>
            <li> I mean, do you really want to smell like some virginal teenager trailing a blast of Drakkar twenty feet behind them?</li>
            <li> I also like Versace Dreamer which is a little sweeter smell than the Pour Homme.</li>
            <li> Versace seemed to wear off after few hrs.</li>
            <li> i waste my money.</li>
            <li> either you have an old bottle, or you&#x27;re wearing it wrong.</li>
            <li> A water with a few drops of some fragrance.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other reviews&#x27; warnings, but I took a chance and learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about ordering on line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this colonge again</li>
            <li> My advice, put it on at least 10-15 min before encountering the girls.</li>
            <li> Extremely weak.  </li>
            <li> FAKE product.</li>
            <li> I had an employee who kept coming in my office making up random excuses to come and smell me.</li>
            <li> All the stuff you see about sending you the fake stuff is incorrect</li>
            <li> me crazy don&#x27;t soend 100</li>

            <li> Came out smelling like roses!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price - Quick ship&lt;br /&gt;No hassles with the entire process - Surely&lt;br /&gt;makes it Perfect a perfect gift</li>
            <li> pleased, fragrance pleasing, not over intense.</li>
            <li> Amazing smelling! Fast shipping! I highly recommended this cologne!</li>
            <li> My third VERSACE and they are all excellent! I got the Oud and the Eau Fraiche, this on is a combination of both clean crisp and a nice a spicy undertone, projects nice and you can smell it on your skin over 24hr, you can shower and still smell it, my new signature scent!</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme is a very good fragrance. Stays on all day, and my wife really likes it. I also like Versace Dreamer which is a little sweeter smell than the Pour Homme. Purchase both and you&#x27;ll be good to go for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Very similar to Chanel&#x27;s Allure Homme Sport at a much lower cost.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin, but I love the scent!</li>
            <li> great price for this size of cologne.  husband loves it.</li>
            <li> prefect size. smells so good! I bought it for my BF and he really loves it. He uses it all the time.</li>

            <li> I am awestruck.I will fall for any men with this perfume.its that good.A sure buy anytime! And also I got it for very good price in amazon.</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite cologne - smells incredible. Excellent price - about $30 cheaper than in the department stores.</li>
            <li> The order I received was exactly what I had ordered. It came wrapped up in bubble wrap and was put in an envelope. It came so fast I could not believe it. Very happy with the price and shipment of this item. Would definitely do business again with this business and shipper.  Thanks so much!  Very happy with product. Excellent price for this item compared to retail prices in stores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not genuine.&lt;br /&gt;It is completely different if you compare with same bottle from local Stores.It is very light and disappear after 5-10 minutes, also color is different ,Box made from low quality materials, and very low quality painting.&lt;br /&gt;Versace Pour Homme must be strong and extremely long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy colognes from here again.&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustment: already refunded thanks Amazon(best online shopping experience)</li>
            <li> on time deliver &amp; smells so good</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Versace seemed to wear off after few hrs.</li>
            <li> Price is amazing for this Huge bottle!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s first cologne. A staple moment into manhood!</li>
            <li> Great product as described</li>
            <li> this is my husbands second bottle and we will be ordering another. It has such a clean scent and not over bearing for an 81 year young man. definitely will shop for this item on amazon.com again.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Versace&#x27; 3.4 Oz bottle is huge and smells transcending. Macy&#x27;s charges $82.00 for the same size Amazon charges 39.99 for. The aroma is fresh &amp; timeless. Very recommended buy. Co to the department stores and research yourself. The box malls are dying from the Extreme offers from Amazon!</li>
            <li> FAKE product. Smells like original but doesnt last more than 1 hr..dont buy</li>
            <li> Love this on my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> Its has a wonderful smell, I just wish the smell alot would last longer but overall it is really good!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and my husband loved it.</li>
            <li> scent didnt last as long</li>
            <li> Best price ever love the smell of it on my husband</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not smell the real......i waste my money.</li>
            <li> Smell good and lasted long. I was not sure about ordering on line. But it seems like its he real thing. I got alit of compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful on my husband.</li>
            <li> My favorite! The only problem might be that it smells too good. I had an employee who kept coming in my office making up random excuses to come and smell me. Let&#x27;s just say that 3 years of stalking, a restraining order, and enrolment into witnesses protection later, I have decided to start wearing brute.</li>
            <li> Well First of all I payed 40$ for a 3.4 ounce Cologne, and I received a 1.0 ounce! Very mad. If i wanted the little bottle I would of got it at my local store for half of that! AND TO FINISH IT OFF I THINK ITS FAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> Not as fragrant as the last Versace I got my husband.  This came in a different colored box than what I purchased the last time, so it may not have been exactly what I wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li> Nice light smell that doesn&#x27;t over power the room.</li>
            <li> Legit.  I ordered the ships &amp; sold by Amazon version.  They actually sent me the 3.4 EDT and a 3.4 body shampoo gift pack.  I compared it to a sampler I got directly from a department store and the scent was identical for the EDT.  I have not opened the body shampoo to inspect it (even though Amazon sent it to some others who reviewed this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting the body shampoo anyway...maybe they&#x27;ll just send them until they run out?).  Buying this product from Amazon I saved nearly 40 dollars on the 3.4 EDT compared to a department store, and it was still 20 dollars cheaper than even the 1.7 in a department store.  One of the better cologne values on Amazon I think...  And, I love the scent...  Very crisp and clean but has a faint floral undertone that makes it one of my favorites...</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Always receive comments on pleasant fragrance!</li>
            <li> Versace pour homme has a very strong, fresh opening with notes of neroli and other citruses (diamante citron, bergamot) that quickly envelop anyone close by in a delicious aroma. This fragrance exudes \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; through the middle notes as it dries and transitions to notes of germanium and cedar wood - but never overwhelmingly so. Rather, even as the scent reaches t tonka he end of it&#x27;s life (and it has an amazing longevity -- 5+ hours on me!) one receives wafts of the citrus top notes while enjoying the intriguing and manly base notes of musk and bean (similar to a vanilla / cinnamon mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Versace pour homme is a classic cologne for men that will not fail to impress. It is one of my personal favorites for day-to-day use (as a student this means in both class and work settings) as well as for going out at night. This cologne will remain one of my staples for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***As always, use your nose before your wallet and try this out at a local shop; wear the scent for a couple hours (your wrist will do) and see for yourself if you appreciate the complex smells that shift and change as the cologne dries.***</li>
            <li> My wife bought this cologne for me, and I love it. She was never fond of my Aqua di Gio, but when she smelled this one she immediately said, that&#x27;s the one you should wear. It has all of the notes of the di Gio that I liked, plus some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you who say you&#x27;re using 10 sprays or more and still can&#x27;t smell it, two things: either you have an old bottle, or you&#x27;re wearing it wrong. Stop spraying down your clothes. Cologne needs to be on your skin, preferably on a heat point, like the veins of your wrist or the glands of your neck. I rarely wear more than one spray and it lasts from 7 am until around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, when it becomes subtle enough that you can really only smell it if you&#x27;re in my personal space. I&#x27;m OK with that. I mean, do you really want to smell like some virginal teenager trailing a blast of Drakkar twenty feet behind them?</li>
            <li> It smells good. Light, fresh and citrusy scent.&lt;br /&gt;But smell is to weak to last long. it disappears after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get any compliments at all because nobody have ever noticed that I was wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> Smell good is no fake like other people say</li>
            <li> Not my absolute best pick but very very good for the price. Great refreshing , light scent , not musky or overpowering and Ive been told I still smell great the morning after ;) My advice, put it on at least 10-15 min before encountering the girls. The top chord scent is good itself but strong and you don&#x27;t want to seem overeager. Let it breathe a bit and your odds of ending up alone tonight significantly decrease.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray.  Its much more inexpensive on amazon and has a masculine smell without being overbearing. Try out the smaller spray if you want to just sample.</li>
            <li> My wife really loved the fragrance and she&#x27;s really picky!!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologone after reading a lot of great reviews. I must say, I am not all that impressed by this product. Counter to other reviewers, I have yet to receive any complements from anyone while wearing this product. The smell is pretty strong and will stay with you throughout the day but I don&#x27;t consider the smell itself as &amp;#34;intoxicating&amp;#34; as some reviewers had implied in their reviews. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this colonge again but I would probably not recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very good. It smells really very good. It makes somebody like Man&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely a counterfeit cologne. The scent was so faint and barely lasted an hour, nothing like the authentic I got from Sephora. I should have heeded the other reviews&#x27; warnings, but I took a chance and learned the hard way. Fortunately, Amazon kindly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I was complimented on this colonge on more than one occasion. It smells great and gives that fresh going out smell.</li>
            <li> I researched some generic knockoff cologne I had that I LOVE. Came back to a copy of this. NOT the same. Similar, but honestly the knockoff is WAAAY better. It was called Bay of Biscany Black Onyx. Kceroc or something. Still good though. Glad to have it in my collection.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I love the smell.  The price was great. The cheapest I found this was for $72 for the large bottle and $57 for the small bottle.  I bought this for $42 for the large bottle with free shipping.  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> First off, the color of the cologne is different from the original I had bought before.  The color should be baby blue, not aqua marine.  Next, the smell is nothing like the original.  Luckily I have some of the original to compare it to, and it is not the same. Finally, if you look at the labels on the bottom, the real version has a serial number, or authenticity stamp.  This one does not. Not feeling good about this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Came quick,  Good value</li>
            <li> Amazing product when it comes to &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; fragrances. Love to spray it daily. Dont last whole day but gives a pleasant odor most of the day!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend on his birthday by his specific request. He had already smelled it before. When I smelled it on him I was very happy he has such good taste.</li>
            <li> great smell.  i went to a big department store and it was $20 more expensive for the smaller size.  You cant beat this price for the bigger size.</li>
            <li> The price for the 3.4oz is awesome you would pay double at a retailer. I only use two sprays on my neck and it last me all day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this item because it is good and the package is  amazingly beautiful. And the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> All the stuff you see about sending you the fake stuff is incorrect this is a great product I absolutely love smelling my other half in this drives me crazy don&#x27;t soend 100 but the product here</li>
            <li> The fragrance is amazing. The only reason this is 4 stars is because the bottle design sucks. The lid doesn&#x27;t click in place and if you grab it by the top (which a ton of people do I&#x27;m sure) the bottle will fall to the floor. Mine broke and now I can&#x27;t use the pump anymore. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Very good scent clean and fresh , packaging was good with adequate delivery time .</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments my husband on this cologne</li>
            <li> I have purchased this cologne before in a store and loved it. I was attracted by price for it from this merchant and I decided to go for it. At the end I did get what I paid for. A water with a few drops of some fragrance. Extremely weak.  Don&#x27;t recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> very nice smell. Not over powering</li>
            <li> He really enjoyed his cologne</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne as a gift this December and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the scent. He loves it, too. It has a nice clean scent that&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fragrance stays for a long time. Awesome perfume. Everyone asks about it. Keeps me feeling fresh. One of the best fragrances I have come across.</li>
