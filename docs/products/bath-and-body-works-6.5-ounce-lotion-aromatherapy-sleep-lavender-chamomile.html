            <li>Love to put it on every night before bed.</li>
            <li>This is an okay lotion and scent.</li>
            <li>I CHOSE THIS LOTION BECAUSE I LOVE THE PILLOW MIST AND</li>
            <li>JUST WHEN YOU REALLY LOVE SOMETHING IT DISAPPEARS, OR</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and use multiple lavender scents and this is one of the best out there !!</li>
            <li>its like my sleep is deeper and more restful and comes on quicker when my head hits the pillow...</li>
            <li>I love the product as it calms me at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I wanted to buy it again!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a mildly sweet warm tea.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty, looks nice on a nightstand</li>
            <li>It really helps me sleep and smells do good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know, but it smells good trying.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this lotion because I love lavender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to knock over.</li>
            <li>Prompt shipment, easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>Bath and Body Works has really developed some outstanding scents and this is certainly one of the most pleasant.</li>
            <li>It was a great price and will very likely buy it again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Great product, however I will probably buy the plastic bottle in the future.</li>
            <li>free to email anytime</li>
            <li>Vibrant smell, swear I slept better!</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of hydrating my hands, way better than some of the other Bath &amp; Body Works lotions.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this fragrance from B&amp;BW  </li>
            <li>Not only does this smell wonderful, but it agrees with my skin, leaving my arms and legs feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I really believe it helps me to produce more relaxing sleep.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Just like every other company that has a great selling product, it cheapens over time while the price goes up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sometimes able to sleep more deeply after applying this lotion to my feet.</li>
            <li>But after I started using it, I realized I think it&#x27;s fragrance does have a mild therapeutic effect on me as I drift off.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell, love the texture of the lotion&lt;br /&gt;Had to wait a LONG time for delivery, though...</li>
            <li>is enough to make you feel ready for a pleasant sleep.</li>
            <li>This was pretty good, but I made one WAY WAY more powerful in five minutes for literally a quarter of the cost using Young Living essential</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been curious if the others smells that good too.</li>
            <li>It is soothing to use the aromatherapy of this lotion right before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and actually helps relax me.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it is magical.</li>
            <li>I took a shower the first night, put the lotion on, and was getting compliments at work the day after from every one.</li>
            <li>This one can only be placed on a counter, in a safe location.</li>
            <li>This really does help me sleep!</li>
            <li>a few years ago &amp; Loved it.</li>
            <li>Love the product but took a long time to recieve it</li>
            <li>The lotion had very few ingredients and he essential oils were near the top and as good as a homemade one I could blend at home.</li>
            <li>It is not only a terrific moisturizer, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It is really soothing and helps me go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Put it on after shower and feel really relaxed.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample bottle and really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, but the pump would not work.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>I have the whole Sleep Lavender-Chamomile collection (body mist, lotion, body wash, and linen spray).</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Amazon comes thru again.my wife really loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Really relaxing and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This body lotion pairs very well with the Aromatherapy body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to every woman.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this product.</li>
            <li>i really like my aromatherapy sleep lavender chamonmile body lotion.</li>
            <li>This came in a big blue glass bottle that presents itself nicely in my guest bath.</li>
            <li>I like other smells better than this.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this &amp;#34;Sleep&amp;#34; aromatherapy because it can be calming and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Love the heavy glass packaging too üëç</li>
            <li>yada yada yada, new product application</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t tell that this lotion makes any difference in quality or quantity of sleep, but at least it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I am almost positive it is a Pavlovian effect since I only use this lotion at night.</li>
            <li>The first bottle of this lotion was given to me as a gift, and I let it sit on a shelf for a long time before using it.</li>
            <li>all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this lotion smells like an artificial scent, it is barely noticeable and a great dissapointment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too sweet</li>
            <li>my back is really itchy now and its not fun.</li>
            <li>and it really does make falling asleep a little easier.</li>

            <li> and it really does make falling asleep a little easier.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it on her arms and legs, and after working or fishing outdoors on a long sunny day, I use it on my arms as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be purchasing other bath and body aromatherapy lotions.</li>
            <li> Normally no assistance needed, but this particular night, things were a little less humid than usual, there was the bottle of Sleep, and</li>
            <li> Makes me extremely sleepy after applying.</li>
            <li> I take turns buying that and Black Currant Vanilla.</li>
            <li> I wish it was slightly stronger</li>
            <li> This scent has a few layers to it.</li>
            <li> I often have trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the that the pump arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> Broken pump is why I give this only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Is lavender chamomile and a very little product</li>
            <li> Then today, I noticed at about 3:00 pm there were tons of small bumps on my chest.</li>
            <li> The black part where the lotion comes out when pumped was broken.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before bedtime, rubbing a little on my temples and some behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> but I think I might be addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find the pump head was broken into pieces when it arrived, despite it was wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>

            <li> Christmas present for Mom. She really loved it. Got it to help relieve stress.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and actually helps relax me. I am almost positive it is a Pavlovian effect since I only use this lotion at night. It was a great price and will very likely buy it again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of lavender.  And this is a lovely one.  It relaxes me at night.</li>
            <li> So, my mom got this for Christmas, not from amazon though. I tried it last night for aromatherapy and put it on my face and neck. Then today, I noticed at about 3:00 pm there were tons of small bumps on my chest. I just now saw that the bumps are even bigger and they spread all over my stomach and back. Also my shoulders and arms. my back is really itchy now and its not fun. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I use it every night on my arms as I go to bed.  It is really soothing and helps me go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I love it just what I ordered. Put it on after shower and feel really relaxed. I take turns buying that and Black Currant Vanilla. Sincerely Nancy Miles.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample bottle and really like the scent.It is creamy and is not greasy so it doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing. I have received many complimemts. It absorbs into skin, not greasy at all. The bottle is very pretty, looks nice on a nightstand</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> Love the product but took a long time to recieve it</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple years ago at B&amp;BW. Loved it so much that I wanted to buy it again! Smells amazing and does&#x27;t leave skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this lotion. It is soothing to use the aromatherapy of this lotion right before I go to sleep. I am sometimes able to sleep more deeply after applying this lotion to my feet. The first bottle of this lotion was given to me as a gift, and I let it sit on a shelf for a long time before using it. But after I started using it, I realized I think it&#x27;s fragrance does have a mild therapeutic effect on me as I drift off.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this lotion because I love lavender. It smells very nice and is really light. I wish it was slightly stronger so I can smell it in the air. It was delivered fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t tell that this lotion makes any difference in quality or quantity of sleep, but at least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but the pump would not work.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing else like it. At the end of every night I like to pamper myself by massaging Bath and Body Works Lavender and Chamomile lotion onto my feet and what a treat it is.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Just wish they have it a larger size üòÉ</li>
            <li> I received one as a gift. I liked it so much I bought this one as a birthday gift for someone else. Soothing and silky feel...non-greasy..excellent aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I looked every where online for a description of what this smells like. I had never smelled it before nor have I bought any products from bath and body works. It reminds me of a mildly sweet warm tea. This scent has a few layers to it. Simply put, it is magical. I took a shower the first night, put the lotion on, and was getting compliments at work the day after from every one. Love this stuff. I was worried the scent would be over powering but I think I might be addicted to it. Definitely will be purchasing other bath and body aromatherapy lotions. #newtotheparty</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and it does a great job of hydrating my hands, way better than some of the other Bath &amp; Body Works lotions.</li>
            <li> Favorite smell, wonderful lotion! Would love to give these as gifts, as I don&#x27;t know who wouldn&#x27;t love this product.</li>
            <li> So calming and soothing. Smells amazing. I have the whole Sleep Lavender-Chamomile collection (body mist, lotion, body wash, and linen spray). I usually only wear it at home before I go to bed and it really does make falling asleep a little easier. Very relaxing and pleasant fragrance. Definitely a favorite! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love the pleasing aroma of the Sleep Lavender Chamomile body lotion. My wife uses it on her arms and legs, and after working or fishing outdoors on a long sunny day, I use it on my arms as well. Bath and Body Works has really developed some outstanding scents and this is certainly one of the most pleasant. Bath Body Works Aromatherapy Sleep Lavender Chamomile 6.5 oz Body Lotion</li>
            <li> When the wife&#x27;s happy we are all happy!!! Fast delivery. Amazon comes thru again.my wife really loves this stuff.I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion. Really relaxing and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... smells soo goood</li>
            <li> Love this. It really helps me sleep and smells do good. Love to put it on every night before bed.</li>
            <li> husband loves these lotions</li>
            <li> This is an amazing lotion. It is not only a terrific moisturizer, it smells amazing. My entire family loves the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Geneen</li>
            <li> This is an okay lotion and scent. However I gave it one star because it is a TOTALLY different formula than it was 10 years ago when I use to buy it regularly. Just like every other company that has a great selling product, it cheapens over time while the price goes up.&lt;br /&gt;It use to be packaged in a old-fashioned pharmaceutical looking glass bottle - ones I use to keep and re-use. The formula was of essential oil therapeutic grade. The lotion had very few ingredients and he essential oils were near the top and as good as a homemade one I could blend at home. The scent would last all day and night and I use to get compliments on it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this lotion smells like an artificial scent, it is barely noticeable and a great dissapointment.</li>
            <li> This came in a big blue glass bottle that presents itself nicely in my guest bath. Smells wonderful and is a very high quality lotion. Does it help you sleep? I don&#x27;t really know, but it smells good trying. I may buy the rest of the collection.</li>
            <li> Great product, however I will probably buy the plastic bottle in the future. This one can only be placed on a counter, in a safe location. It&#x27;s too easy to knock over. Not for high-traffic areas.</li>
            <li> This really does help me sleep!</li>
            <li> I already have the Stress Relief Vanilla Verbena Body Lotion of this brand and since the cream smells so freakin&#x27; good, I&#x27;ve been curious if the others smells that good too. So I had to try a different one. This body lotion is like a dream. I can&#x27;t believe how good is the smell. Is lavender chamomile and a very little product is enough to make you feel ready for a pleasant sleep. I definitely want to try the Pillow Mist with this same scent.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipment, easy transaction.  I particularly like this &amp;#34;Sleep&amp;#34; aromatherapy because it can be calming and relaxing.  I use it every night before bedtime, rubbing a little on my temples and some behind my ears.  The remainder I put on my neck and hands and take a deep breathe.  I really believe it helps me to produce more relaxing sleep.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE THIS LOTION BECAUSE I LOVE THE PILLOW MIST AND THE 3-WICK CANDLES IN THE SAME SCENT (I CAN&#x27;T FIND THE CANDLES ANYMORE)...JUST WHEN YOU REALLY LOVE SOMETHING IT DISAPPEARS, OR THEY STOP MAKING IT!</li>
            <li> Love it. Wonderful atoma.</li>
            <li> i love the smell can&#x27;t say that it puts me to sleep lol</li>
            <li> Vibrant smell, swear I slept better! (Could be just a &amp;#34;mind&amp;#34; thing with the lavender and chamomile, but a lot&lt;br /&gt;of fragrance.) Bath and Body products are a great product.</li>
            <li> This body lotion pairs very well with the Aromatherapy body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to every woman.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and use multiple lavender scents and this is one of the best out there !! All the lavender scented fragrances from Bath and Body Works are perfectly suited to calm and relax your mind, spirit body  !</li>
            <li> This was pretty good, but I made one WAY WAY more powerful in five minutes for literally a quarter of the cost using Young Living essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to email anytime and I can tell you how to get them for 24% off from the site. mrs.tiffanyward@gmail.com</li>
            <li> helps me sleep like a baby... its like my sleep is deeper and more restful and comes on quicker when my head hits the pillow... I wake up refreshed everytime... its like a mini spa day in my house...very soothing!</li>
            <li> I often have trouble sleeping. I keep my bottle of Sleep on my night table, and one night, tossing and turning, I thought I&#x27;d try &amp;#34;releasing some endorphins&amp;#34; to facilitate my date with Morpheus. Normally no assistance needed, but this particular night, things were a little less humid than usual, there was the bottle of Sleep, and yada yada yada, new product application discovered.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, maybe you are wondering about any burning sensation; not all lotions are equally acceptable downtown. Jalape-no! Sleep is warm but not too much.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a &amp;#34;more relaxed slumber&amp;#34; is at your lavender-scented fingertips.</li>
            <li> i really like my aromatherapy sleep lavender chamonmile body lotion. i will tell all my friends about it. thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great gift for a friend the prego friend of mine who ... said it works great when you are just trying to get some sleep</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this fragrance from B&amp;BW  a few years ago &amp; Loved it. Sadly when I went to get more the store was not carrying it, so was thrilled to see it on here &amp; for a good price.</li>
            <li> I adore it!  Makes me extremely sleepy after applying.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough! Smells amazing and I started using it during the day and not just before bed- lots of compliments. Would buy by the gallon if I could.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell, love the texture of the lotion&lt;br /&gt;Had to wait a LONG time for delivery, though...</li>
            <li> I love the product as it calms me at the end of the day.  The only issue I have is the that the pump arrived broken.  The black part where the lotion comes out when pumped was broken.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is relaxing.  The lotion feels nice and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Not only does this smell wonderful, but it agrees with my skin, leaving my arms and legs feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent.  It feels nice on my skin, creamy not greasy.  I was disappointed to find the pump head was broken into pieces when it arrived, despite it was wrapped in bubble wrap.  Broken pump is why I give this only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great, feel creamy. Love the heavy glass packaging too üëç</li>
