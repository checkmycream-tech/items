    <ol>
            <li>(it can make your head spin) and see which ones customers thought were the best.</li>
            <li>These are the best disposable razors I have found.  </li>
            <li>These are the BEST razors!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s probably the best indicator of what she thinks about them.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy we can get them via Amazon subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from Amazon because they offered a great deal with save and subscribe and an online coupon.</li>
            <li>So happy I found these here.  </li>
            <li>ORDER AGAIN AS NEEDED GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>I bought these quite awhile again and they work great.</li>
            <li>While the razors are great.</li>
            <li>These razors are really good.  </li>
            <li>And the price is good too.</li>
            <li>I bought these for myself and my daughter and we are very pleased with the way they work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for two-three years now, and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>This company is kind of misleading when it says 8 count pack of 2, I received 1 8 count.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll just give you a good, clean shave, and that&#x27;s all most of us need.</li>
            <li>I ordered this by mistake as I&#x27;ve used them before but find the blades are much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many types of razors over the years, and my biggest issue is always nicks.  </li>
            <li>The price is much better here than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>AND PRODUCT IS BETTER</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Glad I can still get these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought these razors through subscribe and save because I needed to try something new and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>These razors are great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They are the most comfortable in my hand of any razor I have tried.  </li>
            <li>They were easy to use.</li>
            <li>I tend to use it with Gillette&#x27;s Moisturizing Shave Gel, but Skintimate works fine,</li>
            <li>It work as intended leaves my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>These razors are no longer available in any store in my community.</li>
            <li>They have demonstrated a good service life which pleases her; she has used her present razor about 12 times and is still satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the wonders of the Internet, I was able to research all of the razors out there</li>
            <li>and/or only last of a couple of shaves before losing it&#x27;s best shaving edge.</li>
            <li>First they are comfortable to hold; she uses them in the shower to shave her legs and stores them in between use on the soap dish.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li>But I ended up learning that these are so smooth and gentle on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, and I will be purchasing these again when I run out.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s pleased with the results provided by these razors and they are far superior to the cheaper disposable razors she&#x27;s bought on occasion when store inventories were down.</li>
            <li>If you take care of them right</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors also seem to be quite durable, provided you keep them in a place where the razor can dry nicely after your shower or bath.</li>
            <li>Really close shave!</li>
            <li>The razors are pretty, but are bulky.</li>
            <li>She told me she would like to get more of these when her present supply runs out</li>
            <li>These razors work well and are very affordable.</li>
            <li>We get a nice close shave, but the problem is, the guys like them too, so it&#x27;s hard to keep them on hand.  </li>
            <li>These are more on the expensive side but very well worth it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue buying these, for the price, but especially for the clean, blood-free shave.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough that my teenage daughters haven&#x27;t complained one bit and I loved them.</li>
            <li>I have lost possibly 2 pounds of skin since I bought these, arguably a positive.</li>
            <li>I guess I am old fashioned and like the thinner handles.</li>
            <li>The three Targets near me stopped selling them</li>
            <li>As you can tell I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have never been missing so much skin on my body as I am right now.</li>
            <li>I am pretty upset that that this is marked as 8-count (pack of 2) indicating that I should receive 16 total razors; I only received 1 package.  </li>
            <li>These are great razors, cut the hair close to the skin without cutting it, and each lasts several weeks.</li>
            <li>I dont like not sharp and give me rash whot?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the shave is similar to other higher end disposable razors</li>
            <li>With other razors I get a much closer cut and don&#x27;t have to shave that often.</li>
            <li>Goes dull pretty fast but wide blades</li>
            <li>I rarely get razor burn and hardly ever nick myself.</li>

            <li> I learned to do that after leaving my shaver in the shower at hotels a few times.</li>
            <li> These last approximately two weeks, shaving my underarms and legs two-three times a week.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re one of the few disposable razors marketed for women that truly seem to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get quite a few uses out of them.</li>
            <li> these razors seem to have been designed to massacre small animals and unassuming lady parts.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I dont like not sharp and give me rash whot?</li>
            <li> These are the the worst razors I have ever used. They are so sharp you constantly cut yourself. They&#x27;re painful to use and I&#x27;m never buying these again. I&#x27;ll stick to my Venus razors.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and my daughter and we are very pleased with the way they work.  We get a nice close shave, but the problem is, the guys like them too, so it&#x27;s hard to keep them on hand.  I&#x27;m happy we can get them via Amazon subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> These razors work well and are very affordable. Some of the more expensive ones with replaceable blades don&#x27;t work as well as these.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake as I&#x27;ve used them before but find the blades are much better.  I used a replaceable blade shaver so I try to buy the blades to go with it, which are cheaper on Amazon.com.  Anyway, I sent these back because I still have a few of them that I use for travel and can just throw away.  I learned to do that after leaving my shaver in the shower at hotels a few times.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use anything else. These are more on the expensive side but very well worth it. Close shave.. And not once have I cut myself with these. Will use a different disposable razor and can guarantee I&#x27;m coming out with at least 2 cuts. I recommend these to everyone! Even random Ppl in the razor isle.</li>
            <li> I have used all of the Venus Razors, Mach, etc. They are extremely expensive to maintain over the long term, because of the replacement cartridges. And I&#x27;ve never found a brand that didn&#x27;t nick me, give me razor burn and/or only last of a couple of shaves before losing it&#x27;s best shaving edge. Fed up, I started to look at disposable razors, though I&#x27;d always been told they were inferior. Not so. Thanks to the wonders of the Internet, I was able to research all of the razors out there (it can make your head spin) and see which ones customers thought were the best. These were it, disposable or not, in garnering the highest approval rating. I&#x27;ve been using them for two-three years now, and I&#x27;m very pleased. I rarely get razor burn and hardly ever nick myself. I tend to use it with Gillette&#x27;s Moisturizing Shave Gel, but Skintimate works fine, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors also seem to be quite durable, provided you keep them in a place where the razor can dry nicely after your shower or bath. These last approximately two weeks, shaving my underarms and legs two-three times a week. This has to be changed weekly for my boyfriend, who uses one (kept separate from mine) to shave his face every day- he could care less that they&#x27;re lavender in color, because they work so well for him. And so a package of eight keeps me going for about six weeks- if it was just me, they&#x27;d stick around at least two months. I am hoping and praying that they never discontinue these. They&#x27;re one of the few disposable razors marketed for women that truly seem to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t get any fancy place to hang your razor with this, false promises of tons of moisture being seaped into your skin (though used properly, these aren&#x27;t irritating or drying) and they aren&#x27;t in hyped-up packaging. They&#x27;ll just give you a good, clean shave, and that&#x27;s all most of us need. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> These are the best disposable razors I have found.  Really close shave!</li>
            <li> These are the BEST razors!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon because they offered a great deal with save and subscribe and an online coupon. The razors are pretty, but are bulky. I guess I am old fashioned and like the thinner handles. With other razors I get a much closer cut and don&#x27;t have to shave that often. With these I have to shave twice as often. I cancelled the subscribe and save as I don&#x27;t want these again.</li>
            <li> So happy I found these here.  The three Targets near me stopped selling them and I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> These were ordered for my wife so I&#x27;ve let her tell me what she thinks about them. First they are comfortable to hold; she uses them in the shower to shave her legs and stores them in between use on the soap dish. They have demonstrated a good service life which pleases her; she has used her present razor about 12 times and is still satisfied with the results. She looked for instructions on the container about repeated usage but couldn&#x27;t find any specific suggestion about usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is similar to other higher end disposable razors she&#x27;s used and on balance she&#x27;s pleased with the results provided by these razors and they are far superior to the cheaper disposable razors she&#x27;s bought on occasion when store inventories were down. She told me she would like to get more of these when her present supply runs out and that&#x27;s probably the best indicator of what she thinks about them.</li>
            <li> These razors are really good.  I&#x27;ve used so many types of razors over the years, and my biggest issue is always nicks.  The last razors I used (Bic Soleil) would tear my legs up.  I bought these razors through subscribe and save because I needed to try something new and the price was great.  But I ended up learning that these are so smooth and gentle on my legs.  I have been using these razors for a month (using each razor about 2 weeks), and I have not had a single nick or a single drop of blood run down my leg.  I will definitely continue buying these, for the price, but especially for the clean, blood-free shave.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough that my teenage daughters haven&#x27;t complained one bit and I loved them. The price is much better here than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Tossing these. They only shave well the very first shave and even then I end up cutting myself. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again. Sticking to the schick quattros!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT deal. 16 razors for $26? Sign me up! These are great razors, cut the hair close to the skin without cutting it, and each lasts several weeks. Definitely worth the money, and I will be purchasing these again when I run out.</li>
            <li> It work as intended leaves my legs smooth. Very sharp so don&#x27;t have to go over it again</li>
            <li> I am pretty upset that that this is marked as 8-count (pack of 2) indicating that I should receive 16 total razors; I only received 1 package.  What a rip off for 22 dollars!</li>
            <li> Goes dull pretty fast but wide blades</li>
            <li> I am totally blind and when I got the razors I immediately realized I had purchased the wrong ones, but I said to myself, &amp;#34;Well, you made the purchase now you need to use them.&amp;#34; But when I used one of them I really liked them. I like these because they didn&#x27;t cut you if you accidentally pressed too hard. They were easy to use. Keep making them and I will be buying them.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite razor. I was having trouble with shaving bumps with other razors. These razors are great for sensitive skin. They also give a close shave; they have lasted longer than expected for a disposable razor, as well.</li>
            <li> This company is kind of misleading when it says 8 count pack of 2, I received 1 8 count. If it says 2 packs it should be 16</li>
            <li> I have never been missing so much skin on my body as I am right now. Why you ask?&lt;br /&gt;Well these razors seem to have been designed to massacre small animals and unassuming lady parts. I have lost possibly 2 pounds of skin since I bought these, arguably a positive.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE WILL PROBABLY ORDER AGAIN AS NEEDED GREAT PRICE AND PRODUCT IS BETTER THAN STATED I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY SKIN BURNING AND NICKS WITH OTHER PRODUCTS NOT SO WITH THESE. I HAVE TO SHAVE MY FACE AS A WOMAN IT IS EMBARASSING BUT NOT IF NOT SHAVED OFF. SO GLAD I FOUND THESE</li>
            <li> I bought these quite awhile again and they work great. If you take care of them right you get quite a few uses out of them. As you can tell I have sensitive skin so I try not to cut my self.</li>
            <li> While the razors are great. The offer is misleading. It is advertise as two 8 packs, which would equal to 16 razors. It is not 16 razors, it is 8 razors. So it actual, 4 razors in an 8 count pack. For 20 dollars, that an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> These shave well and do not irritate.They are the most comfortable in my hand of any razor I have tried.  I like the aloe strip and it has no scent or allergy. These razors are no longer available in any store in my community. The only places still carrying the razor only carry the \\&quot;Hawaiian Tropic\\&quot; version which I cannot use for sensitivities. Glad I can still get these on Amazon. And the price is good too.</li>
