    <ol>
            <li>They are perfect!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s everything needed for flawless application.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, I use all the brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these brushes!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice and portable brush set.</li>
            <li>they are a perfect fit for the bag, my face and hands too!</li>
            <li>But they work fine for me, and they&#x27;re a great value for the price!</li>
            <li>Brushes are the perfect size to fit into purse/backpack.  </li>
            <li>They are now the nicest brushes I own, for a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these brushes they work great..</li>
            <li>Overall they are a great &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; find :D</li>
            <li>Price is nice though.</li>
            <li>Soft, and perfect sized.  </li>
            <li>ok I got this for Christmas for a friend</li>
            <li>This item was just okay to me.</li>
            <li>I love the price, I love the quality.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk on buying them.</li>
            <li>For the most part I like 3 out of the 4 brushes.</li>
            <li>The other three brushes have awesome hairs and the handles are so nice.</li>
            <li>Although, the stippling brush is low-grade, it can easily be overlooked by the luxurious feel of the others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product, for basic make up, and for those who don&#x60;t know very much about makeup</li>
            <li>I enjoy the mini size of them because they fit easily in the side pockets of my purse.</li>
            <li>I got these for touch-ups hoping they would fit in my go-to bag...</li>
            <li>These are amasingly soft brushes (almost as soft as my best set of brushes) and are a huge help when using bronzer.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product  to anyone because its great for travel size.</li>
            <li>She says that it is as good or better than the ones she bought at a local beauty supply place.  </li>
            <li>These brushes don&#x27;t seem like anything very special, they&#x27;re my first makeup brushes</li>
            <li>Overall a a good brush.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>really great, and they fit in a little purse!</li>
            <li>Contrary to most shadow brushes this one is way too thick, it&#x27;s okay for applying color to the outer V if you&#x27;re going to blend it afterward but for precise control with your shadow I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>I ordered this little set of brushes after reading another review that they were good quality.</li>
            <li>really, it&#x27;s what you need!</li>
            <li>her first</li>
            <li>It was my very first stippling brush and none other seems to be able to replace it.</li>
            <li>the rest of the brushes work very good except for the larger one it sheds and its really bothersome to be taking off the little hairs off someones face</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.</li>
            <li>These brushes are sturdy and very durable.</li>
            <li>They fit in my tiny cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and was properly packed.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft on my face and they work really well.</li>
            <li>but I wanted smaller brushes that fit the makeup I am currently using.  </li>
            <li>They are just the right size to be convenient to use and large enough to do the job properly.  </li>
            <li>the big whit  brush shades allot and also very scratchy</li>
            <li>This is not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft against my skin.</li>
            <li>They dry quickly after being washed and become soft and pliable within a short time.</li>
            <li>They do shed more than my hundred dollar set of brush and a lot less than other &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; sets of brushes.</li>
            <li>So not worth it, invest in something better the hairs fall out of the brushes so its not a good application and the eyeshadow brush is a poor excuse its horrible its best just to pay more for a better set of brushes.</li>
            <li>They are also small enough to fit in an overnight bag.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried by their name that the handles of the brushes would be too short to use with ease, no trouble there.</li>
            <li>and so far have only used the foundation brush</li>
            <li>It was fine for her but packing was broken (the case it came in) and did not seem practical.</li>

            <li> It was fine for her but packing was broken (the case it came in) and did not seem practical.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit perfectly in a small makeup bag or a small purse.</li>
            <li> I do not like to carry a full sized brush as I have started using a small crossbody purse for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is a lot larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this takes away from the quality of the brush and it will probably only last for a little while anyway.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fluffy and well made but the small brushes are too large to do eyes or brows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was also must faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have brushes from other makeup</li>
            <li> Other than that one lil boo boo I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the shadow brush.</li>
            <li> Handle is no longer than a mascara wand; so the bristles won&#x27;t be damaged if carried in a small makeup bag that zips closed.  </li>
            <li> and it does shed a little</li>
            <li> For the prices of these brushes I was a little worried</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to apply a thin line of shadow over eyeliner, try adding another smaller bristle brush to this set.  </li>
            <li> The blush brush is too stiff for blush application</li>
            <li> they are very small and didn&#x27;t show how small they were  </li>
            <li> Also, they are not metallic or fake looking like other low-end brush brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are small!</li>
            <li> (the application looks fake to me) but the other ones are still with me and have stood the test of wear and time.</li>
            <li> But very thickly packed bristles!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product, for basic make up, and for those who don&#x60;t know very much about makeup it&#x27;s a every day tool</li>
            <li> They are perfect!! really, it&#x27;s what you need! One for the blush, foundation, concealer and eyeshadow!! really great, and they fit in a little purse!</li>
            <li> ok I got this for Christmas for a friend but im probly not gonna give it o her first they are very small and didn&#x27;t show how small they were  the big whit  brush shades allot and also very scratchy</li>

            <li> Son perfectas, me encanta esta marca por ser econ&amp;oacute;mica y de muy buena calidad, muy practico el tama&amp;ntilde;o para llevarlas a todos lados en tu bolsa de mano, excelente producto!</li>
            <li> the rest of the brushes work very good except for the larger one it sheds and its really bothersome to be taking off the little hairs off someones face</li>
            <li> The brushes are fluffy and well made but the small brushes are too large to do eyes or brows. Price is nice though.</li>
            <li> Soft, and perfect sized.  Very reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> I do not like to carry a full sized brush as I have started using a small crossbody purse for everyday use. These brushes fit perfectly in a small makeup bag or a small purse. I washed them when I got them and so far have only used the foundation brush and it does shed a little but this is what I&#x27;ve come to be used to with cheaper brushes. I don&#x27;t think this takes away from the quality of the brush and it will probably only last for a little while anyway. Overall a a good brush.</li>
            <li> This item was just okay to me. I would have sent it back, but I gave it to my seven yo to use. It was fine for her but packing was broken (the case it came in) and did not seem practical.</li>

            <li> My wife loves this brush set.  She says that it is as good or better than the ones she bought at a local beauty supply place.  Delivery was quick and was properly packed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes!! They are just the right size to be convenient to use and large enough to do the job properly.  They dry quickly after being washed and become soft and pliable within a short time. They are also small enough to fit in an overnight bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice and portable brush set. Carry it with me evrywer I go. The brushes are really soft on my face and they work really well.</li>
            <li> Got this set for Christmas.  It works well with my mineral makeup.  I have brushes from other makeup but I wanted smaller brushes that fit the makeup I am currently using.  I recommend them to anyone who likes mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I use all the brushes. I love the price, I love the quality. Although, the stippling brush is low-grade, it can easily be overlooked by the luxurious feel of the others. The other three brushes have awesome hairs and the handles are so nice. Also, they are not metallic or fake looking like other low-end brush brands. I feel every girl who&#x27;s into doing their makeup on the go should press the \\&quot;place order now\\&quot; button. This is not a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they work great.. I would definitely recommend this product  to anyone because its great for travel size.</li>

The blush brush is too stiff for blush application (the application looks fake to me) but the other ones are still with me and have stood the test of wear and time. About this time, the stippling brush is beginning to shed but it&#x27;s giving all it&#x27;s got up till this day. It was my very first stippling brush and none other seems to be able to replace it.</li>
            <li> So not worth it, invest in something better the hairs fall out of the brushes so its not a good application and the eyeshadow brush is a poor excuse its horrible its best just to pay more for a better set of brushes.</li>
