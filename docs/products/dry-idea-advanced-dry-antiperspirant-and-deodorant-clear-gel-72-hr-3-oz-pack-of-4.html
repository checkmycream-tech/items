            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this deoderant!  </li>
            <li>The best Antiperspirant around</li>
            <li>, how great.</li>
            <li>Great product that we have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Great Product...</li>
            <li>great buy</li>
            <li>Great anti-perspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s unscented, it smells like nothing in a good way.</li>
            <li>Great product which I have been using for more than 20 years</li>
            <li>It lasts for more than 24 hours, which is great for most of us.  </li>
            <li>Will not use another kind of deodorant unless they come out with a scented one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need at a great price</li>
            <li>I tried this product when my retailer stopped carrying my favorite unscented, hypo-allergenic deodorant (Almay)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Use this all the time and love the unscented.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for...</li>
            <li>However, like most roll-ons, you have to be sure to spin the roller, to get the liquid deodorant onto the roller, before applying.</li>
            <li>So I came on here for a better deal.</li>
            <li>sure that will be without issue.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said?</li>

            <li>I have skipped a day or 2 and found the product is effective for the full 72 hours as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Dry Idea because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, and it&#x27;s working great for me!  </li>

            <li>First it was just in the bedroom, or so I thought.</li>
            <li>For years I tried many different deoderants, but nothing changed.  </li>
            <li>deodorant had a very noticeable chemical smell when first applied.</li>
            <li>In the case of Dry Idea, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; does not mean scent free, just perfume free.</li>
            <li>Good stuff - hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>plus it didn&#x27;t ooze out as much if I threw it in a gym bag</li>

            <li>.. fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work for me or my son.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Almay Sensitive Skin Fragrance Free Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dry flaky patches under my arms since high school (more than 15 years ago).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only deodorant my husband or adult son will use and the drugstore was out, didn&#x27;t know I could easily order and have it sent on Amazon</li>
            <li>About 20 minutes after applying, I put on a black tank top, then changed my mind and took it off.</li>
            <li>I also began to notice that I felt healthier and my energy level had returned to normal.</li>
            <li>The Dry Idea clear gel has a pretty strong chemical scent to it, an astringent smell similar to alcohol.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe I was just especially smelly that day, so I stuck it out for close to three week, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>I like the clear becasue</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>

            <li>It went on smoothly, dried quickly and did not cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>As it happens, I have found no other deodorant that meets those criteria.</li>
            <li>a year and a half ago I got the idea to try going without deoderant since it was winter, and my skin cleared right up.  </li>
            <li>After buying Dry Idea Advanced Dry Invisible Solid, Unscented, from an Amazon seller and finding out it had been discontinued and the one I received was a few years old, I decided to buy this product, Dry Idea Advanced Dry Unscented Clear Gel, from a local store</li>
            <li>No dry skin and no wetness!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant my husband or adult son will use and the drugstore was out, didn&#x27;t know I could easily order and have it sent on Amazon, how great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Almay Sensitive Skin Fragrance Free Clear Gel. They recently changed the container so I&#x27;ve been checking out alternatives. I am totally fine with the Almay product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dry Idea flunked badly. I definitely could see a white sheen where I applied it. About 20 minutes after applying, I put on a black tank top, then changed my mind and took it off. There were white marks all over the tank top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant had a very noticeable chemical smell when first applied. Sometimes my morning routine gets interrupted and with the Almay, it&#x27;s really hard to figure out whether I&#x27;ve put deodorant on or not (I&#x27;m not a morning person so I&#x27;m on automatic). Would never have that problem with Dry Idea, if the whiteness isn&#x27;t obvious enough, the smell is obvious for at least a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is not much different than the Almay although I found it harder to dispense just the amount I wanted. The old Almay had a few slits instead of the dots and I found that easier to control plus it didn&#x27;t ooze out as much if I threw it in a gym bag and it ended up on its side. But the new Almay has all the little holes just like everybody else.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when my retailer stopped carrying my favorite unscented, hypo-allergenic deodorant (Almay)[[ASIN:B0039YQ8P0 Almay Clear Gel, Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Fragrance Free, 2.25-Ounce Stick (Pack of 6)]]. In the case of Dry Idea, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; does not mean scent free, just perfume free. The Dry Idea clear gel has a pretty strong chemical scent to it, an astringent smell similar to alcohol. After a couple of weeks of use, I began to detect an odd astringent odor in my apartment. First it was just in the bedroom, or so I thought. Later I began to detect it in the living room after I sat there for a while. Finally it was everywhere I went, even in my car. At that point I began to suspect something unusual was happening. With a little thinking I recalled that the only thing that had changed recently was my deodorant, and the smell was vaguely similar. One week after switching back, the mysterious phantom chemical \\&quot;odor\\&quot; had almost entirely disappeared. I believe what had actually been happening was that the deodorant chemicals had worked their way through my physiology, starting at my armpits, until finally reaching my lungs, nose and sinuses! I also began to notice that I felt healthier and my energy level had returned to normal. I thought I had just been a little over tired, and/or maybe a bit depressed, but now I believe it may have been the Dry Idea, since the condition suddenly cleared up once I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> Great if you have sensitive skin and do not like fragrances in your products.  Works well at blocking perspiration and doesn&#x27;t add yet another fragrance to your body from your hygiene products.</li>
            <li> Great product which I have been using for more than 20 years</li>
            <li> After buying Dry Idea Advanced Dry Invisible Solid, Unscented, from an Amazon seller and finding out it had been discontinued and the one I received was a few years old, I decided to buy this product, Dry Idea Advanced Dry Unscented Clear Gel, from a local store so I could be sure it was fresh.  According to the code stamped on the container, the one I&#x27;m reviewing was manufactured two months ago.  It went on smoothly, dried quickly and did not cause irritation.  The problem is the smell.  It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had anything dry-cleaned, but that&#x27;s what the odor reminded me of.  All day long I kept getting a whiff of chemicals.  I even tried covering it up with Honeybee Gardens Deodorant Powder, which has such a gentle scent, I&#x27;m able to tolerate it despite being extremely sensitive to any kind of fragrance.  It seems to be working as an antiperspirant, but to me, it is just not worth walking around in a chemical fog.  The Unscented roll-on in the same brand contains \\&quot;masking fragrance,\\&quot; so I have to give up on Dry Idea and move on to something else.</li>
            <li> Great product that we have used for years.  Hope its never discontiued</li>
            <li> Use this all the time and love the unscented. Our Target is out of it a lot so just started ordering it on line.</li>
            <li> Great Product... great buy.. fast shipping.. what more can you ask for...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve been trying out a bunch of different hypo-allergenic deodorants. This one simply doesn&#x27;t work. After only a couple of hours wearing it I could smell my own BO without even trying. At first I thought maybe I was just especially smelly that day, so I stuck it out for close to three week, but to no avail. Doesn&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> For me this works just as well as the previous formula.  It dries quickly, isn&#x27;t messy, and stops perspiration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this deoderant!  I&#x27;ve had dry flaky patches under my arms since high school (more than 15 years ago).  For years I tried many different deoderants, but nothing changed.  February a year and a half ago I got the idea to try going without deoderant since it was winter, and my skin cleared right up.  I used a natural deoderant after that that helped odors but not wetness.  This summer I finally gave in and decided to try something different even if the dry patches came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Dry Idea because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, and it&#x27;s working great for me!  No dry skin and no wetness!  Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great anti-perspirant/deodorant.  It lasts for more than 24 hours, which is great for most of us.  However, like most roll-ons, you have to be sure to spin the roller, to get the liquid deodorant onto the roller, before applying.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a deodorant?  It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes.  It is unscented.  Both of those are important to me.  Oh, and it works.  As it happens, I have found no other deodorant that meets those criteria.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot from anxiety and physical exertion and I&#x27;m overweight. Picked this up, because it was on sale at Target and the Mitchum gel didn&#x27;t prevent odor the way I needed it to. My underarms stay dry no matter how much I sweat everywhere else and I never have an odor. Because it&#x27;s unscented, it smells like nothing in a good way. A little goes a long way even in my 100 degree high humidity weather from 0500 to roughly 1500. I can skip a day as well so the 24-hr protection is tried and true. Doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, no gunky white residual stains on my underarm. And there isn&#x27;t that wet feeling once you apply it. Went back to Target to buy my next tube and it was over $9! So I came on here for a better deal. One tube lasts me about two months and this is during the summer. Will not use another kind of deodorant unless they come out with a scented one. I&#x27;m awaiting delivery now and sure that will be without issue.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work for me or my son.  And being unscented is problematic if it isn&#x27;t going to stop the sweat.  Hopefully your experiences will differ.</li>
            <li> I like a neutral smelling so it don&#x27;t clash with perfumes or a scented lotion</li>
            <li> My go to antiperspirant. Works well with no added fragrance.</li>
            <li> I hate artificial scents (who needs to smell &amp;#34;Mountain Fresh&amp;#34;?).&lt;br /&gt;Scent free and 72 hour protection. What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need at a great price</li>
            <li> Dry Idea Unscented Gel 72 hour Protection, is my go-to deodorant product. It does not leave a residue or irritate delicate skin. Even though it&#x27;s without fragrance, it prevents odor 100%! As an antiperspirant, its active ingredient is in such a high concentration, it will keep even the most sweaty armpits dry!  I have skipped a day or 2 and found the product is effective for the full 72 hours as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, after years of trial and mostly error, I&#x27;ve discovered this wonderful stuff! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. I say leave the sticky, gloppy, fragrance laden deodorant sticks where they belong, on the store&#x27;s shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that and it&#x27;s inexpensive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this review helpful,&lt;br /&gt;Peter:)</li>
            <li> this is the only deoderant I will use now. I like the clear becasue it doesnt come off on clothes but some of the other clear brands dont last long and this one does.  Hard to find in stored Marsh and Kroger are always sold out so ordered a bunch from on here.  Working out well.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry without adding scent l don&#x27;t want. So I can wear whatever scent I like.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> The best Antiperspirant around</li>
            <li> Have used this product of years. Dry with no aroma. Cooling, soothing.</li>
