            <li>this item is great!!!</li>
            <li>but I should note I have very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>She does have very fair skin so that could be what happened.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with both!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the aerosol version of this stuff works great; you can spray from any angle</li>
            <li>It was okay but not the best.</li>
            <li>nice color and smells great.</li>
            <li>Works great, nice and even, lasts well.</li>
            <li>My friends commented on my good tan, and said I looked really healthy and glowing with it!  </li>
            <li>I then progressed to my face and legs and received many compliments about my \\&quot;vacation-look\\&quot; tan!  </li>
            <li>Also make sure that you wash your hands thoroughly after using it, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with Oompa Loompa knuckles.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>(though most problems don&#x27;t show up on my face until after 3-7 days of use...  </li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was able to get approx 8 tans out of 1 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>felt confident in going to the beach in my swimsuit and walking about site seeing in shorts,</li>
            <li>Eventually bought Clinique and I preferred it much better.</li>
            <li>second day I was more brave and tanned everything, including my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong; like soapy rose?  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the results.</li>
            <li>So far so good--</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m going on vaca in a few days and while I adore my fair winter skin tone as much as my darker summer hue, it wasn&#x27;t the look</li>
            <li>Then I tan the top of my right hand before removing my left glove and put part of the right  glove back on before tanning top of my left, seemed to work like a charm.</li>

            <li>used this lotion in the evening after showering; making sure my hair was dry and pinned up</li>
            <li>I started to notice a bit of a hue change within the first hour; a very nice subtle glow!  </li>
            <li>I will be more careful when I reapply.  </li>
            <li>Works extremely fast</li>
            <li>It absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for a real nice tropical looking tan product then this isn&#x27;t for you, you might want to try fake bake.</li>

            <li>I sprayed my back first</li>
            <li>I was perhaps a bit more cautious than recommended and only used very small amounts on my lower arms at first.  </li>
            <li>If you do buy it, be sure to spend a little extra time scrubbing it off your cuticles after applying it.  </li>
            <li>first day I just did legs and arms, I saw a little difference and had no negative reaction to it</li>

            <li>By morning, I would say I had definitely increased by a little less than one shade -- not orange or yellow, just lightly sun</li>

            <li> i have used this last year and have built a stunning tan with hardly any exposure to the sun at all!!!</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t really work for me, leaves my skin with a small tint of tan after I get out of the shower and put it on</li>
            <li> did everything I was supposed to, I used exfoliant made specifically by Neutrogena for pre-self tanner, I used a downward motion to apply the creme, I even let it dry properly,but having my arms and legs propped up and letting it airdry for 45 mins</li>
            <li> I wanted to bring with me (pale white legs in short shorts...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may work for those who are already dark, but 100% did not work on me properly.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay; my understanding is nearly all self tanners smell.  </li>
            <li> I am a very pale person, so I thought I would try this product as it clearly stated that it was to \\&quot;build a tan\\&quot;, that it would not streak or turn you orange.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I do have to say that one has to be careful when using it.  </li>
            <li> Took me a few applications to get enough color.</li>
            <li> The product met my basic expectations, but not more than that.  </li>
            <li> ; I also had a little bit of streaking (very minor) on my forearms because I had let the water run down my hands after washing before drying off --</li>
            <li> only negative is the scent.  </li>
            <li> a little orange in areas like knuckles that absorb a lot due to wrinkles.</li>
            <li> benefit of this tan building slowly is I didn&#x27;t get streaks or white spots from accidentally missing a spot, which is a problem I have had with other sunless tanning products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on using this everyday, so</li>
            <li> After a few hours, you then get that &amp;#34;tanning smell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My legs were still too pale for my preference</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t streak!</li>
            <li> did note that I missed a very small spot between my pinky and ring finger when washing my hands and the skin color there turned a dark brownish color</li>
            <li> so if subtle is what you&#x27;re looking for, you won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> but I made the decision to add a bit of color to my skin a touch too late to consider making a few trips to a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Assuming you use common sense its lights out.</li>
            <li> Disregard the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> ...they mean it.</li>
            <li> The tan is subtle and goes away within 3 days.</li>
            <li> just too subtle for me.</li>
            <li> Even the girls at the Tim Horton&#x27;s drive through noticed how bad it was (it is so bad I am using drive-through because I wont get out of my car) &lt;br</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!!</li>

            <li> Overall, I like this product.  I am very pale and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  Be sure to rub it in well, otherwise you&#x27;ll likely get some streaking.  Also make sure that you wash your hands thoroughly after using it, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with Oompa Loompa knuckles.  The tan is subtle and goes away within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I am a very pale person, so I thought I would try this product as it clearly stated that it was to \\&quot;build a tan\\&quot;, that it would not streak or turn you orange. WRONG!!!! There is NO WAY this gradually adds colour to your skin. I am BLOTCHY AND STREAKY AND ORANGE!!! Even the girls at the Tim Horton&#x27;s drive through noticed how bad it was (it is so bad I am using drive-through because I wont get out of my car) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did everything I was supposed to, I used exfoliant made specifically by Neutrogena for pre-self tanner, I used a downward motion to apply the creme, I even let it dry properly,but having my arms and legs propped up and letting it airdry for 45 mins (although it says it dries in 5). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It may work for those who are already dark, but 100% did not work on me properly.</li>
            <li> I feel like it just added a yellowish tint to my skin</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t streak!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I do have to say that one has to be careful when using it.  I was perhaps a bit more cautious than recommended and only used very small amounts on my lower arms at first.  After three applications over three days, I found that the \\&quot;tan\\&quot; was very natural looking.  I then progressed to my face and legs and received many compliments about my \\&quot;vacation-look\\&quot; tan!  I did note that darkening could occur on elbows, knees, and ankles.  So, I took extra precautions by smoothing the tanning lotion with a regular moisturizer and washing my hands immediately as not to discolor them, as well.</li>
            <li> this item is great!!! i have used this last year and have built a stunning tan with hardly any exposure to the sun at all!!!</li>
            <li> nice color and smells great.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this might help me reduce the noticeability of my vitiligo during the summer months. So far so good--a little orange in areas like knuckles that absorb a lot due to wrinkles. Took me a few applications to get enough color.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice and even, lasts well. Assuming you use common sense its lights out. Disregard the negative reviews.</li>

This was an impulse buy at my local drug store in addition to the Neutrogena aerosol self-tanner (for my back) and I&#x27;m really happy with both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this lotion in the evening after showering; making sure my hair was dry and pinned up (so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about streaking from run off).  I sprayed my back first, the aerosol version of this stuff works great; you can spray from any angle and it matched the color I got from the lotion.  Then, I used the lotion to do the rest of my body and face before washing my hands in soapy water.  I started to notice a bit of a hue change within the first hour; a very nice subtle glow!  By morning, I would say I had definitely increased by a little less than one shade -- not orange or yellow, just lightly sun kissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did note that I missed a very small spot between my pinky and ring finger when washing my hands and the skin color there turned a dark brownish color; I also had a little bit of streaking (very minor) on my forearms because I had let the water run down my hands after washing before drying off -- I will be more careful when I reapply.  My face did not breakout or experience any sort of rash, which is a miracle in itself since I have really sensitive facial skin (though most problems don&#x27;t show up on my face until after 3-7 days of use...  I don&#x27;t plan on using this everyday, so hopefully I won&#x27;t run into any issues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the scent.  It&#x27;s pretty strong; like soapy rose?  After a few hours, you then get that &amp;#34;tanning smell&amp;#34;.  Small price to pay; my understanding is nearly all self tanners smell.  Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the results.ing is nearly all self tanners smell.  Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and the results.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. Works extremely fast</li>
            <li> I used this recently to tan before a tropical vacation.  I began applying it 1 week ahead, as read the tan builds gradually so needed to be sure it worked, as if it didn&#x27;t I planned to get a pricey professional spray on tan before my trip.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I just did legs and arms, I saw a little difference and had no negative reaction to it (I have very sensitive skin, so better safe than sorry!)&lt;br /&gt;The  second day I was more brave and tanned everything, including my face.&lt;br /&gt;On the third day I had a good tan developed!  My legs were still too pale for my preference but I should note I have very fair skin.  I applied the tan cream again,&lt;br /&gt;I continued to apply every day after my morning shower for 1 week.  My friends commented on my good tan, and said I looked really healthy and glowing with it!  Which is definitely what most of us want from a tan, is a naturally subtly sexy, healthy looking glow!&lt;br /&gt;I missed a couple days when busy, the tan faded a bit, but I was able to boost it right back up within 1 day by applying it again.&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of this tan building slowly is I didn&#x27;t get streaks or white spots from accidentally missing a spot, which is a problem I have had with other sunless tanning products.  If I missed a spot one day, I hit it the next, so the color looked even and natural.&lt;br /&gt;Also, being it&#x27;s a cream, I think its easier to not miss spots by thoroughly rubbing it all over when applying and rubbing it in evenly just as you would a lotion.  It also worked as a great skin moisturizer, my boyfriend commented on how soft my skin was!&lt;br /&gt;The products reasonable price made it affordable enough for me to use every day, which was a convenient  luxury I did not have with previous similar products I have purchased.  I was able to get approx 8 tans out of 1 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I  felt confident in going to the beach in my swimsuit and walking about site seeing in shorts, something I could not do without a sunless tan product.  I will buy it again, it&#x27;s my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; tanning product.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I use a pair of disposable plastic gloves when applying the tan cream, so do not have to worry about getting it on my palms and fingernails.Then I tan the top of my right hand before removing my left glove and put part of the right  glove back on before tanning top of my left, seemed to work like a charm.Note:  I use a pair of disposable plastic gloves when applying the tan cream, so do not have to worry about getting it on my palms and fingernails.Then I tan the top of my right hand before removing my left glove and put part of the right  glove back on before tanning top of my left, seemed to work like a charm.</li>
            <li> My daughter used tis and the tan wasn&#x27;t what we thought it would be. Maybe her skin don&#x27;t take like it should or whatever but was good service just not what we expected. She does have very fair skin so that could be what happened.</li>
            <li> It was okay but not the best. I switched to the argan oil with moisturizer and haven&#x27;t went back.</li>
            <li> Used this every morning and never got a yucky orange look.  Just 5 minutes after the shower and I could throw on my clothes and looked like I had a nice glow from outside.</li>
            <li> This is my first re-entry into self tanning after 15 years of blinding innocent families at the beach.  The product met my basic expectations, but not more than that.  If you do buy it, be sure to spend a little extra time scrubbing it off your cuticles after applying it.  Mine are very, very tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it for weeks. It absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it never leaves an orange cast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cause I&#x27;m not pale white or the fact that I have olive color skin but this doesn&#x27;t really work for me, leaves my skin with a small tint of tan after I get out of the shower and put it on but if your looking for a real nice tropical looking tan product then this isn&#x27;t for you, you might want to try fake bake.</li>
            <li> Streaky and orange. Eventually bought Clinique and I preferred it much better.</li>
    </ol>
