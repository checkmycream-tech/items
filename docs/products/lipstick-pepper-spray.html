            <li>great product kept it in my car and with me all the time, gave it as a gift to couple of friends, we never used it ...</li>
            <li>It was bright orange with a rhinestone heart on it.</li>
            <li>item arrived as described and in good condition.</li>
            <li>it squirts rather then a good spray aim.</li>
            <li>I dont think it would do a good job</li>
            <li>me and my friends loved this and bouncers never caught on that it was mace when they checked our bags.</li>
            <li>Good idea.  </li>
            <li>the product was good</li>
            <li>The pink one is awesome. :D</li>
            <li>Waist of money considering it doesnt work safely!</li>
            <li>Well first off I just wanted to say that the pepper spray came sooner than I thought which is awesome.</li>
            <li>not to  safe!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Carries nice in my wife&#x27;s purse.</li>
            <li>Nice, and compact, my girlfriend loves it.    </li>
            <li>honestly....</li>
            <li>I carry it with me everwhere, and totally fits great in my jean pockets. :D</li>
            <li>the elements are exposed to you and now I wonder about how effective it will be</li>
            <li>This great item will also mark them with a dye also emmitted from this self defense weapon and its a legal form to carry around with us!</li>
            <li>Excellent item for female defense,because if attacked by a perpertrator,we want to hurt them not kill.</li>
            <li>I think I would have given it 5 stars if the sprayer was a litter better designed.</li>
            <li>colour is cute.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this looks like innocent lipstick.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I love the product.</li>
            <li>but i am sure it would sting ...</li>
            <li>I am glad to have the pepper spray along on my walks and bike rides.</li>
            <li>I WENT TO TOOK THE TOP OFF</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and thy were so nice they offered me a replacement that would be securely wrapped, and I received just that.</li>
            <li>I went through a first shipment damage in shipping and that&#x27;s when I found out how good the product was.</li>
            <li>I just got this and it looks very cool.</li>
            <li>nice, point it the right way, stun gun will probably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tube easily dents, vial easily cracks.</li>
            <li>They explained the situation and were pretty nice about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried spraying to make sure it works, and it came out as a liquid, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do, or if it&#x27;s kind of old...</li>
            <li>and I liked this so much</li>
            <li>I found out you can buy this for $1 free shipping.</li>
            <li>It felt extremely cheap, was the quality of a body splash.</li>
            <li>This is the cheap low-quality product.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find an inconspicuous way to protect myself, but since I know better I will just go for the real deal this time around and buy from a reputable seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pepper spray was exactly what is to be expected, and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I will keep it since it does have a unique look and that was one of the reasons I bought it online.</li>
            <li>THAT WAS REALLY SPECIAL TO ME.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off like I did, I highly suggest getting the real kind from a reputable seller so you can have the confidence that you actually have a full canister AND that it actually works.</li>
            <li>Looks like lipstick and may give the ladies a chance to escape harm with this harmless looking container, certainly worth carrying</li>
            <li>This is a good way to camouflage this product, but be careful ladies and store it AWAY from the lipstick.</li>
            <li>Yes that&#x27;s right, the tube is heart shaped.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Just right.</li>
            <li>Also, not the right color</li>
            <li>knowing that is right there</li>
            <li>the tops of the lipstick just come right off without taking them off.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to fool thier perpitrator!</li>
            <li>Also, I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting it to be heart shaped.</li>
            <li>I had hopes of the product actually being able to made someone couldn&#x27;t even do that .</li>
            <li>The first one came and the spray nozzle was off the vial.</li>
            <li>First of all, both sides of the lipstick that the spray is inside of, tend to come off.</li>
            <li>And, it would be very easy to spray yourself in the face because it doesnt have a clear front and back.</li>
            <li>Much bigger than the average lipstick container but great to have to disguise in your purse.</li>
            <li>would&#x27;ve left this as a 1-star rating, but the seller was actually pretty friendly when I contacted him/her about a tracking number (because we couldn&#x27;t find the package).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and not so big as to take up too much room.</li>
            <li>The price was also reasonable for all five tubes that come in the order.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>You would really have to be very close to your perpetrator to use this.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s very  comforting to have the lipstick pepper spray defense.</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>I FEEL MUCH SAFER</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR NOTHING...</li>
            <li>LAWSUIT MUCH?</li>
            <li>this must have been better than other brand&lt;</li>
            <li>the length is 3 1/2\\&quot; long and 1\\&quot; in diameter (top to bottom or left to right of the heart shape).</li>
            <li>It came in this cute heart shape, black color and weighs 20 grams.</li>
            <li>this one is sooo much better than my last big bulky one i had.</li>
            <li>so I plan on spending my next income tax return on many of these to pass out at female meetings to have as &#x27;&#x27;Help in a survival kit.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to send her a few things to help her feel safe</li>
            <li>the picture also shows round top</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34; container is small enough to fit in a pocket and be readily available if needed.  </li>
            <li>NOW WHEN I WALK THE STREETS WITH MY NEW PEPPER SPRAY SOAKED PACKAGE IN MY POCKET.</li>
            <li>The color was different than I ordered as well which I didn&#x27;t have a problem with as much as it not having any pepper spray at all.</li>
            <li>I bought a much stronger one that can be used for further distance of 4 feet to 12 ft.</li>
            <li>The product is completely camouflaged and you would never think it could be pepper spay.  </li>
            <li>thanks to a seller that actually tells the truth in their advertisement....</li>
            <li>One thing, the spray nozzle is able to be twisted in different directions and is completely flat on the top with no direction indicator.</li>
            <li>They are a little larger then lipstick, but can easily be concealed in your hand.</li>
            <li>Be very careful to point it in the right direction.</li>
            <li>It leaked during shipment not impressed at with the product it sprays a mist like the old breath spray and is just as effective will never purchase it again</li>
            <li>bigger than a usual lipstick but still a lot smaller than most others.</li>
            <li>, in the product picture it clearly shows that it&#x27;s a blue lipstick pepper spray.</li>
            <li>To top it off it came broken and leaked.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it definitely looks like lipstick and can be hidden easily.</li>
            <li>product is very strong, would turn anyone around, got a small amount on my face and it burned for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>I gave the product three stars because the color of the product was nice but the only problem i had was that when i received it was a little broken.</li>

            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a small one, i suggest the pen pepper spray (because it&#x27;s really the same size as a pen!).</li>
            <li> After being the victim of 2 home invasions I acquired several containers of pepper spray.  </li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it was a  lot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> But the fluid leaked out of the tunes so when they arrived the tunes were empty and sticky all over</li>
            <li> but it didnt take long for it to arrive in the mail.</li>
            <li> other reviews says it&#x27;s slightly bigger than lipstick</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and dangerous.</li>
            <li> However, an empty dired up canister was not what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> I got the pink one and it looks like an oversized sprayer for perfume rather than lipstick.</li>
            <li> was EMPTY inside.</li>
            <li> She had trouble finding the package, which I understand that this was not the seller&#x27;s fault and therefore not the reason why I would actually rate this a 1 star.</li>
            <li> I arrived licking all over, my fingers got all greasy and peppery.</li>
            <li> On time, tha&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> They sent me a lipstick and it was leaking and empty.</li>
            <li> I wrote them and they sent me another one which also was was leaking and empty.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace one that we had that when I pulled out of outer casing was also empty, thinking that we just had it too long and had dried up.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering if they are just selling all of these just like that, empty!</li>
            <li> I do not know if heat dry these things out, but I usually carry it in my bag , I did not get to use it, it was dry.</li>
            <li> I am a college student, so I take my safety and my expenditures seriously so needless to say I was really irritated to find out that I was sold an EMPTY canister.  </li>
            <li> When I got the pepper spray the container was half empty and leaking</li>
            <li> Second of all, it is really hard to tell where the hole of the spray is.</li>
            <li> Not the size of your average lipstick.</li>
            <li> But I think it still looks innocuous enough to at least not look like pepper spray.</li>
            <li> I took both outside and pumped the sprayer at least 15 times and nothing came out.  </li>
            <li> HALF OF THE PRODUCT WAS GONE.</li>
            <li> Wife received today is a mail bag, only to open it and find the pepper spray had leaked out into bag, burning her eyes and smelling up the house, now she is afraid to order any other one in fear it would leak out in her purse.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I wasted of money.</li>
            <li> the spray evaporates within a few months and too small to keep track in your purse.</li>
            <li> the reason i bought it is because i&#x27;m looking for a small one.</li>
            <li> It is small and you cannot tell what it is at all, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product: 1 star (1 star is the least that Amazon lets me put, otherwise I&#x27;d put 0 or -1</li>
            <li> /&gt;this wont protect you from real harm, jsut annoying poeple.</li>
            <li> so as you can tell i&#x27;m not very happy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot rate this item less than 1 star.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave the product three stars because the color of the product was nice but the only problem i had was that when i received it was a little broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pepper sprays for my daughter and granddaughters. They are exactly what we needed, small enough for your pocket or purse. They are a little larger then lipstick, but can easily be concealed in your hand. Deliverly was prompt and I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than the average lipstick container but great to have to disguise in your purse.</li>
            <li> item arrived as described and in good condition. I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to fool thier perpitrator!</li>
            <li> Wife received today is a mail bag, only to open it and find the pepper spray had leaked out into bag, burning her eyes and smelling up the house, now she is afraid to order any other one in fear it would leak out in her purse. so as you can tell i&#x27;m not very happy neither is my wife.</li>
            <li> Excellent item for female defense,because if attacked by a perpertrator,we want to hurt them not kill. This great item will also mark them with a dye also emmitted from this self defense weapon and its a legal form to carry around with us! The price was also reasonable for all five tubes that come in the order.</li>
            <li> this one is sooo much better than my last big bulky one i had. bigger than a usual lipstick but still a lot smaller than most others.</li>
            <li> Extreme disappointment. My sister is living alone and I wanted to send her a few things to help her feel safe and I liked this so much I got one for myself too. However, an empty dired up canister was not what I had in mind. I Won&#x27;t stray from name brand products again. This was a complete waste of money. The color was different than I ordered as well which I didn&#x27;t have a problem with as much as it not having any pepper spray at all. Both our sprays are completely useless.</li>
            <li> I just got this and it looks very cool. Carries nice in my wife&#x27;s purse. One thing, the spray nozzle is able to be twisted in different directions and is completely flat on the top with no direction indicator. You have to look on the nozzle side to see where the hole is. Be very careful to point it in the right direction. I set it so it points to the tip of the heart shape. Yes that&#x27;s right, the tube is heart shaped. It dose not look like the ones they have in their pix. I got the pink one and it looks like an oversized sprayer for perfume rather than lipstick. It&#x27;s light weight and not so big as to take up too much room. All in all it&#x27;s Just right. I think I would have given it 5 stars if the sprayer was a litter better designed.</li>
            <li> The pepper spray was exactly what is to be expected, and worked wonderfully. I kept it in my bra every day, and until I lost the cap, I felt like the safest woman in the world. I would highly recommend this product! The pink one is awesome. :D</li>
            <li> Frankly I don&#x27;t feel I can properly review this considering I haven&#x27;t had to use it, thankfully.    Anyway, it was a  lot bigger than I expected. Not the size of your average lipstick. But I think it still looks innocuous enough to at least not look like pepper spray. colour is cute. Also, I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting it to be heart shaped. so yeah, I hope a girlfriend never rummages through my purse and thinks it&#x27;s body spray.</li>
            <li> it squirts rather then a good spray aim. I dont think it would do a good job when your attacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am downgrading this at a 1 star. I found out you can buy this for $1 free shipping. Waist of money considering it doesnt work safely! Also, not the right color</li>
            <li> I carry it in my purse all the time. Is discrete and gives me (and my husband) great peace of mind knowing that is right there and I can use it anytime.</li>
            <li> The only flaw with this product is that one might shoot yourself. Otherwise, this looks like innocent lipstick. It would fool me if I was a mugger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful. If so, please add your vote.</li>
            <li> You would really have to be very close to your perpetrator to use this.  It is not designed for distance use.  I only kept one and gave it away.  I bought a much stronger one that can be used for further distance of 4 feet to 12 ft.</li>
            <li> This product came sealed to my house and when I opened and pulled it out of the outside covering it was EMPTY inside. I was trying to replace one that we had that when I pulled out of outer casing was also empty, thinking that we just had it too long and had dried up. Now I&#x27;m wondering if they are just selling all of these just like that, empty!</li>
            <li> Well first off I just wanted to say that the pepper spray came sooner than I thought which is awesome. However it is not the color that I had hoped it would be, in the product picture it clearly shows that it&#x27;s a blue lipstick pepper spray. Nevertheless I love the product. It came in this cute heart shape, black color and weighs 20 grams. I will keep it since it does have a unique look and that was one of the reasons I bought it online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter when we were about to go on vacation.  The product is completely camouflaged and you would never think it could be pepper spay.  If you&#x27;re looking for a discreet way to protect yourself I would say you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever do not buy ! I had hopes of the product actually being able to made someone couldn&#x27;t even do that .</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend who was staying at a university. Her dad bought her another pepper spray too and was going to send it to her around the same time, but I wanted to get her a discreet one in case of an emergency and I found this one. She had trouble finding the package, which I understand that this was not the seller&#x27;s fault and therefore not the reason why I would actually rate this a 1 star. The reason I would rate this a one star is because the item came with a leak! She told me that if she tried to use it, she would get pepper spray all over her hand so she just just threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve left this as a 1-star rating, but the seller was actually pretty friendly when I contacted him/her about a tracking number (because we couldn&#x27;t find the package). They explained the situation and were pretty nice about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: 1 star (1 star is the least that Amazon lets me put, otherwise I&#x27;d put 0 or -1 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: 5 stars</li>
            <li> When this product came, it leaked in the bag with a horrible smell, I just threw package it away. A waste of money</li>
            <li> Very poor packaging. I arrived licking all over, my fingers got all greasy and peppery. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> me and my friends loved this and bouncers never caught on that it was mace when they checked our bags.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s larger than a regular lipstick, it never looks suspicious when you&#x27;re going out and getting checked by security anywhere (still wouldn&#x27;t take it on a plane of course)...I tried spraying to make sure it works, and it came out as a liquid, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do, or if it&#x27;s kind of old...</li>
            <li> I do not know if heat dry these things out, but I usually carry it in my bag , I did not get to use it, it was dry.</li>
            <li> great product kept it in my car and with me all the time, gave it as a gift to couple of friends, we never used it ... but i am sure it would sting ...</li>
            <li> nice, point it the right way, stun gun will probably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this wont protect you from real harm, jsut annoying poeple.</li>
            <li> the spray evaporates within a few months and too small to keep track in your purse. kids can mistake it for lipstick or perfume. not to  safe!</li>
            <li> Was as I asked for, and came as told. no problems.    Nice, and compact, my girlfriend loves it.    Would order again from them    Thanks</li>
            <li> there is no problem to buy in this site. On time, tha&#x27;s what I expected. Recomended site.  Satsfied!  You can buy.</li>
            <li> Horrible Item one of the canisters was empty upon arrival. It leaked during shipment not impressed at with the product it sprays a mist like the old breath spray and is just as effective will never purchase it again</li>
            <li> After being the victim of 2 home invasions I acquired several containers of pepper spray.  The &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34; container is small enough to fit in a pocket and be readily available if needed.  Even with a home security system there are times when the electrical power may be off and that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s very  comforting to have the lipstick pepper spray defense.</li>
            <li> i actually haven&#x27;t used it yet (thankfully) but i&#x27;m not happy about the size. the reason i bought it is because i&#x27;m looking for a small one. other reviews says it&#x27;s slightly bigger than lipstick but it&#x27;s actually WAY LOT bigger than a lipstick. the picture also shows round top but once i get the item, it&#x27;s heart shape (which i don&#x27;t mind). they should definitely change the \\&quot;lipstick\\&quot; description. the length is 3 1/2\\&quot; long and 1\\&quot; in diameter (top to bottom or left to right of the heart shape). if you&#x27;re looking for a small one, i suggest the pen pepper spray (because it&#x27;s really the same size as a pen!).</li>
            <li> IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I OPENED MY LIPSTICK PEPPER SPRAY PACKAGE AND THE ENTIRE THING WAS LEAKING ALL OVER THE PLACE. THAT WAS REALLY SPECIAL TO ME. THANKS. I FEEL MUCH SAFER NOW WHEN I WALK THE STREETS WITH MY NEW PEPPER SPRAY SOAKED PACKAGE IN MY POCKET. HOW DOES THAT WORK? YOU JUST SMEAR THE PERP. WITH PIECES OF PACKAGING? THANKS FOR NOTHING...PLUS WHAT IF THAT HAD SPRAYED IN MY FACE AS A RESULT OF POOR PACKAGING. THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU SELL ANOTHER BOTTLE. LAWSUIT MUCH?</li>
            <li> Looks like lipstick and may give the ladies a chance to escape harm with this harmless looking container, certainly worth carrying</li>
            <li> It is small and you cannot tell what it is at all, but honestly.... do you care if someone can tell what it is? And, it would be very easy to spray yourself in the face because it doesnt have a clear front and back.</li>
            <li> Ordered two:  The first one came and the spray nozzle was off the vial. Putting the spray nozzle is difficult as you may spray yourself. Not a problem, though as it didn&#x27;t work (no spray) after the nozzle was placed onto the vial.  Nothing would come out.  The second one was just as bad. When trying to lift the lipstick cap off the lipstick container, the entire tube of pepper spray would pull out of the lipstick container with the lid. Once you held the vial and pulled the lid off, the spray did not work also.   I took both outside and pumped the sprayer at least 15 times and nothing came out.  These are useless.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I carry it with me everwhere, and totally fits great in my jean pockets. :D</li>
            <li> The product came as described; however, I have several complaints. First of all, both sides of the lipstick that the spray is inside of, tend to come off. Second of all, it is really hard to tell where the hole of the spray is. It will be difficult to spray an attacker if you have to examine your spray that closely. You will probably end up spraying yourself. On the other hand, it definitely looks like lipstick and can be hidden easily.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have the pepper spray along on my walks and bike rides. I have been chased and bitten by dogs, so I will spray the ground to drive away a fierce dog.</li>
            <li> This is complete crap. Unfortunately I cannot rate this item less than 1 star.  I am a college student, so I take my safety and my expenditures seriously so needless to say I was really irritated to find out that I was sold an EMPTY canister.  Thankfully I decided to even test it out because if God forbid I had found myself in danger I would have been SOL.  I was trying to find an inconspicuous way to protect myself, but since I know better I will just go for the real deal this time around and buy from a reputable seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just as a side note, my product looked nothing like the picture. Or lipstick at all.  It was bright orange with a rhinestone heart on it. Quite tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off like I did, I highly suggest getting the real kind from a reputable seller so you can have the confidence that you actually have a full canister AND that it actually works.</li>
            <li> The lipstick pepper stray did NOT meet my expectations as it leaks. Therefore I would rate it as poor because it until the leakage issue is resolved!!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t remember when i bought this&lt;br /&gt;but this must have been better than other brand&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know what to say</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECEIVED THE LIPSTICK PEPPER-SPRAY. HALF OF THE PRODUCT WAS GONE. I WENT TO TOOK THE TOP OFF AND IT WAS BROKEN. I ENDED UP GETTING PEPPER-SPRAY everywhere!!!!! MY EYES WERE BURNING FOR HOURS. I ENDED UP THROWING IT IN THE TRASH. WHAT A WASTE!!!!!! DON&#x27;T ORDER THIS</li>
            <li> Good idea.  But the fluid leaked out of the tunes so when they arrived the tunes were empty and sticky all over</li>
            <li> the tops of the lipstick just come right off without taking them off. not good since then the elements are exposed to you and now I wonder about how effective it will be</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. It felt extremely cheap, was the quality of a body splash. To top it off it came broken and leaked.</li>
            <li> When the pepper spray received, I opened it and I saw the pepper spray had leaked out in the bag, burned my eyes and it was smell horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Thats why we throw it away, :(  I wasted of money.</li>
            <li> Looks good, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet!  Thank goodness.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because it leaked when i opened it . And also i believe the product was well made.</li>
            <li> I bought a number of these for women in the family and for friends. Withing about six to eight weeks they all leaked all the liquid out.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and maced myself.... The can had exploded in the bag and Totally lit me up. I am very unhappy with this product. I have heard of this happening to others as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good way to camouflage this product, but be careful ladies and store it AWAY from the lipstick.</li>
            <li> I went through a first shipment damage in shipping and that&#x27;s when I found out how good the product was. I contacted the seller and thy were so nice they offered me a replacement that would be securely wrapped, and I received just that. I admire people like this so I plan on spending my next income tax return on many of these to pass out at female meetings to have as &#x27;&#x27;Help in a survival kit. thanks to a seller that actually tells the truth in their advertisement....</li>
            <li> They sent me a lipstick and it was leaking and empty. I wrote them and they sent me another one which also was was leaking and empty. I was not writing them anymore. This is the cheap low-quality product.</li>
            <li> product is very strong, would turn anyone around, got a small amount on my face and it burned for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> When I got the pepper spray the container was half empty and leaking so I was displeased about that. but it didnt take long for it to arrive in the mail.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and dangerous. Tube easily dents, vial easily cracks. Fluid leaks everywhere. Do not buy. Could explode in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> the product was good but when it arrived in the package it was smelly and had a foul oder to it..... i dont know why,,,, it&#x27;s a mystery to me.</li>
