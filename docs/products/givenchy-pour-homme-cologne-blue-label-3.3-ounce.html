            <li> Satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and was glad to get it as he was running low on what he had.  He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations had a crack in bottle</li>
            <li> Love thius and so do other women. Always asking hubby what he&#x27;s wearing. G&#x3D;First got as a gift when we checked into a hotel and it was the best investment they ever made. Hubby wearing it ever since.</li>
            <li> great buy for the price. discontinued cologne which i love and couldnt find it anywhere. Amazon continues to amaze me.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple months ago after trying to look for it at department stores. I used to buy this cologne like 10 years ago when I first started dating my wife.Still smells very good has a citrus and sweet smell very nice not your typical &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; this is a lighter cologne sweeter smelling cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to the department stores they kept saying I could probably only find it online then they tried scaring me away from buying it by saying things like &amp;#34;You can buy it online, but there is no guarantee it will smell like it&#x27;s supposed to. A lot of online vendors are selling older colognes that overstocked.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t listen to them, because they are salesmen of course and this cologne smells exactly like it is supposed to so if you scared of that don&#x27;t be and just buy it online!</li>
            <li> love this one! think this is my 3rd one and firs time I bough it in amazon. no problem at all.</li>
            <li> great smell. refined and mature.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth bottle of this stuff.  I was a bit panicked when the only local store with it stopped carrying it.  This stuff is really good, perfect for office wear.  So, I was happy to find it now on Amazon.</li>

Gentle but effective!!!!</li>
