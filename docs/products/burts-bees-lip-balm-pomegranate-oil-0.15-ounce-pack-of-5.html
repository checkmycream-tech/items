            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>Really good ones.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and it smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of eating Pinkberry in the warm Summer months.</li>
            <li>very nice smooth and not too flavorful</li>
            <li>Great feel, mild color.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the MOST greatest lip balm I have ever purchased and used.  </li>
            <li>We tried the different versions of the Burts Bees lip balm and like this the best as it works wonderfully in all weather, adds the subtlest shade of dark rose to the mouth and smells discreetly yummy!</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, but have to keep applying all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are quite natural and even the color is from natural material extraction , goes good with dark skin color and the moisture level is perfect , i don&#x27;t like make up and had never done any make up so this Lip Balm is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Very good...forget about all the others, this is the best so far!</li>
            <li>This is very nice stuff - soft, comforting to the lips</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is one of our favorites, and we find it more economical to buy them in bulk through Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and, in the wintertime, the lip balm really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>I have tried Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms, but hands down the Replenishing Lip Balm with Pomegranate is the best.</li>
            <li>Goes on creamy, not greasy, velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but I was surprised with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>They always arrive quickly and the product is as advertised.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this advanced chap stick to absolutely anyone....!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li>Love the product however,  the 5 tubes all came in just a loose mailer,,,,,,not</li>
            <li>It has been great with our temperatures in the teens and I&#x27;m outside with barn chores everyday</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had a chance to really try it out.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast..</li>
            <li>I kind of thought this would come in a box set or something, but it just came in a plastic baggie -- which was a little strange.  </li>
            <li>Just a touch of color (barely there) and creamy hydration for my lips.</li>
            <li>Product as bought appears to be several years old.</li>
