            <li>This frankincense was good.</li>

            <li>I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I have had the others and this is a better value.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that she did.  </li>
            <li>Also because it has a variety of health benefits I will always make sure I always have this oil on hand.</li>
            <li>Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>Love to use with when I mesitate and just to use in my diffuser before falling asleep.  </li>
            <li>Frankincense oil is something that we use for many things.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to check out the healing properties yet, but I can tell you that you will never regret purchasing this oil.  </li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with DeSensa Frankincense oil and the amount you receive for the price paid</li>
            <li>the Frankincense Essential Oil is one of the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m most pleased with my DeSensua products.</li>
            <li>Very nice and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Their service was quick, bottles were well packaged.  </li>
            <li>The oil is so fresh and is 100% Frankincense.  </li>
            <li>Smells and works as great as a more expensive brand name I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I am feeling my immune system must be pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I started putting drops under my nose and on my chest and feel much improvement in my breathing!  </li>
            <li>Also rubbed some on the bottom of my feet and and was very relaxing and calming!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using the oils mixed w/ carrier oils and for aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase more oils in future.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am just at the beginning of experimenting properly with Frankincense but so far I am delighted with this product and highly recommend it from this neat seller.</li>
            <li>I also like to use it in a diffuser--the fragrance is very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>and I cannot even tell you how wonderful and joyful this scent made me feel - crazy.  </li>
            <li>I even soaked in a bathtub of warm water with a few drops of this in the water, then put some on the soles of my feet when I got out.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot about it and was very curious if it will really do all the &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; it has been known for and I am happy to report that so far I have seen only positive results.</li>
            <li>I know a person is drawn to the scent of an oil that they particularly need and for me this is Frankincense.  </li>
            <li>I also have the Lavender and some other oils from DeSensua and so far I have been pretty pleased with the quality, packaging and overall presentation.</li>
            <li>It also is very beneficial when mixed with Myrrh.</li>
            <li>I gave several as gifts and their arrival in a black velvet bag were excitedly received.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was the generous amount in each bottle - usually it is much less than the ample 1 fl oz here.  </li>
            <li>I have been diffusing a few drops over a burner for a few days now and definitely feel more invigorated.  </li>
            <li>I will not only order this particular oil from DeSensua again, but will try some of their other oils in the future.</li>
            <li>I have also been sleeping much more deeply which I attribute to leaving a few drops in a small dish next to my bed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars. Everyone is constantly fighting about DT and YL oils. There are hundreds of oils out there and this is one of them. I have had the others and this is a better value. The smell is heavenly and works perfectly in my aromatherapy and skincare products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this yummy oil! I mix it with my unscented lotion and use all over my skin. I also diffuse it in my bedroom and add drops to relaxing baths. Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> All is well and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used essential oils on and off for over 25 years and firmly believe in their ability to heal and restore.  I know a person is drawn to the scent of an oil that they particularly need and for me this is Frankincense.  I was given this brand by a friend.  First thing I noticed was the generous amount in each bottle - usually it is much less than the ample 1 fl oz here.  The bottle and packaging is attractive and of good quality.  No worries about leaking out if I take them in my toilet bag on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having suffered 2 bouts of Strep B, a viral infection and then stomach flu all in about a 3 month period I am feeling my immune system must be pretty flimsy.  I have been diffusing a few drops over a burner for a few days now and definitely feel more invigorated.  I have also been sleeping much more deeply which I attribute to leaving a few drops in a small dish next to my bed overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just at the beginning of experimenting properly with Frankincense but so far I am delighted with this product and highly recommend it from this neat seller.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me this frankincense and I&#x27;m so glad that she did.  I love this oil and will  continue to order it!!  I use 30 drops mixed with an ounce of olive oil and apply it to my temples and to the bottom of my feet at night.  When I wake up in the morning I feel refreshed and energized. I also like to use it in a diffuser--the fragrance is very relaxing.  It also is very beneficial when mixed with Myrrh. This is the best product at the best price for those looking for good quality frankincense.  Also because it has a variety of health benefits I will always make sure I always have this oil on hand.</li>
            <li> After a 3-week recuperation from a sinus infection and chest congestion, I have had a residual cough and chest tightness.  I started putting drops under my nose and on my chest and feel much improvement in my breathing!  I even soaked in a bathtub of warm water with a few drops of this in the water, then put some on the soles of my feet when I got out.  I woke up the next morning with a lot less post nasal drainage.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I also like the seller. Will buy more for sure. I still need to find all the ways to use it. Any one&#x27;s idea&#x27;s welcome</li>
            <li> Loved it! Smells different than other Frank I have had but still good. Very strong! That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Frankincense Oil and it is an excellent one. I read a lot about it and was very curious if it will really do all the &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; it has been known for and I am happy to report that so far I have seen only positive results.

            <li> Put some drops in my bath before bed and slept great that night!  Also rubbed some on the bottom of my feet and and was very relaxing and calming!</li>
            <li> This is one of my faborite of them all...  Love to use with when I mesitate and just to use in my diffuser before falling asleep.  A MUST HAVE ITEM!</li>
            <li> This frankincense was good. A lot less expensive then Young Living. It smelled the same as YL. It worked the same as well. I will buy again in future.</li>
            <li> The larger size and cheaper price were the reason for purchasing this product. Frankincense oil is something that we use for many things.</li>
            <li> I have never used Frankincense Oil before and did not know what to expect with the DeSensua Frankincense.  My husband and I were so surprised how wonderful this oil smells - we can&#x27;t get enough of it.  The oil is so fresh and is 100% Frankincense.  It smells woodsey and has a hint of a lighter sweeter highlight.  It smells so good by itself, but I decided to mix a drop of a premium lavender oil with two drops of this oil and I cannot even tell you how wonderful and joyful this scent made me feel - crazy.  I just ordered their Myrrh oil and can&#x27;t wait to receive it.  I have not been able to check out the healing properties yet, but I can tell you that you will never regret purchasing this oil.  I am more than satisfied with DeSensa Frankincense oil and the amount you receive for the price paid is the best bargain around</li>
            <li> I am using it on my face and hands for basal cell skin cancer.  It&#x27;s doing the job and it is a wonderful healthy choice after using strong medicines full of chemicals to eat away the cancer cells!</li>
            <li> Although ordered several weeks ago, I have just recently started using the DeSensua Frankincense-I was finishing up a bottle of another well known, but more expensive brand. I have found DeSensua to work just as well as the other brand. Their service was quick, bottles were well packaged.  I gave several as gifts and their arrival in a black velvet bag were excitedly received. I will not only order this particular oil from DeSensua again, but will try some of their other oils in the future.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED with the quality of the Frankincense and myrrh oil.  I have enjoyed using the oils mixed w/ carrier oils and for aromatherapy.  Will purchase more oils in future.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is being used in reflexology and energy Pranic healing.  It works great and has a true scent.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality oil. I am a first time user. Works really good to reduce anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it with my mom who has a alzheimers.</li>
            <li> Very nice and reasonably priced. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I followed the tips I was given and the Frankincense Essential Oil is one of the best I have used.  I appreciate all the tips.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashley</li>
            <li> I could not locate an aroma from an air freshener and Frankincense was ingredient .I now have several oils and a oil diffuser. However, I&#x27;m most pleased with my DeSensua products.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Smells and works as great as a more expensive brand name I&#x27;ve used before. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
