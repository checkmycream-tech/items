            <li>quality, good value.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion</li>
            <li>I have paid over $300 for mouth guards from a dentist and they have never been this good.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and this mouth guard will fit perfect to your teeth.</li>
            <li>It works and fits as good as the molded ones, IMO.</li>
            <li>Always good to have a backup.</li>
            <li>Good Product...</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and it does not have bpa plastic.</li>
            <li>It also does a really good job in preventing grinding.</li>
            <li>Good product and service.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I see alots of good reviews</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a good pick, but just know it&#x27;ll take about a week for your mouth to get used to sleeping with a guard.</li>
            <li>I received them yesterday, fit them to my mouth, and proceeded to have the best night&#x27;s sleep and ZERO pain in the morning!!</li>
            <li>Good customer service.</li>
            <li>Good product and good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed by this company and it&#x27;s attentive customer service.</li>
            <li>Seems like good deal as you get 3 guards for this price</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Quality of the material is quite good.</li>
            <li>I did not have to adjust the mold as it fit my mouth perfectly</li>
            <li>but if you follow the instructions it&#x27;ll fit perfect in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Probably good for sports</li>
            <li>Good product, but does have a learning curve.</li>
            <li>and she raves over how good it is, so</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that this should be a good one.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Doctor Don makes superior products and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good chance that the sidewall will collapse either in the water or as you take them out.</li>
            <li>Price is good with 3 separate guards.</li>
            <li>and she got a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Best ever fit and comfort.</li>
            <li>Good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>A good deal cheaper than dentist office mouthguards.</li>
            <li>it was good  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of holding the gel in place.</li>
            <li>good value.</li>
            <li>Will prob good for sports but not for night guard.</li>
            <li>product received good reviews which is why I chose it.</li>

            <li>Great product and a very, very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get a perfect mold, even after trying with all three of the guards, but they happily thinned one of them for me that wasn&#x27;t fitting comfortably in my mouth and then gave me a replacement for one where I wasn&#x27;t able to get a sufficient enough impression.</li>

            <li>If you are using for teeth grinding I recommend molding to the bottom teeth rather than the top</li>
            <li>the dentist was able to address any questions I had and he provided the solutions to them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this one.</li>

            <li>I have not found another one better yet, so I keep using this one.  </li>

            <li>Simply the best, most inexpensive night guard I have found.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>a mouth guard ProDental will send you a replacement, but wasn’t sure this appliedto me as I now have a fully-functioning guard.</li>
            <li>That is why I am more than pleased with these mouth guards</li>
            <li>i love these.</li>
            <li>I love that there are 3 in an order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it comes in a three pack.</li>
            <li>This one is BETTER.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the overall value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use ya&#x27;ll again. :)</li>
            <li>But I contacted Dr. Don and he sent me a replacement free of charge!)  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s as safe as they state.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for many months.</li>
            <li>I love this Mouth Guard.  </li>
            <li>It was so comfortable, I didn&#x27;t even feel like it was in!</li>
            <li>For the money especially, this is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Product better than described.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t love a mouth guard</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels better than it has in years</li>
            <li>so I love that this comes in a pack of three.</li>
            <li>Really liked how comfortable it feels and it  doesn&#x27;t feel to bulky in mouth.</li>
            <li>Im really impressed how this company reached out to make sure not only that I had recieved my product but also to give me instrcutions as well.</li>
            <li>Better off getting one from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I am a grinder and this mouth guard seems to hold up better than others that I have which I chewed up during the night.</li>
            <li>glad it comes with three.</li>
            <li>For most of my life I have been a teeth grinder, but did not know it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Molding experience:&lt;br /&gt;I found before molding i needed to trim the material on the top</li>
            <li>Make sure you use plenty of water to boil and use a spoon to lift up the mouthguard after the 20 seconds (not tongs).</li>
            <li>The cost is excellent - a personal cast from the dentist would have costed $500 (this is not including the dentist visit!)</li>
            <li>I wear a mouth guard ever night to prevent bruxism and have used custom made guards as well as many over the counter products.  </li>
            <li>The ProDental guard has been the most comfortable and effective one I have tried.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I made sure to follow the instructions closely as many of the comments recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>the lower part of the guard doesn&#x27;t form as well as the top part</li>
            <li>Quite satisfied</li>
            <li>Ugh, I&#x27;m sure these work well, but I couldn&#x27;t even get through making it without gagging.  </li>
            <li>I followed their directions exactly and it worked perfectly the first time.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spoken to the manufacturer many times..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats paying $500.00 for one made by a dental lab.  </li>

            <li>They are slightly better</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s dual use as a teeth-whiting tray is also appealing.</li>

            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to mold it to my bottom teeth and see if that does any better.</li>
            <li>They work great for nighttime teeth grinding and they are as close to custom without spending that much money.</li>
            <li>I tried to wear the one I could do to the best of my ability at night and since I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth properly, my jaw ached and I had to take them off.</li>
            <li>Definitely more for sports mouth pieces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used to date and also the most affordable!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Dentist told me it was because this wasnt fitting correctly.</li>
            <li>Also, its a better deal than the retail stores had, and a better product.</li>
            <li>but now it is better.</li>
            <li>Works better than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>ok for the price.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there most nights.</li>
            <li>received 3 guards and fitting instructions within the promised shipping time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still to try fitting these guards</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions seem to be thorough, but I wish they had some illustrations / diagrams / youtube videos demonstrating the fitting instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was more than timely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>glad I ordered these guards and can recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li>I would say if you grind your teeth or do anything with your teeth at night you will love these.</li>
            <li>Followed instructions explicitly and first one was successfully molded to my mouth.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li>So pleased with these.  </li>
            <li>Love these things.</li>
            <li>I feel that upon awakening, my jaw is better aligned and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt any more.</li>
            <li>Love all the money I saved since the dentist wanted $318 for his.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to make a better choice.</li>
            <li>and I could use the protector more often.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the thing on bottom teeth as those seem to be the greater problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have worn it 2 nights and did ok with it.  </li>
            <li>Also, they mold at a lower temperature and with more working time than EVA.</li>
            <li>Fitting was a breeze with trimming flexibility by the user if needed.  </li>
            <li>they want us satisfied.</li>
            <li>How many companies will burden themselves with labor costs alone that probably exceeds the profit of the purchase for this service?</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller has made proactive contact to help with fitting the mouthguard.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and what a deal getting 3 mouthpieces for $30 that actually work.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mouth guard!</li>
            <li>I’d like to say that your mouth guards have been the most comfortable, well fitted products I’ve tried!</li>
            <li>I love this mouth-guard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and am really, really pleased.  </li>
            <li>The company truly cares about its customers satisfaction and I am an extremely satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and thank the inventor for this innovative device.</li>
            <li>I love the ProDental 3-in-1 mouthguard.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the &#x27;Dentek&#x27; will work better.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for one product for multiple uses; this is the best product to purchase!</li>
            <li>My dentist has even commented on how much better my grinding (or lack thereof) has gotten.</li>
            <li>I had no issues fitting it to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how it formed to my teeth, making it a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Also after the kids had braces taken off even more mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>I received these to review as a promotion and am glad to say they are quality guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was able to sleep in it with no problems at all.</li>
            <li>This product was made in the USA, which I love.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Better than any I have purchased before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different varieties for my bruxism and this is the best guard on the market!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many replacements.</li>
            <li>He gets lots more use out of them than the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My daughter and i both have TMJ and was told top</li>
            <li>I am going to order more to have on hand for when we need another...</li>
            <li>The company wanted me to be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I like this from my dentist more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that&#x27;s there&#x27;s 3 in this pack.</li>
            <li>Even if it is not the right match for me, it appears to be a good product that has many uses.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by how prompt delivery was, how thorough the instructions were (written and video) and how much the company cares about getting it right for its customers.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to fit after watching the video and reading the instructions, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions precisely and got a very good fit the first time.</li>
            <li>third attempt, though, was very successful</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I was offered to test these for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>(I made my mistakes on the first one) Was able to get good moulds with the rremaining two.</li>
            <li>Very easy to mold - stays in place - comfortable -  </li>
            <li>But this was very easy to  form to my teeth and fit well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to fit and install.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li>The instructions were very easy to follow for a custom fit.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to personalize the guard to the fit of her mouth.</li>
            <li>Also very easy to mold and fit.</li>
            <li>Luckily I still have 2 more!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, got a good fit on the first try.  </li>
            <li>They were easy to form, just follow the directions, and they fit nicely.</li>
            <li>Seller is very conscious of customer service and keeps in touch to make sure you are happy and doing well with item.</li>
            <li>the directions are very detailed and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use me instructions are very detailed.</li>
            <li>I did the second one and it turned out great with a good fit.</li>
            <li>I can close my mouth most of the way at night and it feels more comfortable than on my top</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and was encouraged because I felt I was making a pretty good mold from pressing the heated plastic on my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best at-home-mold mouth guard you can get, but it&#x27;s still not as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li>I made it for the top teeth to set it as that is more comfortable for most.</li>
            <li>Dr Don included a brand new mouthguard in case my wife wasn&#x27;t happy with the modifications.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with fit, thanks to the great instructions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These came in a pack of two, which is super nice.</li>
            <li>He says it forms easily and fits better than any he has had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The fitting was easy and I don&#x27;t notice it at all when I sleep.  </li>
            <li>Easy to understand fitting instructions, and I sleep without even knowing I have it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many teeth guards, however this one is easily the easiest to use.</li>
            <li>The makers are very helpful and pleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very methodical and handy at this kind of stuff</li>
            <li>You honestly can&#x27;t be the price for such a great product.</li>
            <li>These guards have the perfect thickness, so they will last, and I can comfortably close my mouth.)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The key is to get it to fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions closely and - if you&#x27;re like me - you&#x27;ll find it fits better and more comfortably than the one</li>
            <li>More than that, they even offered free custom fitting if she couldn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I do not usually bother with feedback, but this mouthguard is great.</li>
            <li>We found it very easy to mold and fit and is much more comfortable than most of the night guard/athletic guard mouthpieces available.  </li>
            <li>A very comfortable fit for a night guard.</li>
            <li>It makes for a very comfortable fit</li>
            <li>and I was able to sleep fine with it.</li>
            <li>Inst. were excellent, &amp; I even received a confirmation email the day the guards arrived ensuring that I knew how to fit them-a nice touch-above and beyond typical service.</li>
            <li>But other than my paranoias, I have nothing but great things to say! :)</li>
            <li>However, I feel satisfied that I got what I paid for and this would be perfect for any of the other uses.</li>
            <li>Exceptional product and I would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>The second is very good.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to fit and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks real cheap, like 5 dollars worth of material.</li>
            <li>so it stays more secure.  </li>
            <li>(i.e., they thinned my mouth guard to better fit my mouth).</li>
            <li>I find that this guard fits just a well, but is actually more comfortable in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Great product so far (a couple of weeks into using it).  </li>
            <li>I watched the video and read the instructions and got a good fit on my first try.</li>
            <li>and once you mold them to your mouth and teeth, sleeping is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They said they would send me two more free of charge.</li>
            <li>She does not complain about it in her mouth so it must fit pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I suggest trying both and see what feels most comfortable for your mouth.</li>
            <li>The ProDental has been the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It worked great and so far I&#x27;ve had NO problems.</li>
            <li>I still need to make an appointment with my dentist, but I know that I&#x27;m going to be much more comfortable in the meantime.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s comfortable &amp; does the job :-)  </li>
            <li>This is the MOST comfortable over-the-counter mouthpiece I have ever had.</li>
            <li>With these full mouth guards clenching force is distributed more fully through the mouth and is therefore much more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far has Been great.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s BPA free.</li>
            <li>More comfortable than the one made by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is the most comfortable mouthguard I have used,  </li>
            <li>Still it needs a better fit</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It is more comfortable to wear than the one I had gotten from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I received the product sooner than expected, which is great!</li>
            <li>I had to try it many times to get the mouth guard to fit</li>
            <li>I have purchased four night guards from my dentist over the years and this one is more comfortable than those.</li>
            <li>She too was easily able to mold the guard to fit her mouth and finds it to be unobtrusive while she works out.</li>
            <li>After reading and watching the video I was able to fit it well.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This is the MOST comfortable mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I can tell that even after 2 attempts that the guard fits fairly well in my mouth but probably not as well as a mold the dentist could form, or as well as a mold that would cost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li>and it is a good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after seeing all the good reviews, which I really don&#x27;t understand now after trying it myself.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good product and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Shaping it was straightforward and the instructions were very detailed.</li>
            <li>Most surprising is repeated mention that any dissatisfaction with the molding procedure outcome will be corrected by a return of the guard for new, or trimmed guards by their techs.</li>
            <li>Luckily there were two others and the second one came out perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning tip:&lt;br /&gt;One very important instruction included in the package is to NOT USE MOUTHWASH to clean these platic detal appliances.</li>
            <li>However, after getting a 2nd e-mail from the company asking me how I was making out with the mouth guards, I decide to write ProDental and let them now that although I was eventually successful and now have a very comfortable mouth guard, I would feel better if I had a backup just in case</li>
            <li>Molding my teeth was very easy and fit is nice and snug (very thorough video and written instructions on how to do this).</li>
            <li>Sweet dreams!</li>
            <li>I love these mouth guards, they are truly worth the money!</li>
            <li>However, it was easy to mold to my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems while I sleep.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use -</li>
            <li>Molded to my teeth easily.</li>

            <li>The instructions were detailed and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Instead, I formed the second mouth guard it came packaged with to my bottom teeth, and that proved more successful.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to set up, works like a charm, and is surprisingly comfortable given its inherent nature.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working fine as a night protection.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but after trying both, I went with the SISU mouthguard.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>

            <li>that was my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and it works just fine for</li>

            <li>works great, highly recommended, just follow the directions and don&#x27;t make the water too hot</li>
            <li>After reading the instructions I tried to get this mouth guard to fit comfortably in my mouth, I could not get it to feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected and great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>The mouth guards were too huge even when softened through boiling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, and easy to keep clean..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so comfortable you do not realize that you have it in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The guard stays in place comfortably and has yet to noticeably deteriorate.  </li>
            <li>After the dentist-made guards, I had to wear the shock proof football mouth guards that you melt to fit to your teeth.</li>
            <li>These guards are comfortable, light weight, but durable.</li>
            <li>My son says these mouth guards are comfortable.</li>

            <li>It fit well</li>
            <li>This mouth guard works well (fit &amp; no allergy reaction).</li>
            <li>Fantastic value.  </li>
            <li>The owner of the company himself personally offered to have it thinned, and also to refund my money if I still wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>so I know how they&#x27;re supposed to fit.</li>
            <li>In order for it to fit your mouth, you need to trim it to fit your mouth and them boil it.  </li>
            <li>shut comfortably during the night.</li>
            <li>No headache, no muscle and shoulder pain, and they fit</li>
            <li>and now it fits comfortably in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.</li>
            <li>THE MOUTH PIECE IS COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>It took me about two nights to get used to sleeping with a mouth guard, but now that I am used to it, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable without it.</li>
            <li>No problems modifying them to fit my mouth</li>
            <li>but then it is quite comfortable throughout the night.</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions on forming the fit.</li>
            <li>I got these for a friend who had problems grinding her teeth when sleeping, she had a cheap one from Walmart</li>
            <li>(yes I read them) and having the two extra ones is a great plus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to say something about ProDental&#x27;s customer support.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experimenting with filing, rubbing, etc to see how to smooth these edges out.  </li>
            <li>Durable, flexible, stays in the mouth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>She emailed me after I got it with detailed instructions.  </li>
            <li>I recommended it to my brother and now want to fit one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>directions important to avoid overlap melt.</li>
            <li>I got these mouth guard expecting me to find them across the room, only they have been staying in my mouth lol.</li>
            <li>I mailed it to him, he immediately modified it and sent it back, and my wife is now happy with how her&#x27;s fits.</li>
            <li>1 for grinding and/or sports, 2 lightly molded for whitening?</li>
            <li>I had another &amp;#34;grinding guard&amp;#34; from another company before this one, but I wanted a guard that was BPA free.  </li>
            <li>price was fantastic too.</li>
            <li>But the fit is comfortable, and it does the job.</li>
            <li>I had been given a night guard a couple of years ago but couldn&#x27;t stand the way it fit.</li>
            <li>Even if you need it thinned, you can send it on in and they will do that at no extra charge which is great costumer service.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the product but wanted it to be smaller</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and it&#x27;s a remarkably comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>So, if you have patience to mold it to fit your mouth</li>
            <li>It is quite light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Mine fit after I followed the instructions but seemed just a tad bulky</li>
            <li>It fit without having them do this</li>
            <li>The sidewalks are also a comfortable thickness.  </li>
            <li>The mouth guard fits well, and it is comfortable for overnight use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work great but had to trim a lot off as they are larger than I thought.</li>
            <li>(The company had indicated they&#x27;d replace any guards I messed up for free, but I didn&#x27;t bother being</li>
            <li>What is the best is the customer service, I got few emails from them to follow up with the products and all of the tips to improve my sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, these are fantastic for my gymwork.</li>
            <li>and, as advertised, the manufacture sent me 2 free replacements.  </li>
            <li>Fit to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t put the protector in and so decided to try sleeping with it even with the not-so-good fit</li>
            <li>There is a YouTube video on how to fit the tray which I would suggest.  </li>
            <li>I fitted according to directions and obtained a satisfactory fit.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the softened curling walls sticking together, as the instructions warns, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that important</li>
            <li>I think it is comfortable to wear while sleeping.</li>
            <li>it was comfortable to wear and functional.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product, once fitted is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great price for the functionality as compared to purchasing one from a medical practitioner</li>
            <li>No problem in getting it to fit.  </li>
            <li>I know I can send it to the seller free of charge to have it thinned.</li>
            <li>Great interaction with this seller, even though I haven&#x27;t actually talked to anyone!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to mold the guard to fit my teeth and mouth and</li>
            <li>Incredibly comfortable mouth guard that stays in all night unlike others I have had.</li>
            <li>I have tried the cheap mouth guards from the pharmacy, and they never stayed on my teeth and didn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li>follow the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li>then help him make a mold it to fit his lower jaw.  </li>
            <li>But fortunately my teeth were</li>
            <li>but with some practice I had a mouth guard that fit and worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have insurance, so I came to Amazon with a task of finding a mouth guard I could boil for fit and came across this product.</li>
            <li>My husband assessed the fit and trimmed it to fit my mouth.</li>
            <li>The guard is made out of FDA approved material that is BPA free.</li>
            <li>However, the mouth guard enveloped my teeth comfortably and securely.</li>
            <li>and so I needed a more economical option.</li>
            <li>The five-star reviews for this product are justified.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m buying another set of 3 before this company realizes what a fantastic deal this is and jacks up the price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the guards work very well for most people....</li>
            <li>product is soft and comfotable but surprisingly durable.  </li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, after about two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>And the end product came back fast and fits perfectly!</li>
            <li>Worked fine on my first attempt, and the guard is form-fitting but very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This thing really did a good job, even not being quite right with the jaw</li>
            <li>I did my best to cut this off (which is NOT easy) and the result was satisfactory, not</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more when needed!!</li>
            <li>Closson at ProDental was very solicitous about my concerns.</li>
            <li>After watching the instructional video, I was able to cast a secure and comfortable bite guard on my first try.</li>
            <li>I find the mouthguard comfortable and helping significantly with the grinding/clenching.</li>
            <li>First, it is very important not to overheat the mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s super easy to mold -</li>
            <li>and I was able to comfortably wear it the first night.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was successful on the third guard.  </li>
            <li>This product is very neatly packaged and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>High quality material and amazing post-sale service.</li>
            <li>As a former dentist and research scientist, I&#x27;ve found that the ProDental one is extremely well designed, works perfectly and comes with excellent instructions (including an available on-line video) and unsurpassable follow-up technical support.  </li>
            <li>If any special fit is required, you just send them the request.</li>
            <li>It does come with clear instructions and it is easy to use, just put it in warm water and let it mold to your mouth.</li>
            <li>original review was 2 star.</li>
            <li>My second try was successful and now I&#x27;ve use it for about 1 week.</li>
            <li>My neck pain was better after the first night I used your mouth guard.</li>
            <li>Well worth the savings!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get tjese.</li>
            <li>the first one didn&#x27;t work out or I needed more.</li>
            <li>My original review was 2 stars because the product didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, they are also replacing the guard that I ruined in my first try at fitting.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this mouth guard out.</li>
            <li>The first one was okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great that the seller will replace the guards if you mess up all 3 guards while fitting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is significantly bulkier than the night guard that my dentist made 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>And be sure to shake out all the hot water before putting in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how this will turn out.</li>
            <li>Instructions are fairly straightforward and worked well.</li>
            <li>and I was able to form my mouth guard in the first attempt.</li>
            <li>the instructions for much more detailed in the product itself is much better than the over the counter that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>So when a friend told me about this brand I was excited to try them..</li>
            <li>I had no problem with any of the instructions and now have a nice new tray for my teeth whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>The seller stands behind his product and will do his best to help with any problem and ensure you end up satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>By far the most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>My teeth were sensitive before and they are feeling much better now :)</li>
            <li>The fit is 99% as good, but at only 10% of the price.  </li>
            <li>I had a couple of questions, and their representatives responded quickly and accurately.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with how accurately it molds, but the walls are too thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried numerous night guard and this product is by far the greatest night guard I have purchased.</li>
            <li>The ProDental mouth guard was easy to use (had to re-mold it 3X prior to getting the perfect fit) but it was simple and it works.</li>
            <li>Good value and as comfortable as such things can be.</li>
            <li>Dr closson was kind enough to work with me to make sure this fits</li>
            <li>.The device was trimmed to fit my mouth perfectly and helps me not only sleep better but protects my teeth from nightime grinding..Great Value and good people behind the product..</li>
            <li>Following the directions closely, I was able to get a very good close fit for my upper teeth.</li>
            <li>The guard really does the job &amp;, if not a thing of beauty, is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will be buying more when football seasons starts back full force!</li>
            <li>Feels good and much better than the other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So when I was selected to receive this pro 3 in 1 mouth guard set at a special price in exchange I would test it out and post my opinion in this review</li>
            <li>Even though it is very form-fitting to my teeth, it&#x27;s easy to install and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>, consequently it&#x27;s VERY important to get it right on the first try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guard is  more comfortable than what’s available from a drug store and considerably cheaper than the $350</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and ok price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t slept that well in months, and to wake up without having pain is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Just let it air cool for 5 seconds and get it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>And not painful to form-fit (unlike the dentist-fitted device).</li>
            <li>Mailed it back and received the thinned mouthguard within a week and all is good.</li>
            <li>The mouth guard offers effective protection from grinding while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, the ProDental folks followed up on me with several emails on what is required to make it work, videos, offering assistance and more guidance.</li>
            <li>This product was a bit time consuming to fit to my jaw but was well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>not as good as the second time I tried with the # 2 set.</li>
            <li>They have credited my account in full.  </li>
            <li>She says she literally sleeps better, an that the difference was very noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li>not a bad product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to fit and as comfortable as imagined and I am able to sleep with the guard the entire night with no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watched the product fitting tutorial on YouTube, followed the instructions and had no problem getting it right with the first guard.</li>
            <li>They were comfortable, but in 3 nights I would have chewed right through those guards.</li>
            <li>I screwed up 2 trying to get the fit right</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to read through the instructions a couple times (and get everything ready) before custom-fitting this thing, but the procedure works exactly as described, and the guard fits very securely and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty easy to form to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty easy to form too.</li>
            <li>The instructions for fitting were kind of daunting, but it ended up being pretty simple.</li>
            <li>and smart purchase, plus you get 3 of them!!</li>
            <li>Mine was perfectly fine from just putting it one time in the hot water then take it out</li>
            <li>I appreciate the follow-up emails from MKC to check its quick delivery and my satisfaction with their product.</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to offer free replacements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to go thru mouth guards fairly quickly</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that a mold-it-yourself product would be an adequate replacement, but to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product, it came quickly.</li>
            <li>For a basic night guard at a reasonable price, this would be great.  </li>
            <li>but I wish I knew a way to solve this quickly....</li>
            <li>It is the most comfortable mouth guard I have tried, by far.</li>
            <li>This was perfect for 3 different uses on 3 different people.</li>
            <li>pleased with the result and the fact that there are two more to mold in the future when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend them but make sure you follow the fitting instructions for a proper fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Simple process of heating and fitting, just make sure not to over cook the plastic as it softens quickly.</li>
            <li>If you wait too long--even seconds--it tends to quickly melt, resulting in the two edges sticking together.</li>
            <li>As comfortable as they get -- for nighttime teeth grinding, this one fits much more nicely and less obtrusively than the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard, getting the job done without feeling like someone&#x27;s shoved a brick in your mouth.</li>
            <li>, it was wafer thin and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The results were stellar (great fit), and I woke up without blood in my mouth from damage to gums due to teeth grinding (no tension headache, either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first mold turned out okay, but my second one is the most comfortable mold I have ever had for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit, easy to understand directions, and great relief for my ever annoying teeth grinding!</li>
            <li>While this night guard did not work for me (too bulky) despite several attempts to fit it, the manufacturer/inventor did call me to offer to refund my money (despite the time lapse) or alter it to make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The first night I fall asleep with it comfortably.</li>
            <li>The second one I did have to do some fitting, but I just dipped parts in the hot water for a few seconds and worked on it section by section until it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product comes with a free replacement of &amp;#34;better than money back&amp;#34; guarantee within the first 30 days.</li>
            <li>It forms exactly to your teeth and is comfortable to wear while sleeping once you get used to wearing it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good value with minor deficiencies.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a good nights rest in so long.</li>
            <li>I had a great night sleep for the first time in a long while because i didn&#x27;t wake up with a frozen jaw!!</li>
            <li>that if you screw up the fitting just let them know and they&#x27;ll send you a brand new pair.  </li>
            <li>The material feels great on the teeth, sort of rubber like and slightly squishy.</li>
            <li>1 tray perfect for the smaller mouth(maybe like a female or teens jaw line) soft and flexible and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The instructions were very well written and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>Watch the video to insure you understand the process, but it&#x27;s really quite easy.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast and mold easily.</li>
            <li>I had extremely high expectations for this product---and they were exceed!!!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not nearly as form fitting &amp; durable as my old one, the $30 price for 3 is definitely good value &amp; does the job of protecting my teeth from grinding.</li>
            <li>and I actually sleep a lot better with it!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this thing first!  </li>
            <li>How much??!!??).</li>
            <li>On my third try with the first guard, I got a perfect mold for the upper teeth.</li>
            <li>This guard has stayed soft during the moulding to my mouth and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I found these bruxing shields to be easy to fit, durable and as comfortable as possible.</li>
            <li>Extremely well made for a good, secure fit with high sides that hug your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with clenching or bruxism, and this has so far been THE most comfortable product I have used for my medium to large</li>
            <li>Has really helped, comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and feels secure in my mouth.</li>
            <li>The detailed instruction that comes with the guards is really helpful.</li>
            <li>I have used only one of the three guards since purchase and it still is holding up amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: amazingly, there was an almost instant relief from the ache.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable and are very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally a mouth guard that is comfy, effective and lasts.</li>
            <li>, it takes getting used to, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>husband sleeps with a different guard that his top and bottom teeth fit in to for his snoring.</li>
            <li>So far,  I&#x27;m doing okay adjusting to it.</li>
            <li>So over all I think this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat comfortable (a lot better after trimming it for a second time) and all but one time stayed in place over night.</li>
            <li>but if you want a comfortable night guard your better off spending extra and going to a dentist</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable thing in the world but not as big and bulky compared to others.</li>
            <li>How many will talk to you directly these days...</li>
            <li>and I rarely take the time to make reviews.</li>
            <li>However, the seller contacted me and was kind enough to give me a refund on the product.  </li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t have insurance, this economical alternative could work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble fitting or using it as a guard for my teeth since I tend to grind them in my sleep.  </li>
            <li>But even if you do, you can get turn in the messed up one for a fresh one.</li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable to wear all night, and durable enough to do the job!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>comes an observation some might find useful.  </li>
            <li>If you are in search of an effective product I would definitely recommend ProDental.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: 18 months later, I am still loving these night guards.</li>
            <li>Not only was it made in the USA, it has another feature that I love: RISK FREE.</li>
            <li>I first received the three mouth guards, I didn&#x27;t do a good job at all trying to fit the first one, biting down (even though the instructions said not to), resulting in a guard that would not work.  </li>
            <li>By carefully following the product directions, I was able to get the mouth guard to fit my bite exactly.  </li>
            <li>and, sure enough, it fit my mouth exactly.  </li>
            <li>When I was fitting my first one I did not think I needed the mirror and came out with a crooked fit.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit my first mouth guard easily by following the instructions.</li>
            <li>Really appreciated the help video the seller made accessible.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Right now a customized mouth guard is not in my budget.</li>
            <li>and if there is any issues they will work on getting it just right for you.</li>
            <li>It even comes with a link to a video to help you with the right technique.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple of nights to adjust to having it in my mouth, but now I just pop it in and fall right to sleep.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I watched videos online to get it right, still couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a custom guard right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Included instructions provides all of the details needed to start using this product right</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>now uses the mouth guard every night right before falling asleep.</li>
            <li>Comfort Fit Dental Guard is extremely less bulky and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>+ I found out that the material was exactly the same kind as this one.  </li>
            <li>In less than 10 minutes I had a great fitting mouth guard that stayed on my upper teeth.  </li>
            <li>The directions were very clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to mold, and the instructions and emails the company has sent have been very clear and helpful.</li>
            <li>Good product, worth a repurchase for me down the line.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a mouth guard that fit snuggly against my teeth although the walls extended too high up on the gums in some places.  </li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product that I highly recommend to everyone who clenches and/or grinds their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Shaping them to fit was easy, just read the instructions a couple of times before starting so</li>
            <li>This is a great way to save a few hundred dollars!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried this before dishing out a small fortune to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>ProDental is much closer to a custom made mouth guard ordered at the dentist&#x27;s office than to any of the generic products I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li>if he is willing to stand by his product the way he does, it is worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I grind my teeth heavily through the night, and these are pretty soft, so I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting me more than maybe a month each, but that&#x27;ll do perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Flexible-soft, no rough edges, no latex (REALLY allergic), easy to use and shape to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li>My new mouthguard is as comfortable as my custom guard that cost hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li>I felt comfortable knowing if I made a mistake in forming the mouthguard, I could get a new one at no charge.  </li>
            <li>Reading the material and watching the video allowed me to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tried to get the guard molded right, but once I finished that it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It finally turned out to be a good fit on my third try after trimming the mouth guard at the back edge and top.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>A quality product, reasonably priced, and tremendous customer support.  </li>
            <li>I was careful to follow the instructions for fitting them, and the fit was not the problem.</li>
            <li>Instructions clear and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions carefully, you&#x27;ll get a good result, and the manufacturer is very helpful with questions and suggestions.</li>
            <li>The instruction is clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow (there is a website where you can watch a complete video on what to do).</li>
            <li>Very professional and attentive seller.</li>
            <li>Great product but so hard to do right</li>
            <li>60C% of the minimal cost from your DDS to which most insurances will NOT cover!</li>
            <li>The only difference is they take your impression and make it fit for your teeth, and you use hot water to mold it to fit it for this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and I fall asleep with ease knowing I&#x27;m not destroying my teeth while I&#x27;m in dreamland!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>- I dip it in water and then slide on my upper teeth, sleep on my side/back, any way I want, very comfortable and does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two that i trimmed properly are very comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I bought it and delivered very fast.  </li>
            <li>I am using the guard for my night time teeth grinding, it is very comfortable and has given me relief from jaw discomfort and headaches related from TMJ .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY reasonably priced (compared to the $600</li>
            <li>In my case, I read the instructions, watched the video, and read the seller&#x27;s follow-up email, and that helped me get my night guard right the first time, so now I have two more back-ups for when my current guard wears out.  </li>
            <li>arrived very fast and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know anything about mouth guards, and wasn&#x27;t sure that I could wear won, I decided to find out a little more before investing that much money.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were so easy to follow, and not troublesome at all ( like the other one I tried)  Not only that, but it&#x27;s BPA free, super comfortable, and has a high quality fit.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>My first try didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Mouth guard is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I simply do not use it any more.</li>
            <li>you just use hot water.</li>
            <li>First there is no way to mold this thing without biting it to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>must admit, though, that despite having watched the video twice, and reading all the instructions three times, I had problems fitting the mouth guard to my tiny mouth.  </li>
            <li>You can always re-heat the guard if you remove it from the hot water too early.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am guilty of grinding my teeth in my sleep and these are wonderful.</li>
            <li>It will be better to add more photos in the instruction to help user like me who speaks English as a second language.</li>
            <li>I followed all of the instructions to a tee and even made adjustments as directed because the first mold did not suffice.  </li>
            <li>, I knew that I was in no way going to be able to cut this without totally screwing it up.  </li>
            <li>but the second one was better.</li>
            <li>The first ProDental guard was a disaster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night since and had NO jaw pain for the first time in</li>
            <li>Worked for me on the first try doing the mold.</li>
            <li>: follow instructions EXACTLY and try to do everything on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have had many different mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>have three of these mouth guards, still on the first one after 5 months</li>
            <li>The first one I tried didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>the first one lasted me three years.</li>
            <li>The material is soft and so it is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the extra mile the company goes through too with the extra emails to make sure your happy and get it fitted properly.</li>
            <li>I have been using the same night guard now for more than 8 months.</li>
            <li>DO NOT be affraid of putting the mouth piece in your mouth after taking it out of the hot water.</li>
            <li>tried molding one without trimming it at all and the material squished across the entire roof of my mouth, and cooled to form something that looked more like one of those plastic orthodontic retainers you get after your braces come off.</li>
            <li>It works exactly like it is described…..</li>
            <li>My teeth definitely show the damage, so I have had many mouth guards.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>First off -&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits quite comfortably, and I have no trouble sleeping with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used two forks to get them out of the hot water and also to pry apart the walls.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Dentists don&#x27;t like their clients getting these from ProDental and not from them, but I have had no trouble molding it to fit my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Directions are self explanatory.  </li>
            <li>I love how I can use these not only as a mouth guard at night but also to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>This mouth guard will likely be my favorite of three brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>well the first time.  </li>
            <li>I most likely could have saved myself from a lot of dental pain.</li>
            <li>The first one is already showing signs of wear.  </li>
            <li>So last night was the first test, I went in doubting that I would be able to sleep with something in my mouth...</li>
            <li>Woke up many times with chunks of the things falling in the back of my throat.)  </li>
            <li>It comes with three and the first one worked for me</li>
            <li>The hot water molding procedure is tricky.</li>
            <li>I tried to follow the ProDental video and written instructions during my first two attempts at forming this mouth guard around my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the one I had made at the dentist and only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Actually I think most of the saliva build up was because I would immediately put them in my mouth after rinsing it with water.</li>
            <li>On the second guard, I tried to trim it a bit before fitting, and messed that one up also.  </li>
            <li>First night, slept without any issues and every night since.</li>
            <li>I think I was a bit nervous about trimming  on the first molded form and thus it is thicker</li>
            <li>I trimmed and put in hot water to re-form</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>I used a mirror when fitting the second one and thus it came out centered like it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a night guard</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m still using the first one I made.</li>
            <li>It is my first time wearing a mouth guard</li>
            <li>My first mouth guard did not turn out well.  </li>
            <li>This one is much stronger and is lasting much longer than Ruger others and another nice part is there&#x27;s 3 in the order.</li>
            <li>It is a bit thicker than the orthodontist/dentist guards from what I have had in the past, but I have also gotten used to ones similar to these, so it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I do feel one of lips of the guard touching my gum line in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It came partly off first night.</li>
            <li>I was wondering if I should even wear it the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard]] instead.</li>
            <li>I explained that I had some difficulty shaping the first  mouth guard and had to trash it,</li>
            <li>The thing to make sure is that the mouth guard is in the hot water just enough so that you can mold it.</li>
            <li>The mouthguard is probably hot when you first put it in your mouth</li>
            <li>but it shouldn&#x27;t be burning hot.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t bother me  and it fits as if I had a professional fit .</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We used the first of these guards on her to test for quality and functionality.</li>
            <li>They stay exactly where they are supposed and do not move around in their mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mouth guard fits well and appears to be better than the dentek mouthguard I used prior to that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>The trick is not to leave the guard in the hot water after the slightest curling.</li>
            <li>Mouth guards are used for many purposes such as teeth grinding,snoring,sports like hokey and TMJ</li>
            <li>Also included was the (at this time expected) nice letter of explanation and instruction from ProDental</li>
            <li>Although the first night she dreamed she was chewing a peanut butter sandwich</li>
            <li>my dentist quoted me) yet it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>Easy to get proper fit unlike several others I&#x27;ve tried and comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had a custom made one from the dentist which was thinner and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>That along with the instructions that came with the order made the whole process easy and clear to follow.</li>
            <li>Got them ready to return right away and ordered &#x27;Dentek&#x27; -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week, but honestly, even if it falls apart in 6 months it will have been more economical than buying a new mouth guard at full price.  </li>
            <li>The guard is comfortable and not bulky in my mouth and it doesn&#x27;t mess with my wacky gag</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine and was easy to get used to it.</li>
            <li>The molding process was easy and fast and the instructions were very clear, i also found the video very helpful.</li>
            <li>Instructions to ensure proper fit for the mouth-guard were very clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>But I just kept warming them and trimming a little bit until I got it to fit better.</li>
            <li>(so it wasn&#x27;t so deep dish) and i needed to leave in the hot water 1 second longer to get a good squishy/workable consistency for custom molding to my mouth.</li>
            <li>I ordered ProDental  and other kind from Dental Lab.  </li>
            <li>This will do for after the holidays when I want to spend that kind of money on a other dentist made one or as something I travel with.</li>
            <li>It does what it states it does, but if you use it you will understand its bad for your teeth Because its not designed for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I emailed them after and said it worked great and only took me two tries.</li>
            <li>How well it works long term remains to be seen, but so far I am very satisfied with this product after using it for a month.</li>
            <li>Product molds very well to my teeth and have more protection than the last ones I bought.</li>
            <li>Total satisfied and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not only was it easy to mold the first mouth guard to my mouth, it still came with 2 additional in case</li>
            <li>My first attempt at forming the impression was easy and I did a pretty good job, but I accidentally made it slightly off center.  </li>
            <li>Instead of paying $400 to the dentist, I purchased this product, after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I figured why not take a chance on the ProDental Mouth Guard after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>They are a positive exception when it comes to customer</li>
            <li>screwed the first one up because i underestimated how fast it would shrink</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>My first impression of them is that they were very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Edited (10/31/2014):&lt;br /&gt;I botched up my first mouth guard, but the 2nd one worked out fine.</li>
            <li>, I probably wouldn&#x27;t cut it down, but it is kind of bulky to sleep with if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>than I like and is a little high on my gumline, but still fit ok.</li>
            <li>I suggest for those who have this problem to use a serrated tool (I used a small saw) to cut off a portion of the edges and remold for smoothness to make this fit better.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to trim off the excess.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the center of the guard lines up exactly between your two front teeth</li>
            <li>It is easy to off-center the back when pressing and sucking it into position for molding.</li>
            <li>I did have to soften it a few times to get a good fit, and as a final touch (thanks to the instructional video)  gently pinch the channels together while dunking it in the ice water (for a tighter fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if you mess up molding the first one, there are two more right there for you to try)</li>
            <li>I have a rather large tongue and am susceptible to biting it at night.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know where all these positive reviews comes</li>
            <li>process of fitting the guard is a little tricky the first time, but the instructions are accurate and complete.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and useful, even though I pretty much knew what to do.</li>
            <li>no problems so far after several months (3 are included &amp; company will evidently send more if needed).</li>
            <li>I sort of used my first set ( of the 3 ) as kind of a test, and after several back and forth re-shapings, I got them where I wanted but still</li>
            <li>Angela sent me a new one right away.  </li>
            <li>A high quality product at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>I made a perfect fit by lightly biting down after taking it out with a cold metal tongs.</li>
            <li>If one follows the directions (and knowing you get a free replacement if you mess it up), it will fit well without discomfort.</li>
            <li>It was easy to adjust to fit my mouth by following the simple instructions.  </li>
            <li>i accidentally left the mouth guard in the solution all day instead of taking it out after 15 minutes like they suggested, and it was totally fine.</li>
            <li>Their customer service seems pretty decent too.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear enough that i got the fit right on the first try.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s decent quality for the price (I played sports all through middle and high school and have had more mouthguards than I can count).</li>
            <li>I actually trained myself to stop grinding and biting through meditation, which was a huge relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see no reason to spend big bucks on dentist molds when this product is available.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the support and followup.</li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy, too.</li>
            <li>I have found the mouth guard to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>That alone is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using the mouth guard, my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them, whether you grind you teeth or not!</li>
            <li>Appears to be very durable.  </li>
            <li>This item set up exactly as expected, and I can see why it has so many five star reviews.</li>
            <li>, I think I grind them so much it really has taken a toll on the health of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>After it shrunk in the water though I found I didn&#x27;t really need to trim it.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>The product was as described, and the video was very helpful.</li>
            <li>It is so rare to find customer service like this, and I was pleasantly surprised at this companies level of dedication to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the $250 one</li>
            <li>I speculate I will chew to these rather fast</li>
            <li>I received this and followed the directions VERY closely.  </li>
            <li>This mouth guard works very well for the money.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Everything else is smooth except for that patch in the middle, and I wish it weren&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed an affordable night guard that would fit properly and not fall out while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>He asked me several questions and offered free modification.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the call from seller.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>I grind my teeth at night so much that my jaw hurts in the morning</li>
            <li>I really like the guards.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>but nothing really help.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I changed this review from 1 to 3 stars since their customer service seems to really care about your enjoyment of their product and they&#x27;ll try to help you out if there are problems.</li>
            <li>But this will be the case with really any mouth guard.</li>
            <li>Seller is very helpful and provides written and video instructions as well as a dedicated customer service line you can call with any questions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a mouth guard before but this is the one I would whole heartily recommend.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Fits very well</li>
            <li>is also US made and that really appeals to us.</li>
            <li>The protection it affords your teeth and the versatility of the three appliances is a real benefit.</li>
            <li>Dentist quoted me $500 on a custom molded mouth guard to protect my teeth from grinding while I sleep, insurance denied the claim, so instead of dishing out WAY too much cash, I bought these at about $29.  </li>
            <li>and I really needed another mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.  </li>
            <li>The molding process is very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However... there is a big drawback to these that I&#x27;m still dealing with:  You do need to trim these to fit.</li>
            <li>Customer support is very helpful.</li>
            <li>unit is working very well for me in protecting a cracked tooth with a root canal that i would like to avoid having pulled.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied&lt;</li>
            <li>It is much easier to speak with it in, compared to all others I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is advertised as being BPA free, but it didn&#x27;t actually have that claim on the package or the literature that came with the guard</li>
            <li>I really appreciated that they offer so much support and will walk you through the adjustments.</li>
            <li>Plus the instructions were emailed to me (as a video) as well as included in the package which really helped.  </li>
            <li>I really like that the mouth guards are made from a FDA approved material.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one based on the reviews and also because the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>There was no way that I was going to buy a night guard from my dentist for over $500, and I didn&#x27;t want a generic flimsy guard that was meant to fit all mouth sizes.</li>
            <li>And there is a video to show you, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li>last thought..took me 5 minutes to mold and fit.</li>
            <li>I use them when I am weightlifting and they really help.</li>
            <li>(one side of my jaw was swollen, preventing a proper fit).  </li>
            <li>I have used self molding trays for whitening products but this tray is much thicker and since I purchased it for teeth grinding, I do feel it will work well for that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks ProDental</li>
            <li>Really appreciate the video and emails which helped so much.</li>
            <li>Then I discovered we can buy a mouth guard without having to go through a dentist and for way much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I found that to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>Seller is very responsive with instructions and offering support of their product.</li>
            <li>Really helps at night.</li>
            <li>Thanks for all that you do.</li>
            <li>For my level of teeth grinding, lasted 4-5 moths each, so the whole package served me well over the year until my insurance would cover permanent guards.</li>
            <li>Very satisified with this product.</li>
            <li>The overall quality of the product feels great, especially when compared to the generic mouth guards sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li>I really like the ease of molding the appliance in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I also think that the price is very affordable for the quality and quantity  </li>
            <li>I got all the things ready beside the water pot except the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it made a crunching sound, one of my teeth was not positioned properly.</li>
            <li>I needed a mouth guard because my dentist had told me that I am grinding my teeth too much when I sleep.</li>
            <li>and now I have a product that works very well.</li>
            <li>shows that they really care about my experience with their product.</li>
            <li>Really appreciated all the follow up.</li>
            <li>I do not think that she had to have it, but she really wanted it.</li>
            <li>So, you really do get 3 for the price of 1.  </li>
            <li>I read through the fitting instructions carefully, got everything I needed handy, and within a few minutes, I had a perfectly-fitting mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it says in the description, you can trim it to fit your mouth, personally I did not have to trim mine.</li>
            <li>my main concern with these Pro-Dental guards is that they would be too soft and I&#x27;d chew them apart quickly.</li>
            <li>Did the fitting process on one, came out ok but not great</li>
            <li>material is nice and springy, but holding up well -- at this rate, each guard (there are 3 per package) should last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I have a tiny mouth, but was able to trim them down easily.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a less expensive and quick alternative to getting a mouth guard fit by my dentist, and so far, I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to mold and so comfortable, don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s in my mouth, no more grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li>would leave the guard in hot water for slightly longer (couple of seconds more after you see</li>
            <li>Other mouth guards have been too flimsy or too hard (irritated my gums), this one was perfect.</li>
            <li>Once I got over that, I started actually grinding and biting MORE because the feel of the material was so satisfying to bite down on (a little squishy), which led to more severe TMJ.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with but after it has been molded to my teeth, it slips into my upper teeth very well</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that such an inexpensive device (&amp;#60;$10 each) would actually develop a good enough fit to stay on comfortably through the night to prevent teeth grinding,but after following the directions carefully it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Guess I pinched them too much as when I was done with the molding process, the mold barely covered the bottoms of my back teeth; most of the mold was pressed against the roof of my mouth and once the mold had cooled, it would not stay on my teeth, so</li>
            <li>and I expect this product to have a better lifespan than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I had extreme comfort from the start and woke up without a headache, teeth sensitivity or drooling. :-)</li>
            <li>Also if for some other reason it just doesn&#x27;t fit right they will fix it for you when you send it in.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and thanks to having 3 in the package if you don&#x27;t do it right the first time you will the second time.</li>
            <li>However, the third try was a success because it was hot and pliable.  </li>
            <li>Have not worn it long enough to know if it is as effective as the guard made in the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fantastic for me as a night guard because, even after molding, it&#x27;s very easy for me to push out</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price and, if you take the time do it right, you&#x27;ll get a long lasting product in exactly the fit you need.</li>
            <li>The instructions said if , after I got a strong impression of my teeth, the guard didn&#x27;t fit snug enough to put it back in hot water for 5 seconds and put back in mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These ProDentals have really resolved most of my issues with my previous dental guards.  </li>
            <li>If I get brave enough, I may try the third, but I&#x27;m not very hopeful.  </li>
            <li>The guard stays in my mouth all night and after 5 minutes, you can&#x27;t really feel it in your mouth as I can talk normally with this one in.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect--as far as mouthguards go</li>
            <li>the 3 sizes to choose from was nice, because i have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li>I either lost my other one or ground it down and swallowed it while sleeping lol.</li>
            <li>The one I bought at the dentist has been resized and shaved down so many times, yet still I&#x27;d wake up with mouth and jaw pain.  </li>
            <li>thus I still have two more that can be used down the road.</li>
            <li>so I sent it to the company, where they shaved it down to remove some of the bulkiness and now I like it even better.</li>
            <li>When I tried it on dry, it was big and bulky and looked like it might need a bit of trimming -DON&#x27;T, once it is submerged in the hot water, it shrinks and molds to appropriate mouth size.</li>
            <li>I was not able to get a good fit with these, they are way too uncomfortable to use as a night guard, you are better off paying the premium at the dental office</li>
            <li>It fit so tight that it felt as if the device was going to pull the teeth right out of my mouth, as I tried to remove it.  </li>
            <li>Then I decided to try pressing the heated plastic directly onto my old dental impression (which my dentist said would not work) and SUCCESS:</li>
            <li>fitting process requires carefully following of directions however actually very simple.</li>
            <li>I had to dip the guard twice as I didn&#x27;t let it get hot enough the first pass.  </li>
            <li>This Mouth Guard I created fits better and feels better and is what I now use (not the expensive one).  </li>
            <li>Last night after following the fitting instructions I put this in.</li>
            <li>Not sure at this point how long each guard will last, but I&#x27;m sure these will end up being much more cost effective down the road versus dentist&#x27;s guards.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For the one that they thinned for me, they went above and beyond by not only thinning it like I requested but also trimming it in the back so that I would have a comfortable fit without any prompting from me.</li>
            <li>I am a teeth grinder, in high school my friends would tell me that I had kept them up all night grinding my teeth away at night.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as an alternative to prescription guards.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mouth guard to everyone that grinds their teeth while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mouth guard.</li>
            <li>The product is of high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I did manage to mess up during the first attempt to fit it...</li>
            <li>It may be more due to my overbite, but I find it most comfortable to wear when I&#x27;m sleeping with my mouth open, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to talk coherently while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to customize to my small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one gives you 3 guards for the same cost, and works like a dream on the first try!</li>
            <li>Please note that I am not able to say whether or not ProDental would have been able to fix the original mold that I created just from my teeth, so if you don&#x27;t already have a dental impression, you may have different results.</li>
            <li>Molding was a little challenging...</li>
            <li>Also, I have intended on whitening my  teeth for a very long time and am excited about the idea that I can use this product to do that.  </li>
            <li>Simple to mold (I microwaved some water and just soaked it for about ten seconds), and more comfortable than the other sleep guard I have used.</li>
            <li>We had to reheat a couple of times but other than that it was easy</li>
            <li>this was easy to use and extremely helpful to stop a lip biting habit.</li>
            <li>When I put that one in I thought \\&quot;wow, this is so much better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I read great reviews about this product but was still skeptical about the product even after I placed my order.</li>
            <li>Had no trouble molding it to my mouth as the directions are very understandable.</li>
            <li>Such attention to customer satisfaction seems rare these days.</li>
            <li>Since then I have had a root canal and also moved so it has been misplaced on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li>slept like a baby and woke up with my teeth clenched as normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have a better idea of how I like it after sleeping with the mouth guard in for a few nights.</li>
            <li>Considering the amount of time you have a guard in your mouth, the extra expense and time is worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d make sure to read through the instructions a few times to visualize the steps, and to mark a 1, 2, 3, etc.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do that M let the walls curl together for few more seconds it will make the guard softer and easier to mold</li>
            <li>One lesson learned is that you don&#x27;t need to trim the guard first, you should do the trim in the last step of the whole process b/c the guard will shrink after being heated.</li>
            <li>Small clear plastic that I soaked in warm water and put in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This is not meant for a normal sized mouth.  </li>
            <li>The man or people behind this product epitomize good customer service.</li>
            <li>Mouth guard came earlier than expected :) Relatively easy to mold,must follow directions carefully.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re fine for football or other contact sports</li>
            <li>I picked it up right when the walls were curling and it turned hard pretty quickly, so</li>
            <li>I was starting to wonder if I&#x27;d ever find one that fits right.  </li>
            <li>I followed the video and only needed to cook two mouth guards to get it right, however it required a ton of trimming with scissors to allow me to wear it without gagging constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that we saved so much money and basically got 3 mouthgards instead of only one for a ridiculous price at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I will cut more off the tops &amp; will make sure to press hard enough to stretch it toward the back of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Initial ineptitude on my part led to too loose a fitting, but the product is malleable and forgives some mistakes.</li>
            <li>I could never get the other guard  to fit well.</li>
            <li>primarily got the mouth guard due to grinding my teeth at night (I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and my jaw would be sore).</li>
            <li>It is easy to get a customized fit and it is very comfortable to wear, and way less expensive than getting one from the dentist.</li>
            <li>After the dog got ahold my night guard that I had made through my dentist, I needed a temporary fix, until I could have a new guard made.  </li>
            <li>me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I tried this mouthguard.  </li>
            <li>They are bulkier than what I am used to, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I figured i would try the Pro-Dental instead of getting another Dentek since the reviews for the new denteks are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHICH IS NEW TO MY TEETH</li>
            <li>This is new for me</li>
            <li>Then I contacted the company asking if I could maybe have one of the guards I messed up replaced, and they immediately sent me two new guards to replace the ones I ruined, at no charge to me.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping I can live with that one.</li>
            <li>Product arrived as specified and in the new condition as stated.</li>
            <li>and I believe getting this new mouth guard from ProDental was the hardest one to shape to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I used it all night the first night and other than looking like a nerd it felt fine, stayed put,and the next day no problems or soreness.</li>
            <li>When I first made them, they fit a little too snuggly--somewhat uncomfortably--but with usage everything loosened a little, and now they fit</li>
            <li>Have one suggestion, when fitting it after the boiling process, be careful with the back molar area of the mouth guard.</li>
            <li>Sent an informational email about getting a proper fit prior to the device&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li>The video offered clear, concise instructions which really helped.  </li>
            <li>The directions were very clear.  </li>
            <li>The set of instructions is very clear of how to customize and shape.  </li>
            <li>As it turned out the ProDental product worked fine for me, and I plan on continuing to use it in place of the far more expensive custom made guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a small mouth, like I do, I feel this mouth guard are way to big, go buy a  small cheap mouth guard and its will be much easier to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>After a few days to allow the jaw to normalize a little, the fit was better</li>
            <li>Molds easily and seems that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>so I went back and reheat the first mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>The instructions call for removing it from the hot water as soon as you notice the walls of the mouth guard starting to curl together.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the first of the three provided mouthguards for several days and it is working to resolve my problem with teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li>and I have a pretty big mouth</li>
            <li>I, personally don&#x27;t have enough teeth left to be able to use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one wasn&#x27;t a total loss</li>
            <li>result is these feel exactly the same as the mouthpiece</li>
            <li>This mouth guard does the job, especially for the price, but I had some difficulty with it at first.</li>
            <li>Seller sent me a e-mail with video on step by step how to use and mold guard-worked quite well as I got it in first take and now use daily any time I am sleeping.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This is big at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using such an item</li>
            <li>I have experience with this product from its predecessor, which uses the exact same trays.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest putting them in the hot water for only 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other heat and form mouthguards, and I&#x27;ve never been able to keep them in at night.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft too!</li>
            <li>it is more like 7 seconds and no more.</li>
            <li>Hot should only be for molding.</li>
            <li>Instructions suggest that the guard should be left in hot water till the edges start to curl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other brands and these work much better</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth but found that I was better off not trimming.</li>
            <li>Then in the exact same day I wrote the review the mouth guard company contacted me saying they they r</li>
            <li>At first I thought they were &#x27;forming trays, but no, they are the actual things you wear on your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more grinding and more sleep for me.  </li>
            <li>Especially since the price is so reasonable for three mouth guards!  </li>
            <li>No More mouth guard is also less bulky and more comfortable, however in my experience it is not as sturdy as the DenTek, probably because it is disposable.</li>
            <li>I have paid so much for other brands and they never seem to fit properly.  </li>
            <li>When I received the other kind which was much more expensive $90</li>
            <li>Next time, I will just buy this product as I know the other kind was same material.</li>
            <li>AND it won&#x27;t take that long when I fit the next one.</li>
            <li>Be aware there are different styles to choose from in the professionally made guards.</li>
            <li>First night was akward, but by second night it feels natural, and I don&#x27;t go to sleep without one anymore.  </li>
            <li>I let it cool off before putting back in my mouth and molded it to my upper teeth by pressing it against my teeth.</li>
            <li>I failed to get the first two mouthgards into my mouth soon enough after heating to get a good impression.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TO ASSURE A TIGHT FIT.</li>
            <li>When I did have a few questions, they were answered quickly and completely..GREAT customer service!</li>
            <li>This has a BIG ISSUE with your teeth because when you grind your teeth is grinding on huge amount of rubber and that causes pressure on your teeth, which will soon become damaged and will cause you to loose a tooth or get a ruth canal.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t be afraid to cut the mouth guard down to make it fit better if necessary.</li>
            <li>The piece is large and I&#x27;ve had to do some trimming, but it definitely works as a guard against grinding.</li>
            <li>A little thicker than the one than the dentist made, but it&#x27;s perfectly comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li>there is a little flex to them, which is what makes them comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The guards are a little thicker too which are helpful for grinders and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>This would probably be fine as a mouth guard for sports activities, but, for my mouth, it was much too thick and bulky for sleeping comfort.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult and these were definitely large enough for my mouth.</li>
            <li>Second turned out fine and the third i&#x27;m saving for a later date.</li>
            <li>I love these, instead of paying $500 for those hard custom mouth guards from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I have used a hard dentist-manufactured guard for many years.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t hard to mold to my teeth, but this is definitely more for sports than for sleeping.  </li>
            <li>but  I didn&#x27;t get the desired result and they were loose and fell down easily from ur mouth!</li>
            <li>AND THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEAR AND  </li>
            <li>arrived on time and the instructions were clear.</li>
            <li>I watched the video and read the instructions carefully, and I had no problem getting the guard to fit properly.</li>
            <li>so I do like the clear ones from ProDental.</li>
            <li>will recommend it to every one including all the young athletes I know.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy in stopping the tooth sensitivity which may or may not be caused by teeth grinding since I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed a change.</li>
            <li>I wait about a couple of seconds too long with it in the hot water, but that was my fault.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is BY FAR the easiest to mold (and I&#x27;ve molded them all...</li>
            <li>It is necessary, though, to follow the instructions very closely and also watch the video that will be sent to you once you place an order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a Dentist designed professional 3 in 1 mouth guard for use as a sleep aid for grinding your teeth, an athletic guard for playing sports and a teeth whitening tray.</li>
            <li>that make them sensitive.</li>
            <li>This guard is so much nicer than one I got from a local drug store.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using them at night and so far hasn&#x27;t had any complaints.  </li>
            <li>I grind my teeth constantly and it is a real pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn a custom made night guard from my dentist for nearly 20 yrs</li>
            <li>She is thirteen years old.  </li>
            <li>No big deal, really. 2</li>
            <li>I contacted their support team regarding my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>my whole mouth gets pain because the the mouth guard size itself is too big</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have to update my review, because since using this product I have developed TMD and eustachian tube issues.</li>
            <li>Like the old days when people staked their name on what they produced.  </li>
            <li>And yes, so far the soft plastic is holding up well.</li>
            <li>It is soft and fits my mouth well.</li>
            <li>I must have been clenching my teeth, without realizing it, and this was the answer to my frequent headaches and neck pain.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried and ruined two of them.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money as this piece of plastic is over-priced.</li>
            <li>We got this for our 12 year old Grandson to use for sports.</li>
            <li>With the clear instruction, my son who is 8 years old likes to use it.  </li>
            <li>I was grinding through in a week, and have been using one of these for a month so far</li>
            <li>They were just far too bulky.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews before buying this and felt really unsure it the mouth guard would work.  </li>
            <li>Even though I trimmed the ends for my wife&#x27;s piece, there is still too much material left.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that I trimmed it too much, not counting on the shrinking, despite the instructions about it.</li>
            <li>I have to report that these mouth guards work really well and had I known earlier</li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars as the price was much cheaper for the same material compare to the $90 one.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t push on the mold enough and didn&#x27;t indent my teeth in it enough for it to be as comfortable as my second</li>
            <li>These are by far the easiest to mold.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not going to fall out, yet it&#x27;s soft all around.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s helping her</li>
            <li>There is one unexpected benefit.  </li>
            <li>No irritation, no braces-like aches or shifting of teeth, no trouble breathing, and</li>
            <li>resulting guard is softer than the professionally made one which cost me $300.  </li>
            <li>(I was sent an email link directly from the seller after my purchase).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a sensitive tooth for close to 20 years and started using a guard about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I was unaware of doing either until I really paid attention.  </li>
            <li>Which is awesome because my last few teeth whitening trays have worn out and broken.</li>
            <li>I had questions and comments since I&#x27;m a grinder - been so since an early age.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been grinding my teeth for a few months, and wanted to avoid going to the dentist and paying hefty fees for a fitting.</li>
            <li>This mouth guard is just about as comfortable as the custom-made one though naturally it does not fit quite as snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I initially molded the mouth guard to my top teeth, and found out after a few nights of wearing it that the mouth guard was rubbing on my gums, creating ulcers.</li>
            <li>Seems likely to wear out sooner, but economically makes sense – especially given the risk of loss.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>It took a few trials of fitting it after the prescribed procedure, but it  finally worked.</li>
            <li>It is soft, so I am interested to see how long the guard lasts.  </li>
            <li>(I take a lot of over-night airplane flights where I’m apt to leave things behind (like mouth guards and eye masks)</li>
            <li>Nearly as good as an expensive dentist-cast, custom-poured guard (that my dog ate).  </li>
            <li>The material was way too thick to mold appropriately to my teeth.</li>
            <li>It was kind of too thick and my mouth stays open in front when I close it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see rather hollow teeth fitting area compared to other mouth guard</li>
            <li>I got it right after 2 heating tries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this to clean in a tray of water just hot from the tap and at the end of the day it had shrunk to the point my back teeth at either end and up and down weren&#x27;t covered.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other products from Dr. Don and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the products as well as the detailed instructions provided.</li>
            <li>Actually made for a normal sized adult mouth!  </li>
            <li>An added big plus is that the company is very responsive to user input and willing to thin the mouthpieces if requested at no charge with free return shipping.</li>
            <li>The instructions on this could have been a little more clearly written, and bullet pointed so you could follow along step by step as you go, but other than that there&#x27;s no complaint at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear, the instructional video is extremely helpful, the customer service is first rate.  </li>
            <li>It did take me a few dunks between the hot and ice water to get it right, but I feel like this piece is really solid.</li>
            <li>I did mess up the first one, and I think some parts of the instructions would be better with some diagrams, such as how to lay it down on the paper towel.</li>
            <li>Also I trimmed it before putting it in the hot water as the back part went way beyond my last molars.</li>
            <li>The first few weeks I woke with nightmares that I was choking because it was just too much in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a serious grinder, and my teeth are worn WAY down -- so fit, and gum irritation, are big problems with most night-guards.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for certain how long they will hold up.</li>
            <li>Open the pack throw one in a cup of water for 2 minutes or until it curls, put in your mouth and bite slowly down for a form fit.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical buying mouth guards that have to be molded because I am usually not too good following instructions on this type of thing.</li>
            <li>The guard material is high quality, however it is the personal customer service that is unmatched.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: definitely not designed for bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used many different mouth-guards and this material is a little different.</li>
            <li>After several less than comfortable mouth guard experiences, I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li>I first time I tried I didn&#x27;t heat it long enough to completely soften.  </li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and used their instructions to fit the guard to my mouth.</li>
            <li>Revisit your product design and directions (which were also very convoluted and long).</li>
            <li>Having a few questions about the final fit and usage, I contacted the company and was truly surprised at the level of help I received from them.  </li>
            <li>and I found them extremely difficult to get a precise fit (I tried over 40 times with two different guards).</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful when molding the mouth guard because its hot when you put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>how you position the hot guard on the counter (and you can probably skip the wet paper towel, too).</li>
            <li>My wife even boiled the water and did all the prep-work herself, which is normally something that would be well below her status (she has a husband for such things).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I found that despite a product that fit, I really detest wearing a night guard and just couldn&#x27;t tough it out.</li>
            <li>the walls.&lt;br /&gt;Extra complication in my case was I live in Canada so shipping and getting it back</li>
            <li>The Dentek guard would separate where the two pieces are molded together after a month or so and I had to buy new ones constantly.  </li>
            <li>I found that the first time I shaped one of the guards, I didn&#x27;t,t boil it long enough.</li>
            <li>I wash it with my toothbrush in the moring and it stays fresh, it can be trimmed with regular scissors and &#x27;rough&#x27; edges will not cut your mouth.  </li>
            <li>But, I think that was because I didn&#x27;t leave it in the hot water long enough.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear- firm but just enough cushion.</li>
            <li>blahblah, thanks, Me.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Dental people: responded same day with a custom written (not just copy/paste form letter) email addressing my situation and giving me very specific instructions on what they will do and how they will do it, all for free.&lt;br /&gt;Me:</li>
            <li>good but is difficult to mold properly.</li>
            <li>The walls of the guard (inside, outside, bottom) are thick (~3 mm after fitting)</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to adjust to my mouth, but a bit too thick on bottom between uppr and lower teeth.</li>
            <li>Thick enough to prevent my teeth from touching or pushing together.</li>
            <li>The instructions were very clear and simple to understand.</li>
            <li>However, the guard still has to cool down enough to put in your mouth.</li>
            <li>: practice quickly extracting the mouth guard from a pot of cold water before you boil the water - so that extracting it later from the hot water goes smoothly when you reach the critical moment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sad that I love this thing!</li>
            <li>However, i have recently woken up realizing i was just grinding my teeth on the night guard during vivid dreams.</li>
            <li>The SISU is extremely comfortable and I can barely tell it&#x27;s in my mouth after a while it&#x27;s so thin (but still very protective)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a major clencher and grinder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m working a major project at the office and as a result the pressure has been on.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>sorry I&#x27;m not satisfied with their product and gave me the choice to order more for free  and try again or to return them!</li>
            <li>I received a personal call checking on my satisfaction with the product, wow!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I use a mouth guard, so I cannot compare with other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The seller&#x27;s followup</li>
            <li>i may try to trim the outside edges down a little bit with a hot razor blade then soften the guard again and smooth the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new unmoulded mouth guard seemed really large and I was tempted to trim it before going through the moulding process but instructions said it would shrink slightly.</li>
            <li>only complaints are that it is bulky, and i seem to drool a lot more with this mouth guard than the much smaller one i used when whitening my teeth a few years back.  </li>
            <li>I had a little trouble with the first one (They come three to a pack), but I learned through experience and easily fitted the second.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s useful in sports, but for grinding your teeth it makes you sleep with your mouth open due to its thickness.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d tried other types on the past)--no more early morning tooth pain, no more waking up to the shooting pain sensation and feeling of grinding.</li>
            <li>also state right in the literature that comes with it that they want it work out for you and will replace or return if needed (if you mess it up on re-sizing, for instance).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain about anything other than my own gag reflex and the fact that these were slightly bulkier than I expected.</li>
            <li>At first I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to sleep with this in my mouth, but no problem.</li>
            <li>I barely know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>so I fixed this mouth guard and sleep when I wake up next morning</li>
            <li>I asked him if I could use the teeth whitening molds that I still have, but apparently they are too thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it and cancelled my prior appointment with my dentist to have a mouth guard professionally made.</li>
            <li>I have barely used it for one</li>
            <li>Apparently my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover night guards, so I decided to check on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The mouthguard was far too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li>This will take considerably longer than the 5 second window you have after taking the guard out of the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Completely cured her continuous jaw ache after only two nights.</li>
            <li>Molding the guard to mouth took several tries but mission accomplished!</li>
            <li>The mouth guard itself fits my teeth perfectly, is much more flexible than the expensive one from my dentist, and seems thick enough to last for a good long while.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to push it under the mouth and behind the teeth as well.</li>
            <li>I know they can be trimmed down once made in order to help with gagging, but I couldn&#x27;t get it formed in the first place.  </li>
            <li>) There&#x27;s a section of the guard right in the middle, about where your front two teeth align but on the outside, that is rough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying these if and when I need new ones -- though I&#x27;ve used the same guard for 3 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any sign of it needing replacement yet!</li>
            <li>The ProDental mouth guards material was easily molded to fit and helped reduce the night time from clenching which was giving me bad headaches.  </li>
            <li>, I removed the guard at 16 sec, but in order to fit it into my tiny mouth, I had to pinch the two sides towards each other.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It might feel a bit odd at first having something in your mouth while you sleep</li>
            <li>It is slightly bulkier than I would like it to be, but it is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I found it difficult to give five stars only because having to wear a night guard is not something I could ever love!</li>
            <li>The last time I took it in (again, at their request) to have it shaved down a little more (which they kept insisting would help)</li>
            <li>However when i do bite down i&#x27;m still adjusting to the feeling of my front teeth being able to bite into the soft plastic as apposed to the hard plastic of the Dentek.</li>
            <li>This product is also much thicker and heavier than other products on the market.</li>
            <li>did mess up the first one.</li>
            <li>this works very well as a night guard due to nightly teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; will start to curl towards each other when it&#x27;s ready, but if they get stuck together it&#x27;s ruined.</li>
            <li>to fit, stays in all night long, unlike my previous one (different brand) that would not mold properly to my teeth, so it always fell out of my mouth during the night.</li>
            <li>Be careful about &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; too hard when form fitting it.  </li>
            <li>My first try make it too tight on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I needed a professional appliance that keeps my back teeth from touching....which this obviously isn&#x27;t designed to do.  </li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries to customize it but worth the time spent for the savings.</li>
            <li>After the first night, I decided to trim a little here and there</li>
            <li>The setup can be a little tricky, but it is not difficult.  </li>
            <li>think I have average size jaw and and in my case mouth guard covers all upper teeth with the last molar 1/3-1/2 covered.&lt;br /&gt;The key to success</li>
            <li>Did not have to waste one and try getting it right the 2nd</li>
            <li>With other products I have tried I have had a hard time fitting the mouth piece in my mouth but</li>
            <li>followed some of the advice from previous posters and lightly bit down as I molded it to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm for my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s why my Dentek lasted longer than everybody writing bad reviews, i have always used a soft brush and mild hand soap to clean it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>This mouthpiece, on the other hand, was much cheaper and still feels fairly similar.</li>
            <li>Last night, during sleep, I apparently had another clenching bout.  </li>
            <li>and my cheeks were sore the first few days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, thick enough to last, and you can fit it to your mouth.</li>
            <li>I have tried to reheat and reshape the guard several times without success, but I am still using it, just along as I keep my mouth closed during the night the guard stays in my mouth properly, but loose.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first because the guard is stiff and bulky just out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I have used my first guard (3 come in a pkg) and over the last few weeks, no problems.</li>
            <li>actually sent it back a second time to be thinned even more - I told Don to go as thin as possible.</li>
            <li>Cheaper solution than getting a guard made by the dentist for at least my mild case.</li>
            <li>The directions are a little more complicated than your standard night guard, but I got it on the first try.</li>
            <li>yes, as an extreme grinder, who could kill a high quality Dentek in a month, I totally recommend these ProDental mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>Sure I still grind, but at least my habit went from 350 dollars a year to less than 100 dollars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little large overall.</li>
            <li>The molding process is a little tricky to get a tight fit but you have multiple attempts.  </li>
            <li>The little newsletters provide very valuable hints on prep and use of the product.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and there was too much plastic even after cutting a decent amount off both the back and top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget how clumsy other people can be - unless you actually watch them try to follow the process that you&#x27;ve tried to document.</li>
            <li>The Amazon description says it&#x27;s made of a polyvinyl material, but mentally you could visualize it as a thick-ish clear silicone.  </li>

            <li> quality, good value.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion</li>
            <li> I have paid over $300 for mouth guards from a dentist and they have never been this good.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and this mouth guard will fit perfect to your teeth.</li>
            <li> It works and fits as good as the molded ones, IMO.</li>
            <li> Always good to have a backup.</li>
            <li> Good Product...</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> The price is good and it does not have bpa plastic.</li>
            <li> It also does a really good job in preventing grinding.</li>
            <li> Good product and service.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I see alots of good reviews</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a good pick, but just know it&#x27;ll take about a week for your mouth to get used to sleeping with a guard.</li>
            <li> I received them yesterday, fit them to my mouth, and proceeded to have the best night&#x27;s sleep and ZERO pain in the morning!!</li>
            <li> Good customer service.</li>
            <li> Good product and good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed by this company and it&#x27;s attentive customer service.</li>
            <li> Seems like good deal as you get 3 guards for this price</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Quality of the material is quite good.</li>
            <li> I did not have to adjust the mold as it fit my mouth perfectly</li>
            <li> but if you follow the instructions it&#x27;ll fit perfect in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Probably good for sports</li>
            <li> Good product, but does have a learning curve.</li>
            <li> and she raves over how good it is, so</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that this should be a good one.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Doctor Don makes superior products and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good chance that the sidewall will collapse either in the water or as you take them out.</li>
            <li> Price is good with 3 separate guards.</li>
            <li> and she got a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Best ever fit and comfort.</li>
            <li> Good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> A good deal cheaper than dentist office mouthguards.</li>
            <li> it was good  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of holding the gel in place.</li>
            <li> good value.</li>
            <li> Will prob good for sports but not for night guard.</li>

            <li> Great product and a very, very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get a perfect mold, even after trying with all three of the guards, but they happily thinned one of them for me that wasn&#x27;t fitting comfortably in my mouth and then gave me a replacement for one where I wasn&#x27;t able to get a sufficient enough impression.</li>
            <li> Part of that may be the precise instructions that led to a very nice fit.</li>

            <li> Works great at the first time.</li>

            <li> They even offer a link to watch a video, which is great for first time users.  </li>

            <li> This mouth guard is very comfortable to wear all night.</li>

            <li> The instructions are very important.  </li>
            <li> The guard is very comfortable for wearing at night.</li>

            <li> easy to fit, just as good or better than the one I paid 300.00 dollars for from a Dentist.</li>
            <li> If you are using for teeth grinding I recommend molding to the bottom teeth rather than the top</li>
            <li> the dentist was able to address any questions I had and he provided the solutions to them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this one.</li>
            <li> The second molding was perfect</li>

            <li> I have not found another one better yet, so I keep using this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely fits better than the $400+ one I got at my dentist.  </li>

            <li> Simply the best, most inexpensive night guard I have found.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> a mouth guard ProDental will send you a replacement, but wasn’t sure this appliedto me as I now have a fully-functioning guard.</li>
            <li> That is why I am more than pleased with these mouth guards</li>
            <li> i love these.</li>
            <li> I love that there are 3 in an order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it comes in a three pack.</li>
            <li> This one is BETTER.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the overall value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use ya&#x27;ll again. :)</li>
            <li> But I contacted Dr. Don and he sent me a replacement free of charge!)  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s as safe as they state.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for many months.</li>
            <li> I love this Mouth Guard.  </li>
            <li> It was so comfortable, I didn&#x27;t even feel like it was in!</li>
            <li> For the money especially, this is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Product better than described.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t love a mouth guard</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels better than it has in years</li>
            <li> so I love that this comes in a pack of three.</li>
            <li> Really liked how comfortable it feels and it  doesn&#x27;t feel to bulky in mouth.</li>
            <li> Im really impressed how this company reached out to make sure not only that I had recieved my product but also to give me instrcutions as well.</li>
            <li> Better off getting one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I am a grinder and this mouth guard seems to hold up better than others that I have which I chewed up during the night.</li>
            <li> glad it comes with three.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have been a teeth grinder, but did not know it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Molding experience:&lt;br /&gt;I found before molding i needed to trim the material on the top</li>
            <li> Make sure you use plenty of water to boil and use a spoon to lift up the mouthguard after the 20 seconds (not tongs).</li>
            <li> The cost is excellent - a personal cast from the dentist would have costed $500 (this is not including the dentist visit!)</li>
            <li> I wear a mouth guard ever night to prevent bruxism and have used custom made guards as well as many over the counter products.  </li>
            <li> The ProDental guard has been the most comfortable and effective one I have tried.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I made sure to follow the instructions closely as many of the comments recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> the lower part of the guard doesn&#x27;t form as well as the top part</li>
            <li> Quite satisfied</li>
            <li> Ugh, I&#x27;m sure these work well, but I couldn&#x27;t even get through making it without gagging.  </li>
            <li> I followed their directions exactly and it worked perfectly the first time.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spoken to the manufacturer many times..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats paying $500.00 for one made by a dental lab.  </li>
            <li> OK...  </li>
            <li> They are slightly better</li>

            <li> She says they are much more comfortable than all the others I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dual use as a teeth-whiting tray is also appealing.</li>
            <li> Ok well this product has everyone fooled.</li>

            <li> I love the product.  </li>

            <li> I liked that I could adjust the fit.</li>
            <li> So pleased.</li>
            <li> This ProDental mouth guard is the most comfortable guard I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to mold it to my bottom teeth and see if that does any better.</li>
            <li> They work great for nighttime teeth grinding and they are as close to custom without spending that much money.</li>
            <li> I tried to wear the one I could do to the best of my ability at night and since I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth properly, my jaw ached and I had to take them off.</li>
            <li> Definitely more for sports mouth pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to date and also the most affordable!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Dentist told me it was because this wasnt fitting correctly.</li>
            <li> Also, its a better deal than the retail stores had, and a better product.</li>
            <li> but now it is better.</li>
            <li> Works better than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> ok for the price.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there most nights.</li>
            <li> received 3 guards and fitting instructions within the promised shipping time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still to try fitting these guards</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions seem to be thorough, but I wish they had some illustrations / diagrams / youtube videos demonstrating the fitting instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was more than timely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> glad I ordered these guards and can recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li> I would say if you grind your teeth or do anything with your teeth at night you will love these.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions explicitly and first one was successfully molded to my mouth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> So pleased with these.  </li>
            <li> Love these things.</li>
            <li> I feel that upon awakening, my jaw is better aligned and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt any more.</li>
            <li> Love all the money I saved since the dentist wanted $318 for his.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to make a better choice.</li>
            <li> and I could use the protector more often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the thing on bottom teeth as those seem to be the greater problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have worn it 2 nights and did ok with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, they mold at a lower temperature and with more working time than EVA.</li>
            <li> Fitting was a breeze with trimming flexibility by the user if needed.  </li>
            <li> they want us satisfied.</li>
            <li> How many companies will burden themselves with labor costs alone that probably exceeds the profit of the purchase for this service?</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller has made proactive contact to help with fitting the mouthguard.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and what a deal getting 3 mouthpieces for $30 that actually work.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mouth guard!</li>
            <li> I’d like to say that your mouth guards have been the most comfortable, well fitted products I’ve tried!</li>
            <li> I love this mouth-guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and am really, really pleased.  </li>
            <li> The company truly cares about its customers satisfaction and I am an extremely satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and thank the inventor for this innovative device.</li>
            <li> I love the ProDental 3-in-1 mouthguard.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the &#x27;Dentek&#x27; will work better.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for one product for multiple uses; this is the best product to purchase!</li>
            <li> My dentist has even commented on how much better my grinding (or lack thereof) has gotten.</li>
            <li> I had no issues fitting it to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how it formed to my teeth, making it a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Also after the kids had braces taken off even more mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> I received these to review as a promotion and am glad to say they are quality guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was able to sleep in it with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> This product was made in the USA, which I love.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Better than any I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different varieties for my bruxism and this is the best guard on the market!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many replacements.</li>
            <li> He gets lots more use out of them than the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My daughter and i both have TMJ and was told top</li>
            <li> I am going to order more to have on hand for when we need another...</li>
            <li> The company wanted me to be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I like this from my dentist more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that&#x27;s there&#x27;s 3 in this pack.</li>
            <li> Even if it is not the right match for me, it appears to be a good product that has many uses.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how prompt delivery was, how thorough the instructions were (written and video) and how much the company cares about getting it right for its customers.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to fit after watching the video and reading the instructions, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions precisely and got a very good fit the first time.</li>
            <li> third attempt, though, was very successful</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was offered to test these for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> (I made my mistakes on the first one) Was able to get good moulds with the rremaining two.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold - stays in place - comfortable -  </li>
            <li> But this was very easy to  form to my teeth and fit well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fit and install.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li> The instructions were very easy to follow for a custom fit.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to personalize the guard to the fit of her mouth.</li>
            <li> Also very easy to mold and fit.</li>
            <li> Luckily I still have 2 more!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, got a good fit on the first try.  </li>
            <li> They were easy to form, just follow the directions, and they fit nicely.</li>
            <li> Seller is very conscious of customer service and keeps in touch to make sure you are happy and doing well with item.</li>
            <li> the directions are very detailed and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use me instructions are very detailed.</li>
            <li> I did the second one and it turned out great with a good fit.</li>
            <li> I can close my mouth most of the way at night and it feels more comfortable than on my top</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and was encouraged because I felt I was making a pretty good mold from pressing the heated plastic on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best at-home-mold mouth guard you can get, but it&#x27;s still not as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li> I made it for the top teeth to set it as that is more comfortable for most.</li>
            <li> Dr Don included a brand new mouthguard in case my wife wasn&#x27;t happy with the modifications.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with fit, thanks to the great instructions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These came in a pack of two, which is super nice.</li>
            <li> He says it forms easily and fits better than any he has had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The fitting was easy and I don&#x27;t notice it at all when I sleep.  </li>
            <li> Easy to understand fitting instructions, and I sleep without even knowing I have it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many teeth guards, however this one is easily the easiest to use.</li>
            <li> The makers are very helpful and pleasant to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very methodical and handy at this kind of stuff</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t be the price for such a great product.</li>
            <li> These guards have the perfect thickness, so they will last, and I can comfortably close my mouth.)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The key is to get it to fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions closely and - if you&#x27;re like me - you&#x27;ll find it fits better and more comfortably than the one</li>
            <li> More than that, they even offered free custom fitting if she couldn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I do not usually bother with feedback, but this mouthguard is great.</li>
            <li> We found it very easy to mold and fit and is much more comfortable than most of the night guard/athletic guard mouthpieces available.  </li>
            <li> A very comfortable fit for a night guard.</li>
            <li> It makes for a very comfortable fit</li>
            <li> and I was able to sleep fine with it.</li>
            <li> Inst. were excellent, &amp; I even received a confirmation email the day the guards arrived ensuring that I knew how to fit them-a nice touch-above and beyond typical service.</li>
            <li> But other than my paranoias, I have nothing but great things to say! :)</li>
            <li> However, I feel satisfied that I got what I paid for and this would be perfect for any of the other uses.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product and I would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> The second is very good.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to fit and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks real cheap, like 5 dollars worth of material.</li>
            <li> so it stays more secure.  </li>
            <li> (i.e., they thinned my mouth guard to better fit my mouth).</li>
            <li> I find that this guard fits just a well, but is actually more comfortable in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Great product so far (a couple of weeks into using it).  </li>
            <li> I watched the video and read the instructions and got a good fit on my first try.</li>
            <li> and once you mold them to your mouth and teeth, sleeping is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They said they would send me two more free of charge.</li>
            <li> She does not complain about it in her mouth so it must fit pretty good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I suggest trying both and see what feels most comfortable for your mouth.</li>
            <li> The ProDental has been the most comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It worked great and so far I&#x27;ve had NO problems.</li>
            <li> I still need to make an appointment with my dentist, but I know that I&#x27;m going to be much more comfortable in the meantime.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s comfortable &amp; does the job :-)  </li>
            <li> This is the MOST comfortable over-the-counter mouthpiece I have ever had.</li>
            <li> With these full mouth guards clenching force is distributed more fully through the mouth and is therefore much more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far has Been great.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s BPA free.</li>
            <li> More comfortable than the one made by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the most comfortable mouthguard I have used,  </li>
            <li> Still it needs a better fit</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It is more comfortable to wear than the one I had gotten from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I received the product sooner than expected, which is great!</li>
            <li> I had to try it many times to get the mouth guard to fit</li>
            <li> I have purchased four night guards from my dentist over the years and this one is more comfortable than those.</li>
            <li> She too was easily able to mold the guard to fit her mouth and finds it to be unobtrusive while she works out.</li>
            <li> After reading and watching the video I was able to fit it well.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This is the MOST comfortable mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I can tell that even after 2 attempts that the guard fits fairly well in my mouth but probably not as well as a mold the dentist could form, or as well as a mold that would cost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li> and it is a good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing all the good reviews, which I really don&#x27;t understand now after trying it myself.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good product and very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Shaping it was straightforward and the instructions were very detailed.</li>
            <li> Most surprising is repeated mention that any dissatisfaction with the molding procedure outcome will be corrected by a return of the guard for new, or trimmed guards by their techs.</li>
            <li> Luckily there were two others and the second one came out perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning tip:&lt;br /&gt;One very important instruction included in the package is to NOT USE MOUTHWASH to clean these platic detal appliances.</li>
            <li> However, after getting a 2nd e-mail from the company asking me how I was making out with the mouth guards, I decide to write ProDental and let them now that although I was eventually successful and now have a very comfortable mouth guard, I would feel better if I had a backup just in case</li>
            <li> Molding my teeth was very easy and fit is nice and snug (very thorough video and written instructions on how to do this).</li>
            <li> Sweet dreams!</li>
            <li> I love these mouth guards, they are truly worth the money!</li>
            <li> However, it was easy to mold to my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems while I sleep.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use -</li>
            <li> Molded to my teeth easily.</li>

            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but I found the directions easy to follow.</li>

            <li> Extremely easy to boil and mold.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of attention that goes above and beyond good customer service.</li>

            <li> The instructions were detailed and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Instead, I formed the second mouth guard it came packaged with to my bottom teeth, and that proved more successful.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to set up, works like a charm, and is surprisingly comfortable given its inherent nature.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working fine as a night protection.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but after trying both, I went with the SISU mouthguard.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Really easy to fit.  </li>

            <li> It was easy to mold to my mouth and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> that was my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and it works just fine for</li>

            <li> In the instructions it&#x27;s written that it&#x27;s better to remove the guard out of the hot water as soon as u notice the walls start curling together !</li>
            <li> instructions are very good - follow them carefully.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fit and hold up very well!</li>
            <li> works great, highly recommended, just follow the directions and don&#x27;t make the water too hot</li>
            <li> After reading the instructions I tried to get this mouth guard to fit comfortably in my mouth, I could not get it to feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected and great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> The mouth guards were too huge even when softened through boiling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and easy to keep clean..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so comfortable you do not realize that you have it in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The guard stays in place comfortably and has yet to noticeably deteriorate.  </li>
            <li> After the dentist-made guards, I had to wear the shock proof football mouth guards that you melt to fit to your teeth.</li>
            <li> These guards are comfortable, light weight, but durable.</li>
            <li> My son says these mouth guards are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Followed the detailed directions.  </li>
            <li> These are comfortable to wear, so I can wear them through the night for teeth grinding without feeling like I am losing sleep adjusting them.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard is comfortable, inexpensive and does the job for night teeth grinding prevention.</li>
            <li> Within an hour I had a response from Don Closson saying that he was sending me TWO free replacements.  </li>
            <li> It fit well</li>
            <li> This mouth guard works well (fit &amp; no allergy reaction).</li>
            <li> Fantastic value.  </li>
            <li> The owner of the company himself personally offered to have it thinned, and also to refund my money if I still wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> so I know how they&#x27;re supposed to fit.</li>
            <li> In order for it to fit your mouth, you need to trim it to fit your mouth and them boil it.  </li>
            <li> shut comfortably during the night.</li>
            <li> No headache, no muscle and shoulder pain, and they fit</li>
            <li> and now it fits comfortably in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.</li>
            <li> THE MOUTH PIECE IS COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> It took me about two nights to get used to sleeping with a mouth guard, but now that I am used to it, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable without it.</li>
            <li> No problems modifying them to fit my mouth</li>
            <li> but then it is quite comfortable throughout the night.</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions on forming the fit.</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend who had problems grinding her teeth when sleeping, she had a cheap one from Walmart</li>
            <li> (yes I read them) and having the two extra ones is a great plus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to say something about ProDental&#x27;s customer support.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with filing, rubbing, etc to see how to smooth these edges out.  </li>
            <li> Durable, flexible, stays in the mouth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> She emailed me after I got it with detailed instructions.  </li>
            <li> I recommended it to my brother and now want to fit one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> directions important to avoid overlap melt.</li>
            <li> I got these mouth guard expecting me to find them across the room, only they have been staying in my mouth lol.</li>
            <li> I mailed it to him, he immediately modified it and sent it back, and my wife is now happy with how her&#x27;s fits.</li>
            <li> 1 for grinding and/or sports, 2 lightly molded for whitening?</li>
            <li> I had another &amp;#34;grinding guard&amp;#34; from another company before this one, but I wanted a guard that was BPA free.  </li>
            <li> price was fantastic too.</li>
            <li> But the fit is comfortable, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I had been given a night guard a couple of years ago but couldn&#x27;t stand the way it fit.</li>
            <li> Even if you need it thinned, you can send it on in and they will do that at no extra charge which is great costumer service.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product but wanted it to be smaller</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and it&#x27;s a remarkably comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> So, if you have patience to mold it to fit your mouth</li>
            <li> It is quite light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Mine fit after I followed the instructions but seemed just a tad bulky</li>
            <li> It fit without having them do this</li>
            <li> The sidewalks are also a comfortable thickness.  </li>
            <li> The mouth guard fits well, and it is comfortable for overnight use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work great but had to trim a lot off as they are larger than I thought.</li>
            <li> (The company had indicated they&#x27;d replace any guards I messed up for free, but I didn&#x27;t bother being</li>
            <li> What is the best is the customer service, I got few emails from them to follow up with the products and all of the tips to improve my sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, these are fantastic for my gymwork.</li>
            <li> and, as advertised, the manufacture sent me 2 free replacements.  </li>
            <li> Fit to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t put the protector in and so decided to try sleeping with it even with the not-so-good fit</li>
            <li> There is a YouTube video on how to fit the tray which I would suggest.  </li>
            <li> I fitted according to directions and obtained a satisfactory fit.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the softened curling walls sticking together, as the instructions warns, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that important</li>
            <li> I think it is comfortable to wear while sleeping.</li>
            <li> it was comfortable to wear and functional.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product, once fitted is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great price for the functionality as compared to purchasing one from a medical practitioner</li>
            <li> No problem in getting it to fit.  </li>
            <li> I know I can send it to the seller free of charge to have it thinned.</li>
            <li> Great interaction with this seller, even though I haven&#x27;t actually talked to anyone!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to mold the guard to fit my teeth and mouth and</li>
            <li> Incredibly comfortable mouth guard that stays in all night unlike others I have had.</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheap mouth guards from the pharmacy, and they never stayed on my teeth and didn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li> follow the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li> then help him make a mold it to fit his lower jaw.  </li>
            <li> But fortunately my teeth were</li>
            <li> but with some practice I had a mouth guard that fit and worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have insurance, so I came to Amazon with a task of finding a mouth guard I could boil for fit and came across this product.</li>
            <li> My husband assessed the fit and trimmed it to fit my mouth.</li>
            <li> The guard is made out of FDA approved material that is BPA free.</li>
            <li> However, the mouth guard enveloped my teeth comfortably and securely.</li>
            <li> and so I needed a more economical option.</li>
            <li> The five-star reviews for this product are justified.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m buying another set of 3 before this company realizes what a fantastic deal this is and jacks up the price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the guards work very well for most people....</li>
            <li> product is soft and comfotable but surprisingly durable.  </li>
            <li> Good so far.</li>
            <li> So far, so good, after about two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> And the end product came back fast and fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Worked fine on my first attempt, and the guard is form-fitting but very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This thing really did a good job, even not being quite right with the jaw</li>
            <li> I did my best to cut this off (which is NOT easy) and the result was satisfactory, not</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more when needed!!</li>
            <li> Closson at ProDental was very solicitous about my concerns.</li>
            <li> After watching the instructional video, I was able to cast a secure and comfortable bite guard on my first try.</li>
            <li> I find the mouthguard comfortable and helping significantly with the grinding/clenching.</li>
            <li> First, it is very important not to overheat the mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s super easy to mold -</li>
            <li> and I was able to comfortably wear it the first night.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was successful on the third guard.  </li>
            <li> This product is very neatly packaged and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> High quality material and amazing post-sale service.</li>
            <li> As a former dentist and research scientist, I&#x27;ve found that the ProDental one is extremely well designed, works perfectly and comes with excellent instructions (including an available on-line video) and unsurpassable follow-up technical support.  </li>
            <li> If any special fit is required, you just send them the request.</li>
            <li> It does come with clear instructions and it is easy to use, just put it in warm water and let it mold to your mouth.</li>
            <li> original review was 2 star.</li>
            <li> My second try was successful and now I&#x27;ve use it for about 1 week.</li>
            <li> My neck pain was better after the first night I used your mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Well worth the savings!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get tjese.</li>
            <li> the first one didn&#x27;t work out or I needed more.</li>
            <li> My original review was 2 stars because the product didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, they are also replacing the guard that I ruined in my first try at fitting.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this mouth guard out.</li>
            <li> The first one was okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great that the seller will replace the guards if you mess up all 3 guards while fitting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is significantly bulkier than the night guard that my dentist made 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> And be sure to shake out all the hot water before putting in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how this will turn out.</li>
            <li> Instructions are fairly straightforward and worked well.</li>
            <li> and I was able to form my mouth guard in the first attempt.</li>
            <li> the instructions for much more detailed in the product itself is much better than the over the counter that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> So when a friend told me about this brand I was excited to try them..</li>
            <li> I had no problem with any of the instructions and now have a nice new tray for my teeth whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> The seller stands behind his product and will do his best to help with any problem and ensure you end up satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> By far the most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> My teeth were sensitive before and they are feeling much better now :)</li>
            <li> The fit is 99% as good, but at only 10% of the price.  </li>
            <li> I had a couple of questions, and their representatives responded quickly and accurately.  </li>
            <li> I am impressed with how accurately it molds, but the walls are too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried numerous night guard and this product is by far the greatest night guard I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The ProDental mouth guard was easy to use (had to re-mold it 3X prior to getting the perfect fit) but it was simple and it works.</li>
            <li> Good value and as comfortable as such things can be.</li>
            <li> Dr closson was kind enough to work with me to make sure this fits</li>
            <li> .The device was trimmed to fit my mouth perfectly and helps me not only sleep better but protects my teeth from nightime grinding..Great Value and good people behind the product..</li>
            <li> Following the directions closely, I was able to get a very good close fit for my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> The guard really does the job &amp;, if not a thing of beauty, is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will be buying more when football seasons starts back full force!</li>
            <li> Feels good and much better than the other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So when I was selected to receive this pro 3 in 1 mouth guard set at a special price in exchange I would test it out and post my opinion in this review</li>
            <li> Even though it is very form-fitting to my teeth, it&#x27;s easy to install and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> , consequently it&#x27;s VERY important to get it right on the first try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard is  more comfortable than what’s available from a drug store and considerably cheaper than the $350</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and ok price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t slept that well in months, and to wake up without having pain is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Just let it air cool for 5 seconds and get it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> And not painful to form-fit (unlike the dentist-fitted device).</li>
            <li> Mailed it back and received the thinned mouthguard within a week and all is good.</li>
            <li> The mouth guard offers effective protection from grinding while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, the ProDental folks followed up on me with several emails on what is required to make it work, videos, offering assistance and more guidance.</li>
            <li> This product was a bit time consuming to fit to my jaw but was well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> not as good as the second time I tried with the # 2 set.</li>
            <li> They have credited my account in full.  </li>
            <li> She says she literally sleeps better, an that the difference was very noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li> not a bad product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are easy to fit and as comfortable as imagined and I am able to sleep with the guard the entire night with no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watched the product fitting tutorial on YouTube, followed the instructions and had no problem getting it right with the first guard.</li>
            <li> They were comfortable, but in 3 nights I would have chewed right through those guards.</li>
            <li> I screwed up 2 trying to get the fit right</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to read through the instructions a couple times (and get everything ready) before custom-fitting this thing, but the procedure works exactly as described, and the guard fits very securely and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty easy to form to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty easy to form too.</li>
            <li> The instructions for fitting were kind of daunting, but it ended up being pretty simple.</li>
            <li> and smart purchase, plus you get 3 of them!!</li>
            <li> Mine was perfectly fine from just putting it one time in the hot water then take it out</li>
            <li> I appreciate the follow-up emails from MKC to check its quick delivery and my satisfaction with their product.</li>
            <li> They were nice enough to offer free replacements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to go thru mouth guards fairly quickly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a mold-it-yourself product would be an adequate replacement, but to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product, it came quickly.</li>
            <li> For a basic night guard at a reasonable price, this would be great.  </li>
            <li> but I wish I knew a way to solve this quickly....</li>
            <li> It is the most comfortable mouth guard I have tried, by far.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for 3 different uses on 3 different people.</li>
            <li> pleased with the result and the fact that there are two more to mold in the future when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend them but make sure you follow the fitting instructions for a proper fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Simple process of heating and fitting, just make sure not to over cook the plastic as it softens quickly.</li>
            <li> If you wait too long--even seconds--it tends to quickly melt, resulting in the two edges sticking together.</li>
            <li> As comfortable as they get -- for nighttime teeth grinding, this one fits much more nicely and less obtrusively than the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard, getting the job done without feeling like someone&#x27;s shoved a brick in your mouth.</li>
            <li> , it was wafer thin and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results were stellar (great fit), and I woke up without blood in my mouth from damage to gums due to teeth grinding (no tension headache, either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first mold turned out okay, but my second one is the most comfortable mold I have ever had for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, easy to understand directions, and great relief for my ever annoying teeth grinding!</li>
            <li> While this night guard did not work for me (too bulky) despite several attempts to fit it, the manufacturer/inventor did call me to offer to refund my money (despite the time lapse) or alter it to make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The first night I fall asleep with it comfortably.</li>
            <li> The second one I did have to do some fitting, but I just dipped parts in the hot water for a few seconds and worked on it section by section until it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product comes with a free replacement of &amp;#34;better than money back&amp;#34; guarantee within the first 30 days.</li>
            <li> It forms exactly to your teeth and is comfortable to wear while sleeping once you get used to wearing it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good value with minor deficiencies.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a good nights rest in so long.</li>
            <li> I had a great night sleep for the first time in a long while because i didn&#x27;t wake up with a frozen jaw!!</li>
            <li> that if you screw up the fitting just let them know and they&#x27;ll send you a brand new pair.  </li>
            <li> The material feels great on the teeth, sort of rubber like and slightly squishy.</li>
            <li> 1 tray perfect for the smaller mouth(maybe like a female or teens jaw line) soft and flexible and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The instructions were very well written and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> Watch the video to insure you understand the process, but it&#x27;s really quite easy.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast and mold easily.</li>
            <li> I had extremely high expectations for this product---and they were exceed!!!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not nearly as form fitting &amp; durable as my old one, the $30 price for 3 is definitely good value &amp; does the job of protecting my teeth from grinding.</li>
            <li> and I actually sleep a lot better with it!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this thing first!  </li>
            <li> How much??!!??).</li>
            <li> On my third try with the first guard, I got a perfect mold for the upper teeth.</li>
            <li> This guard has stayed soft during the moulding to my mouth and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I found these bruxing shields to be easy to fit, durable and as comfortable as possible.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made for a good, secure fit with high sides that hug your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with clenching or bruxism, and this has so far been THE most comfortable product I have used for my medium to large</li>
            <li> Has really helped, comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and feels secure in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The detailed instruction that comes with the guards is really helpful.</li>
            <li> I have used only one of the three guards since purchase and it still is holding up amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : amazingly, there was an almost instant relief from the ache.  </li>
            <li> They are comfortable and are very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finally a mouth guard that is comfy, effective and lasts.</li>
            <li> , it takes getting used to, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> husband sleeps with a different guard that his top and bottom teeth fit in to for his snoring.</li>
            <li> So far,  I&#x27;m doing okay adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> So over all I think this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat comfortable (a lot better after trimming it for a second time) and all but one time stayed in place over night.</li>
            <li> but if you want a comfortable night guard your better off spending extra and going to a dentist</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable thing in the world but not as big and bulky compared to others.</li>
            <li> How many will talk to you directly these days...</li>
            <li> and I rarely take the time to make reviews.</li>
            <li> However, the seller contacted me and was kind enough to give me a refund on the product.  </li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t have insurance, this economical alternative could work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no trouble fitting or using it as a guard for my teeth since I tend to grind them in my sleep.  </li>
            <li> But even if you do, you can get turn in the messed up one for a fresh one.</li>
            <li> This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable to wear all night, and durable enough to do the job!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> comes an observation some might find useful.  </li>
            <li> If you are in search of an effective product I would definitely recommend ProDental.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 18 months later, I am still loving these night guards.</li>
            <li> Not only was it made in the USA, it has another feature that I love: RISK FREE.</li>
            <li> I first received the three mouth guards, I didn&#x27;t do a good job at all trying to fit the first one, biting down (even though the instructions said not to), resulting in a guard that would not work.  </li>
            <li> By carefully following the product directions, I was able to get the mouth guard to fit my bite exactly.  </li>
            <li> and, sure enough, it fit my mouth exactly.  </li>
            <li> When I was fitting my first one I did not think I needed the mirror and came out with a crooked fit.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit my first mouth guard easily by following the instructions.</li>
            <li> Really appreciated the help video the seller made accessible.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Right now a customized mouth guard is not in my budget.</li>
            <li> and if there is any issues they will work on getting it just right for you.</li>
            <li> It even comes with a link to a video to help you with the right technique.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple of nights to adjust to having it in my mouth, but now I just pop it in and fall right to sleep.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I watched videos online to get it right, still couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a custom guard right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Included instructions provides all of the details needed to start using this product right</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> now uses the mouth guard every night right before falling asleep.</li>
            <li> Comfort Fit Dental Guard is extremely less bulky and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> + I found out that the material was exactly the same kind as this one.  </li>
            <li> In less than 10 minutes I had a great fitting mouth guard that stayed on my upper teeth.  </li>
            <li> The directions were very clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to mold, and the instructions and emails the company has sent have been very clear and helpful.</li>
            <li> Good product, worth a repurchase for me down the line.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a mouth guard that fit snuggly against my teeth although the walls extended too high up on the gums in some places.  </li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product that I highly recommend to everyone who clenches and/or grinds their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Shaping them to fit was easy, just read the instructions a couple of times before starting so</li>
            <li> This is a great way to save a few hundred dollars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I tried this before dishing out a small fortune to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> ProDental is much closer to a custom made mouth guard ordered at the dentist&#x27;s office than to any of the generic products I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li> if he is willing to stand by his product the way he does, it is worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth heavily through the night, and these are pretty soft, so I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting me more than maybe a month each, but that&#x27;ll do perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Flexible-soft, no rough edges, no latex (REALLY allergic), easy to use and shape to fit to my mouth.</li>
            <li> My new mouthguard is as comfortable as my custom guard that cost hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable knowing if I made a mistake in forming the mouthguard, I could get a new one at no charge.  </li>
            <li> Reading the material and watching the video allowed me to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tried to get the guard molded right, but once I finished that it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It finally turned out to be a good fit on my third try after trimming the mouth guard at the back edge and top.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> A quality product, reasonably priced, and tremendous customer support.  </li>
            <li> I was careful to follow the instructions for fitting them, and the fit was not the problem.</li>
            <li> Instructions clear and easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions carefully, you&#x27;ll get a good result, and the manufacturer is very helpful with questions and suggestions.</li>
            <li> The instruction is clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow (there is a website where you can watch a complete video on what to do).</li>
            <li> Very professional and attentive seller.</li>
            <li> Great product but so hard to do right</li>
            <li> 60C% of the minimal cost from your DDS to which most insurances will NOT cover!</li>
            <li> The only difference is they take your impression and make it fit for your teeth, and you use hot water to mold it to fit it for this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and I fall asleep with ease knowing I&#x27;m not destroying my teeth while I&#x27;m in dreamland!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> - I dip it in water and then slide on my upper teeth, sleep on my side/back, any way I want, very comfortable and does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two that i trimmed properly are very comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought it and delivered very fast.  </li>
            <li> I am using the guard for my night time teeth grinding, it is very comfortable and has given me relief from jaw discomfort and headaches related from TMJ .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY reasonably priced (compared to the $600</li>
            <li> In my case, I read the instructions, watched the video, and read the seller&#x27;s follow-up email, and that helped me get my night guard right the first time, so now I have two more back-ups for when my current guard wears out.  </li>
            <li> arrived very fast and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about mouth guards, and wasn&#x27;t sure that I could wear won, I decided to find out a little more before investing that much money.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were so easy to follow, and not troublesome at all ( like the other one I tried)  Not only that, but it&#x27;s BPA free, super comfortable, and has a high quality fit.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> My first try didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Mouth guard is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I simply do not use it any more.</li>
            <li> you just use hot water.</li>
            <li> First there is no way to mold this thing without biting it to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> must admit, though, that despite having watched the video twice, and reading all the instructions three times, I had problems fitting the mouth guard to my tiny mouth.  </li>
            <li> You can always re-heat the guard if you remove it from the hot water too early.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am guilty of grinding my teeth in my sleep and these are wonderful.</li>
            <li> It will be better to add more photos in the instruction to help user like me who speaks English as a second language.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the instructions to a tee and even made adjustments as directed because the first mold did not suffice.  </li>
            <li> , I knew that I was in no way going to be able to cut this without totally screwing it up.  </li>
            <li> but the second one was better.</li>
            <li> The first ProDental guard was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night since and had NO jaw pain for the first time in</li>
            <li> Worked for me on the first try doing the mold.</li>
            <li> : follow instructions EXACTLY and try to do everything on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had many different mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> have three of these mouth guards, still on the first one after 5 months</li>
            <li> The first one I tried didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> the first one lasted me three years.</li>
            <li> The material is soft and so it is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the extra mile the company goes through too with the extra emails to make sure your happy and get it fitted properly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same night guard now for more than 8 months.</li>
            <li> DO NOT be affraid of putting the mouth piece in your mouth after taking it out of the hot water.</li>
            <li> tried molding one without trimming it at all and the material squished across the entire roof of my mouth, and cooled to form something that looked more like one of those plastic orthodontic retainers you get after your braces come off.</li>
            <li> It works exactly like it is described…..</li>
            <li> My teeth definitely show the damage, so I have had many mouth guards.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> First off -&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits quite comfortably, and I have no trouble sleeping with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used two forks to get them out of the hot water and also to pry apart the walls.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Dentists don&#x27;t like their clients getting these from ProDental and not from them, but I have had no trouble molding it to fit my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Directions are self explanatory.  </li>
            <li> I love how I can use these not only as a mouth guard at night but also to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard will likely be my favorite of three brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> well the first time.  </li>
            <li> I most likely could have saved myself from a lot of dental pain.</li>
            <li> The first one is already showing signs of wear.  </li>
            <li> So last night was the first test, I went in doubting that I would be able to sleep with something in my mouth...</li>
            <li> Woke up many times with chunks of the things falling in the back of my throat.)  </li>
            <li> It comes with three and the first one worked for me</li>
            <li> The hot water molding procedure is tricky.</li>
            <li> I tried to follow the ProDental video and written instructions during my first two attempts at forming this mouth guard around my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than the one I had made at the dentist and only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Actually I think most of the saliva build up was because I would immediately put them in my mouth after rinsing it with water.</li>
            <li> On the second guard, I tried to trim it a bit before fitting, and messed that one up also.  </li>
            <li> First night, slept without any issues and every night since.</li>
            <li> I think I was a bit nervous about trimming  on the first molded form and thus it is thicker</li>
            <li> I trimmed and put in hot water to re-form</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> I used a mirror when fitting the second one and thus it came out centered like it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a night guard</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m still using the first one I made.</li>
            <li> It is my first time wearing a mouth guard</li>
            <li> My first mouth guard did not turn out well.  </li>
            <li> This one is much stronger and is lasting much longer than Ruger others and another nice part is there&#x27;s 3 in the order.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thicker than the orthodontist/dentist guards from what I have had in the past, but I have also gotten used to ones similar to these, so it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I do feel one of lips of the guard touching my gum line in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It came partly off first night.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if I should even wear it the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard]] instead.</li>
            <li> I explained that I had some difficulty shaping the first  mouth guard and had to trash it,</li>
            <li> The thing to make sure is that the mouth guard is in the hot water just enough so that you can mold it.</li>
            <li> The mouthguard is probably hot when you first put it in your mouth</li>
            <li> but it shouldn&#x27;t be burning hot.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t bother me  and it fits as if I had a professional fit .</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> We used the first of these guards on her to test for quality and functionality.</li>
            <li> They stay exactly where they are supposed and do not move around in their mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mouth guard fits well and appears to be better than the dentek mouthguard I used prior to that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> The trick is not to leave the guard in the hot water after the slightest curling.</li>
            <li> Mouth guards are used for many purposes such as teeth grinding,snoring,sports like hokey and TMJ</li>
            <li> Also included was the (at this time expected) nice letter of explanation and instruction from ProDental</li>
            <li> Although the first night she dreamed she was chewing a peanut butter sandwich</li>
            <li> my dentist quoted me) yet it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> Easy to get proper fit unlike several others I&#x27;ve tried and comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had a custom made one from the dentist which was thinner and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> That along with the instructions that came with the order made the whole process easy and clear to follow.</li>
            <li> Got them ready to return right away and ordered &#x27;Dentek&#x27; -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week, but honestly, even if it falls apart in 6 months it will have been more economical than buying a new mouth guard at full price.  </li>
            <li> The guard is comfortable and not bulky in my mouth and it doesn&#x27;t mess with my wacky gag</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine and was easy to get used to it.</li>
            <li> The molding process was easy and fast and the instructions were very clear, i also found the video very helpful.</li>
            <li> Instructions to ensure proper fit for the mouth-guard were very clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> But I just kept warming them and trimming a little bit until I got it to fit better.</li>
            <li> (so it wasn&#x27;t so deep dish) and i needed to leave in the hot water 1 second longer to get a good squishy/workable consistency for custom molding to my mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered ProDental  and other kind from Dental Lab.  </li>
            <li> This will do for after the holidays when I want to spend that kind of money on a other dentist made one or as something I travel with.</li>
            <li> It does what it states it does, but if you use it you will understand its bad for your teeth Because its not designed for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I emailed them after and said it worked great and only took me two tries.</li>
            <li> How well it works long term remains to be seen, but so far I am very satisfied with this product after using it for a month.</li>
            <li> Product molds very well to my teeth and have more protection than the last ones I bought.</li>
            <li> Total satisfied and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not only was it easy to mold the first mouth guard to my mouth, it still came with 2 additional in case</li>
            <li> My first attempt at forming the impression was easy and I did a pretty good job, but I accidentally made it slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> Instead of paying $400 to the dentist, I purchased this product, after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I figured why not take a chance on the ProDental Mouth Guard after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> They are a positive exception when it comes to customer</li>
            <li> screwed the first one up because i underestimated how fast it would shrink</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My first impression of them is that they were very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Edited (10/31/2014):&lt;br /&gt;I botched up my first mouth guard, but the 2nd one worked out fine.</li>
            <li> , I probably wouldn&#x27;t cut it down, but it is kind of bulky to sleep with if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> than I like and is a little high on my gumline, but still fit ok.</li>
            <li> I suggest for those who have this problem to use a serrated tool (I used a small saw) to cut off a portion of the edges and remold for smoothness to make this fit better.</li>
            <li> It was easy enough to trim off the excess.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the center of the guard lines up exactly between your two front teeth</li>
            <li> It is easy to off-center the back when pressing and sucking it into position for molding.</li>
            <li> I did have to soften it a few times to get a good fit, and as a final touch (thanks to the instructional video)  gently pinch the channels together while dunking it in the ice water (for a tighter fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you mess up molding the first one, there are two more right there for you to try)</li>
            <li> I have a rather large tongue and am susceptible to biting it at night.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know where all these positive reviews comes</li>
            <li> process of fitting the guard is a little tricky the first time, but the instructions are accurate and complete.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and useful, even though I pretty much knew what to do.</li>
            <li> no problems so far after several months (3 are included &amp; company will evidently send more if needed).</li>
            <li> I sort of used my first set ( of the 3 ) as kind of a test, and after several back and forth re-shapings, I got them where I wanted but still</li>
            <li> Angela sent me a new one right away.  </li>
            <li> A high quality product at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I made a perfect fit by lightly biting down after taking it out with a cold metal tongs.</li>
            <li> If one follows the directions (and knowing you get a free replacement if you mess it up), it will fit well without discomfort.</li>
            <li> It was easy to adjust to fit my mouth by following the simple instructions.  </li>
            <li> i accidentally left the mouth guard in the solution all day instead of taking it out after 15 minutes like they suggested, and it was totally fine.</li>
            <li> Their customer service seems pretty decent too.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear enough that i got the fit right on the first try.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s decent quality for the price (I played sports all through middle and high school and have had more mouthguards than I can count).</li>
            <li> I actually trained myself to stop grinding and biting through meditation, which was a huge relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see no reason to spend big bucks on dentist molds when this product is available.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the support and followup.</li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> I have found the mouth guard to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> That alone is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using the mouth guard, my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them, whether you grind you teeth or not!</li>
            <li> Appears to be very durable.  </li>
            <li> This item set up exactly as expected, and I can see why it has so many five star reviews.</li>
            <li> , I think I grind them so much it really has taken a toll on the health of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After it shrunk in the water though I found I didn&#x27;t really need to trim it.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, and the video was very helpful.</li>
            <li> It is so rare to find customer service like this, and I was pleasantly surprised at this companies level of dedication to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the $250 one</li>
            <li> I speculate I will chew to these rather fast</li>
            <li> I received this and followed the directions VERY closely.  </li>
            <li> This mouth guard works very well for the money.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> Everything else is smooth except for that patch in the middle, and I wish it weren&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed an affordable night guard that would fit properly and not fall out while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> He asked me several questions and offered free modification.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the call from seller.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night so much that my jaw hurts in the morning</li>
            <li> I really like the guards.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> but nothing really help.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I changed this review from 1 to 3 stars since their customer service seems to really care about your enjoyment of their product and they&#x27;ll try to help you out if there are problems.</li>
            <li> But this will be the case with really any mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Seller is very helpful and provides written and video instructions as well as a dedicated customer service line you can call with any questions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a mouth guard before but this is the one I would whole heartily recommend.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Fits very well</li>
            <li> is also US made and that really appeals to us.</li>
            <li> The protection it affords your teeth and the versatility of the three appliances is a real benefit.</li>
            <li> Dentist quoted me $500 on a custom molded mouth guard to protect my teeth from grinding while I sleep, insurance denied the claim, so instead of dishing out WAY too much cash, I bought these at about $29.  </li>
            <li> and I really needed another mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.  </li>
            <li> The molding process is very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However... there is a big drawback to these that I&#x27;m still dealing with:  You do need to trim these to fit.</li>
            <li> Customer support is very helpful.</li>
            <li> unit is working very well for me in protecting a cracked tooth with a root canal that i would like to avoid having pulled.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied&lt;</li>
            <li> It is much easier to speak with it in, compared to all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as being BPA free, but it didn&#x27;t actually have that claim on the package or the literature that came with the guard</li>
            <li> I really appreciated that they offer so much support and will walk you through the adjustments.</li>
            <li> Plus the instructions were emailed to me (as a video) as well as included in the package which really helped.  </li>
            <li> I really like that the mouth guards are made from a FDA approved material.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one based on the reviews and also because the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> There was no way that I was going to buy a night guard from my dentist for over $500, and I didn&#x27;t want a generic flimsy guard that was meant to fit all mouth sizes.</li>
            <li> And there is a video to show you, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> last thought..took me 5 minutes to mold and fit.</li>
            <li> I use them when I am weightlifting and they really help.</li>
            <li> (one side of my jaw was swollen, preventing a proper fit).  </li>
            <li> I have used self molding trays for whitening products but this tray is much thicker and since I purchased it for teeth grinding, I do feel it will work well for that.  </li>
            <li> Thanks ProDental</li>
            <li> Really appreciate the video and emails which helped so much.</li>
            <li> Then I discovered we can buy a mouth guard without having to go through a dentist and for way much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I found that to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> Seller is very responsive with instructions and offering support of their product.</li>
            <li> Really helps at night.</li>
            <li> Thanks for all that you do.</li>
            <li> For my level of teeth grinding, lasted 4-5 moths each, so the whole package served me well over the year until my insurance would cover permanent guards.</li>
            <li> Very satisified with this product.</li>
            <li> The overall quality of the product feels great, especially when compared to the generic mouth guards sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of molding the appliance in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I also think that the price is very affordable for the quality and quantity  </li>
            <li> I got all the things ready beside the water pot except the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it made a crunching sound, one of my teeth was not positioned properly.</li>
            <li> I needed a mouth guard because my dentist had told me that I am grinding my teeth too much when I sleep.</li>
            <li> and now I have a product that works very well.</li>
            <li> shows that they really care about my experience with their product.</li>
            <li> Really appreciated all the follow up.</li>
            <li> I do not think that she had to have it, but she really wanted it.</li>
            <li> So, you really do get 3 for the price of 1.  </li>
            <li> I read through the fitting instructions carefully, got everything I needed handy, and within a few minutes, I had a perfectly-fitting mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it says in the description, you can trim it to fit your mouth, personally I did not have to trim mine.</li>
            <li> my main concern with these Pro-Dental guards is that they would be too soft and I&#x27;d chew them apart quickly.</li>
            <li> Did the fitting process on one, came out ok but not great</li>
            <li> material is nice and springy, but holding up well -- at this rate, each guard (there are 3 per package) should last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I have a tiny mouth, but was able to trim them down easily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive and quick alternative to getting a mouth guard fit by my dentist, and so far, I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold and so comfortable, don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s in my mouth, no more grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> would leave the guard in hot water for slightly longer (couple of seconds more after you see</li>
            <li> Other mouth guards have been too flimsy or too hard (irritated my gums), this one was perfect.</li>
            <li> Once I got over that, I started actually grinding and biting MORE because the feel of the material was so satisfying to bite down on (a little squishy), which led to more severe TMJ.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with but after it has been molded to my teeth, it slips into my upper teeth very well</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that such an inexpensive device (&amp;#60;$10 each) would actually develop a good enough fit to stay on comfortably through the night to prevent teeth grinding,but after following the directions carefully it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Guess I pinched them too much as when I was done with the molding process, the mold barely covered the bottoms of my back teeth; most of the mold was pressed against the roof of my mouth and once the mold had cooled, it would not stay on my teeth, so</li>
            <li> and I expect this product to have a better lifespan than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I had extreme comfort from the start and woke up without a headache, teeth sensitivity or drooling. :-)</li>
            <li> Also if for some other reason it just doesn&#x27;t fit right they will fix it for you when you send it in.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and thanks to having 3 in the package if you don&#x27;t do it right the first time you will the second time.</li>
            <li> However, the third try was a success because it was hot and pliable.  </li>
            <li> Have not worn it long enough to know if it is as effective as the guard made in the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fantastic for me as a night guard because, even after molding, it&#x27;s very easy for me to push out</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price and, if you take the time do it right, you&#x27;ll get a long lasting product in exactly the fit you need.</li>
            <li> The instructions said if , after I got a strong impression of my teeth, the guard didn&#x27;t fit snug enough to put it back in hot water for 5 seconds and put back in mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These ProDentals have really resolved most of my issues with my previous dental guards.  </li>
            <li> If I get brave enough, I may try the third, but I&#x27;m not very hopeful.  </li>
            <li> The guard stays in my mouth all night and after 5 minutes, you can&#x27;t really feel it in your mouth as I can talk normally with this one in.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect--as far as mouthguards go</li>
            <li> the 3 sizes to choose from was nice, because i have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> I either lost my other one or ground it down and swallowed it while sleeping lol.</li>
            <li> The one I bought at the dentist has been resized and shaved down so many times, yet still I&#x27;d wake up with mouth and jaw pain.  </li>
            <li> thus I still have two more that can be used down the road.</li>
            <li> so I sent it to the company, where they shaved it down to remove some of the bulkiness and now I like it even better.</li>
            <li> When I tried it on dry, it was big and bulky and looked like it might need a bit of trimming -DON&#x27;T, once it is submerged in the hot water, it shrinks and molds to appropriate mouth size.</li>
            <li> I was not able to get a good fit with these, they are way too uncomfortable to use as a night guard, you are better off paying the premium at the dental office</li>
            <li> It fit so tight that it felt as if the device was going to pull the teeth right out of my mouth, as I tried to remove it.  </li>
            <li> Then I decided to try pressing the heated plastic directly onto my old dental impression (which my dentist said would not work) and SUCCESS:</li>
            <li> fitting process requires carefully following of directions however actually very simple.</li>
            <li> I had to dip the guard twice as I didn&#x27;t let it get hot enough the first pass.  </li>
            <li> This Mouth Guard I created fits better and feels better and is what I now use (not the expensive one).  </li>
            <li> Last night after following the fitting instructions I put this in.</li>
            <li> Not sure at this point how long each guard will last, but I&#x27;m sure these will end up being much more cost effective down the road versus dentist&#x27;s guards.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the one that they thinned for me, they went above and beyond by not only thinning it like I requested but also trimming it in the back so that I would have a comfortable fit without any prompting from me.</li>
            <li> I am a teeth grinder, in high school my friends would tell me that I had kept them up all night grinding my teeth away at night.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as an alternative to prescription guards.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mouth guard to everyone that grinds their teeth while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mouth guard.</li>
            <li> The product is of high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I did manage to mess up during the first attempt to fit it...</li>
            <li> It may be more due to my overbite, but I find it most comfortable to wear when I&#x27;m sleeping with my mouth open, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to talk coherently while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to customize to my small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one gives you 3 guards for the same cost, and works like a dream on the first try!</li>
            <li> Please note that I am not able to say whether or not ProDental would have been able to fix the original mold that I created just from my teeth, so if you don&#x27;t already have a dental impression, you may have different results.</li>
            <li> Molding was a little challenging...</li>
            <li> Also, I have intended on whitening my  teeth for a very long time and am excited about the idea that I can use this product to do that.  </li>
            <li> Simple to mold (I microwaved some water and just soaked it for about ten seconds), and more comfortable than the other sleep guard I have used.</li>
            <li> We had to reheat a couple of times but other than that it was easy</li>
            <li> this was easy to use and extremely helpful to stop a lip biting habit.</li>
            <li> When I put that one in I thought \\&quot;wow, this is so much better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I read great reviews about this product but was still skeptical about the product even after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> Had no trouble molding it to my mouth as the directions are very understandable.</li>
            <li> Such attention to customer satisfaction seems rare these days.</li>
            <li> Since then I have had a root canal and also moved so it has been misplaced on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> slept like a baby and woke up with my teeth clenched as normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have a better idea of how I like it after sleeping with the mouth guard in for a few nights.</li>
            <li> Considering the amount of time you have a guard in your mouth, the extra expense and time is worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d make sure to read through the instructions a few times to visualize the steps, and to mark a 1, 2, 3, etc.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do that M let the walls curl together for few more seconds it will make the guard softer and easier to mold</li>
            <li> One lesson learned is that you don&#x27;t need to trim the guard first, you should do the trim in the last step of the whole process b/c the guard will shrink after being heated.</li>
            <li> Small clear plastic that I soaked in warm water and put in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is not meant for a normal sized mouth.  </li>
            <li> The man or people behind this product epitomize good customer service.</li>
            <li> Mouth guard came earlier than expected :) Relatively easy to mold,must follow directions carefully.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re fine for football or other contact sports</li>
            <li> I picked it up right when the walls were curling and it turned hard pretty quickly, so</li>
            <li> I was starting to wonder if I&#x27;d ever find one that fits right.  </li>
            <li> I followed the video and only needed to cook two mouth guards to get it right, however it required a ton of trimming with scissors to allow me to wear it without gagging constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that we saved so much money and basically got 3 mouthgards instead of only one for a ridiculous price at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I will cut more off the tops &amp; will make sure to press hard enough to stretch it toward the back of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Initial ineptitude on my part led to too loose a fitting, but the product is malleable and forgives some mistakes.</li>
            <li> I could never get the other guard  to fit well.</li>
            <li> primarily got the mouth guard due to grinding my teeth at night (I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and my jaw would be sore).</li>
            <li> It is easy to get a customized fit and it is very comfortable to wear, and way less expensive than getting one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> After the dog got ahold my night guard that I had made through my dentist, I needed a temporary fix, until I could have a new guard made.  </li>
            <li> me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I tried this mouthguard.  </li>
            <li> They are bulkier than what I am used to, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I figured i would try the Pro-Dental instead of getting another Dentek since the reviews for the new denteks are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WHICH IS NEW TO MY TEETH</li>
            <li> This is new for me</li>
            <li> Then I contacted the company asking if I could maybe have one of the guards I messed up replaced, and they immediately sent me two new guards to replace the ones I ruined, at no charge to me.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping I can live with that one.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as specified and in the new condition as stated.</li>
            <li> and I believe getting this new mouth guard from ProDental was the hardest one to shape to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I used it all night the first night and other than looking like a nerd it felt fine, stayed put,and the next day no problems or soreness.</li>
            <li> When I first made them, they fit a little too snuggly--somewhat uncomfortably--but with usage everything loosened a little, and now they fit</li>
            <li> Have one suggestion, when fitting it after the boiling process, be careful with the back molar area of the mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Sent an informational email about getting a proper fit prior to the device&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li> The video offered clear, concise instructions which really helped.  </li>
            <li> The directions were very clear.  </li>
            <li> The set of instructions is very clear of how to customize and shape.  </li>
            <li> As it turned out the ProDental product worked fine for me, and I plan on continuing to use it in place of the far more expensive custom made guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth, like I do, I feel this mouth guard are way to big, go buy a  small cheap mouth guard and its will be much easier to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> After a few days to allow the jaw to normalize a little, the fit was better</li>
            <li> Molds easily and seems that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> so I went back and reheat the first mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> The instructions call for removing it from the hot water as soon as you notice the walls of the mouth guard starting to curl together.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the first of the three provided mouthguards for several days and it is working to resolve my problem with teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li> and I have a pretty big mouth</li>
            <li> I, personally don&#x27;t have enough teeth left to be able to use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one wasn&#x27;t a total loss</li>
            <li> result is these feel exactly the same as the mouthpiece</li>
            <li> This mouth guard does the job, especially for the price, but I had some difficulty with it at first.</li>
            <li> Seller sent me a e-mail with video on step by step how to use and mold guard-worked quite well as I got it in first take and now use daily any time I am sleeping.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This is big at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using such an item</li>
            <li> I have experience with this product from its predecessor, which uses the exact same trays.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest putting them in the hot water for only 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other heat and form mouthguards, and I&#x27;ve never been able to keep them in at night.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft too!</li>
            <li> it is more like 7 seconds and no more.</li>
            <li> Hot should only be for molding.</li>
            <li> Instructions suggest that the guard should be left in hot water till the edges start to curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands and these work much better</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth but found that I was better off not trimming.</li>
            <li> Then in the exact same day I wrote the review the mouth guard company contacted me saying they they r</li>
            <li> At first I thought they were &#x27;forming trays, but no, they are the actual things you wear on your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more grinding and more sleep for me.  </li>
            <li> Especially since the price is so reasonable for three mouth guards!  </li>
            <li> No More mouth guard is also less bulky and more comfortable, however in my experience it is not as sturdy as the DenTek, probably because it is disposable.</li>
            <li> I have paid so much for other brands and they never seem to fit properly.  </li>
            <li> When I received the other kind which was much more expensive $90</li>
            <li> Next time, I will just buy this product as I know the other kind was same material.</li>
            <li> AND it won&#x27;t take that long when I fit the next one.</li>
            <li> Be aware there are different styles to choose from in the professionally made guards.</li>
            <li> First night was akward, but by second night it feels natural, and I don&#x27;t go to sleep without one anymore.  </li>
            <li> I let it cool off before putting back in my mouth and molded it to my upper teeth by pressing it against my teeth.</li>
            <li> I failed to get the first two mouthgards into my mouth soon enough after heating to get a good impression.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TO ASSURE A TIGHT FIT.</li>
            <li> When I did have a few questions, they were answered quickly and completely..GREAT customer service!</li>
            <li> This has a BIG ISSUE with your teeth because when you grind your teeth is grinding on huge amount of rubber and that causes pressure on your teeth, which will soon become damaged and will cause you to loose a tooth or get a ruth canal.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t be afraid to cut the mouth guard down to make it fit better if necessary.</li>
            <li> The piece is large and I&#x27;ve had to do some trimming, but it definitely works as a guard against grinding.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than the one than the dentist made, but it&#x27;s perfectly comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> there is a little flex to them, which is what makes them comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The guards are a little thicker too which are helpful for grinders and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> This would probably be fine as a mouth guard for sports activities, but, for my mouth, it was much too thick and bulky for sleeping comfort.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult and these were definitely large enough for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Second turned out fine and the third i&#x27;m saving for a later date.</li>
            <li> I love these, instead of paying $500 for those hard custom mouth guards from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used a hard dentist-manufactured guard for many years.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to mold to my teeth, but this is definitely more for sports than for sleeping.  </li>
            <li> but  I didn&#x27;t get the desired result and they were loose and fell down easily from ur mouth!</li>
            <li> AND THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEAR AND  </li>
            <li> arrived on time and the instructions were clear.</li>
            <li> I watched the video and read the instructions carefully, and I had no problem getting the guard to fit properly.</li>
            <li> so I do like the clear ones from ProDental.</li>
            <li> will recommend it to every one including all the young athletes I know.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy in stopping the tooth sensitivity which may or may not be caused by teeth grinding since I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed a change.</li>
            <li> I wait about a couple of seconds too long with it in the hot water, but that was my fault.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is BY FAR the easiest to mold (and I&#x27;ve molded them all...</li>
            <li> It is necessary, though, to follow the instructions very closely and also watch the video that will be sent to you once you place an order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a Dentist designed professional 3 in 1 mouth guard for use as a sleep aid for grinding your teeth, an athletic guard for playing sports and a teeth whitening tray.</li>
            <li> that make them sensitive.</li>
            <li> This guard is so much nicer than one I got from a local drug store.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using them at night and so far hasn&#x27;t had any complaints.  </li>
            <li> I grind my teeth constantly and it is a real pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a custom made night guard from my dentist for nearly 20 yrs</li>
            <li> She is thirteen years old.  </li>
            <li> No big deal, really. 2</li>
            <li> I contacted their support team regarding my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> my whole mouth gets pain because the the mouth guard size itself is too big</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have to update my review, because since using this product I have developed TMD and eustachian tube issues.</li>
            <li> Like the old days when people staked their name on what they produced.  </li>
            <li> And yes, so far the soft plastic is holding up well.</li>
            <li> It is soft and fits my mouth well.</li>
            <li> I must have been clenching my teeth, without realizing it, and this was the answer to my frequent headaches and neck pain.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried and ruined two of them.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money as this piece of plastic is over-priced.</li>
            <li> We got this for our 12 year old Grandson to use for sports.</li>
            <li> With the clear instruction, my son who is 8 years old likes to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was grinding through in a week, and have been using one of these for a month so far</li>
            <li> They were just far too bulky.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before buying this and felt really unsure it the mouth guard would work.  </li>
            <li> Even though I trimmed the ends for my wife&#x27;s piece, there is still too much material left.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that I trimmed it too much, not counting on the shrinking, despite the instructions about it.</li>
            <li> I have to report that these mouth guards work really well and had I known earlier</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars as the price was much cheaper for the same material compare to the $90 one.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t push on the mold enough and didn&#x27;t indent my teeth in it enough for it to be as comfortable as my second</li>
            <li> These are by far the easiest to mold.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not going to fall out, yet it&#x27;s soft all around.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s helping her</li>
            <li> There is one unexpected benefit.  </li>
            <li> No irritation, no braces-like aches or shifting of teeth, no trouble breathing, and</li>
            <li> resulting guard is softer than the professionally made one which cost me $300.  </li>
            <li> (I was sent an email link directly from the seller after my purchase).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sensitive tooth for close to 20 years and started using a guard about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I was unaware of doing either until I really paid attention.  </li>
            <li> Which is awesome because my last few teeth whitening trays have worn out and broken.</li>
            <li> I had questions and comments since I&#x27;m a grinder - been so since an early age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been grinding my teeth for a few months, and wanted to avoid going to the dentist and paying hefty fees for a fitting.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard is just about as comfortable as the custom-made one though naturally it does not fit quite as snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I initially molded the mouth guard to my top teeth, and found out after a few nights of wearing it that the mouth guard was rubbing on my gums, creating ulcers.</li>
            <li> Seems likely to wear out sooner, but economically makes sense – especially given the risk of loss.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> It took a few trials of fitting it after the prescribed procedure, but it  finally worked.</li>
            <li> It is soft, so I am interested to see how long the guard lasts.  </li>
            <li> (I take a lot of over-night airplane flights where I’m apt to leave things behind (like mouth guards and eye masks)</li>
            <li> Nearly as good as an expensive dentist-cast, custom-poured guard (that my dog ate).  </li>
            <li> The material was way too thick to mold appropriately to my teeth.</li>
            <li> It was kind of too thick and my mouth stays open in front when I close it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see rather hollow teeth fitting area compared to other mouth guard</li>
            <li> I got it right after 2 heating tries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this to clean in a tray of water just hot from the tap and at the end of the day it had shrunk to the point my back teeth at either end and up and down weren&#x27;t covered.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other products from Dr. Don and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the products as well as the detailed instructions provided.</li>
            <li> Actually made for a normal sized adult mouth!  </li>
            <li> An added big plus is that the company is very responsive to user input and willing to thin the mouthpieces if requested at no charge with free return shipping.</li>
            <li> The instructions on this could have been a little more clearly written, and bullet pointed so you could follow along step by step as you go, but other than that there&#x27;s no complaint at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions are very clear, the instructional video is extremely helpful, the customer service is first rate.  </li>
            <li> It did take me a few dunks between the hot and ice water to get it right, but I feel like this piece is really solid.</li>
            <li> I did mess up the first one, and I think some parts of the instructions would be better with some diagrams, such as how to lay it down on the paper towel.</li>
            <li> Also I trimmed it before putting it in the hot water as the back part went way beyond my last molars.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks I woke with nightmares that I was choking because it was just too much in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a serious grinder, and my teeth are worn WAY down -- so fit, and gum irritation, are big problems with most night-guards.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for certain how long they will hold up.</li>
            <li> Open the pack throw one in a cup of water for 2 minutes or until it curls, put in your mouth and bite slowly down for a form fit.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying mouth guards that have to be molded because I am usually not too good following instructions on this type of thing.</li>
            <li> The guard material is high quality, however it is the personal customer service that is unmatched.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: definitely not designed for bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used many different mouth-guards and this material is a little different.</li>
            <li> After several less than comfortable mouth guard experiences, I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> I first time I tried I didn&#x27;t heat it long enough to completely soften.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and used their instructions to fit the guard to my mouth.</li>
            <li> Revisit your product design and directions (which were also very convoluted and long).</li>
            <li> Having a few questions about the final fit and usage, I contacted the company and was truly surprised at the level of help I received from them.  </li>
            <li> and I found them extremely difficult to get a precise fit (I tried over 40 times with two different guards).</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful when molding the mouth guard because its hot when you put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> how you position the hot guard on the counter (and you can probably skip the wet paper towel, too).</li>
            <li> My wife even boiled the water and did all the prep-work herself, which is normally something that would be well below her status (she has a husband for such things).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I found that despite a product that fit, I really detest wearing a night guard and just couldn&#x27;t tough it out.</li>
            <li> the walls.&lt;br /&gt;Extra complication in my case was I live in Canada so shipping and getting it back</li>
            <li> The Dentek guard would separate where the two pieces are molded together after a month or so and I had to buy new ones constantly.  </li>
            <li> I found that the first time I shaped one of the guards, I didn&#x27;t,t boil it long enough.</li>
            <li> I wash it with my toothbrush in the moring and it stays fresh, it can be trimmed with regular scissors and &#x27;rough&#x27; edges will not cut your mouth.  </li>
            <li> But, I think that was because I didn&#x27;t leave it in the hot water long enough.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear- firm but just enough cushion.</li>
            <li> blahblah, thanks, Me.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Dental people: responded same day with a custom written (not just copy/paste form letter) email addressing my situation and giving me very specific instructions on what they will do and how they will do it, all for free.&lt;br /&gt;Me:</li>
            <li> good but is difficult to mold properly.</li>
            <li> The walls of the guard (inside, outside, bottom) are thick (~3 mm after fitting)</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to adjust to my mouth, but a bit too thick on bottom between uppr and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> Thick enough to prevent my teeth from touching or pushing together.</li>
            <li> The instructions were very clear and simple to understand.</li>
            <li> However, the guard still has to cool down enough to put in your mouth.</li>
            <li> : practice quickly extracting the mouth guard from a pot of cold water before you boil the water - so that extracting it later from the hot water goes smoothly when you reach the critical moment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that I love this thing!</li>
            <li> However, i have recently woken up realizing i was just grinding my teeth on the night guard during vivid dreams.</li>
            <li> The SISU is extremely comfortable and I can barely tell it&#x27;s in my mouth after a while it&#x27;s so thin (but still very protective)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major clencher and grinder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working a major project at the office and as a result the pressure has been on.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> sorry I&#x27;m not satisfied with their product and gave me the choice to order more for free  and try again or to return them!</li>
            <li> I received a personal call checking on my satisfaction with the product, wow!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I use a mouth guard, so I cannot compare with other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The seller&#x27;s followup</li>
            <li> i may try to trim the outside edges down a little bit with a hot razor blade then soften the guard again and smooth the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new unmoulded mouth guard seemed really large and I was tempted to trim it before going through the moulding process but instructions said it would shrink slightly.</li>
            <li> only complaints are that it is bulky, and i seem to drool a lot more with this mouth guard than the much smaller one i used when whitening my teeth a few years back.  </li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with the first one (They come three to a pack), but I learned through experience and easily fitted the second.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s useful in sports, but for grinding your teeth it makes you sleep with your mouth open due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d tried other types on the past)--no more early morning tooth pain, no more waking up to the shooting pain sensation and feeling of grinding.</li>
            <li> also state right in the literature that comes with it that they want it work out for you and will replace or return if needed (if you mess it up on re-sizing, for instance).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about anything other than my own gag reflex and the fact that these were slightly bulkier than I expected.</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to sleep with this in my mouth, but no problem.</li>
            <li> I barely know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> so I fixed this mouth guard and sleep when I wake up next morning</li>
            <li> I asked him if I could use the teeth whitening molds that I still have, but apparently they are too thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it and cancelled my prior appointment with my dentist to have a mouth guard professionally made.</li>
            <li> I have barely used it for one</li>
            <li> Apparently my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover night guards, so I decided to check on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The mouthguard was far too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> This will take considerably longer than the 5 second window you have after taking the guard out of the boiling water.</li>
            <li> Completely cured her continuous jaw ache after only two nights.</li>
            <li> Molding the guard to mouth took several tries but mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> The mouth guard itself fits my teeth perfectly, is much more flexible than the expensive one from my dentist, and seems thick enough to last for a good long while.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to push it under the mouth and behind the teeth as well.</li>
            <li> I know they can be trimmed down once made in order to help with gagging, but I couldn&#x27;t get it formed in the first place.  </li>
            <li> ) There&#x27;s a section of the guard right in the middle, about where your front two teeth align but on the outside, that is rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying these if and when I need new ones -- though I&#x27;ve used the same guard for 3 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any sign of it needing replacement yet!</li>
            <li> The ProDental mouth guards material was easily molded to fit and helped reduce the night time from clenching which was giving me bad headaches.  </li>
            <li> , I removed the guard at 16 sec, but in order to fit it into my tiny mouth, I had to pinch the two sides towards each other.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It might feel a bit odd at first having something in your mouth while you sleep</li>
            <li> It is slightly bulkier than I would like it to be, but it is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to give five stars only because having to wear a night guard is not something I could ever love!</li>
            <li> The last time I took it in (again, at their request) to have it shaved down a little more (which they kept insisting would help)</li>
            <li> However when i do bite down i&#x27;m still adjusting to the feeling of my front teeth being able to bite into the soft plastic as apposed to the hard plastic of the Dentek.</li>
            <li> This product is also much thicker and heavier than other products on the market.</li>
            <li> did mess up the first one.</li>
            <li> this works very well as a night guard due to nightly teeth grinding.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; will start to curl towards each other when it&#x27;s ready, but if they get stuck together it&#x27;s ruined.</li>
            <li> to fit, stays in all night long, unlike my previous one (different brand) that would not mold properly to my teeth, so it always fell out of my mouth during the night.</li>
            <li> Be careful about &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; too hard when form fitting it.  </li>
            <li> My first try make it too tight on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I needed a professional appliance that keeps my back teeth from touching....which this obviously isn&#x27;t designed to do.  </li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to customize it but worth the time spent for the savings.</li>
            <li> After the first night, I decided to trim a little here and there</li>
            <li> The setup can be a little tricky, but it is not difficult.  </li>
            <li> think I have average size jaw and and in my case mouth guard covers all upper teeth with the last molar 1/3-1/2 covered.&lt;br /&gt;The key to success</li>
            <li> Did not have to waste one and try getting it right the 2nd</li>
            <li> With other products I have tried I have had a hard time fitting the mouth piece in my mouth but</li>
            <li> followed some of the advice from previous posters and lightly bit down as I molded it to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm for my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why my Dentek lasted longer than everybody writing bad reviews, i have always used a soft brush and mild hand soap to clean it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> This mouthpiece, on the other hand, was much cheaper and still feels fairly similar.</li>
            <li> Last night, during sleep, I apparently had another clenching bout.  </li>
            <li> and my cheeks were sore the first few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, thick enough to last, and you can fit it to your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried to reheat and reshape the guard several times without success, but I am still using it, just along as I keep my mouth closed during the night the guard stays in my mouth properly, but loose.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first because the guard is stiff and bulky just out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I have used my first guard (3 come in a pkg) and over the last few weeks, no problems.</li>
            <li> actually sent it back a second time to be thinned even more - I told Don to go as thin as possible.</li>
            <li> Cheaper solution than getting a guard made by the dentist for at least my mild case.</li>
            <li> The directions are a little more complicated than your standard night guard, but I got it on the first try.</li>
            <li> yes, as an extreme grinder, who could kill a high quality Dentek in a month, I totally recommend these ProDental mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> Sure I still grind, but at least my habit went from 350 dollars a year to less than 100 dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little large overall.</li>
            <li> The molding process is a little tricky to get a tight fit but you have multiple attempts.  </li>
            <li> The little newsletters provide very valuable hints on prep and use of the product.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and there was too much plastic even after cutting a decent amount off both the back and top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to forget how clumsy other people can be - unless you actually watch them try to follow the process that you&#x27;ve tried to document.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description says it&#x27;s made of a polyvinyl material, but mentally you could visualize it as a thick-ish clear silicone.  </li>
            <li> I have such bad habit of grinding my teeth at night and cannot find the right mouth guard that is comfortable for me.</li>
            <li> The reason it&#x27;s getting four stars right now is because I feel like the material under my very back teeth is somewhat thick</li>
            <li> my dentist made me if not more comfortable because they are slightly softer and chewier.</li>
            <li> He usually chews right through them in a single practice.  </li>
            <li> That guard was never very comfortable, was constructed of some kind of hard resin material, wasn&#x27;t easy to use at night, and was very difficult to remove in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Extra long (ACTUALLY FITS TO YOUR BACK TEETH!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sleeping comfortably with it for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used my last mouth guard for way too long and finally had to replace it when it started to irritate my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took a few tries in the hot water but eventually got it to soften so that it can mold to the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and large teeth</li>
            <li> On me, the guard is about a half molar short of completely covering my end molars.  </li>
            <li> I would say trim it a little at a time to be sure that it does not get cut down too small.  </li>
            <li> This company, run by a dentist, is serious about doing the right thing.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever been influenced to purchase by the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried all the Dentek (Which never last as long as they say on the package.  </li>
            <li> Those do not last long, and eventually you will start grinding your front teeth.  </li>
            <li> This thing flat out works.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t align the guard to the middle of my teeth, so it was a tiny bit shifted to the left of the center.).</li>
            <li> and I will definitely buy again as long as my teeth don&#x27;t shift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little mouth guard thieves live in my walls, I guess), I DREAD having to make another one.</li>
            <li> My front teeth have cut a little into the guard so that it sits a little higher on my gums, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is bulky and slightly uncomfortable, even when fit properly.</li>
            <li> I found that after rinsing it with water I&#x27;d then slightly dry it off prior to putting the guard in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a five star product considering the price compared to what my dentist wanted to charge me....</li>
            <li> After the cold water drench, put it in and it felt like a professional fit from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, and I can&#x27;t figure it out, but it&#x27;s rough--not rough enough that my lip is irritated by it, but enough that I notice it and that pieces shed off of it.</li>
            <li> wait few seconds till it cools of then put direct on my mouth with pressing with my tongue the inside part and my fingers the outside part and</li>
            <li> Will keep the other two new trays around in case other family members need them.</li>
            <li> She has trimmed it a few times because it still did not fit right.  </li>
            <li> husband had no trouble at all cutting them down to size and fitting them for her mouth.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I also noticed that my teeth that were starting to protrude due to the tongue thrusting are back like they were as if I&#x27;ve been using braces.</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products which were cheaper, but this one is the only one that worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to stress or just habit, but over the years my grinding has forced my husband on the couch more than once.</li>
            <li> Also - and I didn&#x27;t know this before I decided to buy the product: (1) the seller offers to further refine your night guard using dental tools if, after molding, it&#x27;s still too thick for some peoples&#x27; mouths (free of charge, sounds like you just need to pay the shipping to send in your guard), and (2) the seller will replace your product on the off chance that you still don&#x27;t get it right with the three that are provided.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem is, she is only 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; on a low gravity day (fun-sized, like those little Snickers bars) so the mouth guard was too big even after I found scissors and trimmed it for her.</li>
            <li> It was huge and uncomfortable and no way you can sleep with it.  </li>
            <li> So I purchased a small clear sports mouth guard for about $3 and used the same instructions that came with this mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I have now gone through 2 of these merely trying to fit to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheap ones and the really expensive one&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t found one yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is complete waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to a long time of use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be wanting to spit all night long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how long.  </li>
            <li> Tried all those Doctors Guards, and those strange no boil ones...</li>
            <li> (Huh.. Strange requirement</li>
            <li> Also, do not wait for too long before inserting the moldable guard in your mouth</li>
            <li> The 1st morning after using it I could immediately feel comfort that I haven&#x27;t felt in the morning in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t take the time to do what I used to do meditation, some yoga and long runs because of that, rather than drug up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started wearing it during the day, if there&#x27;s a long stretch where I don&#x27;t have to deal with people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use just-boiled water and a NON-PLASTIC spoon, and don&#x27;t let the guard sit in the water too long.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been sleeping with it for a few days now and it neither fell out nor loosened off my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and it took me a few tries but finally got it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get three of these bad boys which makes you feel good, just in case you mess up doing the impression.</li>
            <li> They even give you three fittings for future use or in case you mess up when preparing one initially.</li>
            <li> price was definitely a bargain, compared to the hundreds of dollars I spent and multiple visits required to have my dentist make and attempt to adjust a mouthguard that never fit properly</li>
            <li> I have had to deal with pain for many years due to spinal problems and unfortunately this causes intense grinding and chomping down hard on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Due to recent dental work, had to replace mouth guard, for night time teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> , I wish I had done it a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> I am reluctant to trim it fearing it might cause problems such as sharp</li>
            <li> I still have the other two spares for the next two years for replacements  too!</li>
            <li> It was also easy to trim any uncomfortable sections with sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li> Mouthwash will dry out the plasic and it will crumble.</li>
            <li> for years I have been buying the basic football mouth guards at the sports store for $1.49 each and just cutting them to fit just as this product.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s simple and only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> While this is a little bit difficult to trim and shape, it is the only one that would fit my ten-year-old daughter, who grinds her teeth sometimes in sleep.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions, before it cools off completely, dip it in cold water, for a few seconds,  then put it in your mouth and adjust as per instructions and also use your fingers to shape  it to fit your mouth.</li>
            <li> and I would describe myself as having an average male mouth.</li>
            <li> and then after the initial fitting I could re-warm and then rinse in cold water to firm them up.</li>
            <li> Too small, looks like for 10 year old boy.</li>
            <li> My old standby is past the point of no return.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really not clear why the trough for your teeth is so wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently a tooth grinder while sleeping and a few years ago, my dentist fitted me for a custom tooth guard at a cost of over $400.  </li>
            <li> They are thick enough to protect by still flexible enough to allow enough movement for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Or else it will be loose and you&#x27;ll have to re-mode it.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the previous guard my dentist made for me (for $600), and while it&#x27;s not as thin and tiny as a professional-grade guard, the company offers to thin the walls for free if it&#x27;s an issue (and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me).</li>
            <li> just enough to wear down my teeth while I sleep.</li>
            <li> and I did trim down the edges a bit with a scissors prior to making the impression.</li>
            <li> I switched to these after my bite had changed from using generic guards and it caused one of my teeth to get worn down by day-to-day chewing.  </li>
            <li> but I just kept biting down with the back teeth and concentrated breathing through my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be a customer for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my rather serious teeth grinding problem.  </li>
            <li> But I have used them for teeth whitening and they&#x27;re bearable enough to keep in for half an hour.</li>
            <li> After desperately looking for a replacement in a similar price range,  I was so lucky to find this brand on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The ProDental is easily four to five times as thick as my thin, tooth-whitening tray.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it is a little big for my husband, he loves this.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that I had flattened it against the front of my teeth more, as it feels a little bulgy in front--but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I am a female in my late 20&#x27;s and the guard is just made too big.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long each one will last.  </li>
            <li> I spent like a week researching mouth guards--</li>
            <li> I took the time to read instructions, trimmed the height of the trays and carefully molded each mouthpiece.</li>
            <li> the entire thing cracked, so I had no mouthguard for a few weeks while they were making</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully and you should have no complaints.</li>
            <li> You have 3 tries since it comes packaged with 3 mouth guards.</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> but i also expected to which is why i bought a three pack.</li>
            <li> I got it back in just a few days and now it fits perfectly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparison to another product:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these nightguards for roughly 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Those days are gone, and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It took me two tries to get the molding process &#x27;just-right&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to get the mouth guard molded correctly.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really molded to my teeth anymore after the trim.</li>
            <li> I began using the guard a few weeks ago and the change in my sleeping habits has definitely been improved!</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> My insurance coverage was all spent this year</li>
            <li> Comfort of the item was as expected.  </li>
            <li> It worked way faster than I expected, one day seems to have done it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this to take some getting used to, but it was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are roughly 3 times thicker than the ones I got from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Even though I molded mine a bit off center on one, side it still fits and performs well.</li>
            <li> Almost no one has teeth that wide.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully with the 3 guard  trying to mold them</li>
            <li> Just be careful and you will be happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is identical (aside from heavy use and wear &amp; tear) to the one made for me by a dentist several years ago.</li>
            <li> All three of the users said that there was absolutely no taste associated with the guards during the molding process or when they use it.</li>
            <li> few days later: received the mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Even after lifting my lips over the plastic, I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth completely because the plastic was so thick.</li>
            <li> but they seem thick enough to last a while.</li>
            <li> Only other complaint is these are larger than my wife&#x27;s dentist provided mouthguard.</li>
            <li> I paid a couple hundred dollars for a professional Dentist mouth guard (due to constant teeth grinding at night) and was not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why there are so few One Star reviews relative to other night guards.</li>
            <li> The expensive version didn&#x27;t help me much as it has only small pads between the upper and lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> My husband it&#x27;s a very intense teeth grinder in his sleep and and broken thru every guard he has tried in just a few days.</li>
            <li> You have to be really careful about not overheating the plastic and then to take it out VERY carefully</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone who needs a guard for serious night time grinding issues like me to get a professional guard done at a dentist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker on the bottom which will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> (Especially when the lab tech loses the little air pocket essential for getting the mold to release.  </li>
            <li> and I often suffered from headaches which were mostly due to the sore jaw that was due to the teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is helping with my dental problem as it was starting to subside by the time it came.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try as I have cracked 2 teeth and needed root canals due to night grinding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not aware of doing it during the day</li>
            <li> Now I have the other two included molds as backups.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands before and did not work as well</li>
            <li> so I usually wake up with it on the pillow next to me.</li>
            <li> If you trim them then you have sharp edges digging into your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I bought mine due to teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I am an extreme case due to severe TMJ Disorder.  </li>
            <li> Other guards</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not buy any other product for my night grinding.</li>
            <li> It is thicker and the material doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape when heating as well as other products.</li>
            <li> Even so, this mouth-guard fits extremely well in mouth.</li>
            <li> and I am starting to like the small profile of this mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I have extreme grinding craters and couldn&#x27;t wait any longer to do something.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other mouth guards</li>
            <li> After boiling the water and submerging the guard for instructed time, it still seemed a little hard-left it in a little longer and finally softened.</li>
            <li> I will spend the money on getting the other ones fitted when the time comes.</li>
            <li> for each step on the instructions, but other than that I was impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to get this product to fit -</li>
            <li> I had the other two).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a clenching challenge due to an illness in the family.  </li>
            <li> The other 2 I use for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I had to have one of my tooth capped due to wear</li>
            <li> It was too small and did not cover 4 of my back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> i gave the other two to my parents to try out (a grinder and a snorer)</li>
            <li> You simply boil water, take the pot off the heat source, put the guard in, watch it until it starts to fold (about 19 seconds for me) take it out with a spoon, let it sit on a paper towel for a few seconds until it cools off, then put it in your mouth!</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with molding, but by the third try I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to get tight fit; useable loose, but would not buy again.</li>
            <li> They were all hard, uncomfortable and had to fit</li>
            <li> Bath Beyond was a complete nightmare - difficult instructions, and only one chance to get it to mold to my teeth.</li>
            <li> (Right, little vague but</li>
            <li> found out that even though the material itself is pliable and will re-shape 3,4,5 times if needed it WILL shrink somewhat every single time you reheat it so you will get less and less coverage on your teeth</li>
            <li> It served me well for 2 years (longer than average as i read other reviews on it), but eventually fell appart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used DenTek/generic guards (not molded, changed bite), molded/hard plastic hybrids (way too large), and rigid molds from dentists (ridiculously expensive and too rigid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little off center since I did not look in the mirror as I make the mold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for teeth grinding and ended up cutting off too much in the black, but the guard is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t let my back teeth touch.</li>
            <li> It turned out that I grind to such a degree that the hard thicker teeth guards are cracked after a year.</li>
            <li> I used it last night and hardly noticed it</li>
            <li> issue is this:  once you do trim these guards, the edges can be very rough and a little sharp and this irritates the tongue while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> The sides are ridiculous thick and high, trimming it will leave sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it makes me drool too much.  </li>
            <li> I had no success with them whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it but to have caution if small mouth and plan to use it as a night guard (i.e. long period of time).</li>
            <li> My only negative comment would be that I&#x27;ve discharged it from my mouth while asleep and found it in the bed.</li>
            <li> Before using this mouth guard, I had trouble opening my mouth too wide because my jaw would crack</li>
            <li> Way too thick, way too big.  </li>
            <li> I needed help thinning out the mouth guard, and even though it was a few months after my order, it was absolutely no issue.  </li>
            <li> hallelujah they actually reach the teeth they are supposed to protect!&lt;br /&gt;2.Thick but not too thick...</li>
            <li> It seems as though it will last a while too because the plastic where my teeth meet is thick.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with it is that it seems really thick</li>
            <li> My previous night guard was a Dentek with the Blue soft/moldable portion and the thick bite plate.</li>
            <li> you have it down pat.</li>
            <li> You put it in your mouth and bite down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trimmed down the edge</li>
            <li> I tried laying down with it on, but had to take it out because I felt like gagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It probably could be cut down</li>
            <li> I woke up and bit down on it to test it</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t bite down.</li>
            <li> I emailed back and the dentist (Don Closson, DDS) offered to thin it down for me at no cost (except the small cost of shipping it back to him).  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little thick for whitening, which is what I wanted them for, but overall does the job.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few other brands from walmart - target - etc</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time with other teeth grinding products.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about these because they are thin, hard, and can be remolded from scratch.</li>
            <li> For this reason I have deleted my previous, two-star review.</li>
            <li> I have a slight overbite...</li>
            <li> I prefer a mouth guard that takes up less room in my mouth and allows me room to close my mouth to sleep.</li>
            <li> with it in, I sleep with my mouth slightly ajar.</li>
            <li> mouth guard from the dentist lasted 11 months before it snapped in half from my grinding and it cost $150 (the rest was covered by insurance).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s see what the dentist tells me in 6 months - whether my teeth have taken less of a beating from my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> but I ground thru those in less than 2 months).</li>
            <li> Typical mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I did my jaw feels less sore in the morning with this guard.</li>
            <li> However, they contract slightly as they harden</li>
            <li> These three guards cost me less than a tenth of what my copay was.</li>
            <li> A lot less than a tenth.</li>
            <li> At less than $10 per device, it&#x27;s a screaming deal.</li>
            <li> and I had a reply in less than 18 hours.</li>
            <li> In the morning my mouth feels a little sour</li>
            <li> I found that I had to trim them a little only because they felt a little thick when I put them in.</li>
            <li> In purchasing it, my expectations were not that high having had a Dentist molded mouth guard which I stopped using after feeling uncomfortable and borderline pain with use over some months.</li>
            <li> After that it wasn&#x27;t bad - still thicker than a dentist-made guard, but not bad.</li>
            <li> If you mess up one, you can try again.  </li>
            <li> you mess up (which I didn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> The first night was awkward, however by night two</li>
            <li> should you mess up.</li>
            <li> ... if you ever had to use a night guard before you know when one is so thick you can&#x27;t close your mouth, or so thin that it will only last a week.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing the guard took a little getting use to (slight saliva build up etc)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortably tight on my teeth when I put it on</li>
            <li> She mentioned it hurt and did not mold tightly to her teeth.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this is the first time I have to write negative reviews about this product</li>
            <li> but it does take a little skill to get it</li>
            <li> Took a little fenagling to get it formed to my mouth-</li>
            <li> (Pretty weird feeling!).</li>
            <li> I just wished it would be a little thinner.</li>
            <li> Three stars because it is a little too bulky for my mouth.</li>
            <li> by wearing this at night it keeps the pressure off the questionable tooth and so far it is helping!</li>
            <li> After I read the instructions, I was a little nervous that I wasn&#x27;t going to do something correctly.</li>
            <li> ....takes a little while to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, but it never fit tight.</li>
            <li> I woke up the past week with less pain in my jaw and less clicking.</li>
            <li> In the morning, it felt like I had been wearing corrective braces and after a few months, I lost a crown.</li>
            <li> Save me few hundreds dollars going for a custom made one.</li>
            <li> the dentist was asking- give it a few days to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble getting the mold on my teeth without having pains.</li>
            <li> Because it does not really fit my mouse.</li>
            <li> These seem like cheap Wal-mart crap.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes for me to adjust to wearing it</li>
            <li> I just needed something thin to prevent my nighttime jaw clenching while wearing an upper retainer from damaging my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Its bulky and not comfortable.</li>
            <li> After wearing a CVS bought mouth guard for a few weeks, her jaws become locked in the morning.  </li>
            <li> And so when I clench my teeth at night the pressure is still concentrated on those few teeth that contact the pads.  </li>
            <li> but after a few nights I got accustom to it.</li>
            <li> It took a few nights to get used to using the guard, and now I don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li> Took a few minutes to get over the gag reflex</li>
            <li> A few days after placing my order I was sent an email with a video on how to make the mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> wait few seconds then put in ur mouth and start pressing on it abd</li>
            <li> After our phone conversation, I received  a replacement mouth guard in a few days.</li>
            <li> We heated a pan of water to a pre boil on the stove then submerged the guard for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it was still soft but not comfortable as it felt like my tongue had no room in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I did need to cut a few areas down because of a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Extremely bulky, hard to mold and not comfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> My front teeth are really veneers (expensive veneers!),.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find a mouth guard for kids.  </li>
            <li> I was so scared I would somehow mess this up, but I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It stays tight all night doesn&#x27;t bother my sleep and has stopped my teeth clenching and grinding!</li>
            <li> I am a pretty bad grinder.</li>
            <li> have woken up everyday the past 2-3 years with a sore and aching jaw and a headache that lasted almost all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick, but does slim down after applying some pressure during the molding process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little wary about sticking plastic in my mouth, and essentially chewing on it every night.  </li>
            <li> I prefer its feel while sleeping in comparison to the previous, $700 hard dental splint that I lost.</li>
            <li> Just for the simple fact I grind my teeth at night and wake up with such bad pains.</li>
            <li> combination of slow reflexes and a steep learning curve resulted in two globs of soft plastic that, while one might consider them pieces of found art, are useless as night guards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the other 2 disposable ones for a few months but my grinding was getting worse.</li>
            <li> A little bit too thick to wear and keep my mouth</li>
            <li> Does what I needed, although it does seems a little thick.</li>
            <li> If you are using these as a nite guard they are a little too thick.  </li>
            <li> The device is a little thick.</li>
            <li> material is too hard and does not fit well.</li>
            <li> In the past, I had my dentist make mouth guards to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I ever went to the dentist and paid hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth too(no comment from husband and kids).&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping</li>
            <li> I have been using it every night for the past couple of weeks</li>
            <li> My experience is that this ProDental mouth guard is way too big and uncomfortable for me to wear.</li>
            <li> I usually start using it as i read a book in bed before falling asleep and after 5 minutes</li>
            <li> My mouth is really small</li>
            <li> I was not able to use these mouth guards because they were so bulky</li>
            <li> I have quite a small mouth</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the issue, though it usually takes about 4 nights of trimming, then trying, then trimming, then trying, etc until you get it</li>
            <li> I do have a small mouth (even after having a few teeth removed from overcrowding!)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable, but not enough for me to not use the product at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about durability yet</li>
            <li> I had no more soreness when I woke</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, so</li>
            <li> To give you a sense of how thin they are, with your mouth closed</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> and small..</li>
            <li> Literally took me no more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> grind my teeth at night which has cause tooth damage in the past.</li>
            <li> My one big complaint with them is they get very hard in a short time and then become very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> (If you ask Don to thin them (see below), don&#x27;t bother trying to thin the walls yourself when molding it - just make a simple impression and let Don do all the thinning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am so sorry that I waited so long to try this guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel nauseated for half a day.</li>
            <li> Also, it was difficult to get used to sleeping with the guard at night because I couldn&#x27;t fully close my mouth and found myself getting a dry throat and mouth.</li>
            <li> It is a little tough to make the mold.  </li>
            <li> It is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is hard to form to a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> Its hard to mold although watching the clip on their website and reading the instructions.</li>
            <li> Hard to form, but I&#x27;ve never done it before.  </li>
            <li> I wear it at night to protect my teeth from clenching, and can be hard on guards.  </li>
            <li> I like how they aren&#x27;t hard plastic</li>
            <li> Way too hard on the sides</li>
            <li> I put it in a case for hard times.</li>
            <li> Overcoming this is hard: I had to squeeze all three surfaces of the guard against my teeth using my fingers.</li>
            <li> and the thing I did was I pushed the mouthguard hard towards my teeth and gums so that I can get it to mold.</li>
            <li> I can hardly close my lips over it.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were hard to follow.</li>
            <li> the material was a little thin,</li>
            <li> However, the instruction is a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> I had a rough time with the instructions (I failed to pull it out of the boiling water in time and the sides folded up.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;1&amp;#34;, no need for cutting.  </li>
            <li> However, the plastic was too thick for my mouth.</li>
            <li> They are too thick, not meant or to be used for night grinding...</li>
            <li> Be warned that it is quite thick, so I can&#x27;t close my mouth all the way</li>
            <li> but they were just too thick and bulky - basically a glorified sports mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> Yeah don&#x27;t waste your money on those thin bar ones</li>
            <li> Because I hate it so much I decided to try these mouth guards from pro dental</li>
            <li> But all that aside, these guards are just too thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the thick walls</li>
            <li> I think this is because the occlusal face is somewhat thick and because they are compressible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> The thing didn&#x27;t feel right with or without boiling, and I was so desperate for a guard I ended up cutting the bottom part off to use it.  </li>
            <li> THAT was expensive, and I think it was due to the bite guard.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to take this to mean that they are working well for her.  </li>
            <li> no more teeth grinding for me!</li>
            <li> No more grinding teeth for me.!  </li>
            <li> Produce a decent product without bribing the fan base.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t fallow the last 2 steps , cold water and hot water again then another time cold water !!</li>
            <li> Out of the 3 I only managed to make one that is very uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Several years ago my dentist made me a (very expensive) custom mouth guard</li>
            <li> but i do have a very small mouth, so the guard is bulky.  </li>
            <li> and when you cut it down to size the edges can sometimes rub against your mouth or gums which is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting the thin hard plastic ones that you get from the dentist keep looking</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> You see, it&#x27;s like a chain reaction; and not a good one at that.</li>
            <li> this product is not really good.</li>
            <li> It turns out that although I don&#x27;t actually grind my teeth I do &amp;#34;clench&amp;#34; which was causing some nerve pain, emulating a non existent, painful cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The takeaway here is to use cold water when cleaning, not hot.  </li>
            <li> My point was that this product is no more uncomfortable than the custom-made ones.</li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s what my wife thinks!).  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do, which is stop me from grinding my teeth causing terrible headaches and dental issues.</li>
            <li> I have at least 3 years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very thick and big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more morning head/jaw aches!!</li>
            <li> I very much expected to become frustrated trying to mold the mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> I shaped my mouth guards, I did find them bulky in my mouth, so contacted MKC and took them up on their offer to thin</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t even close to wearing thin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately two years.</li>
            <li> Dr Don reads these reviews, and responded to mine with an offer to trim and thin my wife&#x27;s at no charge to us.</li>
            <li> I purchased my guard approximately 2 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> And it still won&#x27;t be thin.</li>
            <li> He called me at home offering to thin the impression at his lab for no additional charge.</li>
            <li> The thinned surface had a cat&#x27;s tongue texture, which initially was annoying, but it&#x27;s smoothed over time and I no longer notice</li>
            <li> Not the least bit uncomfortable in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I used to grind my teeth just terribly at night and would wake up with a sore jaw and achy teeth particularly on one side in the morning.</li>
            <li> but, very thick and uncomfortable to wear...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;good\\&quot; one felt awful in my mouth compared to a professionally made guard.</li>
            <li> Every mouth guard I have tried has been very uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> He now wishes he would have got these a long time ago before his teeth got so bad!</li>
            <li> This material was hard as a rock and also hurt my gums so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even wear not even for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like those horrid hard heavy duty ones you get from the dentist, or that evil</li>
            <li> Though the process sounded quite complex, it turned out not to be bad.  </li>
            <li> They feel uncomfortable to me..</li>
            <li> I bought the ProDental mouthguard when my expensive, dentist-molded mouthguard got lost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> They caused headaches and were uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I needed an alternative to the expensive mouth guard the dentist suggested-</li>
            <li> I was recently intended by my dentist that I am grinding my teeth horribly.</li>
            <li> She is horrible at grinding her teeth in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> After 1 fail, I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I was having chronic headaches, and terrible upper shoulder and arm pain</li>
            <li> It was initially difficult for me to get a quality mold.  </li>
            <li> That is an expensive problem.</li>
            <li> It does the job in comparison to the expensive one my dentist wanted to do.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong making this purchase.</li>
            <li> The moulding process is somewhat tedious than what you would expect.</li>
            <li> and the it was so uncomfortable I never used it.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that the process was too complicated, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I also tried getting custom made ones from the dentist, but those are expensive, and the molding process is really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t sleep at all because it was so uncomfortable in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Basically any type of tray you have in your mouth is going to be somewhat uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> They are basically useless.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth horribly at night and haven&#x27;t had any tooth pain, jaw ache, or middle of the night wakeups associated with tooth grinding since I started wearing this</li>
            <li> We have tried others before but the product failed to reach our needs.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to thin it yourself.</li>
            <li> Thick cushioned base to prevent pain in jaw and muscles.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t tend to get the horrible smell that some other mouthguards get after awhile (even after washing).</li>
            <li> It has cut down on the horrible noise and the affect on her teeth.</li>
            <li> really disappointing they send 3 pcs</li>
            <li> My experience was disappointing.</li>
            <li> but you will sometimes end up with some crazy colors</li>
            <li> i mean it works !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated that mouth guard as it was made of a hard plastic that was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Expensive!  </li>
            <li> Usually I would use Dentek nightguard because I grind my teeth horribly while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I somehow feel guilty that I never responded!</li>
            <li> If you bit it while molding it, the front will bulge out, which make it very uncomfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had custom dental night guard (durable but very expensive).</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable, bulky.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth badly and this product works</li>
            <li> I noticed my jaw would be out of alignment on bad nights.</li>
            <li> That one continues to shrink over time and is exceedingly painful to wear -</li>
            <li> My daughter, unfortunately has also inherited this horrible habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because in the instructions I have been told I need to put it for couple seconds in a boiled water.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> My daughter grinds her teeth so bad!</li>
            <li> but I hated the bulk,</li>
            <li> I felt very disappointed and felt bad for wasting 30$ for nothing!</li>
            <li> believe that my teeth grinding is one of the reasons that I have horrible teeth</li>
            <li> Additionally, I was so disgusted at the taste and feel of my teeth when I removed it in the morning</li>
            <li> (I grind my teeth terribly at night.)  </li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who grinds his teeth horribly at night.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for my temporary needs.  After the dog got ahold my night guard that I had made through my dentist, I needed a temporary fix, until I could have a new guard made.  I grind my teeth heavily through the night, and these are pretty soft, so I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting me more than maybe a month each, but that&#x27;ll do perfectly.  Follow the directions, and you should get a darn good fit.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> works great, highly recommended, just follow the directions and don&#x27;t make the water too hot</li>
            <li> Great product. They&#x27;re a little thick for whitening, which is what I wanted them for, but overall does the job.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions exactly.  It works perfectly.  Don&#x27;t bother trimming.  My wife is petite and i trimmed 1/4 inch and it was already too short.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing a dentist made guard for over ten years and I am so sorry that I waited so long to try this guard.&lt;br /&gt;It is so comfortable you do not realize that you have it in place.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to every one including all the young athletes I know.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The molding process is a little tricky to get a tight fit but you have multiple attempts.  Also, the manufacturer instructions state that if you screw up the fitting just let them know and they&#x27;ll send you a brand new pair.  If you are using for teeth grinding I recommend molding to the bottom teeth rather than the top so it stays more secure.  I see no reason to spend big bucks on dentist molds when this product is available.  I&#x27;ll buy again once these three bite the dust.</li>
            <li> Fits well , no issues</li>
            <li> My first try didn&#x27;t go well. And I followed the lengthy directions to the T. It&#x27;s uncomfortably tight on my teeth when I put it on and I can&#x27;t fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Works great, make sure to read the directions thoroughly before forming.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night guard because I&#x27;ve noticed that I often wake up grinding my teeth. I can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy in stopping the tooth sensitivity which may or may not be caused by teeth grinding since I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed a change. However, it was easy to mold to my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems while I sleep.</li>
            <li> I use my mouth guards for teeth whitening.  They are pretty easy to form to my mouth.  I use them together with a teeth whitening gel.  The guard stays in place comfortably and has yet to noticeably deteriorate.  I appreciate that I was granted a discount to share my honest opinion of this quality product.</li>
            <li> I am a grinder and clench my teeth during sleep. In the past, I had my dentist make mouth guards to sleep in. They were comfortable, but in 3 nights I would have chewed right through those guards. After the dentist-made guards, I had to wear the shock proof football mouth guards that you melt to fit to your teeth. Now, those are bulky, but would last for several months, like 8 months or so. Presently, I am very happy to report the ProDental Mouth guards are not bulky and are comfortable. I have used my first guard (3 come in a pkg) and over the last few weeks, no problems. These guards are comfortable, light weight, but durable. Finally a mouth guard that is comfy, effective and lasts. I am very happy to have found this. The guard stays in my mouth all night and after 5 minutes, you can&#x27;t really feel it in your mouth as I can talk normally with this one in.  Happy camper, here!!!!</li>
            <li> I had extremely high expectations for this product---and they were exceed!!! The guard material is high quality, however it is the personal customer service that is unmatched. Don the dentist was able to address any questions I had and he provided the solutions to them (i.e., they thinned my mouth guard to better fit my mouth). I spent like a week researching mouth guards--I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, but much thicker than I desire. They feel uncomfortable to me.. I think thee are best for sports use.</li>
            <li> I was not able to get a good fit with these, they are way too uncomfortable to use as a night guard, you are better off paying the premium at the dental office</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I very much expected to become frustrated trying to mold the mouth guard.  I first time I tried I didn&#x27;t heat it long enough to completely soften.  The second molding was perfect so I went back and reheat the first mouth guard.  It came out perfect as well.  I find the device to be very comfortable and snug when wearing it at night.  It is hardly noticeable. Great product and a very, very affordable price.  Believe it or not, it was recommended by my dentist by name.  If I would have purchased a night guard at the dental office, it would have cost me $450!!!  Thanks for the support and followup.</li>
            <li> This is a good product with outstanding follow-up service and generally good instruction. I failed to get the first two mouthgards into my mouth soon enough after heating to get a good impression. However, the third try was a success because it was hot and pliable.  It stays tight all night doesn&#x27;t bother my sleep and has stopped my teeth clenching and grinding!</li>
            <li> I bought the ProDental mouthguard when my expensive, dentist-molded mouthguard got lost. Shaping it was straightforward and the instructions were very detailed. My new mouthguard is as comfortable as my custom guard that cost hundreds of dollars and I can wear it all night. It feels very sturdy, too. And I have 2 spares that came with the ProDental guard in case one is lost or worn out. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Not too big and obstructive. The directions are a little more complicated than your standard night guard, but I got it on the first try.</li>
            <li> My daughter grinds her teeth so bad! These are excellent! Definitely a great buy!!</li>
            <li> It is hard to form to a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I purchased these mouth guards for my son after reading consumers reviews on numerous mouth guards on the market. I am so happy with the products as instructions that came with the products are easy to follow. My son says these mouth guards are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good price and product. Heat for shortest time to avoid collapse.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and ok price. For a Product that claims to be effective for teeth grinding I had to take several measure to make this product work for me. After repeatedly following the instructions to mold it to my teeth It still had that bulky feel that would keep my mouth slightly open at night often leading me to taking it out while sleeping.  I suggest for those who have this problem to use a serrated tool (I used a small saw) to cut off a portion of the edges and remold for smoothness to make this fit better.</li>
            <li> Mouth guard is exactly as described. It saved me over 500 dollars, which is what my dentist wanted for a traditional night guard (not covered by my dental insurance).</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and got an excellent fit.  I have been using a mouth guard from my dentist until I recently lost it.  I find that this guard fits just a well, but is actually more comfortable in my mouth.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards work as advertised. Be sure to read and closely follow the instructions. The follow-up from the vendor has been excellent. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to fit and is comfortable.  However, I bite on it and it only lasts about 2 weeks if I use if every night.  I have not found another one better yet, so I keep using this one.  It&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> While this night guard did not work for me (too bulky) despite several attempts to fit it, the manufacturer/inventor did call me to offer to refund my money (despite the time lapse) or alter it to make it more comfortable. This is the kind of attention that goes above and beyond good customer service. For this reason I have deleted my previous, two-star review. I feel customers can safely order this product, knowing that they will get superior service for their money. Such attention to customer satisfaction seems rare these days.</li>
            <li> Great product so far (a couple of weeks into using it).  I did manage to mess up during the first attempt to fit it...I wait about a couple of seconds too long with it in the hot water, but that was my fault.  Second time around worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely fits better than the $400+ one I got at my dentist.  That one continues to shrink over time and is exceedingly painful to wear - I simply do not use it any more.</li>
            <li> Thankful these are easy to use and work well! I&#x27;ve only been grinding my teeth for a few months, and wanted to avoid going to the dentist and paying hefty fees for a fitting. These are easy to use - you just use hot water. Love them!</li>
            <li> The seller stands behind his product and will do his best to help with any problem and ensure you end up satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, good value.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: practice quickly extracting the mouth guard from a pot of cold water before you boil the water - so that extracting it later from the hot water goes smoothly when you reach the critical moment.</li>
            <li> I have found the mouth guard to be very helpful. It finally turned out to be a good fit on my third try after trimming the mouth guard at the back edge and top. It stays in without difficulty and has resulted in elimination of discomfort and the sensation that my jaw slipped out of alignment. The little newsletters provide very valuable hints on prep and use of the product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Seems to be made of sturdy material. Molded to my teeth easily.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!!! I have paid over $300 for mouth guards from a dentist and they have never been this good. They caused headaches and were uncomfortable. This mouth guard is very comfortable to wear all night. I barely know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are the best. Follow the directions and this mouth guard will fit perfect to your teeth. It does mine, no need to hold it in with my bottom teeth it stays where you want it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know where all these positive reviews comes from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is complete waste of my time and money. I read the instruction and watch the video.  First there is no way to mold this thing without biting it to keep it in place.  If you bit it while molding it, the front will bulge out, which make it very uncomfortable to wear.  The sides are ridiculous thick and high, trimming it will leave sharp edges.  Out of the 3 I only managed to make one that is very uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a night guard go to the dentist or order from a dental lab that sends you a molding kit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, outstanding follow up by the company.  Has really helped, comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Followed the detailed directions.  Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I tried the drugstore version. No good. I tried the one the dentist made (for $300+). In the morning, it felt like I had been wearing corrective braces and after a few months, I lost a crown. THAT was expensive, and I think it was due to the bite guard. Then I tried the ProDental Mouth Guard. I am very happy with it. I watched the video and read the instructions and got a good fit on my first try. After the first night, I decided to trim a little here and there and now it is just fine. A little thicker than the one than the dentist made, but it&#x27;s perfectly comfortable to sleep with. It does not irritate my gums or put pressure on my crowns. Fantastic! Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Simply the best, most inexpensive night guard I have found. Very comfortable and sturdy. There&#x27;s a reason why there are so few One Star reviews relative to other night guards. It works and fits as good as the molded ones, IMO.</li>
            <li> Works perfect just follow the instructions provided.</li>
            <li> Beats $300 at the dentist office. Easy instructions and 3 come in the set. Always good to have a backup.</li>
            <li> Good Product... one product, multiple use. Great</li>
            <li> The mount guard is easy to mount after I read the instruction. The first night I fall asleep with it comfortably. However, in the morning when I woke up, I felt dizzy and my teeth were sore. I feel nauseated for half a day. I stopped wearing it.</li>
            <li> Have not worn it long enough to know if it is as effective as the guard made in the dentist&#x27;s office. However, I am very pleased with the quality of the product and detail of instructions provided. Even if it is not the right match for me, it appears to be a good product that has many uses.</li>
            <li> These are comfortable to wear, so I can wear them through the night for teeth grinding without feeling like I am losing sleep adjusting them. These set of molds are similar ones that I got at my dentist office. Shaping them to fit was easy, just read the instructions a couple of times before starting so you have it down pat. I have a tiny mouth, but was able to trim them down easily. I can&#x27;t wait to use them for whitening, they stay in well and I think will hold the whitening formula in place.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Not sure why I ever went to the dentist and paid hundreds of dollars. This mouth guard is comfortable, inexpensive and does the job for night teeth grinding prevention.</li>
            <li> Works well. Also appreciate that it came with multiple!</li>
            <li> I have a slight overbite...just enough to wear down my teeth while I sleep. So, I&#x27;ve been wearing a night guard for a while now. Every time I lose one (and I have NO idea how I lose them...little mouth guard thieves live in my walls, I guess), I DREAD having to make another one. First off, this product is at a great price... AND you get 3 guards!! Also, it is BY FAR the easiest to mold (and I&#x27;ve molded them all...the ones from walgreens, target, you name it). Love it!</li>
            <li> I had a set custom made at the dentist for $200. It wore out after a year so I decided to look for a cheaper alternative. This mouth guard is just about as comfortable as the custom-made one though naturally it does not fit quite as snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It definitely takes some time to get used to having something in your mouth. This was the case when I was using the custom-made mouth guard. My point was that this product is no more uncomfortable than the custom-made ones.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  The guard is  more comfortable than what’s available from a drug store and considerably cheaper than the $350 my dentist wanted to custom mold one.  It is necessary, though, to follow the instructions very closely and also watch the video that will be sent to you once you place an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, though, that despite having watched the video twice, and reading all the instructions three times, I had problems fitting the mouth guard to my tiny mouth.  First, it is very important not to overheat the mouth guard.  The instructions call for removing it from the hot water as soon as you notice the walls of the mouth guard starting to curl together.  I removed the mouth guard at 18 seconds when I saw that the side walls were starting to curl together.  The side walls, though, are quite a bit thicker than the front walls and by the time I had removed the guard from the water, the front walls had curled together and the guard was ruined.  So, err on the side of caution.  You can always re-heat the guard if you remove it from the hot water too early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my second attempt, I removed the guard at 16 sec, but in order to fit it into my tiny mouth, I had to pinch the two sides towards each other.  Guess I pinched them too much as when I was done with the molding process, the mold barely covered the bottoms of my back teeth; most of the mold was pressed against the roof of my mouth and once the mold had cooled, it would not stay on my teeth, so this guard also went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third attempt, though, was very successful and I ended up with a mouth guard that fit snuggly against my teeth although the walls extended too high up on the gums in some places.  It was easy enough to trim off the excess.  I’ve now been wearing the mouth guard nightly for almost two weeks and it fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I know that if you mis-mold a mouth guard ProDental will send you a replacement, but wasn’t sure this appliedto me as I now have a fully-functioning guard. However, after getting a 2nd e-mail from the company asking me how I was making out with the mouth guards, I decide to write ProDental and let them now that although I was eventually successful and now have a very comfortable mouth guard, I would feel better if I had a backup just in case I lose it.  (I take a lot of over-night airplane flights where I’m apt to leave things behind (like mouth guards and eye masks) so I like to travel with backups of those things.  I asked ProGuard if they could possibly send me another guard.  Within an hour I had a response from Don Closson saying that he was sending me TWO free replacements.  He also said that after I molded them, if they needed additional trimming or smoothing, he would do it at no charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a company that clearly stands by their product and will go to great lengths to make sure the consumer is happy.</li>
            <li> I needed an alternative to the expensive mouth guard the dentist suggested- this is the perfect solution! Easy to use/mold and an inexpensive solution to my teeth grinding!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Molding the guard to mouth took several tries but mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> The customer service that comes with this product is excellent. I wasn&#x27;t able to get a perfect mold, even after trying with all three of the guards, but they happily thinned one of them for me that wasn&#x27;t fitting comfortably in my mouth and then gave me a replacement for one where I wasn&#x27;t able to get a sufficient enough impression. For the one that they thinned for me, they went above and beyond by not only thinning it like I requested but also trimming it in the back so that I would have a comfortable fit without any prompting from me. They&#x27;re also very quick to respond to email. Outstanding service!</li>
            <li> This is a Dentist designed professional 3 in 1 mouth guard for use as a sleep aid for grinding your teeth, an athletic guard for playing sports and a teeth whitening tray. I personally wanted it for use as a night guard because I grind my teeth at night. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to stress or just habit, but over the years my grinding has forced my husband on the couch more than once. (and so has his snoring, but that&#x27;s another topic). So when I was selected to receive this pro 3 in 1 mouth guard set at a special price in exchange I would test it out and post my opinion in this review, I was very happy. You see, I had a $300 mouth guard made by my Dentist about 4 years ago. Since then I have had a root canal and also moved so it has been misplaced on more than one occasion. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so great about this product. There are 3 mouth guards! Yes, 3! So, if by chance I misplace one or have dental work, I always have a back up mouth guard. That alone is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using the mouth guard, my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive. I think for all the years I&#x27;ve been grinding I put some tiny cracks in my teeth that make them sensitive. Also, my jaw isn&#x27;t as sore when I wake up in the morning. Before using this mouth guard, I had trouble opening my mouth too wide because my jaw would crack and I often suffered from headaches which were mostly due to the sore jaw that was due to the teeth grinding. You see, it&#x27;s like a chain reaction; and not a good one at that. That is why I am more than pleased with these mouth guards and I would highly recommend them, whether you grind you teeth or not!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, got a good fit on the first try.  Appears to be very durable.  Looking forward to a long time of use.</li>
            <li> i love these. I am guilty of grinding my teeth in my sleep and these are wonderful. I love that there are 3 in an order. they are easy to trim to fit. and once you mold them to your mouth and teeth, sleeping is much more comfortable. plus my husband doesn&#x27;t complain that im waking him up with the grinding. lol. I will be buying these again. 2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> This item set up exactly as expected, and I can see why it has so many five star reviews. Great value and service from this seller. I have been using the first of the three provided mouthguards for several days and it is working to resolve my problem with teeth grinding.  It is so nice to deal with a quality product and organization.</li>
            <li> This guard is so much nicer than one I got from a local drug store.  The directions were very clear.  I am impressed that the company is so interested in a good experience that you can send your guard to them to be modified if you have difficulties. The price is good and it does not have bpa plastic.</li>
            <li> It fit well and I sleep with it for avoiding grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Ordered it on Dec 8 with prime no rush shipping and received it on the 12th. Well packed and protected with padded envelope. I am a pretty bad grinder. My teeth are worn done. Therefore, I decided to try this product. This mouth guard works well (fit &amp; no allergy reaction). However, the instruction is a bit confusing. It will be better to add more photos in the instruction to help user like me who speaks English as a second language.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mold - stays in place - comfortable -  this is a fantastic product that I highly recommend to everyone who clenches and/or grinds their teeth.  A very similar product purchased through my dentist costs over $200.  3 mouth guards for $30 through ProDental - my newest favorite purchase!!</li>
            <li> I followed all of the instructions to a tee and even made adjustments as directed because the first mold did not suffice.  The mouth guard is just too big for me and I have a pretty big mouth (at least that&#x27;s what my wife thinks!).  I prefer a mouth guard that takes up less room in my mouth and allows me room to close my mouth to sleep.</li>
            <li> I am gonna be really honest here, I knew that I was in no way going to be able to cut this without totally screwing it up.  So, I got my husband who has done similar with mouth guards do this.  I am a teeth grinder, in high school my friends would tell me that I had kept them up all night grinding my teeth away at night.  My daughter, unfortunately has also inherited this horrible habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that my teeth grinding is one of the reasons that I have horrible teeth, I think I grind them so much it really has taken a toll on the health of my teeth.  So, I&#x27;m glad that my daughter has this to help with her own grinding issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had no trouble at all cutting them down to size and fitting them for her mouth.  She&#x27;s been using them at night and so far hasn&#x27;t had any complaints.  So, I&#x27;m going to take this to mean that they are working well for her.  I, personally don&#x27;t have enough teeth left to be able to use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Received at a Promo Price</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth constantly and it is a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it cause enamel wear but recently it has started giving me headaches, all the time headaches.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided on a mouth guard. It is great.&lt;br /&gt;They sent 3 separate ones!!!.&lt;br /&gt;Once you put it in hot water it moulds accordingly and fits nice and snug over the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It might feel a bit odd at first having something in your mouth while you sleep, it takes getting used to, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> After having some teeth issues my dentist suggested I get a mouth guard in case I was grinding my teeth. This runs $200-$300 at the dentist so I thought I&#x27;d look online. I found this item, read the reviews, and bought it. I&#x27;m glad it comes in a three pack. I&#x27;m very methodical and handy at this kind of stuff but it does take a little skill to get it just right. I think a lot of it is just feeling it in your mouth after you soften it and are trying to mold it with your tongue and lips. The first one wasn&#x27;t a total loss and I heated it up and reshaped it again but the second one was better. Also I trimmed it before putting it in the hot water as the back part went way beyond my last molars. After it shrunk in the water though I found I didn&#x27;t really need to trim it. I have a small mouth too(no comment from husband and kids).&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping with the guard was not a problem. I used it all night the first night and other than looking like a nerd it felt fine, stayed put,and the next day no problems or soreness. I&#x27;m not sure if it is helping with my dental problem as it was starting to subside by the time it came. I don&#x27;t think I grind my teeth; what happens is my jaw snaps shut periodically jamming my teeth together. I&#x27;ve caught myself doing this when I drift off. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;My husband sleeps with a different guard that his top and bottom teeth fit in to for his snoring.Really works. He didn&#x27;t think this would work for that issue. We are a lovely site; glad we have been married sometime.&lt;br /&gt;The company is great. After ordering and before receiving the product I got an email from the company with very clear instructions on how to get the best fit, etc.  I emailed them after and said it worked great and only took me two tries. They said they would send me two more free of charge. How often does that happen with a company.</li>
            <li> Really a fantastic mouth guard at a fantastic price with plenty of instructions to ensure great results.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with the product. Would recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at an incredible price!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed!! I was told by the dentist my cracked tooth was from grinding at night and I would continue to have problems unless I use a mouth guard, they would sell me one for $300!!!  I chose to find my own and saw this one had good reviews. Shipping was very fast. I liked that there are three of them, and a warranty, since I messed up the first one. The company promptly sent me a replacement! The cost is great, fitting was easy (make sure to watch the video) it saved me lots of money and my teeth! I&#x27;ve had no problem sleeping with it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic value.  My dog ate my $400 custom mouth guard. This one is BETTER.</li>
            <li> By far the most comfortable mouth guard I&#x27;ve tried! I use it every night for my TMJ pain.  Extremely comfortable fit, stays in place all night, best of all...no pain!  Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> A very comfortable fit for a night guard. Very happy with the overall value.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, and the video was very helpful. I have a small mouth and used their instructions to fit the guard to my mouth. However, the plastic was too thick for my mouth. The owner of the company himself personally offered to have it thinned, and also to refund my money if I still wasn&#x27;t happy. It is so rare to find customer service like this, and I was pleasantly surprised at this companies level of dedication to customer satisfaction. I think you can order this product and feel comfortable that this will do what they can to make sure you are happy with your mouth guard!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it makes me drool too much.  I can&#x27;t be wanting to spit all night long.</li>
            <li> Works great.  You just have to be careful when molding the mouth guard because its hot when you put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The mouth guard easily molded as per instructions. It fits well without any irritation. It also does a really good job in preventing grinding. It deserves 5 stars for that. But personally i found my mouth drying out and a taste of plastic so i end up taking it out in the middle of the night but I&#x27;ll still continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ProDental mouth guard to replace another brand I have been using. I could never get the other guard  to fit well. The first ProDental guard was a disaster.  I overheated it, and it fold into itself and fused together. I did the second one and it turned out great with a good fit. I have used it and after it&#x27;s in for awhile you forget it is there. I like it. The best part is I emailed them this morning and got a reply this afternoon saying they are sending out a replacement without any hassle. Good product and service.</li>
            <li> Works well for me....</li>
            <li> I bought these to try as I have cracked 2 teeth and needed root canals due to night grinding.  They were very easy to shape and the process took about 5 minutes.  I woke up and noticed my teeth were hurting and I put it in since I knew I was grinding.  Worked great.  Next night I took it out in my sleep and my dog ate it! Luckily I still have 2 more!  Much cheaper than the $250 one my dentist was going to make. He actually recommended I try these before paying a lot because not all people can tolerate night guards.  I&#x27;m glad I did this option as I would have been out a lot more money when my dog ate it!</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my $500 night guard that I chewed through. I took the time to read instructions, trimmed the height of the trays and carefully molded each mouthpiece. result is these feel exactly the same as the mouthpiece my dentist made me if not more comfortable because they are slightly softer and chewier. I speculate I will chew to these rather fast but I don&#x27;t care because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great at the first time. Save me few hundreds dollars going for a custom made one.</li>
            <li> fit me great.  easy instructions.</li>
            <li> I was recently intended by my dentist that I am grinding my teeth horribly. I&#x27;m not aware of doing it during the day so I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;m doing this at night. Right now a customized mouth guard is not in my budget. I received this and followed the directions VERY closely.  So far,  I&#x27;m doing okay adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! After watching the instructional video, I was able to cast a secure and comfortable bite guard on my first try. Now I have the other two included molds as backups. I prefer its feel while sleeping in comparison to the previous, $700 hard dental splint that I lost. I appreciate the follow-up emails from MKC to check its quick delivery and my satisfaction with their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of bite guards over the years for night time teeth grinding, this one is among the best. W/ a package of 3-I could use 1 for the biting,1 for whitening, &amp; a spare, if I was so inclined. Inst. were excellent, &amp; I even received a confirmation email the day the guards arrived ensuring that I knew how to fit them-a nice touch-above and beyond typical service. I&#x27;d use ya&#x27;ll again. :)</li>
            <li> Got this for my TMJ/TMD. I grind and clench my teeth all night and these help. Easy to form to my mouth.</li>
            <li> material is too hard and does not fit well.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard works very well for the money. I&#x27;ve worn a custom made night guard from my dentist for nearly 20 yrs so I know how they&#x27;re supposed to fit. After years of faithful service, my custom night guard got chipped &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel like spending $450 + for another one so I decided to try this one from ProDental. While it&#x27;s not nearly as form fitting &amp; durable as my old one, the $30 price for 3 is definitely good value &amp; does the job of protecting my teeth from grinding. How well it works long term remains to be seen, but so far I am very satisfied with this product after using it for a month.</li>
            <li> I have had quite a struggle with mouthguards.  The one I bought at the dentist has been resized and shaved down so many times, yet still I&#x27;d wake up with mouth and jaw pain.  The last time I took it in (again, at their request) to have it shaved down a little more (which they kept insisting would help) the entire thing cracked, so I had no mouthguard for a few weeks while they were making me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I tried this mouthguard.  I had a rough time with the instructions (I failed to pull it out of the boiling water in time and the sides folded up.  But I contacted Dr. Don and he sent me a replacement free of charge!)  Then I finally got the knack for it.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night since and had NO jaw pain for the first time in I can&#x27;t remember how long.  I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little wary about sticking plastic in my mouth, and essentially chewing on it every night.  So I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s as safe as they state.  It says it&#x27;s FDA-approved plastic -- I&#x27;m hoping specifically for this purpose of nightly use. And hoping that whatever factory is manufacturing it is actually reliable in using what materials they say they are.  But other than my paranoias, I have nothing but great things to say! :)</li>
            <li> Love it... Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good product will recommend to buy, it works great</li>
            <li> Great product. Took a little fenagling to get it formed to my mouth- I had to put it back in the boiling water 3 times. Once I got it fitted to my mouth well, though, it was great. I have been using it every night for the past couple of weeks and it&#x27;s been a great short-term solution to my night bruxism. My teeth were sensitive before and they are feeling much better now :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter.  She is horrible at grinding her teeth in the middle of the night.  She is thirteen years old.  She read the directions and did this all by herself.  In order for it to fit your mouth, you need to trim it to fit your mouth and them boil it.  You put it in your mouth and bite down.  This allows it to form to the shape of your mouth.  She has trimmed it a few times because it still did not fit right.  But she is happy with it now.  I would say trim it a little at a time to be sure that it does not get cut down too small.  She does not complain about it in her mouth so it must fit pretty good.  It has cut down on the horrible noise and the affect on her teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice.  This mouth guard fits perfectly and is really helping prevent my teeth from grinding.. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> works really well- very happy and glad I didn&#x27;t spend the $600 the dentist was asking- give it a few days to get used to it. Worked for me on the first try doing the mold.</li>
            <li> As a long-time teeth grinder, I&#x27;ve used mouth guards ever since my dentist said I would ruin my teeth without one. I used my last mouth guard for way too long and finally had to replace it when it started to irritate my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came in a pack of two, which is super nice. The instructions were detailed and easy to follow. When I first made them, they fit a little too snuggly--somewhat uncomfortably--but with usage everything loosened a little, and now they fit comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons. 1) It&#x27;s a little large overall. My lips do not close over the guard unless I focus on doing so, so with it in, I sleep with my mouth slightly ajar. No big deal, really. 2) There&#x27;s a section of the guard right in the middle, about where your front two teeth align but on the outside, that is rough. I don&#x27;t know why, and I can&#x27;t figure it out, but it&#x27;s rough--not rough enough that my lip is irritated by it, but enough that I notice it and that pieces shed off of it. Everything else is smooth except for that patch in the middle, and I wish it weren&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, would I buy these again? Probably. They&#x27;re a good value with minor deficiencies.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The mouth guard is nice. A little bit too thick to wear and keep my mouth shut comfortably during the night. It is impossible to thin it yourself.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing. I will never ever buy another brand again in my life. Follow the directions carefully and you should have no complaints. It hasn&#x27;t fallen out my mouth once and I have been using it for many months.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard is great. it is very easy to use and work as promised. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is more impressive than the product is their customer service. I contacted their support team regarding my sensitive teeth. I was having trouble getting the mold on my teeth without having pains. They replied almost immediately and suggested that i gradually rise my mouth with warmer water to prevent &amp;#34;Heat Shock&amp;#34;. I messed up twice because of this &amp;#34;heat shock&amp;#34;. They were nice enough to offer free replacements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product and am extremely pleased with their customer service. if you guys have issues, please contact them. they will take care of you!</li>
            <li> They are too thick, not meant or to be used for night grinding...followed directions...didn&#x27;t get a good fit with all 3...</li>
            <li> I got my mouth guards and followed instructions EXACTLY, got 2 of them molded perfectly to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I think I have average size jaw and and in my case mouth guard covers all upper teeth with the last molar 1/3-1/2 covered.&lt;br /&gt;The key to success: follow instructions EXACTLY and try to do everything on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;I found out that even though the material itself is pliable and will re-shape 3,4,5 times if needed it WILL shrink somewhat every single time you reheat it so you will get less and less coverage on your teeth, consequently it&#x27;s VERY important to get it right on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the customer service itself. All I can say is WOW, probably one of the best if not the best I have dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;Once I shaped my mouth guards, I did find them bulky in my mouth, so contacted MKC and took them up on their offer to thin the walls.&lt;br /&gt;Extra complication in my case was I live in Canada so shipping and getting it back could be a problem?&lt;br /&gt;No worries, everything was arranged and the shipping charge was nominal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my mouth guard back with the walls thinned and what a difference - I dip it in water and then slide on my upper teeth, sleep on my side/back, any way I want, very comfortable and does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product and excellent customer service, once my mouth guard wears out will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I see alots of good reviews but unfortunately this is the first time I have to write negative reviews about this product please buyers this product is not really good. I have a teeth grinding problem so I fixed this mouth guard and sleep when I wake up next morning my whole mouth gets pain because the the mouth guard size itself is too big so I have to take a day off at my work .its really disappointing they send 3 pcs I still have 2 pcs left But I don&#x27;t know what to do even I can&#x27;t return</li>
            <li> My dentist informed me that I have bruxism, teeth grinding while I sleep, and suggested I get a mouth guard. My insurance doesn&#x27;t cover mouth guards, so I began my search. This mouth guard does the job, especially for the price, but I had some difficulty with it at first. I initially molded the mouth guard to my top teeth, and found out after a few nights of wearing it that the mouth guard was rubbing on my gums, creating ulcers. Also, it was difficult to get used to sleeping with the guard at night because I couldn&#x27;t fully close my mouth and found myself getting a dry throat and mouth. Instead, I formed the second mouth guard it came packaged with to my bottom teeth, and that proved more successful. I can close my mouth most of the way at night and it feels more comfortable than on my top teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I suggest trying both and see what feels most comfortable for your mouth. You have 3 tries since it comes packaged with 3 mouth guards. Also, it&#x27;s super easy to mold - the directions are very detailed and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can tell that even after 2 attempts that the guard fits fairly well in my mouth but probably not as well as a mold the dentist could form, or as well as a mold that would cost twice as much as this one. For the price, it&#x27;s a good pick, but just know it&#x27;ll take about a week for your mouth to get used to sleeping with a guard. Sweet dreams!</li>
            <li> This is a superior product!  I needed an affordable night guard that would fit properly and not fall out while I sleep.  The &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; one that I got from Bed Bath Beyond was a complete nightmare - difficult instructions, and only one chance to get it to mold to my teeth. After 1 fail, I had to throw it away. After desperately looking for a replacement in a similar price range,  I was so lucky to find this brand on Amazon.  This one gives you 3 guards for the same cost, and works like a dream on the first try! (still have 2 back-ups!) The instructions were so easy to follow, and not troublesome at all ( like the other one I tried)  Not only that, but it&#x27;s BPA free, super comfortable, and has a high quality fit. I&#x27;ve been sleeping comfortably with it for the past few weeks.  SO IMPRESSED! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love this Mouth Guard.  It is very easy to form to your teeth. I wear it every night.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to whiten my teeth with it!!!!! Great item to have, love it</li>
            <li> I have had many different mouth guards.  The last one bought from a dentist.  Expensive!  The ProDental has been the most comfortable.  It was the easiest of the &amp;#34;self fitting&amp;#34; mouth guards to use.</li>
            <li> Bruxism - My dentist suggested I find a mouth guard for night time grinding of my back teeth. My experience is that this ProDental mouth guard is way too big and uncomfortable for me to wear. The instructions and video are great and it appears the vendor will make every effort to ensure satisfaction, however I have tried others and for me the DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard is extremely less bulky and much more comfortable. Also, the Plackers Grind No More mouth guard is also less bulky and more comfortable, however in my experience it is not as sturdy as the DenTek, probably because it is disposable.</li>
            <li> I am so so so happy I didn&#x27;t spend $400 at the dentist and tried this first. I am a college student and this literally saved my teeth and looks the same. Super happy with it thank you</li>
            <li> Product molds very well to my teeth and have more protection than the last ones I bought.</li>
            <li> I was having chronic headaches, and terrible upper shoulder and arm pain and we couldn&#x27;t figure out why...! I went to the dentist who said I was aggressively grinding my teeth during the night which was what was making all of these pains. He offered to make me a mouth guard... for $650! Uh.. no thanks. I found these on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. They are amazingly wonderful. I received them yesterday, fit them to my mouth, and proceeded to have the best night&#x27;s sleep and ZERO pain in the morning!! No headache, no muscle and shoulder pain, and they fit so well I could close my mouth during sleep. It was so comfortable, I didn&#x27;t even feel like it was in! I haven&#x27;t slept that well in months, and to wake up without having pain is a dream come true. These are the best. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions precisely and got a very good fit the first time. I am an adult and these were definitely large enough for my mouth. There was too much extra material on the inside of my teeth, which irritated the roof of my mouth. I did my best to cut this off (which is NOT easy) and the result was satisfactory, not great.&lt;br /&gt;The price was definitely a bargain, compared to the hundreds of dollars I spent and multiple visits required to have my dentist make and attempt to adjust a mouthguard that never fit properly (thankfully my money was refunded!).&lt;br /&gt;However, I found that despite a product that fit, I really detest wearing a night guard and just couldn&#x27;t tough it out. The first few weeks I woke with nightmares that I was choking because it was just too much in my mouth. Once I got over that, I started actually grinding and biting MORE because the feel of the material was so satisfying to bite down on (a little squishy), which led to more severe TMJ. Additionally, I was so disgusted at the taste and feel of my teeth when I removed it in the morning that I just stopped using it altogether. I actually trained myself to stop grinding and biting through meditation, which was a huge relief.&lt;br /&gt;If you must use a biteguard/night guard, these are a bargain and can be adjusted by carefully following the instructions. I would recommend them over a guard made by a dentist based on my experience with each, but would recommend meditative training as an adjunct therapy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great quality and price! I use it for a night guard. The molding process was easy and fast and the instructions were very clear, i also found the video very helpful. I sleep with my mouth guard every night now and I actually sleep a lot better with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very thick and big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;My original review was 2 star. Because it does not really fit my mouse. I have difficulty to close my mouth when I&#x27;m sleeping. I&#x27;ve trimmed down the edge but it does not help. But I got a call from seller. He asked me several questions and offered free modification. I will send this product back to seller and they will fix for me. I&#x27;ll update after I get it and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the call from seller. Good customer service.</li>
            <li> Item works just as described. Watch the video. It helps.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my rather serious teeth grinding problem.  The product is easy to set up, works like a charm, and is surprisingly comfortable given its inherent nature.  The instructions are very clear, the instructional video is extremely helpful, the customer service is first rate.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Work as advertised. Bought it for my uncle and he told me it works for him. Will recommend to friend.</li>
            <li> For the money especially, this is awesome!  Helps me not grind my teeth at night.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> These seem like cheap Wal-mart crap. I had no success with them whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Very professional and attentive seller. Product better than described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t love a mouth guard LOL... But this was very easy to  form to my teeth and fit well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mouth guard.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 months and the pain in my neck (from clinching) is gone!&lt;br /&gt;And the price is perfect.  My dentist wanted between $300-$400 for a mouth guard.  This one works!!  Buy now!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lots of instructions and support with followup emails.  I got it right after 2 heating tries.  I use them on the upper teeth as a night guard.  On me, the guard is about a half molar short of completely covering my end molars.  I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that I love this thing! haha  I grind my teeth at night so much that my jaw hurts in the morning and I have worn the enamel off some of my teeth.  My dentist said it would cost me about $1,000 for a night guard because my insurance won&#x27;t cover it.  I decided to try this thing first!  Love it!!!!  It was so easy to mold to my teeth and now it fits comfortably in my mouth.  I wish I had it 10 years ago so I didn&#x27;t damage my teeth!</li>
            <li> Good product and good value.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is wonderful---everyone should be like this!!!</li>
            <li> screwed the first one up because i underestimated how fast it would shrink but i also expected to which is why i bought a three pack. Second turned out fine and the third i&#x27;m saving for a later date. Good product, worth a repurchase for me down the line.</li>
            <li> I do not usually bother with feedback, but this mouthguard is great. My mouth feels better than it has in years and i can finally sleep throught the night.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I tend to go thru mouth guards fairly quickly so I love that this comes in a pack of three. I have TMJ and have used several different mouth guards over the last 3 years. I just got this pack so I can&#x27;t say for certain how long they will hold up. But from the look of them I think I can get about 6-7 months out of each one of them since they look and feel sturdy. So over all I think this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this simple -&lt;br /&gt;My mouth guard from the dentist lasted 11 months before it snapped in half from my grinding and it cost $150 (the rest was covered by insurance).&lt;br /&gt;I have three of these mouth guards, still on the first one after 5 months (I know they say switch at 3 but it&#x27;s still perfectly functional). And they cost what? 30 bucks? So if this breaks tomorrow and I get 5 months out of each mouth guard I save..a lot of money. Even if I keep having to re order after 15 months or whatever, I don&#x27;t care. So worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Just take care molding because you only get one shot, maybe two if you can reheat it without messing it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have to update my review, because since using this product I have developed TMD and eustachian tube issues. I would advise anyone who needs a guard for serious night time grinding issues like me to get a professional guard done at a dentist.</li>
            <li> It was initially difficult for me to get a quality mold.  You have to be really careful about not overheating the plastic and then to take it out VERY carefully or the guard will melt together.  They sent me a free replacement QUICKLY and I was able to correctly mold a guard.  Excellent customer service.  The guard is working great to prevent nighttime grinding!</li>
            <li> As opposed to the dentist alternatives, this was cheaper and easier! The man or people behind this product epitomize good customer service.</li>
            <li> Really liked how comfortable it feels and it  doesn&#x27;t feel to bulky in mouth. Im really impressed how this company reached out to make sure not only that I had recieved my product but also to give me instrcutions as well. I loved the fact that we saved so much money and basically got 3 mouthgards instead of only one for a ridiculous price at the dentist. It&#x27;s a no brianer.</li>
            <li> great product. received as described. great customer service. easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a little big for my husband, he loves this.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I needed an upper Night Guard to protect my teeth from the damage I do from clenching them at night. He offered to make me a custom one for $700 (I thought...How much??!!??). I asked him if he could use an impression that my prior dentist had made for me about 10 years ago for creating plastic teeth whitening molds, but he said he couldn&#x27;t use that. I asked him if I could use the teeth whitening molds that I still have, but apparently they are too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began my search on Amazon. The first one I tried didn&#x27;t work at all and Amazon was great about refunding my purchase. Then I tried this ProDental product. I followed the instructions and was encouraged because I felt I was making a pretty good mold from pressing the heated plastic on my teeth. But after repeated trials, the mouth guard just kept falling out of my mouth.  Then I decided to try pressing the heated plastic directly onto my old dental impression (which my dentist said would not work) and SUCCESS: The mold stayed neatly tucked into my mouth. But I still had a problem. Even after lifting my lips over the plastic, I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth completely because the plastic was so thick. I tried laying down with it on, but had to take it out because I felt like gagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to give up when I received a timely email from ProDental Customer Service, asking me how my guard was doing. I emailed back and the dentist (Don Closson, DDS) offered to thin it down for me at no cost (except the small cost of shipping it back to him).  I got it back in just a few days and now it fits perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed by this company and it&#x27;s attentive customer service. Please note that I am not able to say whether or not ProDental would have been able to fix the original mold that I created just from my teeth, so if you don&#x27;t already have a dental impression, you may have different results. But I am giving this product 5 stars, because it worked perfectly for me and again: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!r me and again: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
            <li> Better off getting one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. I am a grinder and this mouth guard seems to hold up better than others that I have which I chewed up during the night. This is the second one I have had of this brand and the first one lasted me three years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product. I had a custom mouth guard made by my dentist for which I paid $ 650.00. Used it only once since it was causing pain. The mouth guard from ProDental is just perfect. Took 5 minutes to mold. And it works the way a mouth guard should. Buy it and all problems related to grinding teeth will be gone.</li>
            <li> Seller sent me a e-mail with video on step by step how to use and mold guard-worked quite well as I got it in first take and now use daily any time I am sleeping. Seems like good deal as you get 3 guards for this price and if there is any issues they will work on getting it just right for you. Seller is very conscious of customer service and keeps in touch to make sure you are happy and doing well with item.</li>
            <li> Great product but so hard to do right glad it comes with three.</li>
            <li> The material is soft and so it is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to save a few hundred dollars! I&#x27;ve had a dentist mouth guard, this one fits better! I either lost my other one or ground it down and swallowed it while sleeping lol. Anyhow that was a lot of money to lose. I really appreciate the extra mile the company goes through too with the extra emails to make sure your happy and get it fitted properly. Seems like a top notch company!</li>
            <li> Almost brings tears to ny eyes. A quality product, reasonably priced, and tremendous customer support.  Like the old days when people staked their name on what they produced.  Times have changed but not for these people.  My highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have been a teeth grinder, but did not know it. Then several years ago I received a dental guard from my dentist. It turned out that I grind to such a degree that the hard thicker teeth guards are cracked after a year. I repeated this process for 3 years and thought something has to change. For each replacement in Switzerland costs me 350 dollars. That is an expensive problem. Thus I decided to switch tack and use another product, in specific this one. Sure I still grind, but at least my habit went from 350 dollars a year to less than 100 dollars. I really like the guards. They are bulkier than what I am used to, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 2/10/2016: I have been using the same night guard now for more than 8 months. Still works great. It&#x27;s not chewed up at all. Excellent value and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR version; Good product. Excellent support and documentation. Three weeks of use and no durability issues yet. Absolutely a great value. I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison to another product:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these nightguards for roughly 3 weeks now. My previous night guard was a Dentek with the Blue soft/moldable portion and the thick bite plate. It served me well for 2 years (longer than average as i read other reviews on it), but eventually fell appart. I figured i would try the Pro-Dental instead of getting another Dentek since the reviews for the new denteks are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my main concern with these Pro-Dental guards is that they would be too soft and I&#x27;d chew them apart quickly. And that is yet to be determined. However, i have recently woken up realizing i was just grinding my teeth on the night guard during vivid dreams. (Pretty weird feeling!). And yes, so far the soft plastic is holding up well. I hope they continue to endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molding experience:&lt;br /&gt;I found before molding i needed to trim the material on the top (so it wasn&#x27;t so deep dish) and i needed to leave in the hot water 1 second longer to get a good squishy/workable consistency for custom molding to my mouth. DO NOT be affraid of putting the mouth piece in your mouth after taking it out of the hot water. Just let it air cool for 5 seconds and get it in your mouth. It will be very warm, but not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried molding one without trimming it at all and the material squished across the entire roof of my mouth, and cooled to form something that looked more like one of those plastic orthodontic retainers you get after your braces come off. Needless to say it was still soft but not comfortable as it felt like my tongue had no room in my mouth. I suppose i could &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; this oneand request another piece be sent, but for the price of these 3, I do not feel it is necessary. It is still usable and will serve well as a backup i can keep in my luggage all the time in case i forget to pack the regular use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort:&lt;br /&gt;The two that i trimmed properly are very comfortable in my mouth. I usually start using it as i read a book in bed before falling asleep and after 5 minutes i forget it&#x27;s in my mouth.  However when i do bite down i&#x27;m still adjusting to the feeling of my front teeth being able to bite into the soft plastic as apposed to the hard plastic of the Dentek. And i guess that&#x27;s why i question the longevity of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning tip:&lt;br /&gt;One very important instruction included in the package is to NOT USE MOUTHWASH to clean these platic detal appliances. Mouthwash will dry out the plasic and it will crumble. Just use regular hand soap or basic toothpaste. I think that&#x27;s why my Dentek lasted longer than everybody writing bad reviews, i have always used a soft brush and mild hand soap to clean it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> easy to adjust. Tried other brands before and did not work as well</li>
            <li> It works exactly like it is described…..I use this to protect my upper inside gums since I have a severe overbite and they get inflamed. This mouth guard helps protect the gum and gives it time to heal without my bottom teeth constantly hitting it.&lt;br /&gt;Good and smart purchase, plus you get 3 of them!!</li>
            <li> This works really well.  Be careful about &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; too hard when form fitting it.  My first try make it too tight on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth when I sleep. This product is excellent if the instructions are followed - the video is really well done. My first impression failed because I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions exactly. Make sure you use plenty of water to boil and use a spoon to lift up the mouthguard after the 20 seconds (not tongs). My second try was successful and now I&#x27;ve use it for about 1 week. It is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. I sleep well with it. Now let&#x27;s see what the dentist tells me in 6 months - whether my teeth have taken less of a beating from my teeth grinding. The cost is excellent - a personal cast from the dentist would have costed $500 (this is not including the dentist visit!)</li>
            <li> Very good mouth guard, instructions were very clear. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had custom dental night guard (durable but very expensive). I&#x27;ve tried generic big box store version from pharmacy (low profile but I ground thru those in less than 2 months). This guard is GREAT.  Durable. Very reasonable price. Only criticism is they&#x27;re slightly larger than aforementioned. But all in all, I&#x27;d buy these again. No question.</li>
            <li> I wear a mouth guard ever night to prevent bruxism and have used custom made guards as well as many over the counter products.  The ProDental guard has been the most comfortable and effective one I have tried. Three forms are included at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> THE MOUTH PIECE IS COMFORTABLE AND THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE CLEAR AND  EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN BOILING&lt;br /&gt;TO ASSURE A TIGHT FIT. IT WILL HELP MY TEETH GRINDING WHICH IS NEW TO MY TEETH</li>
            <li> Nearly as good as an expensive dentist-cast, custom-poured guard (that my dog ate).  I am very pleased; fits well and a great value.  And not painful to form-fit (unlike the dentist-fitted device).</li>
            <li> I have now used this guard for 4 days. I had no problems with fit, thanks to the great instructions. I did need to cut a few areas down because of a small mouth. It worked great and so far I&#x27;ve had NO problems. It is soft and fits my mouth well. I have had to deal with pain for many years due to spinal problems and unfortunately this causes intense grinding and chomping down hard on my teeth. My teeth definitely show the damage, so I have had many mouth guards. My one big complaint with them is they get very hard in a short time and then become very uncomfortable. This guard has stayed soft during the moulding to my mouth and is very comfortable. I truly hope it stays this way!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you&#x27;d expect--as far as mouthguards go it&#x27;s decent quality for the price (I played sports all through middle and high school and have had more mouthguards than I can count). It&#x27;s not fantastic for me as a night guard because, even after molding, it&#x27;s very easy for me to push out so I usually wake up with it on the pillow next to me. However, I feel satisfied that I got what I paid for and this would be perfect for any of the other uses. (Plus it&#x27;s a three pack so if you mess up molding the first one, there are two more right there for you to try)</li>
            <li> It does what it says. I ordered these because my insurance didn&#x27;t cover the mouth guard my dentist wanted to make for me. Besides wearing out my teeth, my nightly clenching and grinding was leading to severe aches in my neck and upper back. Those days are gone, and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks. It took me about two nights to get used to sleeping with a mouth guard, but now that I am used to it, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable without it. Highly recommended as an alternative to prescription guards.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because in the instructions I have been told I need to put it for couple seconds in a boiled water. I did it and it didn&#x27;t form into my mouth&#x27;s shape. This material was hard as a rock and also hurt my gums so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even wear not even for 5 minutes. And I tried... My mouth is really small so I had to cut it in order to cosumize it but nothing really help.</li>
            <li> Wow! Thank you so much! My neck pain was better after the first night I used your mouth guard. I must have been clenching my teeth, without realizing it, and this was the answer to my frequent headaches and neck pain. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Best night guard I&#x27;ve used in 20 years!!  :)</li>
            <li> Dentist quality molding/fit @ home @ 60C% of the minimal cost from your DDS to which most insurances will NOT cover! Easy Peezy!!!</li>
            <li> Way too thick, way too big.  If you trim them then you have sharp edges digging into your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I changed this review from 1 to 3 stars since their customer service seems to really care about your enjoyment of their product and they&#x27;ll try to help you out if there are problems.</li>
            <li> I lost the mouthguard that my dentist custom made for me and was sad :)  I didn&#x27;t think that a mold-it-yourself product would be an adequate replacement, but to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  Very happy with this and am glad that I got the 3 pack.  It took me two tries to get the molding process &#x27;just-right&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do, which is stop me from grinding my teeth causing terrible headaches and dental issues. The cost was 95% cheaper than my dentist charges. Well worth the savings!</li>
            <li> easy to fit, just as good or better than the one I paid 300.00 dollars for from a Dentist. Don&#x27;t even know I have it on.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price! It doesn&#x27;t bother me while I sleep at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> No problems modifying them to fit my mouth and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;1&amp;#34;, no need for cutting.  It stays put until I take it out and my hygienist looked at it and gave it the &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  Just wish these came with a ventilated storage case.  Great customer service communication.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working fine as a night protection. I just wished it would be a little thinner. In the morning my mouth feels a little sour but I&#x27;m still getting used to it and maybe that goes away.&lt;br /&gt;Good value if I compare it to what my dentist would charge for it.</li>
            <li> Lost a $300 guard custom made by my dentist.  Bought one of these.  The fit is 99% as good, but at only 10% of the price.  Seems likely to wear out sooner, but economically makes sense – especially given the risk of loss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, it came quickly. After reading the instructions I tried to get this mouth guard to fit comfortably in my mouth, I could not get it to feel comfortable. So I purchased a small clear sports mouth guard for about $3 and used the same instructions that came with this mouth guard. It worked great. If you have a small mouth, like I do, I feel this mouth guard are way to big, go buy a  small cheap mouth guard and its will be much easier to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to get the mouth guard molded correctly. Seller provided excellent advice, I watched the video again, and it worked. Thank you for helping me to stop clenching my teeth at night!</li>
            <li> Great item. This is a great value.</li>
            <li> Quality of the material is quite good. I made sure to follow the instructions closely as many of the comments recommended. The process is rather simply and my mold came out well. I&#x27;m a week into wearing the mouth guard and have not had any problems with discomfort. I did not have to adjust the mold as it fit my mouth perfectly and I would describe myself as having an average male mouth. It takes a few minutes for me to adjust to wearing it but then it is quite comfortable throughout the night. Wife reports that the grinding has stopped and i haven&#x27;t woken up with a headache since!</li>
            <li> Great bargain. Worked as promised. Just follow the directions faithfully. Beats $3-400 at the dentist every time.</li>
            <li> I love these, instead of paying $500 for those hard custom mouth guards from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get tjese. Just for the simple fact I grind my teeth at night and wake up with such bad pains. This is big at first but if you follow the instructions it&#x27;ll fit perfect in your mouth. Recommended this for anyone with grinding problems like myself..it&#x27;s also multi purpose so that&#x27;s even better!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It does the job in comparison to the expensive one my dentist wanted to do. I am a female in my late 20&#x27;s and the guard is just made too big. Yeah you can cut it so it doesn&#x27;t irritate the gums but the lower part of the guard doesn&#x27;t form as well as the top part so it&#x27;s not really molded to my teeth anymore after the trim. It&#x27;s somewhat comfortable (a lot better after trimming it for a second time) and all but one time stayed in place over night. I would recommend it but to have caution if small mouth and plan to use it as a night guard (i.e. long period of time).</li>
            <li> Very much worth the money spent. I bought mine due to teeth grinding. I found that the first time I shaped one of the guards, I didn&#x27;t,t boil it long enough. Follow the instructions, before it cools off completely, dip it in cold water, for a few seconds,  then put it in your mouth and adjust as per instructions and also use your fingers to shape  it to fit your mouth.</li>
            <li> It took a few trials of fitting it after the prescribed procedure, but it  finally worked. It is slightly bulkier than I would like it to be, but it is not uncomfortable. Quite satisfied and it is a good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Probably good for sports but if you want a comfortable night guard your better off spending extra and going to a dentist</li>
            <li> Ugh, I&#x27;m sure these work well, but I couldn&#x27;t even get through making it without gagging.  I just needed something thin to prevent my nighttime jaw clenching while wearing an upper retainer from damaging my teeth.  I know they can be trimmed down once made in order to help with gagging, but I couldn&#x27;t get it formed in the first place.  The nice thing is that you get three in a pack.  So far I have tried and ruined two of them.  If I get brave enough, I may try the third, but I&#x27;m not very hopeful.  The detailed instructions were very nice.  It even comes with a link to a video to help you with the right technique.  I can&#x27;t complain about anything other than my own gag reflex and the fact that these were slightly bulkier than I expected.</li>
            <li> just like I remember when I played football. Open the pack throw one in a cup of water for 2 minutes or until it curls, put in your mouth and bite slowly down for a form fit.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Only problem I had was I ruined my last one while molding it. They work wonderful. I am a senior citizen and can not afford the dentist guards. Thank you for the best guards out there.</li>
            <li> Molding was very quick and easy. I use this as a night guard to prevent bruxism and it seems to help! Be warned that it is quite thick, so I can&#x27;t close my mouth all the way and my cheeks were sore the first few days. But this will be the case with really any mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions. Although it fits big, it doesn&#x27;t bother my mouth and definitely steps the grinding.</li>
            <li> I followed their directions exactly and it worked perfectly the first time.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It&#x27;s my first time using such an item and it seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this purchase. Not only was it easy to mold the first mouth guard to my mouth, it still came with 2 additional in case the first one didn&#x27;t work out or I needed more. I began using the guard a few weeks ago and the change in my sleeping habits has definitely been improved! I&#x27;m very happy to report that the guard lives up to its hype and more! I still need to make an appointment with my dentist, but I know that I&#x27;m going to be much more comfortable in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me...</li>
            <li> good but is difficult to mold properly.</li>
            <li> I was told I needed a mouth guard because I grind my teeth at night and clench my teeth during the day--awesome, right? My dentist charged $400+ for a fitted mouth guard, but I am SO glad I found these first! They come in a pack of 3, molded to my teeth PERFECTLY, and have proven  durable. I would definitely recommend these. You honestly can&#x27;t be the price for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Its hard to mold although watching the clip on their website and reading the instructions. You will probably butn your mouth too, I did. Its bulky and not comfortable. Do not waste your money as this piece of plastic is over-priced.</li>
            <li> Great value! Considering one of these cost $300 at the dentist, this is a great value. Very easy to fit and install. Seller is very helpful and provides written and video instructions as well as a dedicated customer service line you can call with any questions or if you need assistance.</li>
            <li> Due to recent dental work, had to replace mouth guard, for night time teeth grinding. Instead of paying $400 to the dentist, I purchased this product, after reading positive reviews. It took me a couple of tries to customize it but worth the time spent for the savings. Material is thicker than what I&#x27;m used to but it&#x27;s comfortable &amp; does the job :-)  Impressed with company&#x27;s follow up &amp; outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable thing in the world but not as big and bulky compared to others. Keeps me from grinding my teeth and clenching all night.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and it worked as advertised!  No complaints, and I have extras.</li>
            <li> Good product, but does have a learning curve. (I made my mistakes on the first one) Was able to get good moulds with the rremaining two. Can&#x27;t fault the product for operator error - it&#x27;s handy to have three on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a mouth guard before but this is the one I would whole heartily recommend. Extremely well made for a good, secure fit with high sides that hug your teeth. Just follow the instructions on forming the fit. Bonus is that three mouth guards are provided plus they back up their product. If any special fit is required, you just send them the request.</li>
            <li> This product gives great value .The device was trimmed to fit my mouth perfectly and helps me not only sleep better but protects my teeth from nightime grinding..Great Value and good people behind the product..I&#x27;ve spoken to the manufacturer many times..How many will talk to you directly these days...</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend who had problems grinding her teeth when sleeping, she had a cheap one from Walmart but she kept having problems with it so I got her this and she raves over how good it is, so I would definitely recommend and buy again if/when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled by the 5 star reviews here. First off -&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on using the mouthguard as shipped then you&#x27;ll be somewhat happy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, God forbid you trim - as per the directions - you&#x27;re screwed. My guard now digs into my gums making it totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for play-doh that will last 2 months - this is your shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, come on. Produce a decent product without bribing the fan base. I have now gone through 2 of these merely trying to fit to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Much better than expected and great deal for the price. Fits very well</li>
            <li> We got this for our 12 year old Grandson to use for sports. He says it forms easily and fits better than any he has had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This is also US made and that really appeals to us. I am retired and use one of them that came in the three pack to prevent \\&quot;grinding\\&quot; my teeth in my sleep. I found it very easy to fit to my mouth. Recommend it highly and I rarely take the time to make reviews.</li>
            <li> The mouthguard was easy to purchase. The instructions were very clear and simple to understand. I felt comfortable knowing if I made a mistake in forming the mouthguard, I could get a new one at no charge.  This is the MOST comfortable over-the-counter mouthpiece I have ever had. I love it. It is very durable and feels secure in my mouth. It is like getting three mouthguards for the price of one. The protection it affords your teeth and the versatility of the three appliances is a real benefit. You can&#x27;t go wrong making this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just to big and bulky for sleeping</li>
            <li> My original review was 2 stars because the product didn&#x27;t work for me.  However, the seller contacted me and was kind enough to give me a refund on the product.  Because of that, I had to up the stars for the review....Fantastic customer service!!!  I&#x27;m sure the guards work very well for most people....I am an extreme case due to severe TMJ Disorder.  I needed a professional appliance that keeps my back teeth from touching....which this obviously isn&#x27;t designed to do.  For a basic night guard at a reasonable price, this would be great.  Wish it had worked for me.</li>
            <li> Typical mouth guard. Works fine, but after trying both, I went with the SISU mouthguard. This product is bulky and slightly uncomfortable, even when fit properly. The SISU is extremely comfortable and I can barely tell it&#x27;s in my mouth after a while it&#x27;s so thin (but still very protective)</li>
            <li> After being quoted a price of $250+ for a &amp;#34;professionally made&amp;#34; mouth guard from my dentist I figured why not take a chance on the ProDental Mouth Guard after reading the positive reviews. I am very pleased to say that this mouth guard works great. Easy to follow instructions (yes I read them) and having the two extra ones is a great plus.</li>
            <li> Three stars because it is a little too bulky for my mouth. The moulding process is somewhat tedious than what you would expect. But it does avoid grinding.</li>
            <li> Great deal on 3 mouth guards.  Dentist quoted me $500 on a custom molded mouth guard to protect my teeth from grinding while I sleep, insurance denied the claim, so instead of dishing out WAY too much cash, I bought these at about $29.  After about 2 weeks, these mouth guards have proven themselves effective.  I have not been waking up with headaches from my teeth grinding, and the mouth guards were very easy to mold (just followed the included instructions).  Not sure at this point how long each guard will last, but I&#x27;m sure these will end up being much more cost effective down the road versus dentist&#x27;s guards.  Money well spent.</li>
            <li> arrived very fast and was exactly as described.  It was easy to fit and works great!</li>
            <li> I have experience with this product from its predecessor, which uses the exact same trays.  We found it very easy to mold and fit and is much more comfortable than most of the night guard/athletic guard mouthpieces available.  I purchased a different night guard kit awhile back and the it was so uncomfortable I never used it.  If one follows the directions (and knowing you get a free replacement if you mess it up), it will fit well without discomfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find a mouth guard for kids.  I did some research and found that this should be a good one.  I bought it and delivered very fast.  With the clear instruction, my son who is 8 years old likes to use it.  It fits him well.</li>
            <li> Fits and works better than the night guard my dentist made! Easy to make if you follow the instructions well. My jaw no longer pops when I chew food! Thank you!</li>
            <li> better than the fancy custom item i had made years ago.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fit and hold up very well! Other guards I was grinding through in a week, and have been using one of these for a month so far and it isn&#x27;t even close to wearing thin. Also, doesn&#x27;t tend to get the horrible smell that some other mouthguards get after awhile (even after washing). Great value and quality!</li>
            <li> Good product. Followed the directions to a tee and it worked fine. It took a couple of nights to adjust to having it in my mouth, but now I just pop it in and fall right to sleep. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend used to grind her teeth at night to a point where I thought her teeth would break into pieces.  I went to CVS and bought ONE  mouth guard for $33 to give her some relief.  After wearing a CVS bought mouth guard for a few weeks, her jaws become locked in the morning.  So, I looked on Amazon and found this product...... We could have been happier with it.  Her jaw no longer locked in place in the morning and the mouth guard is very comfortable to wear, contrary to the one I bought from CVS for her. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I am a teeth grinder and suggested that I use a night guard to keep me from doing further damage.  He told me that I could have one made for me by a dental lab at a cost of over $500.  I didn&#x27;t know anything about mouth guards, and wasn&#x27;t sure that I could wear won, I decided to find out a little more before investing that much money.  As it turned out the ProDental product worked fine for me, and I plan on continuing to use it in place of the far more expensive custom made guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of fitting the guard is a little tricky the first time, but the instructions are accurate and complete.  I had a little trouble with the first one (They come three to a pack), but I learned through experience and easily fitted the second.  It fits quite comfortably, and I have no trouble sleeping with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to say something about ProDental&#x27;s customer support.  It&#x27;s outstanding.  From the day I received my guards, they kept track of my progress and my satisfaction with the product via email.  I had a couple of questions, and their representatives responded quickly and accurately.  Moreover, they are also replacing the guard that I ruined in my first try at fitting.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sure beats paying $500.00 for one made by a dental lab.  It works great.  Love it and would suggest it to anyone who grinds their teeth!</li>
            <li> I was not able to use these mouth guards because they were so bulky I could not even close my mouth while wearing them. I was careful to follow the instructions for fitting them, and the fit was not the problem. They were just far too bulky. I purchased this product after seeing all the good reviews, which I really don&#x27;t understand now after trying it myself. Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Seller&#x27;s instructions, follow-up email, and video tutorial were all very informative and helped me create the perfect night guard. You really can&#x27;t beat the price and, if you take the time do it right, you&#x27;ll get a long lasting product in exactly the fit you need. Also - and I didn&#x27;t know this before I decided to buy the product: (1) the seller offers to further refine your night guard using dental tools if, after molding, it&#x27;s still too thick for some peoples&#x27; mouths (free of charge, sounds like you just need to pay the shipping to send in your guard), and (2) the seller will replace your product on the off chance that you still don&#x27;t get it right with the three that are provided.  In my case, I read the instructions, watched the video, and read the seller&#x27;s follow-up email, and that helped me get my night guard right the first time, so now I have two more back-ups for when my current guard wears out.  All in all, great value and exceptional service.  Highly recommend this product and the seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week. It was very easy to fit after watching the video and reading the instructions, and is very comfortable. I was looking for a less expensive and quick alternative to getting a mouth guard fit by my dentist, and so far, I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Customer service is great.  I needed help thinning out the mouth guard, and even though it was a few months after my order, it was absolutely no issue.  Mailed it back and received the thinned mouthguard within a week and all is good.</li>
            <li> What can I say this product is great. I have a rather large tongue and am susceptible to biting it at night. The solution for this obviously was in a nightguard. I went to the dentist about five years ago and I had a mouth guard made for about $500. After chewing through this mouthguard I needed to find a cheaper solution. Pro dental to the rescue, easy to fit and are great thank you</li>
            <li> I have worn mouth guards (for teeth grinding while sleeping) for decades and have always gotten custom made ones from the dentist.  My insurance coverage was all spent this year and I really needed another mouth guard.  I read several reviews before buying this and felt really unsure it the mouth guard would work.  IT WORKS!  Really easy to fit.  I have quite a small mouth but it&#x27;s easy to cut to fit.  For those who don&#x27;t have insurance, this economical alternative could work.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Comfort of the item was as expected.  Delivery was very prompt.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, easy to use and really works.Great seller and interactive communication.5 stars product and seller.</li>
            <li> Doctor Don makes superior products and this one is no exception.  Good quality and does the job!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have had several night guards from my dentist, some were over $400, others I bought online or in sports stores.  They were all hard, uncomfortable and had to fit (the dentist product had to be cut and buffed with a dremel tool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is soft and comfotable but surprisingly durable.  I wash it with my toothbrush in the moring and it stays fresh, it can be trimmed with regular scissors and &#x27;rough&#x27; edges will not cut your mouth.  The molding process is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy any other product for my night grinding.</li>
            <li> OK...  I tried these as well as a way more expensive version.  The expensive version didn&#x27;t help me much as it has only small pads between the upper and lower teeth.  And so when I clench my teeth at night the pressure is still concentrated on those few teeth that contact the pads.  With these full mouth guards clenching force is distributed more fully through the mouth and is therefore much more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... there is a big drawback to these that I&#x27;m still dealing with:  You do need to trim these to fit. That&#x27;s not the issue, though it usually takes about 4 nights of trimming, then trying, then trimming, then trying, etc until you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is this:  once you do trim these guards, the edges can be very rough and a little sharp and this irritates the tongue while sleeping.  I&#x27;m experimenting with filing, rubbing, etc to see how to smooth these edges out.  They are slightly better but I wish I knew a way to solve this quickly....</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night and needed an affordable solution. I was impressed by how prompt delivery was, how thorough the instructions were (written and video) and how much the company cares about getting it right for its customers. I had a little trouble with molding, but by the third try I got the hang of it. I&#x27;m really pleased with the result. It works just as well as the previous guard my dentist made for me (for $600), and while it&#x27;s not as thin and tiny as a professional-grade guard, the company offers to thin the walls for free if it&#x27;s an issue (and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me). They are great communicators and really eager to please, which is extremely refreshing. Very impressed with the product and the high touch service. I almost never review on Amazon, but felt this company deserved a shout-out.</li>
            <li> Durable, flexible, stays in the mouth and comfortable. It&#x27;s also nice to have two in the pack!</li>
            <li> Good so far. Followed directions.easy to form. Getting used to sleeping with it..but so far has Been great.</li>
            <li> By carefully following the product directions, I was able to get the mouth guard to fit my bite exactly.  The instructions said if , after I got a strong impression of my teeth, the guard didn&#x27;t fit snug enough to put it back in hot water for 5 seconds and put back in mouth. I did that and, sure enough, it fit my mouth exactly.  I use the mouth guard to bleach my teeth and it worked as well as the guard I got from my dentist (which I had accidently thrown away!).  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> very good value for what is received.  It&#x27;s a bit thick, but does slim down after applying some pressure during the molding process.  Customer support is very helpful.</li>
            <li> arrived as promised and as described. fitting process requires carefully following of directions however actually very simple. unit is working very well for me in protecting a cracked tooth with a root canal that i would like to avoid having pulled. by wearing this at night it keeps the pressure off the questionable tooth and so far it is helping! thank you</li>
            <li> Does what I needed, although it does seems a little thick.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving 5-stars is because they need to include different sizes into their product line.  Even though I trimmed the ends for my wife&#x27;s piece, there is still too much material left.  Too bulky.  I messed up the first one, but that was my fault, the other two (one for me and the other for my wife) work perfectly, bar the fact that there us just way too much silicon in our mouths.  Revisit your product design and directions (which were also very convoluted and long).</li>
            <li> First off, there&#x27;s a nice video that you can watch to get an idea of how to use this product. The link is on the instructions. I have used many different mouth-guards and this material is a little different. It is thicker and the material doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape when heating as well as other products. There&#x27;s a good chance that the sidewall will collapse either in the water or as you take them out. I&#x27;d suggest putting them in the hot water for only 15 seconds. I used two forks to get them out of the hot water and also to pry apart the walls. This product is also much thicker and heavier than other products on the market. Even so, this mouth-guard fits extremely well in mouth. I used it last night and hardly noticed it and it also stayed in my mouth all night.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth in the night so I was excited to try this mouth guard out. Im glad I did my jaw feels less sore in the morning with this guard. I have braces so my dentist was happy that I got a mouth guard because it could have caused damage to my teeth if it didn&#x27;t. I love this mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for honest review.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see rather hollow teeth fitting area compared to other mouth guard I am familiar with but after it has been molded to my teeth, it slips into my upper teeth very well and I am starting to like the small profile of this mouth guard. The detailed instruction that comes with the guards is really helpful.</li>
            <li> The material feels great on the teeth, sort of rubber like and slightly squishy. The instructions are great and easy to understand. Just follow the instructions exactly for the best results. These are the only dental guards that I will ever buy. Excellent product above and beyond customer support.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this mouth guard for my night time teeth grinding.  My dentist wanted me to pay over $500 for a custom mouth guard (that was AFTER insurance).  This works just as well and saved our family a lot of money.  The fitting was easy and I don&#x27;t notice it at all when I sleep.  The customer service (Angela) is second to none.  She emailed me after I got it with detailed instructions.  My first attempt at forming the impression was easy and I did a pretty good job, but I accidentally made it slightly off center.  Angela sent me a new one right away.  I loved this so much I recommended it to my brother and now want to fit one for my daughter.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other heat and form mouthguards, and I&#x27;ve never been able to keep them in at night. This one stays in all night. I did mess up the first one, and I think some parts of the instructions would be better with some diagrams, such as how to lay it down on the paper towel. The second one I did have to do some fitting, but I just dipped parts in the hot water for a few seconds and worked on it section by section until it fit perfectly. I didn&#x27;t need to trim it or anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately two years. I don&#x27;t sleep without it. Not only has it protected my teeth but it has changed my sleeping habits. The product is easy to use me instructions are very detailed. The mouthpieces great but even better than that is customer service and this company has that. Thank you pro dental.</li>
            <li> Used these for my daughters karate. These are better than the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the store. She says they are much more comfortable than all the others I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to give five stars only because having to wear a night guard is not something I could ever love! The product is exactly as described.  The instructions were very well written and easy to understand.  The video which followed the purchase was helpful as well.  Initial ineptitude on my part led to too loose a fitting, but the product is malleable and forgives some mistakes. It&#x27;s dual use as a teeth-whiting tray is also appealing. The availability of additional assistance was also reassuring.</li>
            <li> Ok well this product has everyone fooled. It does what it states it does, but if you use it you will understand its bad for your teeth Because its not designed for a perfect fit. When you go to the dentist you design and make a perfect exact fit for your teeth and is light/small. This has a BIG ISSUE with your teeth because when you grind your teeth is grinding on huge amount of rubber and that causes pressure on your teeth, which will soon become damaged and will cause you to loose a tooth or get a ruth canal. Don&#x27;t say i didn&#x27;t warn you!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and fits well.  Price is good with 3 separate guards.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. I followed the instructions provided and everything worked the way it was supposed to. I used the guard the&lt;br /&gt;first night and was very happy that I did not have any issues since I was worried about not being able to sleep with it. I am very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;with it and cancelled my prior appointment with my dentist to have a mouth guard professionally made.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to fit. Feels good and much better than the other I&#x27;ve tried. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> very durable, work great.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. ..directions important to avoid overlap melt. .use fingers to mold good fit</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife. The directions were very clear and easy to follow. We had to reheat a couple of times but other than that it was easy and she got a perfect fit. She love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good fit, no trimming needed.</li>
            <li> Dentists don&#x27;t like their clients getting these from ProDental and not from them, but I have had no trouble molding it to fit my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Directions are self explanatory.  Price is the best part.  This is new for me so I have no comment on longevity of the guard, but with three&lt;br /&gt;in a pack...I have at least 3 years!</li>
            <li> Best ever fit and comfort. Easy to understand fitting instructions, and I sleep without even knowing I have it on.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard has been great using it at night to prevent teeth grinding. It was really easy to mold, and the instructions and emails the company has sent have been very clear and helpful. My only problem is that I trimmed it too much, not counting on the shrinking, despite the instructions about it. My fault!</li>
            <li> I have such bad habit of grinding my teeth at night and cannot find the right mouth guard that is comfortable for me. I got these mouth guard expecting me to find them across the room, only they have been staying in my mouth lol. The mouth guard is comfortable and great to use at night. I love how I can use these not only as a mouth guard at night but also to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this product...especially the fact that you get multiples.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble fitting or using it as a guard for my teeth since I tend to grind them in my sleep.  Has helped tremendously and will buy these again!</li>
            <li> Hard to form, but I&#x27;ve never done it before.  Good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard will likely be my favorite of three brands I have tried. I have been using it for two weeks.The instructions were clear and useful, even though I pretty much knew what to do. It is the most comfortable mouth guard I have tried, by far. Part of that may be the precise instructions that led to a very nice fit. It will not fall our of my mouth. It is much easier to speak with it in, compared to all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I was concerned at first because the guard is stiff and bulky just out of the package.  I was concerned that the process was too complicated, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I had to dip the guard twice as I didn&#x27;t let it get hot enough the first pass.  The second time when I put it in my mouth it moulded to my teeth like a charm.  I paid $400 for a guard from my dentist years ago and my dog got ahold of it.  I didn&#x27;t have the money to replace it and my teeth suffered because of it.  I have extreme grinding craters and couldn&#x27;t wait any longer to do something.  Money was an issue so I googled options.  Because of the ratings on the ProDental guard I took a chance.  I am so happy, I wish I had done it a long time ago!  My teeth wouldn&#x27;t look like they do.</li>
            <li> We love the versatility of this product. Dentist designed with value in mind. WE love the fact that it can be a teeth grinding deterrent or a sports mouth guard...not to mention the tooth whitening tray too. It&#x27;s very healthy as it is BPA free...and it&#x27;s so soft too!</li>
            <li> The piece is large and I&#x27;ve had to do some trimming, but it definitely works as a guard against grinding.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with my mouth guard. I actually went to the dentist and was told I needed to buy a guard to wear at night. I had already purchased these so I made it the same night. I followed the instructions and it fits like a glove. I slept all night with it and it stayed in place and was a great night guard. I will DEFINITELY be recommending this product to anyone needing a guard !!!! - side note. I have purchased a few other brands from walmart - target - etc and they didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> These were easy to mold and fit. The seller sends informational emails and follow up emails to make sure it is working for you. They appear to be sturdy enough for the one year they are estimated on lasting. Great that you get three!</li>
            <li> Update (1/25/15):  upgraded to 5 stars because of outstanding customer service. Dr Don reads these reviews, and responded to mine with an offer to trim and thin my wife&#x27;s at no charge to us. I mailed it to him, he immediately modified it and sent it back, and my wife is now happy with how her&#x27;s fits. Dr Don included a brand new mouthguard in case my wife wasn&#x27;t happy with the modifications. And I&#x27;ve been using mine for several months without issues. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:  Use it to stop grinding as recommended by my dentist (found hairline fractures in my front uppers). Works good. Molding was a little challenging...instructions are very good - follow them carefully. Only other complaint is these are larger than my wife&#x27;s dentist provided mouthguard. Tried 1st attempt on bottom teeth. Trimmed it to fit &amp; molding was fine but couldn&#x27;t use it after 3 nights because of irritation to front lower gums. Molded 2nd one to upper teeth, no problems so far after several months (3 are included &amp; company will evidently send more if needed). Molded 3rd one for my wife but despite trimming per instructions it&#x27;s too big. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but seems ideal for adult sports. ProDental says these can also be used for whitening. Hence 3 mouthguards...1 for grinding and/or sports, 2 lightly molded for whitening? A good deal cheaper than dentist office mouthguards.</li>
            <li> So far, so good, after about two weeks of use.  The instructions were very good, and the process to create a fitted mouth guard was easy.  Worked fine on my first attempt, and the guard is form-fitting but very comfortable.  It is soft, so I am interested to see how long the guard lasts.  I wear it at night to protect my teeth from clenching, and can be hard on guards.  I figure if I spend $70 a year on this guard replacing chewed up ones, I will still come out well ahead of the cost of a dentist-produced guard.</li>
            <li> It is working well!  I did have to heat it a second time because it didn&#x27;t form to my teeth well the first time.  But, I think that was because I didn&#x27;t leave it in the hot water long enough.  The second time I just watched the form instead of the clock and I pulled it out just as the sides were coming together.  I had another &amp;#34;grinding guard&amp;#34; from another company before this one, but I wanted a guard that was BPA free.  This is advertised as being BPA free, but it didn&#x27;t actually have that claim on the package or the literature that came with the guard so I&#x27;m trusting the heading on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great mouth guard! Took a few tries in the hot water but eventually got it to soften so that it can mold to the teeth. Be sure to follow the directions!</li>
            <li> it was good  the material was a little thin,</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mouth Guard from ProDental after I injured my eyetooth from clenching at night and had to have a root canal consisting of three separate visits to the Endodontics Dentist. I have to report that these mouth guards work really well and had I known earlier I most likely could have saved myself from a lot of dental pain. I have used only one of the three guards since purchase and it still is holding up amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to fit and as comfortable as imagined and I am able to sleep with the guard the entire night with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;The price was fantastic too.</li>
            <li> I paid a couple hundred dollars for a professional Dentist mouth guard (due to constant teeth grinding at night) and was not happy with it.  So I ordered this and got the product promptly. The instructions are very important.  This Mouth Guard I created fits better and feels better and is what I now use (not the expensive one).  I can recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not sure how long each one will last.  The first one is already showing signs of wear.  But the fit is comfortable, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major clencher and grinder. I&#x27;m working a major project at the office and as a result the pressure has been on. I had a measureable amount of damage to my teeth over the course of the year. I had been given a night guard a couple of years ago but couldn&#x27;t stand the way it fit. I liked that I could adjust the fit. I really appreciated that they offer so much support and will walk you through the adjustments. So last night was the first test, I went in doubting that I would be able to sleep with something in my mouth...slept like a baby and woke up with my teeth clenched as normal. Mouth guard was in place. So pleased.</li>
            <li> Customer service was great but they were just too thick and bulky - basically a glorified sports mouth guard.  If you&#x27;re expecting the thin hard plastic ones that you get from the dentist keep looking</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, easy to understand directions, and great relief for my ever annoying teeth grinding!</li>
            <li> I wear a mouth guard to prevent grinding. Have tried other mouth guards but this beats all of them. Plus the instructions were emailed to me (as a video) as well as included in the package which really helped.  This ProDental mouth guard is the most comfortable guard I&#x27;ve ever had! Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used a hard dentist-manufactured guard for many years.  When my guard broke I decided to try this one.  After purchase, it took me a while to decide to shape this guard.  Though the process sounded quite complex, it turned out not to be bad.  I will do things a bit differently for the second one in the package.  I will cut more off the tops &amp; will make sure to press hard enough to stretch it toward the back of my teeth.  The guard really does the job &amp;, if not a thing of beauty, is very comfortable.  And, since starting to use it my jaws have not hurt at all.  (I grind my teeth terribly at night.)  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other products from Dr. Don and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the products as well as the detailed instructions provided. I really like that the mouth guards are made from a FDA approved material. It was easy to mold and I was able to comfortably wear it the first night.</li>
            <li> Mouth guard came earlier than expected :) Relatively easy to mold,must follow directions carefully. After boiling the water and submerging the guard for instructed time, it still seemed a little hard-left it in a little longer and finally softened. The guard conforms to the mouth perfectly and I did NOT need to trim it. When I tried it on dry, it was big and bulky and looked like it might need a bit of trimming -DON&#x27;T, once it is submerged in the hot water, it shrinks and molds to appropriate mouth size. I have worn it several days and I love it- no more teeth grinding for me! When ordering, order 2-3 plastic mouth guard cases-you are going to need them!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best at-home-mold mouth guard you can get, but it&#x27;s still not as good as the real deal. I am impressed with how accurately it molds, but the walls are too thick. It may be more due to my overbite, but I find it most comfortable to wear when I&#x27;m sleeping with my mouth open, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to talk coherently while wearing it. I&#x27;m going to try to mold it to my bottom teeth and see if that does any better.</li>
            <li> Easy instructions and easy to configure.  They work great for nighttime teeth grinding and they are as close to custom without spending that much money.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouth/night guard I have ever tried!!!  And I have tried them all.  Let&#x27;s see... I tried all the Dentek (Which never last as long as they say on the package.  Woke up many times with chunks of the things falling in the back of my throat.)  Tried the sleep aid mouth guard, which was total torture!  The thing didn&#x27;t feel right with or without boiling, and I was so desperate for a guard I ended up cutting the bottom part off to use it.  Tried all those Doctors Guards, and those strange no boil ones... Yeah don&#x27;t waste your money on those thin bar ones, that just have the padding for the back teeth.  Those do not last long, and eventually you will start grinding your front teeth.  I also tried getting custom made ones from the dentist, but those are expensive, and the molding process is really uncomfortable. (Especially when the lab tech loses the little air pocket essential for getting the mold to release.  Nothing like the feeling of all your teeth being pulled at once! My teeth are fine, but I just have a smidge of trauma from that experience...)  Anyway let me list the pros to these ProDental Guards for my fellow night grinders and clenchers.&lt;br /&gt;1. Extra long (ACTUALLY FITS TO YOUR BACK TEETH!) hallelujah they actually reach the teeth they are supposed to protect!&lt;br /&gt;2.Thick but not too thick... (Right, little vague but... if you ever had to use a night guard before you know when one is so thick you can&#x27;t close your mouth, or so thin that it will only last a week.  These guards have the perfect thickness, so they will last, and I can comfortably close my mouth.)&lt;br /&gt;3. They flex! (Along side the thickness there is a little flex to them, which is what makes them comfortable.  It is nothing like those horrid hard heavy duty ones you get from the dentist, or that evil Sleep Aid night Guard.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Actually made for a normal sized adult mouth!  (Huh.. Strange requirement right?  Well you&#x27;d think so after all the products I bought.  Not only do they have enough reach for the back, but they also have it for the front teeth too. So you are not teetering on the edge of the front of the guard, or having to make compromises about which teeth you want to protect more.&lt;br /&gt;5. 3 pack!!! Yay!  A company that actually cares about its customers for once.  If you mess up one, you can try again.  Though, I found these extremely easy to mold, so then you got two extras for when you need to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;So yes, as an extreme grinder, who could kill a high quality Dentek in a month, I totally recommend these ProDental mouth guards.  BUY THEM!  I plan to purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who grinds his teeth horribly at night. The mouth guards were too huge even when softened through boiling. That was a no go for him. But I have used them for teeth whitening and they&#x27;re bearable enough to keep in for half an hour.</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my teeth-whitening gel. It works great! It was easy to mold to my mouth and is comfortable. It does a good job of holding the gel in place. It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Worked just as described.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Instructions clear and easy to understand.  I have a small mouth and large teeth and it was no problem to adjust it to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Bruxism to the point that I wake myself up because of it. Every three hours I wake up and I haven&#x27;t had a good nights rest in so long. I&#x27;ve also tried numerous night guard and this product is by far the greatest night guard I have purchased. The seller provided me with tons of information on getting a good impression and fitting, and the process was very easy. I have a smaller mouth and I did trim down the edges a bit with a scissors prior to making the impression. The guard is comfortable and not bulky in my mouth and it doesn&#x27;t mess with my wacky gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get three of these bad boys which makes you feel good, just in case you mess up doing the impression. But even if you do, you can get turn in the messed up one for a fresh one. Even if you need it thinned, you can send it on in and they will do that at no extra charge which is great costumer service. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> this was easy to use and extremely helpful to stop a lip biting habit. It worked way faster than I expected, one day seems to have done it.</li>
            <li> I had one of the best experiences with customer service of anyone. I was happy with the product but wanted it to be smaller so i contacted company and they were wonderful helping me send product to be extra fitted. They were so helpful! And the end product came back fast and fits perfectly! I will spend the money on getting the other ones fitted when the time comes. I give this product and the customer service a perfect rating.</li>
            <li> The material was way too thick to mold appropriately to my teeth. I watched videos online to get it right, still couldn&#x27;t. I tried to wear the one I could do to the best of my ability at night and since I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth properly, my jaw ached and I had to take them off. I would like to return them (though I understand one out of the multi-pack has been opened) and Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow for returns on this. Risky to buy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The mouth guard offers effective protection from grinding while sleeping.  The setup can be a little tricky, but it is not difficult.  I have been using it for a while now and it has been very good.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> too big for nightguard</li>
            <li> arrived on time and the instructions were clear. good value.</li>
            <li> If you are using these as a nite guard they are a little too thick.  Definitely more for sports mouth pieces.</li>
            <li> Well, I literally just got this in the mail today so I haven&#x27;t slept with it in my mouth yet, but I found the directions easy to follow. I do have a small mouth (even after having a few teeth removed from overcrowding!) and so I trimmed the sides off before starting the molding process. Following the directions closely, I was able to get a very good close fit for my upper teeth. It stays put without me having to hold it in place. It did take me a few dunks between the hot and ice water to get it right, but I feel like this piece is really solid. I&#x27;ll probably have a better idea of how I like it after sleeping with the mouth guard in for a few nights. The reason it&#x27;s getting four stars right now is because I feel like the material under my very back teeth is somewhat thick and it&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable, but not enough for me to not use the product at all. I definitely feel like I won&#x27;t even notice it when I&#x27;m going to sleep.</li>
            <li> Flexible-soft, no rough edges, no latex (REALLY allergic), easy to use and shape to fit to my mouth. I was able to put my whitening gel in with no problem and it stayed put! No muss, no fuss-just rinsed when I finished and stored until I need it next. Other mouth guards have been too flimsy or too hard (irritated my gums), this one was perfect. Follow the instructions and it&#x27;s a remarkably comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  Watched the product fitting tutorial on YouTube, followed the instructions and had no problem getting it right with the first guard.</li>
            <li> Best Mouth Guard I&#x27;ve used to date and also the most affordable!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to fit, stays in all night long, unlike my previous one (different brand) that would not mold properly to my teeth, so it always fell out of my mouth during the night. I&#x27;ll be a customer for a very long time!</li>
            <li> brought pain to my teeth when I used it as night guard. Dentist told me it was because this wasnt fitting correctly. Teeth pain went away the next day after not using it for one night. Will prob good for sports but not for night guard.</li>
            <li> I have been using mouth guards for years now. Usually I would use Dentek nightguard because I grind my teeth horribly while I sleep. The Dentek guard would separate where the two pieces are molded together after a month or so and I had to buy new ones constantly.  I decided to try this one based on the reviews and also because the price was reasonable. It is a great mouth guard. Molds easily and seems that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Too big and bulky.  It wasn&#x27;t hard to mold to my teeth, but this is definitely more for sports than for sleeping.  I looked like I was headed into the boxing ring!  Couldn&#x27;t sleep at all because it was so uncomfortable in my mouth.  Actually started to hurt my teeth so I took it out after about 3 hours.  Went and got an Oral B mouthguard.  Much better!</li>
            <li> I ordered ProDental  and other kind from Dental Lab.  When I received the other kind which was much more expensive $90 + I found out that the material was exactly the same kind as this one.  The only difference is they take your impression and make it fit for your teeth, and you use hot water to mold it to fit it for this product.  It was kind of too thick and my mouth stays open in front when I close it.  I guess it is for athlete, so they gave me an instruction to make it thinner in front to use it as a night guard.  I gave 5 stars as the price was much cheaper for the same material compare to the $90 one.  Besides there are 3 of them in 1 package.  So, if you have patience to mold it to fit your mouth good, this was really a better deal.  Next time, I will just buy this product as I know the other kind was same material.</li>
            <li> As a night time teeth grinder I am very pleased to endorse the ProDental 3 in 1 Mouth Guard.  It was easy to adjust to fit my mouth by following the simple instructions.  Also, I have intended on whitening my  teeth for a very long time and am excited about the idea that I can use this product to do that.  Strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time with other teeth grinding products. This thing flat out works. Watch the video to insure you understand the process, but it&#x27;s really quite easy. I&#x27;ve tried many teeth guards, however this one is easily the easiest to use. So when you buy this, let me emphasize...watch the video.</li>
            <li> It is not in my nature to write reviews but I must confess that I was quite impressed with the ProDental mouth guard. In purchasing it, my expectations were not that high having had a Dentist molded mouth guard which I stopped using after feeling uncomfortable and borderline pain with use over some months. Despite returning back for amendments and all, I simply gave up and this cost me $400+. The ProDental mouth guard was easy to use (had to re-mold it 3X prior to getting the perfect fit) but it was simple and it works. It is quite light and comfortable. More importantly, the ProDental folks followed up on me with several emails on what is required to make it work, videos, offering assistance and more guidance. I somehow feel guilty that I never responded! But it is one that I will recommend to anyone for the price. It comes with three and the first one worked for me thus I still have two more that can be used down the road. I have barely used it for one month+ now but I will recommend trying it out for the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold and so comfortable, don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s in my mouth, no more grinding my teeth. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I did not like the night guard my dentist made me, so tried this. My experience was disappointing. The hot water molding procedure is tricky. I followed the instructions as closely as I could, but still managed to ruin 2 of the 3 guards. The \\&quot;good\\&quot; one felt awful in my mouth compared to a professionally made guard. So I ordered a custom guard right here on Amazon. When I put that one in I thought \\&quot;wow, this is so much better.\\&quot; Considering the amount of time you have a guard in your mouth, the extra expense and time is worth it. Be aware there are different styles to choose from in the professionally made guards.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I try a guard. This product was a bit time consuming to fit to my jaw but was well worth the effort. AND it won&#x27;t take that long when I fit the next one. It turns out that although I don&#x27;t actually grind my teeth I do &amp;#34;clench&amp;#34; which was causing some nerve pain, emulating a non existent, painful cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product received good reviews which is why I chose it. Good value and as comfortable as such things can be. Not very romantic though!</li>
            <li> Easy to mold and a great custom fit.  Much better than the one my dentist made (for $500!).  Very happy with the quality and durability of the night guard and have no problem wearing it all night.</li>
            <li> I tried to follow the ProDental video and written instructions during my first two attempts at forming this mouth guard around my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A combination of slow reflexes and a steep learning curve resulted in two globs of soft plastic that, while one might consider them pieces of found art, are useless as night guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions and video say to leave the ProDental guard in the almost-boiling water for between 18 and 20 seconds.  That&#x27;s 2 second window.  That in itself is an invitation for failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third attempt I followed the instructions from another manufacturer&#x27;s product.  Instead of placing the ProDental guard into ~200 degree water, I used water at 165 degrees Fahrenheit.  I also increased the &amp;#34;time in the soup&amp;#34; from 20 seconds to about 45.  This gave me ample time to retrieve the mouth guard once it started to soften.  I did have to soften it a few times to get a good fit, and as a final touch (thanks to the instructional video)  gently pinch the channels together while dunking it in the ice water (for a tighter fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this product five stars if it weren&#x27;t for the steep learning curve.  I&#x27;m guessing that the people who did the instructional material have formed these guards hundreds of times.  It&#x27;s easy to forget how clumsy other people can be - unless you actually watch them try to follow the process that you&#x27;ve tried to document.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my husband as he is a snorer and grinds his teeth. This was perfect for 3 different uses on 3 different people. 1 tray perfect for the smaller mouth(maybe like a female or teens jaw line) soft and flexible and easy to clean. It has one perfect for a teeth whitening tray and is trimmed to prevent rubbing. The last is for multi protection for instance a sports mouth guard. Each is specifically made and cut and is most easily molded using warm water. Thick cushioned base to prevent pain in jaw and muscles. excellent!!</li>
            <li> Quite happy with the product. Love that it&#x27;s BPA free. The instructions for fitting were kind of daunting, but it ended up being pretty simple. I&#x27;m using it for teeth grinding and ended up cutting off too much in the black, but the guard is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t let my back teeth touch. Also, its a better deal than the retail stores had, and a better product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> There was no way that I was going to buy a night guard from my dentist for over $500, and I didn&#x27;t want a generic flimsy guard that was meant to fit all mouth sizes. This mouth guard hits the spot. It&#x27;s inexpensive, thick enough to last, and you can fit it to your mouth. Mine fit after I followed the instructions but seemed just a tad bulky so I sent it to the company, where they shaved it down to remove some of the bulkiness and now I like it even better. It fit without having them do this but now it is better. Furthermore, from the time I mailed it until I got it back was about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used DenTek/generic guards (not molded, changed bite), molded/hard plastic hybrids (way too large), and rigid molds from dentists (ridiculously expensive and too rigid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ProDentals have really resolved most of my issues with my previous dental guards.  I switched to these after my bite had changed from using generic guards and it caused one of my teeth to get worn down by day-to-day chewing.  These are comfortable and easily molded to fit.  I did have heat up the same guard 3 times to make adjustments.  It was also easy to trim any uncomfortable sections with sharp scissors.  Overall, these are a winner given the comfort, ease of use, and price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about durability yet but they seem thick enough to last a while.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.great experience. .</li>
            <li> Instructions to ensure proper fit for the mouth-guard were very clear and easy to follow. Reading the material and watching the video allowed me to get it right the first time. Great product. Very happy with the fit and function.  More comfortable than the one made by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Works better than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. Plus is comes with 3 incase you mess up (which I didn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> Worked well. Easy to mould. Good fit.</li>
            <li> While this is a little bit difficult to trim and shape, it is the only one that would fit my ten-year-old daughter, who grinds her teeth sometimes in sleep. It got ride of her headaches and her teeth are no longer being damaged. If you follow the instructions carefully, you&#x27;ll get a good result, and the manufacturer is very helpful with questions and suggestions.</li>
            <li> Great and detailed instructions for a PERFECT fit.  You get 3 trays.  I gave 2 away to a friend and family member. First night was akward, but by second night it feels natural, and I don&#x27;t go to sleep without one anymore.  Saving me from big dental bills.</li>
            <li> Received product as a promotion!! This item is just as described!!! The quality is great. Will definitely purchase more when needed!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used night guards for about 8 years now.  Always used &amp;#34;doctors&amp;#34; or something similiar.  This one is by far my favorite. Very easy to mold and wear.  It seems as though it will last a while too because the plastic where my teeth meet is thick.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly. My first mold turned out okay, but my second one is the most comfortable mold I have ever had for my teeth. I have a problem with clenching or bruxism, and this has so far been THE most comfortable product I have used for my medium to large mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ONE warning is that after boiling water you do not need to wait 20 seconds. I think for me in MN it is more like 7 seconds and no more. I made a perfect fit by lightly biting down after taking it out with a cold metal tongs. I can sleep with this in my mouth. I made it for the top teeth to set it as that is more comfortable for most. I give this product five stars. I have one mold left. The first one was okay and it works but I didn&#x27;t push on the mold enough and didn&#x27;t indent my teeth in it enough for it to be as comfortable as my second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the boiling water was left to sit for about 5 seconds I dipped the piece in fully for 7 seconds, as it then was starting to curl, and then I took it out and basically put it my mouth and used my fingers to place just how I wanted. I like how they give you three molds here. Their customer service seems pretty decent too.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive alternative to the equivalent purchased through the dentist. The guards are a little thicker too which are helpful for grinders and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Like these better than my bite guard I had made at my dentist!  Very easy to mold and very comfortable! !!</li>
            <li> not a bad product. ok for the price.</li>
            <li> High quality material and amazing post-sale service. The guard is very comfortable for wearing at night.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. Very good directions on how to form mouthguard. I find the mouthguard comfortable and helping significantly with the grinding/clenching.</li>
            <li> Better than the one I had made at the dentist and only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> The instructions on this could have been a little more clearly written, and bullet pointed so you could follow along step by step as you go, but other than that there&#x27;s no complaint at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were stellar (great fit), and I woke up without blood in my mouth from damage to gums due to teeth grinding (no tension headache, either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d make sure to read through the instructions a few times to visualize the steps, and to mark a 1, 2, 3, etc. for each step on the instructions, but other than that I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this to take some getting used to, but it was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also state right in the literature that comes with it that they want it work out for you and will replace or return if needed (if you mess it up on re-sizing, for instance).  I didn&#x27;t have to resize at all so that was a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the result and the fact that there are two more to mold in the future when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this to clean in a tray of water just hot from the tap and at the end of the day it had shrunk to the point my back teeth at either end and up and down weren&#x27;t covered.  The takeaway here is to use cold water when cleaning, not hot.  Hot should only be for molding.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fits as advertised. Molding and trimming is easy.  Included instructions provides all of the details needed to start using this product right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a teeth grinder and I expect this product to have a better lifespan than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s a little thicker on the bottom which will go a long way.  The sidewalks are also a comfortable thickness.  It makes for a very comfortable fit and I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there most nights.</li>
            <li> Edited (10/31/2014):&lt;br /&gt;I botched up my first mouth guard, but the 2nd one worked out fine. The mouth guard fits well, and it is comfortable for overnight use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Instructions suggest that the guard should be left in hot water till the edges start to curl in.&lt;br /&gt;I would leave the guard in hot water for slightly longer (couple of seconds more after you see curling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Also, do not wait for too long before inserting the moldable guard in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Make sure the center of the guard lines up exactly between your two front teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;I received 3 guards and fitting instructions within the promised shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products seem to be as described. I am still to try fitting these guards and I will update this review once I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions seem to be thorough, but I wish they had some illustrations / diagrams / youtube videos demonstrating the fitting instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great that the seller will replace the guards if you mess up all 3 guards while fitting.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to get this product to fit - I have a small mouth and there was too much plastic even after cutting a decent amount off both the back and top.  Was not the answer for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would use again.</li>
            <li> Does the job. We followed fitting instructions and it works perfectly. Shipping was more than timely. Awesome company, sent an email with even more explicit instructions and faq&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouth guard I&#x27;ve used.  I watched the video and read the instructions carefully, and I had no problem getting the guard to fit properly. I&#x27;ve paid $30 for just one mouth guard, so getting three for that price is amazing!</li>
            <li> These work great but had to trim a lot off as they are larger than I thought. I&#x27;ve used several other brands and these work much better and they stay in your mouth overnight.</li>
            <li> I found these bruxing shields to be easy to fit, durable and as comfortable as possible.</li>
            <li> Stay away.  Unless you want to feel like you&#x27;re about to go into a lacrosse match when going to bed.  Extremely bulky, hard to mold and not comfortable at all.  Looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I got the mouth guard for my son who plays football and he loves it. Says it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. In addition to instructions with package, Prodental contacts you via email prior to arrival to supply QA and Video. Followed the instructions and the Prodental &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; in and does not come out at night.</li>
            <li> Apparently my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover night guards, so I decided to check on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a week, but honestly, even if it falls apart in 6 months it will have been more economical than buying a new mouth guard at full price.  Plus, this comes with three of them.  I feel like there has to be some sort of catch.  Maybe all my teeth will fall out in a year?  Who knows.  For now, this was a good purchase decision</li>
            <li> I held off giving my review until after a month or two of use:&lt;br /&gt;Arrived when promised along with an email from the company asking if I had a questions.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction video was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I did mess up the first one. Luckily there were two others and the second one came out perfect. (The company had indicated they&#x27;d replace any guards I messed up for free, but I didn&#x27;t bother being I had the other two).&lt;br /&gt;I primarily got the mouth guard due to grinding my teeth at night (I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and my jaw would be sore). Once I started using the mouth guard I had no more soreness when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;Wearing the guard took a little getting use to (slight saliva build up etc) but after a few nights I got accustom to it. Actually I think most of the saliva build up was because I would immediately put them in my mouth after rinsing it with water. The excess water still on the guard led to the  build up of saliva. I found that after rinsing it with water I&#x27;d then slightly dry it off prior to putting the guard in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a five star product considering the price compared to what my dentist wanted to charge me....</li>
            <li> These are by far the easiest to mold.  And there is a video to show you, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for these mouth guards, I have a horrible habit of grinding my teeth and these are the best.  I have paid so much for other brands and they never seem to fit properly.  They are easy to customize and they don&#x27;t hurt your gums in any way I am happy!</li>
            <li> Great product. I was skeptical that such an inexpensive device (&amp;#60;$10 each) would actually develop a good enough fit to stay on comfortably through the night to prevent teeth grinding,but after following the directions carefully it worked perfectly. No need to spend $100 + on a custom-molded alternative.</li>
            <li> After several less than comfortable mouth guard experiences, I decided to try this one.  I have a small mouth, so I was starting to wonder if I&#x27;d ever find one that fits right.  I have to say, this is the most comfortable mouthguard I have used,  I actually look forward to putting it in at night.  Would recommend, very impressed!</li>
            <li> This mouth guard is easy to mold.  The instruction is clear and easy to follow.  What is the best is the customer service, I got few emails from them to follow up with the products and all of the tips to improve my sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s good product and very affordable.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try this product to see if it would help with &amp;#34;night grinding&amp;#34;.  Bottom line:  it helped a lot and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and gave it a try.  It took a few nights to get used to using the guard, and now I don&#x27;t even notice it.  One suggestion is to wear it on your bottom teeth...that was my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and it works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the three mouth guards, I didn&#x27;t do a good job at all trying to fit the first one, biting down (even though the instructions said not to), resulting in a guard that would not work.  On the second guard, I tried to trim it a bit before fitting, and messed that one up also.  Fortunately, I was successful on the third guard.  Then I contacted the company asking if I could maybe have one of the guards I messed up replaced, and they immediately sent me two new guards to replace the ones I ruined, at no charge to me.  Wow...great customer service in addition to a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I ordered these guards and can recommend them 100%.</li>
            <li> This is one great item. These are just like the dentist use in the practice. It can be used for grinding teeth, protection from playing sports and as a white teething tray. You can trim them to your own size. I would say if you grind your teeth or do anything with your teeth at night you will love these.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me out a lot! I grind my teeth when I sleep a lot and since I&#x27;ve been wearing it  I don&#x27;t and my jaw doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I got these for my brother. He has been grinding his teeth at night forever. I had told him to get a night guard he didn&#x27;t so I bought him these.&lt;br /&gt; He said they are easy to use even when he over heated them they still worked. They fit his teeth great! He has been using them for over a week and no problems! He now wishes he would have got these a long time ago before his teeth got so bad!</li>
            <li> Great mouth guards! I grind my teeth and clench my jaw when I sleep. Several years ago my dentist made me a (very expensive) custom mouth guard so I wouldn&#x27;t damage my teeth. I&#x27;ve always hated that mouth guard as it was made of a hard plastic that was very uncomfortable. Because I hate it so much I decided to try these mouth guards from pro dental and I&#x27;m very glad I did. They were easy to form, just follow the directions, and they fit nicely. I like how they aren&#x27;t hard plastic like my mouth guard from my dentist. Much more comfortable to wear all night, and durable enough to do the job!</li>
            <li> Followed instructions explicitly and first one was successfully molded to my mouth. The new unmoulded mouth guard seemed really large and I was tempted to trim it before going through the moulding process but instructions said it would shrink slightly. It did. After the cold water drench, put it in and it felt like a professional fit from the dentist. Took a few minutes to get over the gag reflex but I just kept biting down with the back teeth and concentrated breathing through my nose. First night, slept without any issues and every night since. Really happy with the night guard that is stout enough that if I played sports, it would make an excellent mouth guard. I would encourage anyone in need of this type of product to give it a try. Just make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. Great product. Great price!</li>
            <li> Great Product and Price.  Excellend Customer service.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve seen these type guards before. Lots of promises and no delivery. I have a mouth guard that was made by my dentist. It fits too perfectly. Way too hard on the sides it almost feels as though it&#x27;s moving my teeth. Very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions for the pro dental to a t. I am pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s in there....it&#x27;s not going to fall out, yet it&#x27;s soft all around. Really comfortable.  It&#x27;s thicker then the one made by the lab but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me. The softness of the molded material provides a cushion for clenching. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: definitely not designed for bottom teeth. It probably could be cut down but I didn&#x27;t feel like trying. .......last thought..took me 5 minutes to mold and fit.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful the directions are easy to follow but make sure you pay attention to the timing and watch the guard while it is in the water like the directions tell you</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s lots of discussion about the molding of this item and it&#x27;s pretty much as described. If you watch the video and read the instructions and exercise a bit of patience it&#x27;s not that big a deal. But all that aside, these guards are just too thick. They are roughly 3 times thicker than the ones I got from my dentist. I think they&#x27;re fine for football or other contact sports but as a night guard I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Finally!  An affordable solution to my relentless (unconscious) clenching.  So pleased with these.  They&#x27;re easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was very leery of making a mistake while fitting this mouth guard, and was delighted with how easy it was to get it to fit perfectly! It&#x27;s comfortable, and easy to keep clean..When I did have a few questions, they were answered quickly and completely..GREAT customer service!</li>
            <li> These are a perfect fit in a family with 3 active boys.  They shipped fast and mold easily.</li>
            <li> Love these things. I use them when I am weightlifting and they really help. They are pretty easy to form too. I found that I had to trim them a little only because they felt a little thick when I put them in. But I just kept warming them and trimming a little bit until I got it to fit better. I found that I could reshape them over and over until they felt really good and then after the initial fitting I could re-warm and then rinse in cold water to firm them up. I sort of used my first set ( of the 3 ) as kind of a test, and after several back and forth re-shapings, I got them where I wanted but still not as good as the second time I tried with the # 2 set. I use that one all the time at the gym and I have the unshaped spare still.. I think I was a bit nervous about trimming  on the first molded form and thus it is thicker than I like and is a little high on my gumline, but still fit ok. I put it in a case for hard times. Ha. Anyway, these are fantastic for my gymwork. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My daughter grinds her teeth so I thought I would try this guard out. So far it&#x27;s helping her</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth but found that I was better off not trimming. Have one suggestion, when fitting it after the boiling process, be careful with the back molar area of the mouth guard. It is easy to off-center the back when pressing and sucking it into position for molding. Even though I molded mine a bit off center on one, side it still fits and performs well. I feel that upon awakening, my jaw is better aligned and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt any more. Anyone else have a problem with jaw snapping at night! I also haven&#x27;t bitten my tongue since I got it, another bonus! Love all the money I saved since the dentist wanted $318 for his. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a high-quality dentist-made mouth guard and after it broke, a thermoplastic one I bought in a drug store.  The latter seems to work quite well and when I asked my dentist, he approved of it.  Recently my wife has needed one, so I bought this one from ProDental.  As a former dentist and research scientist, I&#x27;ve found that the ProDental one is extremely well designed, works perfectly and comes with excellent instructions (including an available on-line video) and unsurpassable follow-up technical support.  There are three to a package (for the price I paid for one in the drug store), so you don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mistake and can have additional ones for back-up and different uses.  This company, run by a dentist, is serious about doing the right thing.  You won&#x27;t be able to make a better choice.</li>
            <li> The mouthguard was far too big for my mouth. I trimmed and put in hot water to re-form but then it was digging into my gums. This guard would be fine for sports protection, but not as a night guard for grinding problem</li>
            <li> Hah screw those Dentists trying to get you to pay 1000 bucks for a custom one.  These are great for the money</li>
            <li> Only have had it for two days but it is amazing. I was skeptical buying mouth guards that have to be molded because I am usually not too good following instructions on this type of thing. I went step by step and it is a perfect fit. Did not have to waste one and try getting it right the 2nd time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have woken up everyday the past 2-3 years with a sore and aching jaw and a headache that lasted almost all day. The 1st morning after using it I could immediately feel comfort that I haven&#x27;t felt in the morning in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is very easy to fall asleep with and does not feel like a discomfort staying on your teeth for 8 hours or more.</li>
            <li> I have been having issues with jaw clenching/grinding while sleeping and was instructed by my dentist to get a mouth guard as this was damaging my teeth. This guard seems to be a good deal for the money and is relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  My dentist said I needed one and it would $400 or I could get one from amazon.  I screwed up 2 trying to get the fit right and, as advertised, the manufacture sent me 2 free replacements.  There is one unexpected benefit.  I no longer snore since I have been using this product.  My wife says HOORAH.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Fit to my mouth.  It help me stop the nightmare of teeth grinding. Great</li>
            <li> I have a clenching challenge due to an illness in the family.  Since I can&#x27;t take the time to do what I used to do meditation, some yoga and long runs because of that, rather than drug up I bought these things.  Did the fitting process on one, came out ok but not great (one side of my jaw was swollen, preventing a proper fit).  After a few days to allow the jaw to normalize a little, the fit was better and I could use the protector more often.  Still it needs a better fit but jaw is still a bit swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes an observation some might find useful.  Last night, during sleep, I apparently had another clenching bout.  Woke around 4 AM with my jaws aching and couldn&#x27;t stop it.  I hadn&#x27;t put the protector in and so decided to try sleeping with it even with the not-so-good fit: amazingly, there was an almost instant relief from the ache.  This thing really did a good job, even not being quite right with the jaw still swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even if you can&#x27;t quite get a good fit, this thing works.  As my jaw swelling reduces, I&#x27;ll try refitting the protector (don&#x27;t yet know if reheating will allow a refit, I&#x27;m assuming it will).  So far, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  I&#x27;m using the thing on bottom teeth as those seem to be the greater problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.  But do follow the directions to the letter.  Also, I&#x27;ve received through emails further instructions/caveats from ProDental, including a video.  I note one reviewer said pictures would help (definitely) and I assume ProDental took the advice.  Good product, anyway.</li>
            <li> After multiple attempts, could not mold to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used self molding trays for whitening products but this tray is much thicker and since I purchased it for teeth grinding, I do feel it will work well for that.  Basically any type of tray you have in your mouth is going to be somewhat uncomfortable.  I have worn it 2 nights and did ok with it.  The key is to get it to fit perfectly.  There is a YouTube video on how to fit the tray which I would suggest.  It gives you some tips and suggestions.  Just search by the product name and it will come up.</li>
            <li> I purchased my guard approximately 2 weeks ago.  I bought this as I tend to grind my teeth some.  I fitted according to directions and obtained a satisfactory fit. Having a few questions about the final fit and usage, I contacted the company and was truly surprised at the level of help I received from them.  They are a positive exception when it comes to customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them but make sure you follow the fitting instructions for a proper fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are great mouth guards. I use one as a night guard since I grind my teeth and it&#x27;s really comfortable. The other 2 I use for teeth whitening. Follow the instructions exactly and you won&#x27;t have a problem molding them to your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Molds perfect wth teeth and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, but it never fit tight.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions this is a great product. I used on lower teeth for more comfortable fit. Best non dentist made guard I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver~Easy to use! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is very neatly packaged and very easy to use. I loved it! Thanks ProDental</li>
            <li> I think these are identical to the $2 EVA guards you can find elsewhere on Amazon. What you are paying for is the service (see below). Also, they will send you additional guards if you screw up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is significantly bulkier than the night guard that my dentist made 20 years ago. The walls of the guard (inside, outside, bottom) are thick (~3 mm after fitting) and I felt like I was wearing a sports mouthguard. Overcoming this is hard: I had to squeeze all three surfaces of the guard against my teeth using my fingers. This will take considerably longer than the 5 second window you have after taking the guard out of the boiling water. It took me about 8 rounds of molding. And then trim the elongated tops of the walls. And it still won&#x27;t be thin. (If you ask Don to thin them (see below), don&#x27;t bother trying to thin the walls yourself when molding it - just make a simple impression and let Don do all the thinning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the thick walls, it&#x27;s really not clear why the trough for your teeth is so wide. Almost no one has teeth that wide. And you&#x27;re softening the guard anyways, so if the trough were made narrower and happened to be narrower than your teeth, it would just stretch when you molded it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the softened curling walls sticking together, as the instructions warns, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that important how you position the hot guard on the counter (and you can probably skip the wet paper towel, too). However, the guard still has to cool down enough to put in your mouth. And be sure to shake out all the hot water before putting in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Don Closson at ProDental was very solicitous about my concerns. He called me at home offering to thin the impression at his lab for no additional charge. I&#x27;m excited to see how this will turn out. Stay tuned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-MONTH UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I actually sent it back a second time to be thinned even more - I told Don to go as thin as possible. After that it wasn&#x27;t bad - still thicker than a dentist-made guard, but not bad. Don wanted to keep the occlusal face somewhat thicker so that I wouldn&#x27;t wear through it. To give you an idea of how thin they are after the second thinning, with my mouth closed someone might not be able to tell that I&#x27;m wearing them. The thinned surface had a cat&#x27;s tongue texture, which initially was annoying, but it&#x27;s smoothed over time and I no longer notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m awake, I find that I clench my teeth when wearing the guard. I think this is because the occlusal face is somewhat thick and because they are compressible. My front teeth have cut a little into the guard so that it sits a little higher on my gums, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time I got a SISU SOVA night guard. I was very hopeful about these because they are thin, hard, and can be remolded from scratch. Also, they mold at a lower temperature and with more working time than EVA. To give you a sense of how thin they are, with your mouth closed no one could tell that you were wearing them. However, they contract slightly as they harden and I found them extremely difficult to get a precise fit (I tried over 40 times with two different guards). I have given up on wearing these and prefer the EVA.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and it took me a few tries but finally got it right. Really appreciate the video and emails which helped so much. It took me a while to get used wearing it but it has helped. Thank you.</li>
            <li> After I read the instructions, I was a little nervous that I wasn&#x27;t going to do something correctly. But, if you follow the directions implicitly, the form will turn out like you want it. I think it is comfortable to wear while sleeping. I have a small mouth and I gag easily, but the mouthpiece doesn&#x27;t&#x27; make me gag...yeah! My only negative comment would be that I&#x27;ve discharged it from my mouth while asleep and found it in the bed. Maybe its because I didn&#x27;t get the fit exactly perfect when I made it. I would recommend this product. I got it because I grind my teeth and I also bite the inside of my cheeks and tongue...which hurt a lot! so, since I bought the guard, I haven&#x27;t done it.​</li>
            <li> I got a dental guard from my dentist for $300 and lost it after only having it for two months. I could not afford another one. Then I discovered we can buy a mouth guard without having to go through a dentist and for way much cheaper. I decided to give it a try.  After reading reviews on this one I decided to order it. It is more comfortable to wear than the one I had gotten from the dentist. Wish I had known about it sooner - I would have saved $275. This dental guard is easy to fit. I do recommend you follow the instructions that tell you to use a mirror. This company gives you three mouth guards. When I was fitting my first one I did not think I needed the mirror and came out with a crooked fit. Even though it was crooked it was comfortable to wear and functional. I used a mirror when fitting the second one and thus it came out centered like it is supposed to be. I have the third one to save as a spare. I highly recommend this mouth guard to everyone that grinds their teeth while sleeping. It is easy to get a customized fit and it is very comfortable to wear, and way less expensive than getting one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> This item is wonderful.  Follow the instructions closely and - if you&#x27;re like me - you&#x27;ll find it fits better and more comfortably than the one you b ought from your dentist for hundreds of dollars and promptly lost.  We have a great dentist, but never again will any member our family ask him for a mouthguard.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions to mold the guards.....but, very thick and uncomfortable to wear... wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I&#x27;d rather pay the price to have my dentist make guards for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great communication by the manufacturer. Sent an informational email about getting a proper fit prior to the device&#x27;s arrival. I found that to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this. I read all the reviews on this product as well as others and this one seemed to be getting the best reviews. A few days after placing my order I was sent an email with a video on how to make the mouth guard.  That along with the instructions that came with the order made the whole process easy and clear to follow. I was able to fit my first mouth guard easily by following the instructions. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a night guard and I was able to sleep fine with it. I think it also helped with the tongue thrusting too. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this before dishing out a small fortune to the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m still using the first one I made. My husband and I also noticed that my teeth that were starting to protrude due to the tongue thrusting are back like they were as if I&#x27;ve been using braces. Needless to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased! I wasn&#x27;t paid or contacted by the company for my review apart from an email from them when I ordered to leave a review if I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to adjust to my mouth, but a bit too thick on bottom between uppr and lower teeth. Other than that it works fine and was easy to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new mouth guard. Very easy to wear at night good price too.  I will buy it gain.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully with the 3 guard  trying to mold them but  I didn&#x27;t get the desired result and they were loose and fell down easily from ur mouth! I tried to return them through amazon but they said it&#x27;s not eligible for return! I felt very disappointed and felt bad for wasting 30$ for nothing! Then in the exact same day I wrote the review the mouth guard company contacted me saying they they r sorry I&#x27;m not satisfied with their product and gave me the choice to order more for free  and try again or to return them! I was truly amazed by their generous offer and their amazing customer service, I wanted to return them then decided if they will refund me then why not to try molding the guard one more time without fallowing the instructions ! Then I just boiled some water put the guard for like 20 seconds take it out wait few seconds till it cools of then put direct on my mouth with pressing with my tongue the inside part and my fingers the outside part and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation is if u want to use don&#x27;t fallow the instructions!: 1-  In the instructions it&#x27;s written that it&#x27;s better to remove the guard out of the hot water as soon as u notice the walls start curling together ! Don&#x27;t do that M let the walls curl together for few more seconds it will make the guard softer and easier to mold&lt;br /&gt;2- don&#x27;t fallow the last 2 steps , cold water and hot water again then another time cold water !! Mine was perfectly fine from just putting it one time in the hot water then take it out wait few seconds then put in ur mouth and start pressing on it abd that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Follow the directions and thanks to having 3 in the package if you don&#x27;t do it right the first time you will the second time.</li>
            <li> Great item: The mouth guard was easily molded and it fits comfortably on my bottom jaw. My husband also likes his mouth guard which he molded to his upper jaw. We are indeed very happy with this purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> very happy with the product.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this ProDental mouthguard. It was packaged well and came with a laminated instruction card. Very easy to customize to my small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I followed some of the advice from previous posters and lightly bit down as I molded it to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm for my teeth grinding. Thank you ProDental for a cost effective,well made product.</li>
            <li> The item arrived promptly and as described. Simple process of heating and fitting, just make sure not to over cook the plastic as it softens quickly. Seller is very responsive with instructions and offering support of their product. The quality of the product, once fitted is fantastic. They even give you three fittings for future use or in case you mess up when preparing one initially.</li>
            <li> At the risk of sounding like a paid hawker for this mouthguard, I have to say that I am very pleased with all aspects of this product and delivery. Fitting was a breeze with trimming flexibility by the user if needed.  The linked video gives a very confident impression that this is a concerned company. The follow up emails reinforces that theme. Beyond question seems to be they want us satisfied. Most surprising is repeated mention that any dissatisfaction with the molding procedure outcome will be corrected by a return of the guard for new, or trimmed guards by their techs. How many companies will burden themselves with labor costs alone that probably exceeds the profit of the purchase for this service?</li>
            <li> works well....takes a little while to get used to.  Great price for the functionality as compared to purchasing one from a medical practitioner</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product. The instructions were very easy to follow for a custom fit. Really helps at night. I highly recommend this mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I received the product sooner than expected, which is great! Would recommend to anyone that is thinking about purchasing it!</li>
            <li> this works very well as a night guard due to nightly teeth grinding.  No problem in getting it to fit.  I can&#x27;t sleep without it.</li>
            <li> Really appreciated the help video the seller made accessible. I don&#x27;t think I would have succeeded without it. The device is a little thick. I know I can send it to the seller free of charge to have it thinned. Great interaction with this seller, even though I haven&#x27;t actually talked to anyone! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great customer service. Does the job the more expensive ones for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t care for this mouth guard, it was way too bulky for me.  It is my first time wearing a mouth guard but I hated the bulk, So I just ordered one the just rests on either side of the mouth.  I am hoping I can live with that one.</li>
            <li> This guard works well...very comfortable and easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold.  Saved me from grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw while sleeping.  No longer waking to pain and headaches.  Thick enough to prevent my teeth from touching or pushing together. Does not disrupt sleep at all.  Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get one sooner!</li>
            <li> These are great mouth guards, however, follow the fitting instructions closely.  My first mouth guard did not turn out well.  The second is very good.  Just be careful and you will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;The seller has made proactive contact to help with fitting the mouthguard.  Nice touch.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to get tight fit; useable loose, but would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The product works great and it was delivered right away! The ProDental mouth guards material was easily molded to fit and helped reduce the night time from clenching which was giving me bad headaches.  It&#x27;s nice that they come with three sizes.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this product is the price...for years I have been buying the basic football mouth guards at the sports store for $1.49 each and just cutting them to fit just as this product.  They work just as good but you will sometimes end up with some crazy colors so I do like the clear ones from ProDental.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and what a deal getting 3 mouthpieces for $30 that actually work. An added big plus is that the company is very responsive to user input and willing to thin the mouthpieces if requested at no charge with free return shipping. From my internet search, this is the best choice for a diy mouthpiece.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mouth guard!</li>
            <li> I’d like to say that your mouth guards have been the most comfortable, well fitted products I’ve tried! Thanks for all that you do.</li>
            <li> Works as advertized. Instructions are fairly straightforward and worked well.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold. Comfortable to wear- firm but just enough cushion. For my level of teeth grinding, lasted 4-5 moths each, so the whole package served me well over the year until my insurance would cover permanent guards.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews about this product but was still skeptical about the product even after I placed my order. The product arrived in a timely fashion, and the company emailed me to follow up that I has received it and that I had all the information I needed to make a good mould. The process was so easy and I was able to form my mouth guard in the first attempt. If you are in search of an effective product I would definitely recommend ProDental.</li>
            <li> I have been using the ProDental  mouthguard for about a week now and like it. Had no trouble molding it to my mouth as the directions are very understandable. Was having pain from grinding my teeth which has now gone away.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable, bulky. They are basically useless.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth-guard. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because mine was so worn-out, but the style and comfort of this one has been awesome. It was quick and easy to trim and mold (great instructions provided). I had extreme comfort from the start and woke up without a headache, teeth sensitivity or drooling. :-) The price is great since you get three. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as specified and in the new condition as stated. My husband it&#x27;s a very intense teeth grinder in his sleep and and broken thru every guard he has tried in just a few days. This one is much stronger and is lasting much longer than Ruger others and another nice part is there&#x27;s 3 in the order. Total satisfied and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good value and quality.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very satisified with this product. I followed the instructions to mold the guard to fit my teeth and mouth and the result is amazing. The overall quality of the product feels great, especially when compared to the generic mouth guards sold in drugstores. ProDental is much closer to a custom made mouth guard ordered at the dentist&#x27;s office than to any of the generic products I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever been influenced to purchase by the negative reviews. There are just a handful, but each and every one has been answered by the man selling the mouth guards. I feel like if he is willing to stand by his product the way he does, it is worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I just finished molding the mouth guard. The result is identical (aside from heavy use and wear &amp; tear) to the one made for me by a dentist several years ago. The difference in cost is staggering. These three guards cost me less than a tenth of what my copay was. A lot less than a tenth.</li>
            <li> Good price and works like many mouth guards/night guards.  It is a bit thicker than the orthodontist/dentist guards from what I have had in the past, but I have also gotten used to ones similar to these, so it works perfectly.  I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Item was well received and arrived as described. No issues molding the guards with the instructions provided. Great price per item and would order from here again if needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently a tooth grinder while sleeping and a few years ago, my dentist fitted me for a custom tooth guard at a cost of over $400.  That guard was never very comfortable, was constructed of some kind of hard resin material, wasn&#x27;t easy to use at night, and was very difficult to remove in the morning.  It fit so tight that it felt as if the device was going to pull the teeth right out of my mouth, as I tried to remove it.  I decided to give the Mouth Guard from ProDental a shot and am extremely impressed.  The initial setup (place in boiling water for approx 20 seconds, form to teeth, dip in ice water) was really simple.  Trust me, it&#x27;s simple and only takes a few minutes.  The mouth guard itself fits my teeth perfectly, is much more flexible than the expensive one from my dentist, and seems thick enough to last for a good long while.  The Amazon description says it&#x27;s made of a polyvinyl material, but mentally you could visualize it as a thick-ish clear silicone.  Not the least bit uncomfortable in your mouth.  Even though it is very form-fitting to my teeth, it&#x27;s easy to install and easy to remove.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and am really, really pleased.  Three mouth guards are packed inside the box so even if it might wear out prematurely, I wouldn&#x27;t complain one bit.  At less than $10 per device, it&#x27;s a screaming deal.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is simply amazing! The product is of high quality and I feel very comfortable while wearing the gear during night time. One lesson learned is that you don&#x27;t need to trim the guard first, you should do the trim in the last step of the whole process b/c the guard will shrink after being heated.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wonderful service. Incredibly comfortable mouth guard that stays in all night unlike others I have had. The company truly cares about its customers satisfaction and I am an extremely satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of molding the appliance in my mouth.  I grind my teeth nightly and this prevents me from harming my teeth.  I also think that the price is very affordable for the quality and quantity  you receive.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! With other products I have tried I have had a hard time fitting the mouth piece in my mouth but the ProDental mouth guard fit perfectly after molding. It was very easy to trim and mold.</li>
            <li> What a relief for my nighttime clenching!!  Very prompt service and very easy to use!!  No more morning head/jaw aches!!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.  My mouth did not feel pain when I removed the device.  The teeth whitening effect is an added plus of this device.  I will continue to use it and thank the inventor for this innovative device.</li>
            <li> A high quality product at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I love the ProDental 3-in-1 mouthguard.  I used to grind my teeth just terribly at night and would wake up with a sore jaw and achy teeth particularly on one side in the morning. I have tried the cheap mouth guards from the pharmacy, and they never stayed on my teeth and didn&#x27;t help at all.  The ProDental 3-in-1 mouthguard came with very easy instructions for fitting it to my mouth.  In less than 10 minutes I had a great fitting mouth guard that stayed on my upper teeth.  It stays on and doesn&#x27;t slip, and I no longer wake up in the morning with achy teeth and a sore jaw from grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the best night-guards I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m a serious grinder, and my teeth are worn WAY down -- so fit, and gum irritation, are big problems with most night-guards.  You&#x27;ll need to read through the instructions a couple times (and get everything ready) before custom-fitting this thing, but the procedure works exactly as described, and the guard fits very securely and comfortably.  No irritation, no braces-like aches or shifting of teeth, no trouble breathing, and I don&#x27;t have to take it out every time I want a drink of water.  I&#x27;ve started wearing it during the day, if there&#x27;s a long stretch where I don&#x27;t have to deal with people.&lt;br /&gt;The material is nice and springy, but holding up well -- at this rate, each guard (there are 3 per package) should last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructions precisely.  Use just-boiled water and a NON-PLASTIC spoon, and don&#x27;t let the guard sit in the water too long.  The &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; will start to curl towards each other when it&#x27;s ready, but if they get stuck together it&#x27;s ruined.</li>
            <li> It is a little tough to make the mold.  You have to follow direction to the T.  I almost got it except I bit on the end of the guard and folded one lip over which I could correct after reheating the area.  It is a little off center since I did not look in the mirror as I make the mold.  I got all the things ready beside the water pot except the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting guard is softer than the professionally made one which cost me $300.  I think it is easier on my teeth.  I do feel one of lips of the guard touching my gum line in the back of my mouth.  I am reluctant to trim it fearing it might cause problems such as sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered a set for brothers.  Then wife said son has been grinding his teeth.  Got another set and used one for him.  I trimmed it to his size then help him make a mold it to fit his lower jaw.  Then I trimmed the lips of the guard so that it does not touch lower gum line; leaving just enough to hold itself in place during sleep.  Son liked it.  I have two left over as spares.  I had to have one of my tooth capped due to wear so I am using this guard religiously and expect my son to do the same.</li>
            <li> Too small, looks like for 10 year old boy. It came partly off first night. I woke up and bit down on it to test it and it made a crunching sound, one of my teeth was not positioned properly. My front teeth are really veneers (expensive veneers!),. I was worried  I chipped an incisor... But fortunately my teeth were o.k.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was not the same as in picture. The picture seemed to me to show 3 different sizes, lrg, med. and small.. They sent me 3 of the same size... the smallest one. It was too small and did not cover 4 of my back teeth. I was wondering if I should even wear it the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get the box, There is no &#x27;gel&#x27; included. What you get is just the 3 flimsy plastic forms, and those are what you put in boiling water. At first I thought they were &#x27;forming trays, but no, they are the actual things you wear on your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks real cheap, like 5 dollars worth of material. Got them ready to return right away and ordered &#x27;Dentek&#x27; - [[ASIN:B00CF0FNVO Dentek Professional Fit Maximum Protection Dental Guard]] instead. Hopefully the &#x27;Dentek&#x27; will work better.</li>
            <li> First I want to say how impressed I am with the service from this company.  I received a personal call checking on my satisfaction with the product, wow!  I explained that I had some difficulty shaping the first  mouth guard and had to trash it, but with some practice I had a mouth guard that fit and worked well for me.  After our phone conversation, I received  a replacement mouth guard in a few days. Great follow through from ProDental.  I am using the guard for my night time teeth grinding, it is very comfortable and has given me relief from jaw discomfort and headaches related from TMJ .</li>
            <li> I needed a mouth guard because my dentist had told me that I am grinding my teeth too much when I sleep. After reading some reviews and comparing different products on Amazon, I chose this one. Before even arriving of the product, I received an email from the seller(/manufacturer) with instructions on how to make it customized. I followed the instructions very carefully and now I have a product that works very well. This is the first time I use a mouth guard, so I cannot compare with other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The seller&#x27;s followup shows that they really care about my experience with their product. Well done!&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: Product works, supportive customer service, happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I had to try it many times to get the mouth guard to fit just right. I probably lost one just because I had to redo it like 7X. the second time around, it was easier. The thing to make sure is that the mouth guard is in the hot water just enough so that you can mold it. I picked it up right when the walls were curling and it turned hard pretty quickly, so I couldn&#x27;t even mold it correctly. The mouthguard is probably hot when you first put it in your mouth but it shouldn&#x27;t be burning hot. and the thing I did was I pushed the mouthguard hard towards my teeth and gums so that I can get it to mold. Make sure to push it under the mouth and behind the teeth as well. Or else it will be loose and you&#x27;ll have to re-mode it.</li>
            <li> Dentist told me I was grinding my teeth in my sleep and needed a mouth guard. I didn&#x27;t have insurance, so I came to Amazon with a task of finding a mouth guard I could boil for fit and came across this product. I followed the video and only needed to cook two mouth guards to get it right, however it required a ton of trimming with scissors to allow me to wear it without gagging constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have now slept with it in for two nights, so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase even though I&#x27;d rather not have to use this product at all.</li>
            <li> When my mouth guards arrived I washed one and put it in my mouth covering my upper teeth. My husband assessed the fit and trimmed it to fit my mouth. We heated a pan of water to a pre boil on the stove then submerged the guard for a few minutes. I let it cool off before putting back in my mouth and molded it to my upper teeth by pressing it against my teeth. The first night was awkward, however by night two it didn&#x27;t bother me  and it fits as if I had a professional fit . My jaw ache is gone since I no longer grind my teeth while wearing the guard.</li>
            <li> Simple to mold (I microwaved some water and just soaked it for about ten seconds), and more comfortable than the other sleep guard I have used. And you can&#x27;t beat ten bucks a piece!</li>
            <li> easy to mold.  the 3 sizes to choose from was nice, because i have a small mouth.  I grind my teeth at night, and just after a week of using, my clinch muscles have relaxed and I&#x27;m not noticing myself clinching.  Cheaper solution than getting a guard made by the dentist for at least my mild case.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> Exceptional product and I would highly recommend!!  This has multiple benefits!  It not only helps you from grinding your teeth at night but it also works perfectly as a teeth-whitening tray!!  If you are looking for one product for multiple uses; this is the best product to purchase!</li>
            <li> Easy to mold after watching the video (I was sent an email link directly from the seller after my purchase). I grind my teeth horribly at night and haven&#x27;t had any tooth pain, jaw ache, or middle of the night wakeups associated with tooth grinding since I started wearing this guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 18 months later, I am still loving these night guards. I have noticed such a difference in my quality of sleep since using these guards specifically (I&#x27;d tried other types on the past)--no more early morning tooth pain, no more waking up to the shooting pain sensation and feeling of grinding. My dentist has even commented on how much better my grinding (or lack thereof) has gotten.</li>
            <li> Very impressed! Great value and a superior product! I had no issues fitting it to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Wife is a grinder (and the noise would wake me up).  Got these and they work perfectly.  No more grinding and more sleep for me.  Win Win!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised​. I use it for a night guard and in the car when traffic stresses me. Easy to use and fit.</li>
            <li> Pro Dental three in one mouth guard came in a plastic bag about the size of a paperback book. I was amazed when I opened the bag and retrieved three pro dental mouth guards. Small clear plastic that I soaked in warm water and put in my mouth. I was surprised by how it formed to my teeth, making it a perfect fit. It not only whitens your teeth, but keeps you from grinding them as well. I would recommend the 3 in1 Pro dental mouth guard to anyone who is concerned with keeping your teeth nice. I am told i sometimes grind my teeth when i sleep so i was thrilled when i got the chance to purchase this item. I received this item at a discount in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have purchased four night guards from my dentist over the years and this one is more comfortable than those.</li>
            <li> Quality mouth guards with easy to follow written instructions and videos for easy custom fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had experience over the years with mouth guards, with son in wrestling and football these were required.  Also after the kids had braces taken off even more mouth guards.  I received these to review as a promotion and am glad to say they are quality guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They each come packaged in their own sealed bag.  The set of instructions is very clear of how to customize and shape.  They even offer a link to watch a video, which is great for first time users.  I had no problem with any of the instructions and now have a nice new tray for my teeth whitening gel.  Will keep the other two new trays around in case other family members need them.</li>
            <li> Great help! Really appreciated all the follow up. Just what I ordered, prompt, and no problems. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received this ProDental mouth guard for a product review and I think they are great. In this pack came three guards which was perfect to meet the needs of my family. My mother in law has been staying with us and she grinds her teeth when she sleeps. We used the first of these guards on her to test for quality and functionality. It was very easy to personalize the guard to the fit of her mouth. She was able to sleep in it with no problems at all. (please note that the package is labeled with a warning against allowing children under the age of 18 to sleep with the guard in their mouth) The second guard was used by my husband to create a tray to use to whiten his upper teeth. He found the guard to be very easy to mold to his mouth size and quite comfortable to use while brightening his smile. My oldest daughter claimed the third guard. I do not think that she had to have it, but she really wanted it. She has a punching bag and wanted to use a guard for her teeth while she is doing her cardio work out on the bag. She too was easily able to mold the guard to fit her mouth and finds it to be unobtrusive while she works out. The guard is made out of FDA approved material that is BPA free. All three of the users said that there was absolutely no taste associated with the guards during the molding process or when they use it. The material that is used also is hygienic, so there will not be any foul smell from using it. This product was made in the USA, which I love. Not only was it made in the USA, it has another feature that I love: RISK FREE. This product comes with a free replacement of &amp;#34;better than money back&amp;#34; guarantee within the first 30 days. If you are in need of a mouth guard this should be the one you try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mouth guards for my night grinding teeth before, but they don&#x27;t even come close to these. They fit perfectly after I followed the instructions and even made a slight mistake (I didn&#x27;t align the guard to the middle of my teeth, so it was a tiny bit shifted to the left of the center.). However, the mouth guard enveloped my teeth comfortably and securely. So far, I&#x27;ve been sleeping with it for a few days now and it neither fell out nor loosened off my teeth. In fact, I have to grasp the guard and pull it out with a bit of force, but nothing that would cause discomfort though. I still have the other two spares for the next two years for replacements  too! I love these mouth guards, they are truly worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are awesome mouth guards. Very easy to use/form. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have two teenage daughters that play both school and travel lacrosse. One of the requirements is a mouth guard. I have invested tens of thousands in their mouths. I want their teeth protected at all cost. They both tried these mouth guards and they love them! They stay exactly where they are supposed and do not move around in their mouth. They were very easy to mold and they fit perfectly. My first impression of them is that they were very sturdy. They are thick enough to protect by still flexible enough to allow enough movement for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;We go through a lot of mouth guards. I was so excited when I was offered to test these for my honest opinion. There are three to the pack so we even have an extra now. I trust these guards to protect my children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Very comfortable. Also very easy to mold and fit. The makers are very helpful and pleasant to deal with. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for all the directions. After reading and watching the video I was able to fit it well.&lt;br /&gt;You guys have probably the best customer support in any company I have seen in years.&lt;br /&gt;Mouth guard fits well and appears to be better than the dentek mouthguard I used prior to that.</li>
            <li> I  have received my mouth guards. I accidentally threw out the one the dentist made for me and so I needed a more economical option. I had no problems in customizing it to fit my mouth and it was fairly easy. I feel like it fits well. I am just concerned because my dentist said if he didn&#x27;t make the actual impression another mouth guard could shift my teeth. I need it for night time grinding.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product so far and I will definitely buy again as long as my teeth don&#x27;t shift.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to customize just follow the instructions provided. Literally took me no more than 5 minutes. I didn&#x27;t have to trim it or anything</li>
            <li> It is working so well. It&#x27;s comfortable and I fall asleep with ease knowing I&#x27;m not destroying my teeth while I&#x27;m in dreamland!</li>
            <li> Great product that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. No more grinding teeth for me.!  Absolutely love this! Better than any I have purchased before. Thx.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and clear instructions.</li>
            <li> I use this for teeth whitening, and it has been working wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Relief from night grinding without paying $350 at my dentist!!! Molding my teeth was very easy and fit is nice and snug (very thorough video and written instructions on how to do this). Very pleased with purchase and seller of this item.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it worked great first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick I can hardly close my lips over it.  Maybe it&#x27;s useful in sports, but for grinding your teeth it makes you sleep with your mouth open due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> What a great product and excellent customer service!  I purchased this mouth guard for my daughter who was grinding her teeth.  Before it even arrived, I received an email from ProDental with instructions, tips and a video to help her get the perfect fit.  More than that, they even offered free custom fitting if she couldn&#x27;t get it just right.  The video offered clear, concise instructions which really helped.  We had a question about the fit, so I emailed Pro Dental, and they replied immediately with the answers I needed, and again offered custom fitting for free if she needed it.  I am blown away by this company.  Especially since the price is so reasonable for three mouth guards!  Highly recommend!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> This is the MOST comfortable mouth guard.  I wake up occasionally and have to double check that it didn&#x27;t fall out, because I can&#x27;t feel it.  No issues molding the guard - just followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> Easy to get proper fit unlike several others I&#x27;ve tried and comfortable to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Great mouth guard! I&#x27;ve tried many different varieties for my bruxism and this is the best guard on the market!</li>
            <li> Thumbs up for this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sensitive tooth for close to 20 years and started using a guard about 5 years.  My old standby is past the point of no return. I&#x27;ve tried many replacements. Unsuccessfully. I gave this one a shot. the instructions for much more detailed in the product itself is much better than the over the counter that I&#x27;ve tried so far. Dr closson was kind enough to work with me to make sure this fits and I finally have a replacement that works. Yay!</li>
            <li> I got these for my son to wear as mouth guards for football.  I have tried lots of other mouth guards.  He usually chews right through them in a single practice.  I have tried the cheap ones and the really expensive one&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t found one yet that he will not or can not chew through.  These shape to his mouth perfectly and are comfortable for him to wear.  He gets lots more use out of them than the one&#x27;s I have been buying for him.  I was offered these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.  I have already told my friends about them and recommended them.  I am sure I will be buying more when football seasons starts back full force!</li>
            <li> This 3 pack mouth guard is just great! I ordered through a great deal to share my honest opinion, since I grind my teeth at night . I could not afford a $250 one that my dentist offered me so I decided to try this one. It does come with clear instructions and it is easy to use, just put it in warm water and let it mold to your mouth. I woke up the past week with less pain in my jaw and less clicking. I understand you can  use with combined with a gel  to bleach your teeth with it as well as to protect for sports. Great value for a great [product</li>
            <li> Perfect for the teeth grinder. It forms exactly to your teeth and is comfortable to wear while sleeping once you get used to wearing it.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. She mentioned it hurt and did not mold tightly to her teeth.</li>
            <li> The five-star reviews for this product are justified. The trick is not to leave the guard in the hot water after the slightest curling. If you wait too long--even seconds--it tends to quickly melt, resulting in the two edges sticking together. On my third try with the first guard, I got a perfect mold for the upper teeth. It is very comfortable, and it does prevent night-time teeth clenching.</li>
            <li> I am using this product as a night bite guard, because I lost my $300 dentist made one. This will do for after the holidays when I want to spend that kind of money on a other dentist made one or as something I travel with. Be sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t be afraid to cut the mouth guard down to make it fit better if necessary. This would be a great athletic dental protector as is, for that, I probably wouldn&#x27;t cut it down, but it is kind of bulky to sleep with if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good mouth guard for a while now..and i am so happy i found these!! My daughter and i both have TMJ and was told top get a Mouth Guard to sleep with and this was the one for us!! We have tried others before but the product failed to reach our needs. So when a friend told me about this brand I was excited to try them.. I had a great night sleep for the first time in a long while because i didn&#x27;t wake up with a frozen jaw!! I grind my teeth badly and this product works i mean it works !!! Mouth guards are used for many purposes such as teeth grinding,snoring,sports like hokey and TMJ so if you have any of those reasons and you have been looking for a mouth Guard this one is it!! Trust me its amazing or i would not come on here telling you all how well it works!!! I am going to order more to have on hand for when we need another...I could not sleep if i didn&#x27;t have them!! Thank you for a great product !!</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tried to get the guard molded right, but once I finished that it works pretty well.  Previously, I had a custom made one from the dentist which was thinner and more comfortable.  This mouthpiece, on the other hand, was much cheaper and still feels fairly similar. Only problem I have with it is that it seems really thick and when you cut it down to size the edges can sometimes rub against your mouth or gums which is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions, must follow! Super comfy and great quality for the price!!!</li>
            <li> This has helped my husband with his snoring at night. Meaning I can finials sleep again.</li>
            <li> This would probably be fine as a mouth guard for sports activities, but, for my mouth, it was much too thick and bulky for sleeping comfort.  I have been using my upper tooth-whitening tray to prevent night grinding, but because it is costly to replace, I thought the ProDental might be a less-costly alternative.  The ProDental is easily four to five times as thick as my thin, tooth-whitening tray.  I could not wear it for sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was fine, and I received it in a timely period.  Had I seen it before buying, I believe I would have realized the bulk was too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...I have changed my rating to five stars....The company wanted me to be satisfied.  They have credited my account in full.  I will return the unused, unopened guards.  GREAT job!</li>
            <li> I got a perfect fit on my first try!  So, I have 2 additional guards to use in the future!!!  One thing I wondered about before I received was whether the 3 guards in the package were all the same size, and the answer is yes.  So, you really do get 3 for the price of 1.  Shortly after I ordered, I received an email from the manufacturer offering to help out if I had any problems or questions.  This showed excellent customer service, even though the I didn&#x27;t end up needing the help.  I read through the fitting instructions carefully, got everything I needed handy, and within a few minutes, I had a perfectly-fitting mouth guard.  My dentist recommended getting a &amp;#34;night guard&amp;#34; at my last check-up because my teeth showed signs that I either clench or grind my teeth.  I was unaware of doing either until I really paid attention.  I think I do clench and/or grind as I sometimes catch myself clenching or wake up with a headache and &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; feeling jaws.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not this much impressed. I like this from my dentist more.  It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> As comfortable as they get -- for nighttime teeth grinding, this one fits much more nicely and less obtrusively than the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard, getting the job done without feeling like someone&#x27;s shoved a brick in your mouth. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously good service on this. My dentist quoted me $500 for a custom mouth guard. This was very, very easy to set up. I&#x27;m glad I watched the video and read the instructions, but it was super easy to follow. My only wish is that I had flattened it against the front of my teeth more, as it feels a little bulgy in front--but not too bad. It&#x27;s helping me sleep better already!</li>
            <li> I have been using night guards for years and I believe getting this new mouth guard from ProDental was the hardest one to shape to my teeth.  I have tried to reheat and reshape the guard several times without success, but I am still using it, just along as I keep my mouth closed during the night the guard stays in my mouth properly, but loose.</li>
            <li> I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a grinder. Last night after following the fitting instructions I put this in. At first I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to sleep with this in my mouth, but no problem. Woke up in the morning with no face ache. Yeay! It does what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dentist quoted me 1200 for a guard. Another wanted to inject 60 units of botox in my jaws and put me on muscle relaxants. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if this company can come out with a DIY veneer kit...</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used the other 2 disposable ones for a few months but my grinding was getting worse. I noticed my jaw would be out of alignment on bad nights. Lower jaw would be further out. First night I used this was perfect. No headaches. No pain in my teeth. Fantastic. I have tried other similar products which were cheaper, but this one is the only one that worked. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Ordered the mouth guard for my wife, who grinds her teeth at night. It came promptly and well packaged. Extremely easy to boil and mold. My wife even boiled the water and did all the prep-work herself, which is normally something that would be well below her status (she has a husband for such things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, she is only 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; on a low gravity day (fun-sized, like those little Snickers bars) so the mouth guard was too big even after I found scissors and trimmed it for her. When I watched the instructions, they mentioned you could send the mouth guard in for thinning. It went something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: Hello, blahblah, mouth guard too big, blahblah, sent it in? blahblah, thanks, Me.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Dental people: responded same day with a custom written (not just copy/paste form letter) email addressing my situation and giving me very specific instructions on what they will do and how they will do it, all for free.&lt;br /&gt;Me: sent it in the next day.&lt;br /&gt;---later that same day: wife starts asking me when it will be returned.&lt;br /&gt;ProDental people: sent me an email the day it arrived at their office, saying they got it and were going to start the thinning process. How convenient! I now have some information to relay to the wife.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later: received the mouth guard. Wife&#x27;s response &amp;#34;wow!!&amp;#34; They were not kidding about the thinning, it was wafer thin and fit perfectly. Also included was the (at this time expected) nice letter of explanation and instruction from ProDental people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife now uses the mouth guard every night right before falling asleep. She says she literally sleeps better, an that the difference was very noticeable in the morning. Completely cured her continuous jaw ache after only two nights. Although the first night she dreamed she was chewing a peanut butter sandwich all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ProDental, for making an awesome product, for having awesome customer service, for fixing the issue for free,for giving me updates during the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear enough that i got the fit right on the first try.  but i do have a very small mouth, so the guard is bulky.  i may try to trim the outside edges down a little bit with a hot razor blade then soften the guard again and smooth the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m a night-clencher.  i don&#x27;t grind, i just clench my teeth all night.  to the point that i have dreams i&#x27;m breaking my teeth.  i have been using this mouth guard only two weeks but the constant pain i had in my jaw above a tooth with a root canal is 95% gone. i gave the other two to my parents to try out (a grinder and a snorer) and i&#x27;m buying another set of 3 before this company realizes what a fantastic deal this is and jacks up the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaints are that it is bulky, and i seem to drool a lot more with this mouth guard than the much smaller one i used when whitening my teeth a few years back.  it might be the design, or it could be that it&#x27;s channeling the saliva to the front of my mouth instead, but it&#x27;s super sexy LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a side note: i also bought a case and some retainer cleaner tabs at the same time.  i accidentally left the mouth guard in the solution all day instead of taking it out after 15 minutes like they suggested, and it was totally fine.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are awesome!! They are comfortable and are very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;I grind my teeth at night which has cause tooth damage in the past. Every mouth guard I have tried has been very uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep with it in. This mouth guard is different! I can sleep like a baby with it in and it is always in the same position when I wake up! It has not moved, shifted or fallen out!! I can also use it as a protector while playing sports or as a tooth whitening tray! Which is awesome because my last few teeth whitening trays have worn out and broken. I am very pleased with these mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;As it says in the description, you can trim it to fit your mouth, personally I did not have to trim mine. It fit my mouth perfectly! You can mold this mouth guard to fit your teeth perfectly very easily! You simply boil water, take the pot off the heat source, put the guard in, watch it until it starts to fold (about 19 seconds for me) take it out with a spoon, let it sit on a paper towel for a few seconds until it cools off, then put it in your mouth! Once in your mouth you close your lips and suck all the air in to make the guard conform to the front of your teeth, while doing this you must also push on the inside with your tongue and push with your fingers on your cheeks. And don&#x27;t bite down. I was so scared I would somehow mess this up, but I didn&#x27;t! It was surprisingly easy!&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very satisfied with this product! I recommend it to anyone needing a mouth guard for any reason!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. My opinion is all my own and is 100% honest and unbiased!</li>
            <li> The instructions were hard to follow. I had to reread them several times to know what to do. Once I tried it, the result turned out great. I&#x27;d give it a 5 star but I wish the instructions had pictures as I&#x27;m a visual learner and that would of saved me time and understood what to do. I love the fact that&#x27;s there&#x27;s 3 in this pack. This guard can be used for a variety of things. Great item!</li>
            <li> This is not meant for a normal sized mouth.  It was huge and uncomfortable and no way you can sleep with it.  I am trying to get a refund and the seller will not respond.</li>
            <li> Very good product and customer support! Please read the directions and watch the video-it makes everything easier.Trim the product BEFORE molding is beneficial. I had questions and comments since I&#x27;m a grinder - been so since an early age. Customer Support was great - they sent me an email and I had a reply in less than 18 hours. Questions answered plus recommendations/suggestions made too. Recommend?Absolutely</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  The directions are easy to follow (there is a website where you can watch a complete video on what to do). Furthermore, they back up their product and replace it should you mess up. Also if for some other reason it just doesn&#x27;t fit right they will fix it for you when you send it in.  This guard has given me quite a lot of relief and i have only been using it for one week.  Great product, great price, great company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been super happy with this product. It&#x27;s VERY reasonably priced (compared to the $600 my dentist quoted me) yet it does exactly what I need it to. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying these if and when I need new ones -- though I&#x27;ve used the same guard for 3 months now and haven&#x27;t seen any sign of it needing replacement yet!</li>
