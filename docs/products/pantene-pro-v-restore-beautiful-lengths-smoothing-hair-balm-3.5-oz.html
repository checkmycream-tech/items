            <li>I have used this for about three years and it is the best for leaving my hair shiny &amp; easy to manage.</li>
            <li>My Internet search led me to Amazon and a really good price for three bottles.  </li>
            <li>my hair is wavy and is medium length wise.</li>

            <li>Wonderful stuff right here.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>The Restore Beautiful Lengths Smoothing Hair Balm is OK, and I would buy it again because it seems that the frizz control serum is no longer available anywhere.  </li>
            <li>God bless all :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Walmart and they don&#x27;t carry it any more.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see that Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>The Pantene frizz control is the most affordable leave in conditioner I have found to help keep it under control.  </li>
            <li>all in all its an okay product</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner but they seemed to have changed those.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>This product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The Hair Balm is a thicker cream, and seems to add more body to my medium-fine hair than the now-unavailable serum.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, and I don&#x27;t have to touch it with any heating object to get a nice flat-ironed look.</li>
            <li>hair feels much smooth now</li>
            <li>this is the best product I have used for VERY CURLY hair... can&#x27;t say enough...</li>
            <li>great product, but 4 stars because container becomes top-heavy and knocks over easily after more than half is dispensed.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more to having curly hair than straightening it all the time us curlies have to love our natural beauty too.</li>
            <li>The Lord is coming soon clean your house</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF (yes, so much that it requires all caps).</li>
            <li>It gives me nice curl all day long and my hair is more on the wavy side than curly.</li>
            <li>I guess body is not a bad thing, but I was not trying to get it.  </li>
            <li>When purchased as a set of three, the hair balm&#x27;s price per container is not bad.</li>
            <li>On the first day that I used this hair mask, it already made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my naturally curly hair, including salon stuff.</li>
            <li>Now that I know how much to use, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always known to get a hair cut when it gets tangled incredibly easily and there is no way of keeping it looking decent for an hour after it has been washed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have bangs that have a mind of their own, this is the only product that allows me to keep them straightened out and under control.</li>
            <li>It helps tame the fly aways.</li>
            <li>I have semi-fine hair that I am growing out right now (have not cut it for a while now...</li>
            <li>easy to use, not stiff on hair, pantene is awsome!  </li>
            <li>this balm is great for long hair,it works well on my long hair my hair shines so smooth after blowing it out,..</li>
            <li>I am so glad Pantene did not take it off the market, but simply changed the name and packaging.  </li>
            <li>I believe that if they would market this product differently and focus on curl, frizz, and expansion control, they would have a lot more people to buy it.  </li>
            <li>When I want to do a really smooth stlye it really helps keep he frizz out of my naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>This product will smooth my hair and keep it from getting big, even on very humid days.</li>
            <li>It does absolute wonders.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really even tell it is there...</li>
            <li>For those saying not to add too much, the bottle says to \\&quot;apply liberally\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Thanks Pantene.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair sleek and straight without frizzing even in the summer.</li>
            <li>because it is just the right product to give my fine hair the body it needs without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>(my hair is pretty damaged) but it can leave your hair too sticky or feel weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>It even works better than most expensive products.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and bouncy, smells great, and my style lasts a little longer than the other smoothing cream I was using.</li>
            <li>I end up with smooth and shiny frizz-free loose waves.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>it really makes it smooth and less frizzy</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and it is not thick or gooey, All that is needed is a little in the palm of ones hands and rubbed into the hair prior to drying.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, and all of a sudden, it was no longer available in any stores.  </li>
            <li>creamy white balm, only need a little, works really good</li>
            <li>I use this on dry hair to calm my little frizzy ends and it leaves my blond hair looking shiny and smooth plus moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was unable to find it in my local store but was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>not greasy like the old kinds of dressings were.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>(at least I didn&#x27;t want to try:)</li>
            <li>I love this product but can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, but lately have not been able to find it anywhere in stores.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Took me a couple tries to figure out the right amount to use.</li>
            <li>thick, wavy hair and one squirt makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>A major plus is that it controls frizz without killing body and wave, definitely not a straightener.</li>
            <li>Well worth it for the price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If I let it dry naturally</li>
            <li>Because of the product thickness and the &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; it gives to the the hair, I can&#x27;t see someone who has thin or fine hair finding it beneficial.  </li>
            <li>But then I don&#x27;t know anything about thin or fine hair.  </li>

            <li> But then I don&#x27;t know anything about thin or fine hair.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I have very dry, very thick, very curly, just below the shoulder length hair, and my hair tends to get big.  </li>
            <li> The product is hard to find and when I do find it, I try to buy as much as I can.  </li>
            <li> It also blends in well, so you aren&#x27;t left with sticky or wet feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I use it after blow drying my long hair to keep those darn grey curls from popping up.  </li>
            <li> I do have long hair and have to use a lot (3 pumps).</li>
            <li> I have long wavy/curly hair that is fine-textured, but lots of it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel stiff rather than soft.</li>
            <li> I put three squirts in (like I said, LONG hair) and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Granted it does take a bit longer to dry with the product in, my hair looks healthier and shinier than ever.</li>
            <li> I think it helps dry hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I knew I could not live without it</li>
            <li> This balm is one of the few products I have found that actually works and I am one of those people that has tried almost every anti-frizz product out there.  </li>
            <li> It has been harder and harder to find at Walmart and Target, so when I saw it here, I bought a bunch.</li>
            <li> It controls frizz, adds shape and a healthy-looking sheen, all with absolutely no greasiness, stickiness, or added weight.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dry and brittle and then weighed down and oily.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have an oil problem as some other people who bought the product</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, curly, and tends to expand when outside, I say try it.  </li>
            <li> it lets my hair wave but keeps down frizz.</li>
            <li> it smooths down fried ends</li>
            <li> Even though this product is thick, I still have to use several pumps and usually go through a bottle every two weeks.</li>
            <li> It was a weighed down, waxy feeling residue-y mess!  </li>
            <li> And my hair has grown a little.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with the mousse i use to scrunch my hair.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t use this for growing out length, I can&#x27;t do without it, and not at all happey that it&#x27;s not easily available.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curly locks in place without being too stiff.</li>
            <li> How on earth do they say you can &#x27;style as usual&#x27; after this?  </li>
            <li> I can use this one product, and it works as a smoother and gel, at least in my hair.</li>
            <li> so it needs help, but it looked so flat and dirty that I could not wait to wash it out.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 times I hated it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick frizzy hair that&#x27;s about shoulder length and</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair that is difficult to have any control over even in when it isn&#x27;t humid out.  </li>

            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair that is difficult to have any control over even in when it isn&#x27;t humid out.  This product used to be called something like Frizz control smoothing balm and was packaged differently.  I am so glad Pantene did not take it off the market, but simply changed the name and packaging.  This balm is one of the few products I have found that actually works and I am one of those people that has tried almost every anti-frizz product out there.  It even works better than most expensive products.  It also blends in well, so you aren&#x27;t left with sticky or wet feeling hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working great on my hair. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going great it really makes it smooth and less frizzy I use it everyday with the mousse i use to scrunch my hair. There&#x27;s more to having curly hair than straightening it all the time us curlies have to love our natural beauty too. The Lord is coming soon clean your house the king is coming soon :D  God bless all :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have semi-fine hair that I am growing out right now (have not cut it for a while now... I know that is so not-cool in the hair realm,) and this gives my hair a freshly-cut look. I&#x27;ve always known to get a hair cut when it gets tangled incredibly easily and there is no way of keeping it looking decent for an hour after it has been washed. It does absolute wonders. I put three squirts in (like I said, LONG hair) and then let it air dry. Granted it does take a bit longer to dry with the product in, my hair looks healthier and shinier than ever. I don&#x27;t have to do anything to it. I can run my fingers through it and it feels as if I don&#x27;t have any product in my hair. HIGHLY recommended. I have naturally straight hair, and I don&#x27;t have to touch it with any heating object to get a nice flat-ironed look. Wonderful stuff right here.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it&#x27;s no miracle grow. It does give your hair a nice shine though! And my hair has grown a little.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps control my frizz and leaves a wonderful smell.  I also feel as if it does make you hair stronger - easier to grow out!! BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Takes care of the frizzies without adding weight...you can&#x27;t really even tell it is there...not greasy like the old kinds of dressings were.  Great customer service, as always.</li>
            <li> For those saying not to add too much, the bottle says to \\&quot;apply liberally\\&quot; so I did and yuck.  It was a weighed down, waxy feeling residue-y mess!  I have mid back length hair with fried ends so it needs help, but it looked so flat and dirty that I could not wait to wash it out.  How on earth do they say you can &#x27;style as usual&#x27; after this?  No way....</li>
            <li> I love this product, smells great but not overpowering.  I use it after blow drying my long hair to keep those darn grey curls from popping up.  It makes my hair really soft and silky.  I used to buy it at Walmart and they don&#x27;t carry it any more.  I was glad to see that Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  When I want to do a really smooth stlye it really helps keep he frizz out of my naturally wavy hair.  If I let it dry naturally it lets my hair wave but keeps down frizz.</li>
            <li> Took me a couple tries to figure out the right amount to use. The first 2 times I hated it. Made my hair feel dry and brittle and then weighed down and oily. I have very thick frizzy hair that&#x27;s about shoulder length and 3 pumps is the perfect amount. Now that I know how much to use, it&#x27;s fantastic. My hair is shiny and bouncy, smells great, and my style lasts a little longer than the other smoothing cream I was using.</li>
            <li> this balm is great for long hair,it works well on my long hair my hair shines so smooth after blowing it out,..I do recomment it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and all of a sudden, it was no longer available in any stores.  I knew I could not live without it (at least I didn&#x27;t want to try:) because it is just the right product to give my fine hair the body it needs without weighing it down.  My Internet search led me to Amazon and a really good price for three bottles.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> My hair has a lot of body and the slightest humidity causes it to grow.  The Pantene frizz control is the most affordable leave in conditioner I have found to help keep it under control.  Thanks Pantene.</li>
            <li> great product, but 4 stars because container becomes top-heavy and knocks over easily after more than half is dispensed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I just wash my hair, comb it out and put the product on. I do have long hair and have to use a lot (3 pumps). It gives me nice curl all day long and my hair is more on the wavy side than curly.</li>
            <li> my hair is wavy and is medium length wise. i like this product and its a great buy. it smooths down fried ends (my hair is pretty damaged) but it can leave your hair too sticky or feel weighed down easily. you need to brush your hair after using this product or else it will leave parts of your hair clumped together. all in all its an okay product but it isnt great.</li>
            <li> This does not feel like a leave in conditioner. It made my hair feel stiff rather than soft.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t use this for growing out length, I can&#x27;t do without it, and not at all happey that it&#x27;s not easily available. It&#x27;s hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my naturally curly hair, including salon stuff. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> this is the best product I have used for VERY CURLY hair... can&#x27;t say enough... I Love it</li>
            <li> On the first day that I used this hair mask, it already made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels much smooth now and I didn&#x27;t have an oil problem as some other people who bought the product did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think it helps dry hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. I was unable to find it in my local store but was happy to find it on Amazon. It keeps my hair sleek and straight without frizzing even in the summer. I hope it never goes away!</li>
            <li> I love this product but can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately so I recently started getting it here and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the shampoo and conditioner but they seemed to have changed those.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it does improve hair length and does protect ends. Makes my hair feel healthier...I have colored treated.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Seems to help strengthen my hair and keep it from frizzing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF (yes, so much that it requires all caps). I have long wavy/curly hair that is fine-textured, but lots of it. I can use this one product, and it works as a smoother and gel, at least in my hair. I end up with smooth and shiny frizz-free loose waves. Love it, but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Great hair product.  It keeps my curly locks in place without being too stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, but lately have not been able to find it anywhere in stores.&lt;br /&gt;On a whim I checked Amazon, and found it in a 3 pack at a really great price! This product works great on my hair. It helps tame the fly aways. This product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It has been harder and harder to find at Walmart and Target, so when I saw it here, I bought a bunch. I have bangs that have a mind of their own, this is the only product that allows me to keep them straightened out and under control.</li>
            <li> I use this on dry hair to calm my little frizzy ends and it leaves my blond hair looking shiny and smooth plus moisturized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes this work, but it does. I have thick, wavy hair and one squirt makes a huge difference.  I&#x27;ve always refrained from using hair products because I hate the sticky or heavy feel of them, but this stuff is great!  It controls frizz, adds shape and a healthy-looking sheen, all with absolutely no greasiness, stickiness, or added weight.  Well worth it for the price, a little goes a long way. A major plus is that it controls frizz without killing body and wave, definitely not a straightener.</li>
            <li> This does not seem to be just a repackaging of the Pantene Restoratives Frizz Control Extra Strength Serum, as others have thought it to be.  The Hair Balm is a thicker cream, and seems to add more body to my medium-fine hair than the now-unavailable serum.  I guess body is not a bad thing, but I was not trying to get it.  The Restore Beautiful Lengths Smoothing Hair Balm is OK, and I would buy it again because it seems that the frizz control serum is no longer available anywhere.  When purchased as a set of three, the hair balm&#x27;s price per container is not bad.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. It has a nice smell and it is not thick or gooey, All that is needed is a little in the palm of ones hands and rubbed into the hair prior to drying. IT is GREAT!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> easy to use, not stiff on hair, pantene is awsome!  creamy white balm, only need a little, works really good</li>
            <li> I have used this for about three years and it is the best for leaving my hair shiny &amp; easy to manage. I hope Pantene never stops making it! Our local stores stopped carrying it so I was excited to find it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have very dry, very thick, very curly, just below the shoulder length hair, and my hair tends to get big.  This product will smooth my hair and keep it from getting big, even on very humid days. I can&#x27;t say that it does anything to help the dryness of my hair but it does control the frizz, curl, and bigness factor.  Even though this product is thick, I still have to use several pumps and usually go through a bottle every two weeks. The product is hard to find and when I do find it, I try to buy as much as I can.  It appears that Pantene keeps changing either the product or the packaging and then putting it back out on the shelf. I believe that if they would market this product differently and focus on curl, frizz, and expansion control, they would have a lot more people to buy it.  Because of the product thickness and the &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; it gives to the the hair, I can&#x27;t see someone who has thin or fine hair finding it beneficial.  But then I don&#x27;t know anything about thin or fine hair.  If your hair is thick, curly, and tends to expand when outside, I say try it.  I did not give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t help the dryness of my hair and its pricey.</li>
