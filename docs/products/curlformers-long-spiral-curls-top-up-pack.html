            <li>These are awesome.  </li>
            <li>my understanding is that this works best) or attack them with hairspray after you have the look you want after taking the curlers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve posted a fairly close up  picture of my hair in the user pictures for this product.  </li>

            <li>Curlformers are the best for my two teenage girls!  </li>
            <li>Price ok</li>
            <li>the curl formers help their already curly hair become way more defined and bouncy...</li>
            <li>After awhile the curls loosened up and gave me more of a beachy wavy look.</li>
            <li>Somehow, I always have more hair than they think I do, but still, I have more fine hair than they think.  </li>
            <li>So easy to put on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>

            <li>Its free delivery</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>it was my first time using this type of curler and were it was not the same as the original curlformer, they are easy to use and give great results</li>
            <li>To get your hair to hold a curl best either use your favorite styling product on your wet hair prior to curling (this is what I do and</li>
            <li>And quick delivery.</li>
            <li>They are a pricy investment, but I feel it is well worth it to get the curls that my girls get with them.</li>
            <li>have slept with the curlformers in (not the most comfortable but doable) and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Keep the top edge of the former right beneath the opening.</li>
            <li>I like these very much.</li>
            <li>not only recommend them, but have already purchased more for myself (another size) and as gifts.gifts.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it, it can go pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>These worked really well on curly and straight hair.</li>
            <li>prepared to be stared at haha.</li>
            <li>If you put too much hair into the curlformer, it will not curl up....</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my daughters who already have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Makes it go much faster&lt;</li>
            <li>Flat, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Flat, fine hair that will do nothing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Soooo, when I stumbled upon these while looking for an easy way to curl without having to use a curling iron (I was actually looking up the old fashioned rag curlers and found that someone had mentioned these being so much easier), I figured why not.  </li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t fit the length of my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li>but once I got comfy, I was fine with wearing them in my sleep), or blow dry them.  </li>
            <li>other day I decided to try them on my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>and I had a rough night before an important day in my life.</li>
            <li>I needed a new approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have straight medium length hair that when curled with a curling iron will go back to straight in just a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, simple, and easy (especially for someone with long hair).</li>
            <li>(I got it right the first time, then struggled with a few others, then</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste ur money on this product.</li>
            <li>It did give me the soft spiral i wanted</li>
            <li>They were a little tricky to use at first - don&#x27;t try to pull too much hair through -</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold as long and when you take them off they do leave a roughish look to the hair follicles which is not as smooth as the other method I was using.</li>
            <li>A normal head of hair will definitely take about 24-32 curlformers.</li>
            <li>so generally I just don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my only complaint is that they are not as comfortable as I thought they would be for nighttime curling.</li>
            <li>I also recently used these on my almost dry hair on a long car ride (3.5 hrs) and by the time I got to the event my hair was ready to go!</li>
            <li>I like that they are sold in a big pack and these little ones because my hair is growing so fast that some areas need longer ones!</li>
            <li>about 8 or 9 inches past the shoulder to get the Extra Long and wide curlformers...that is, if you would like a curl from the top of the scalp to the ends.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE THESE CURL FORMERS!!!! I&#x27;ve used them twice since I got them about a week ago and could not ask for better results, my only complaint is that they are not as comfortable as I thought they would be for nighttime curling.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  So easy to put on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Don&#x27;t forget the Hook - it&#x27;s sold separately!!</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! These &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; were VERY SHORT and i personally did not like the material it was made from. Do NOT waste ur money on this product.</li>
            <li> Curlformers are the best for my two teenage girls!  They both have hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl, but with these, they can have curls for days!  They were a little tricky to use at first - don&#x27;t try to pull too much hair through - but once you get used to it, it can go pretty fast.  I have two hooks, so my girls will get one loaded while I am putting one in, which cuts down on the time it takes to do each head of hair.  They are a pricy investment, but I feel it is well worth it to get the curls that my girls get with them.</li>
            <li> Goood. Price ok And quick delivery. Its free delivery</li>
            <li> Get your Beyonce hair on with these formers. These worked really well on curly and straight hair. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The curliformers are difficult to use.  It took me a few tries to get them in my hair but was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these because the tool to do them is not included. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. Also they are tiny. The ones my friend has that are just like these are twice as long. These won&#x27;t fit the length of my daughters long hair. So dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I got this product. it was my first time using this type of curler and were it was not the same as the original curlformer, they are easy to use and give great results</li>
            <li> I love these (had to buy 2 packs to curl all my hair)! I have straight medium length hair that when curled with a curling iron will go back to straight in just a couple of hours. I needed a new approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slept with the curlformers in (not the most comfortable but doable) and the curls last all day. I also recently used these on my almost dry hair on a long car ride (3.5 hrs) and by the time I got to the event my hair was ready to go! Warning if you have to make a pit stop with these in your hair...prepared to be stared at haha.</li>
            <li> I love this method of curling my hair! It&#x27;s fast, simple, and easy (especially for someone with long hair). I suggest those with long hair...about 8 or 9 inches past the shoulder to get the Extra Long and wide curlformers...that is, if you would like a curl from the top of the scalp to the ends. What&#x27;s misleading about this product is that&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t not come with a hook, you&#x27;ll have to buy it separately.&lt;br /&gt;2) There are only 8 curlformers in each package. A normal head of hair will definitely take about 24-32 curlformers. If you put too much hair into the curlformer, it will not curl up....so 3 or 4 packages is necessary; unless, you only want a small portion of your hair curled.</li>
            <li> Doesnt detail that there are only 6. But gotta love curlformers! They have changed my hair life for the better! I like that they are sold in a big pack and these little ones because my hair is growing so fast that some areas need longer ones! Also my edges still need ahort ones so i love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted a fairly close up  picture of my hair in the user pictures for this product.  I have very fine hair.  You know the kind - go to the hairdresser for a cut and they say \\&quot;oh, this will be easy\\&quot;.  Somehow, I always have more hair than they think I do, but still, I have more fine hair than they think.  Flat, fine hair.  Flat, fine hair that will do nothing.  Especially on one side of my head.  I don&#x27;t know why that one side is even grumpier (flatter) than the other, that&#x27;s just the way it is.  It doesn&#x27;t help that I am not into girlie things.  Not that I am against looking girlie, I am just against the time it takes and against the curling irons or hair dryers or tons of make-up items I&#x27;d have to deal with, etc.  so generally I just don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo, when I stumbled upon these while looking for an easy way to curl without having to use a curling iron (I was actually looking up the old fashioned rag curlers and found that someone had mentioned these being so much easier), I figured why not.  I was not disappointed.  Shampoo (or wet) your hair, use the hook (purchased separately if you buy the curlers this way -- they also sell kits that include the a larger number of curlers and includes the hook) to pull your hair through the curler, then either go about your business until your hair dries, sleep in them (I found it tough to fall asleep but once I got comfy, I was fine with wearing them in my sleep), or blow dry them.  To get your hair to hold a curl best either use your favorite styling product on your wet hair prior to curling (this is what I do and my understanding is that this works best) or attack them with hairspray after you have the look you want after taking the curlers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may take a few curls to get it right (I got it right the first time, then struggled with a few others, then fine again - aka practice makes perfect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only recommend them, but have already purchased more for myself (another size) and as gifts.gifts.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughters who already have very curly hair. (They are African American and Dutch. ) the curl formers help their already curly hair become way more defined and bouncy...helps control the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;The other day I decided to try them on my fine, straight hair. The result was amazing! Beautiful bouncy and defined curls. After awhile the curls loosened up and gave me more of a beachy wavy look. But, if I had used products in my hair, the curls would have lasted longer I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to using these.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the things that helped make using the curlformers easier:&lt;br /&gt;1.Purchase two hooks. When using one, have your daughter (or whomever) &amp;#34;load&amp;#34;  another curlformer on the other hook. Makes it go much faster&lt;br /&gt;2. Use small sections. Larger sections of hair are harder to load and pull through and can cause pain&lt;br /&gt;3. When putting the former on the hook, don&#x27;t push it way down the wand. Keep the top edge of the former right beneath the opening. This makes pulling the hair through start easier...less struggle to pull the curler up over the hair to begin pulling it through.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you are tugging at the hair and it causes pain; stop! Pull the curler back and try again and maybe take less hair in that section. The hair should pull through fairly easily...with no pain. Initially you may feel some tugging and a little painful but with practice it gets easier.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you pull the curler all the way up to the root of the hair, it can feel tight and you may feel a pinching.&lt;br /&gt;Just adjust the curlformer by sliding it down a little bit from the roots.&lt;br /&gt;6. Sleeping in these was not comfortable and I had a rough night before an important day in my life. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but it can be done if necessary. I recommend using the during the day and using a blow dryer if you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it. I like these very much. They do a beautiful job and give full, plump and bouncy coils.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my daughters hair</li>
            <li> So I bought these for my wedding. Did a practice on with my hair before hand to check the curls. It did give me the soft spiral i wanted but it doesn&#x27;t hold as long and when you take them off they do leave a roughish look to the hair follicles which is not as smooth as the other method I was using.</li>
