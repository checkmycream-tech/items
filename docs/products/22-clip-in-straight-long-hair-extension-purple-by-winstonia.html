            <li>Greatest thing for my copay</li>
            <li>Very nice color and quality.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing!</li>
            <li>Definatly buy if you want good bright colors for an amazing price!</li>
            <li>They look great in my hair and for the price you can&#x27;t get much better!</li>
            <li>but it seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li>It came in good shape and packing&lt;</li>
            <li>but it still look good.</li>
            <li>Good for a couple of days</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of these to clip into my hair for my wedding.</li>
            <li>Lovely clips!</li>
            <li>They were in great condition when I received them, and were assembled nice and strong.</li>
            <li>I probably lose 30 strands of my own hair</li>
            <li>The hair it self is a nice color.</li>
            <li>its a bit shiny but looks nice.</li>
            <li>over all it has a nice look</li>
            <li>The colro is great, but it tangles in it first use, and I coudl onoly give it like 2 or three uses before having to throw it away.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very secure, doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>which kind of sucks...other than that it&#x27;s pretty good c:</li>
            <li>Reasonably good quality (the weft stitching even matches the extension color!), but the color just doesn&#x27;t live up to the picture.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>My fault - I know better.  </li>
            <li>a day so sure...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing them for more than a day, or sleeping in them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also getting more colors.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but if you brush it it gets many knots in it</li>
            <li>and I was done with it, Its best to get real human hair</li>
            <li>this will be more durable</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s enjoying a lot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this but will not order any more.</li>
            <li>this is a pretty good item except someone the hair falls out</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to use, but I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use light heat to straighten out the kinks from the packaging.  </li>
            <li>They go in and out so easy, who cares?  </li>
            <li>These extensions are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very fun to wear.  </li>
            <li>you want bright, punky colors, you pretty much need to go synthetic.  </li>
            <li>They go in super easy and come out super easy.  </li>
            <li>If it was a whole wig of hair it would be more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>For the price is ok, but the plastic is very sensitive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun though to add a bit of color.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re easy to hide and look pretty real.</li>
            <li>and I love the texture it feels so soft, like real</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more and make different lengths for fun styles.  </li>
            <li>Came much quicker than stated!  </li>
            <li>For $10 I got a whole lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>Some of the strands are already coming out when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>They are really pretty and exactly what is shown.</li>
            <li>and my daughter really loves it very much</li>
            <li>Very vibrant color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not ugly, really, but it&#x27;s not that vivid violet - more of slightly muddy grape.</li>
            <li>If these were human-hair extensions they would have cost ~$20 each - and they wouldn&#x27;t have as much color.  </li>
            <li>When you tug on the extension your whole head goes with it.  </li>
            <li>The color is very close to the color in the picture, and the hair is somewhat silky.</li>
            <li>it came really fast  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have naturally straight hair so for me to use these I have to straighten all of my hair.</li>
            <li>It said real hair, and it is NOT real hair, is pure cheap synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>I would spend the extra money on a better brand of blonde ones &amp; dye them the color you would like.</li>
            <li>Good quality all things concidering, 22 INCHES long, and just as a warning, i&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks, have only worn the purple once or twice</li>
            <li>A little lighter than the picture, but I still enjoy them.</li>
            <li>purchased another clip in the color blue from another seller and that one has a very plastic feel and tangles a lot.</li>
            <li>This is a duplicate review of the one I left on the Red Hot Chili color...</li>
            <li>so I bought 3 of the red (Red Hot Chili) and 3 of the purple.  </li>
            <li>was looking to add a little fun and flair to my style</li>
    </ol>

            <li> One piece got a little damaged because I used a little too much heat.  </li>
            <li> I used two pieces on one side of my head and one in the other, and it blended in well enough</li>
            <li> then i expected</li>
            <li> the hair is long and thins out as it goes down.</li>
            <li> so I might just be crazy but it worth it honesty!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It came before it was due within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Just remember to be very careful brushing your hair or even running your fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> They broke cheap plastic :(</li>
            <li> But a little piece here</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely by the end of the day the clips started to make my scalp a little sore, hence the 4 stars vs. 5.  </li>
            <li> also the clips were a little thicker</li>
            <li> They are $1.50 for crying out</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong color I ordered 2 purple ones and received two blue ones.</li>
            <li> But I was confused</li>
            <li> look fake to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hair does not stay on the clip :(</li>

            <li> Hair does not stay on the clip :( but it seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li> Came much quicker than stated!  Very vibrant color.  Stayed in place well.</li>
            <li> Lovely clips! I use them for my Gogo wig and they work great! A little lighter than the picture, but I still enjoy them.</li>
            <li> I just received in the mail and I love the texture it feels so soft, like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t look fake to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another clip in the color blue from another seller and that one has a very plastic feel and tangles a lot. I will be buying more</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet so I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to use, but I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a duplicate review of the one I left on the Red Hot Chili color...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to add a little fun and flair to my style so I bought 3 of the red (Red Hot Chili) and 3 of the purple.  For $10 I got a whole lot of fun.  They go in super easy and come out super easy.  There are a ton of how-to videos on YouTube if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use light heat to straighten out the kinks from the packaging.  One piece got a little damaged because I used a little too much heat.  My fault - I know better.  They are not human hair.  If these were human-hair extensions they would have cost ~$20 each - and they wouldn&#x27;t have as much color.  You don&#x27;t get the option to curl them, and they won&#x27;t last as long; but if you don&#x27;t wear the same ones every day they should last you a bit.  Yes, a hair or 2 will fall out here and there.  I probably lose 30 strands of my own hair a day so sure...why not?  They are $1.50 for crying out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want bright, punky colors, you pretty much need to go synthetic.  With synthetic you know it&#x27;s going to look like barbie doll hair.  It&#x27;s just the way it is.  I used two pieces on one side of my head and one in the other, and it blended in well enough that my husband and a friend both thought I had dyed my hair.  If it was a whole wig of hair it would be more noticeable.  But a little piece here and there looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely by the end of the day the clips started to make my scalp a little sore, hence the 4 stars vs. 5.  I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing them for more than a day, or sleeping in them &lt;shudder&gt;.  They go in and out so easy, who cares?  Just remember to be very careful brushing your hair or even running your fingers through it.  When you tug on the extension your whole head goes with it.  ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they&#x27;re long...just cut them.  I&#x27;m going to order more and make different lengths for fun styles.  I&#x27;m also getting more colors.  What a truly inexpensive way to change yourlook up, and with no damage to your hair whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine shipped from overseas so expect a bit of lead time on the shipment.  At this price, whatever!</li>
            <li> Reasonably good quality (the weft stitching even matches the extension color!), but the color just doesn&#x27;t live up to the picture. It&#x27;s not ugly, really, but it&#x27;s not that vivid violet - more of slightly muddy grape.</li>
            <li> Very fun to wear.  I place close to temple and it&#x27;s very secure, doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> It came in good shape and packing&lt;br /&gt;It came before it was due within 2 weeks it arrived. But I was confused I thought I was purple it came out as an blueish purple but it still look good. People said that it WA purple so I might just be crazy but it worth it honesty!</li>
            <li> Love it but if you brush it it gets many knots in it</li>
            <li> They broke cheap plastic :(</li>
            <li> The hair it self is a nice color. its a bit shiny but looks nice. Im using this in my eridan wig for his cosplay the hair is long and thins out as it goes down. Almost like a tiangle shape. over all it has a nice look</li>
            <li> Good quality all things concidering, 22 INCHES long, and just as a warning, i&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks, have only worn the purple once or twice but the ends seem to be frizing a bit, curling up. also the clips were a little thicker then i expected but if you know how (unlike me) they&#x27;re easy to hide and look pretty real.</li>
            <li> they are great! Very happy! thank you!</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong color I ordered 2 purple ones and received two blue ones. It even said purple on the shipping info. Also the clip attached to it was an alligator clip not the one the pictured and it doesn&#x27;t hold onto the hair at all.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing! They look great in my hair and for the price you can&#x27;t get much better! Definatly buy if you want good bright colors for an amazing price! Plus you can curl and strighten them so whatever you do with your hair, you can do it with these too!</li>
            <li> These extensions are cheaply made. I would spend the extra money on a better brand of blonde ones &amp; dye them the color you would like.</li>
            <li> Very nice color and quality. The color is very close to the color in the picture, and the hair is somewhat silky.</li>
            <li> Greatest thing for my copay but order it about a month before it takes a while to get here</li>
            <li> Good for a couple of days It tangled and I was done with it, Its best to get real human hair this will be more durable</li>
            <li> For the price is ok, but the plastic is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Served the purpose that I bought them for. They were in great condition when I received them, and were assembled nice and strong. No hair falling out or anything like that.</li>
            <li> The colro is great, but it tangles in it first use, and I coudl onoly give it like 2 or three uses before having to throw it away. It said real hair, and it is NOT real hair, is pure cheap synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> it came really fast  i got it last month and my daughter really loves it very much, she&#x27;s enjoying a lot.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good item except someone the hair falls out which kind of sucks...other than that it&#x27;s pretty good c:</li>
            <li> I got this today. I guess for the price I paid it&#x27;s ok. Some of the strands are already coming out when I tried it for the first time. It&#x27;s fun though to add a bit of color. I&#x27;ll use this but will not order any more.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of these to clip into my hair for my wedding. I had no idea until after I bought them and went to use them that you can not do anything with them. They do not curl or krimp or anything. I don&#x27;t even have naturally straight hair so for me to use these I have to straighten all of my hair. They are really pretty and exactly what is shown. I just wish I would have known that I couldn&#x27;t curl them.</li>
            <li> Does not stay in my hair.</li>
