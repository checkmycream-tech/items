            <li>it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re going for a perfect look and have the time to do so, but when you&#x27;re in a rush the plastic combs are probably better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as good as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handle is the perfect length for holding comfortably</li>

            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyelash comb!  </li>
            <li>Therefore, you can have many coats of clump-free mascara!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this comb!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job separating the lashes and taking out clumps.</li>
            <li>They separate amazingly.</li>
            <li>Its so compact and folds nicely.</li>
            <li>The fact that it folds into itself is handy as well.</li>
            <li>I have had others (non-folding kind) that have lasted 15 years.</li>
            <li>The lashcomb itself is sturdy and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>This folding comb fits nicely into the makeup kit that lives in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Safe,easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>Works well, separates lashes nicely.  </li>
            <li>I like finding inexpensive and effective products, this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I recommend wiping an mascara residue off before using each time, otherwise it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best eyelash comb ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many eyelash combs through the years, and this model has the best length teeth with the right width in-between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these because I thought it would be a great alternative to the safety pin I have used since puberty to separate my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>But it does do a great job of making average-and-up quality look so clean, separated, unclumped, etc.     </li>
            <li>it was very easy</li>
            <li>more effectively - helping create a fuller look and avoid the \\&quot;spider leg\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this item so far.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty item I own.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lash comb/separator I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this is the by far the best eyelash comb i have ever used!  </li>
            <li>The very fine tips can separate anything, unlike any plastic combs.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very fine teeth to separate lashes.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of this product since it was a replacement for a similar eyelash comb I had.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash comb is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I just love this eyelash separator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to mention this again, but you have to maintain caution to avoid poking yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li>Way better than plastic combs.</li>
            <li>safe design.</li>

            <li>Definitely the best beauty tool in my make-up bag!</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It does a better job of separating my lashes than do combs with plastic tines.  </li>

            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>The metal comb works so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>Now I do it with 20 needles at the same time - swoosh, and I got perfectly separated lashes.</li>
            <li>Love the eyelash comb.  </li>
            <li>I love that it folds up so that I don&#x27;t poke myself on it when digging through my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I thought an eyelash comb would make my lashes look stunning.</li>
            <li>I spiral brush works better on my brows</li>
            <li>much better than using a comb with plastic prongs.</li>
            <li>I love also that it folds in</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>A metal eyelash comb is miles better than a plastic one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so much better than the plastic combs.</li>
            <li>I absolutly LOVE this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>It works better than a safety pin.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Then went some more years without it, thinking some mascara was going to not include clumps.</li>
            <li>(Believe me, I have tried many and found this is something that works and it can be replaced every 3-4 months)</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>I buy only this brand as it seems to be the one that holds up the best.</li>
            <li>an products are far superior!</li>
            <li>When I first received this eyelash comb, I loved it.</li>
            <li>This comb is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, very fine comb that can separate even the densest lashes with all types of mascara.  </li>
            <li>One coat of mascara, let it dry, then comb away for best results.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman eyelash comb has a fine metal comb that separates eyelashes easily (be sure you don&#x27;t poke your eye -</li>
            <li>I love the way the fine teeth of the comb separate lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tool is tiny but very easy to use, great for me to comb after using mascara.</li>
            <li>It makes crappy mascara look better until you can buy a kind that really works for you!  </li>
            <li>Able to rake thru the thickest of mascara to leave clump free &amp; separated.</li>
            <li>Curl first then comb and you have perfectly flirty natural eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and you can fold in and keep the brissles safe, so all in all.. its worth it!</li>
            <li>It folds easily, but isn&#x27;t flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>Separates lashes, cleans easily, stores conveniently.</li>
            <li>I lose them easily</li>
            <li>Does its job - helps me easily remove clumps in my mascara and separate my lashes.</li>
            <li>Also, the metal teeth are much sturdier and MUCH more effective than any plastic combs I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>This is a strong, sturdy product.</li>
            <li>And no clumps on the first application because you are using this amazing comb which keeps the lashes separate.</li>
            <li>I feel like this should have been priced more reasonably since it is made kind of cheaply.</li>
            <li>The comb&#x27;s teeth pull out for cleaning and fold down and into the handle perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is very sharp but it&#x27;s also the greatest eyelash separator in the world.  </li>
            <li>Just as described, quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been meaning to buy one of these for awhile, and so happy I finally did!  </li>
            <li>and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Real Techniques Lash/Brow Groomer as a replacement and although it is sturdier than this lash comb, it is not as effective at separating and de-clumping my lashes.</li>
            <li>gone are the clumps and each lash is free to flutter.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean mascara off and folds to protect the pins.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very durable plastic and the prongs are nicely spaced.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>I tried these several times after applying mascara and they just didn&#x27;t do that great of a job at separating my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Why anyone is walking around with clumpy eyelashes is beyond me with products like this one available.</li>
            <li>It gets through the mascara and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It makes any mascara look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Perfect product for separating eyelashes after mascara has dried.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for removing clumps from mascara and gives extra definition to your lashes making them look much fuller.</li>
            <li>to clean?</li>
            <li>Just clean the comb with a cotton swab dipped in mascara remover.  </li>
            <li>The comb is made of metal and can be pulled out to clean.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman website says not to use eye make up remover to clean it but to dab  it with alcohol, which I did.  </li>
            <li>Because it folds it stays clean and the tines don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>the easiest way to clean</li>
            <li>No matter how gently I clean it</li>
            <li>For the many years I&#x27;ve had it certainly got my money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li>I find it works best (for me) if you only use one coat of mascara and let it dry, then use the comb (using more than one coat of mascara</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Really makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>The metal teeth seem quite a bit finer than most of the plastic eyelash combs, and they work really well to separate eyelashes and remove clumps of mascara.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always fresh and free of fuzz and debris when you need it.</li>
            <li>FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.THIS IS A GOOD BRAND....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this; it really helps to separate the lashes and de-clump them after applying mascara.</li>
            <li>This brand is very longlasting - I&#x27;ve had my tweezer from Tweezerman also for as many years</li>
            <li>Last a good while though.</li>
            <li>Thick, perfect lashes.</li>
            <li>The worlds BEST eyelash comb hands down!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great lash comb, but be advised: the teeth of the comb are SHARP.  </li>
            <li>I use waterproof mascara and it dries quickly, often drawing my lashes together as it dries.  </li>
            <li>super glue again.</li>
            <li>I always stored the comb in the super organized makeup drawer in my bathroom, banging around in a makeup bag or purse was not an issue.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a quick arrival.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I wanted and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Ladies, we all know through the gazillion tubes of mascara, whether high end or drugstore, there isn&#x27;t a magical mascara that is going to do everything we need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When the time comes for a new lash comb, I&#x27;ll be looking for a plastic one with more blunt ends.</li>
            <li>I really like the strong metal tongs on this.</li>
            <li>It easily removes all the gunky bits left by mascara and it super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very fast and gets it perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>Its pretty easy to clean, i just used a baby wipe and was gentle with it</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, works like a charm!</li>
            <li>However, on my first attempt to clean the brush (using a pulling motion)</li>
            <li>At first I thought my cleaning method was faulty (the manufacturer says to clean it with alcohol).</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>I use a damp cotton pad or simply wash with warm water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Affordable?</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY tool that truly separates my thinning lashes effectively, getting in between each lash.  </li>
            <li>It did separate lashes nicely and combed out extra mascara as promised.  </li>
            <li>I see some women using PINS and wow, as a doctor I can sure recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;drkimsagewellsolutions</li>
            <li>but it is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Works fine if you have a fairly steady hand</li>
            <li>First the pins fall out, which can be reset and secured with super glue, then the case breaks...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands that just didn&#x27;t work right, but the Tweezerman is perfect for separating lashes because of the sharp, metal teeth and can glide through clumps.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are definitely sharp and work fairly well on eyelashes, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li>It broke right after I received it</li>
            <li>The metal part does pop out after cleaning, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it since it&#x27;s easy to fit back in and fold up again.</li>
            <li>NO MORE CLUMPS OF MASCARA WHEN I USE THIS GREAT LASH SEPARATOR.</li>
            <li>indispensable!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped it super fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean; I hold it down at the bottom of the basin under really hot water and all traces of mascara are gone.</li>
            <li>The tiny metal tines get between lashes easily, separating them quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought two combs for just this reason, it is easy to replace the teeth that fall out: remove a tooth from one comb with tweezers, then place it in the emplty hole, unless you are lucky enough to find where the tooth fell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you wear contacts, put them in first so that if you accidentally stab yourself, your eye will be protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure enough Tweezerman had what i needed!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>, can someone explain to me why I should put on eye shadow, then buff it in and follow it with three more layers of eye shadow, in the same color, layered and buffed onto my eye lid?  </li>
            <li>It works just as well as it did the first day.</li>
            <li>This comb&#x27;s metal teeth aren&#x27;t likely to break like so many plastic ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Most others have a wide-tooth comb that simply do not work, so why bother.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I used the Tweezeman comb with different mascara brands to separate when needed and found that this one is much better</li>
            <li>Maybe soaking it would work better; I used a bit of soap and a Q-tip to rub back and forth to remove the mascara</li>
            <li>but they really do the job!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I rub the comb against the mascara wand first and then apply the mascara with the comb.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time today, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Yes it is sharp but it needs to be in order to be so effective in doing its job.  </li>
            <li>Seperates lashes and makes them look full and lush!</li>
            <li>The plastic is very flimsy and cheap and if you aren&#x27;t careful, will snap easily.</li>
            <li>After using it, it helps to rub it sideways on an old washcloth to clean it before it dries on.  </li>
            <li>You could definitely poke your eye, but if you have relatively good hand control and take your time, it&#x27;s not too likely.</li>
            <li>I love this tool; it&#x27;s become an absolute makeup essential for me!</li>
            <li>(I figured since I threw away the packaging, I may try to &amp;#34;save it&amp;#34; with good &#x27;ol superglue -as duck tape is not a quick fix in this particular situation ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are not long, and easy to stick together after i applied mascara.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, sharp teeth, easy to clean, folds up for safe-keeping.</li>
            <li>love long lashes that aren&#x27;t stuck together</li>
            <li>This comb removes all clumps my mascara may leave behind, and separates my lashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I love that it folds into itself making it even smaller for travel (always a plus!); and it keeps the metal tips safe from puncturing other items in my bag, and dust/other items from damaging the metal</li>
            <li>I ordered this little tool and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>For the price, I would have expected more uses other than just for lashes, but it does fold up nicely for care-taking and quality.</li>
            <li>I use tends to clump easily without the proper tools.</li>
            <li>I wash and dry it (with my hair dryer) after (ok, almost) every use, and it is holding up well.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash comb is the only product that actually breaks the clumps apart, so in this respect I love it!</li>
            <li>Hard to find and good to have.  </li>
            <li>While the product is effective, its not very safe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great little product for travel, and really for regular home use as well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much  </li>
            <li>Thanks T-man</li>
            <li>sturdy, works very well.  </li>
            <li>It seems very sturdy and folds up so it is very compact.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it</li>
            <li>The plastic on this comb is very flimsy and prone to breaking.</li>
            <li>Does that really produce luminous eyes?  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and the metal comb spikes have not bent or rusted.</li>
            <li>Separates lashes really well.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to get into the lashes and separate them.  </li>
            <li>I really like this makeup tool.</li>
            <li>(I wash it every time I use it to keep it running smoothly through my lashes), but that&#x27;s basically standard with lash combs.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WILL LAST A LOT LONGER THAN THE CHEAP PLASTIC, PRODUCTS SOLD</li>
            <li>This product is very helpful for separatng lashes after mascara application.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li>I know some girls use pins and needles to get rid of their mascara clumps, but I value my eyesight too much to do that.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to the cheap plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much I needed this until I had it.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s metal ~ not the plastic combs that really didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li>combs straight through it and evens out mascara</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>Definitely take your time, not like with the cheap plastic versions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using LiLash, and my eyelashes are so much longer.  </li>
            <li>The metal comb REALLY separates your lashes.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for separating eye lashes after you have applied mascara.  </li>
            <li>They have really skyrocketed over the years</li>
            <li>Yes, you need to be careful, as then ends are sharp, but even my teenagers are able to use this without incident and they all love it as well.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be careful not to poke yourself in the eye, the teeth are sharp, but they do a great job of eliminating clumps.</li>
            <li>It is too sharp to be safe.</li>
            <li>But it does the job better than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Use hot water and any stiff fine brush (old toothbrush, brow brush, clean mascara wand; Q-tip will also do in a pinch).</li>
            <li>thoroughly clean this thing, you need a tiny toothbrush or one of those disposable mascara wands from Sephora to get between the teeth.</li>
            <li>to really get the clumps out, and make your lashes look natural (if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for), this comb with the metal teeth is an absolute MUST!</li>
            <li>I find it works better if you use it after the first coat has dried.</li>
            <li>effective, but the clear thin stem looks like it&#x27;s easy to break.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and yes, as many reviewers have noted, it IS sharp, but that is the point!</li>
            <li>Being small and flat it takes up virtually no space making it great for travel.</li>
            <li>I love that it folds down to keep the teeth from breaking and bending.</li>
            <li>The teeth are actually pointed, so they separate better than any other comb I&#x27;ve used, it cleans easily (unlike most others), and so far none of the teeth have broken off, probably because they&#x27;re actually metal and not the flimsy plastic that most combs use.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re like me and you go through more mascara than Tammy Faye Bakker (or even if you don&#x27;t, because it will work great for you too), just throw out all your stupid plastic-tined combs or safety pins or whatever and just buy this because you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>This one is much better quality than the one I had previously.</li>
            <li>I put on several coats of mascara, and comb and kind of wiggle the comb through the wet lashes to evenly spread the mascara and remove clumps.</li>
            <li>putting on mascara was such a hassle, until this little baby came into my life, this and smashbox mascara primer has whipped my lashes into straight little soldiers LoL!!</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look beautiful, long, and plentiful; no more clumpy lashes for this Betty!</li>
            <li>It is high quality</li>
            <li>I bought this eyelash comb after my sister highly encouraged me to buy one; I saw an immediate difference in my eyelashes after one use.</li>
            <li>This little comb is a magical tool that every woman needs.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT A TOY, SO BE SURE TO KEEP OUT OF THE HANDS OF LITTLE ONES WHO LIKE TO PLAY WITH MOM&#x27;S MAKE-UP.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I probably treat the comb a little rougher than most women.  </li>
            <li>I love this little eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>You can easily take the lashcomb and stick all of the points under your skin on your finger for example, just like with a saftey pin or other pin.</li>
            <li>Separate my eyelashes like no other!!!!</li>
            <li>I have two of these little combs and they are efficient and easy to keep clean, just a quick wipe with a tissue or with a cotton pad and a little makeup remover (if you&#x27;re using waterproof mascara).  </li>
            <li>I guess I really wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the only eyelash comb that&#x27;s worth anything.  </li>
            <li>I take a cotton round, put my favorite eye makeup remover on it and give it a wipe and never had a problem with the teeth pulling out or the case cracking.</li>
            <li>This little gadget is the new favorite in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>This little folding eyelash comb works very well to separate lashes, but it&#x27;s easy to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li>are very strong and sharp, so be careful if this is your first time using an eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>It popped right back on, but I took a star off -</li>
            <li>I feel like it actually separates my lashes and it is small and easy to clean after to use.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be treating myself to a new one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need a new brand of mascara</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well the comb separated the lashes.</li>
            <li>Of course it has to be that way to work properly, just something to remember when using, so use it very gently.</li>
            <li>...it is easier not to pull the teeth too hard when they are wet with mascara, just lightly rub the teeth against a tissue, better if the tissue has some alcohol on it.</li>
            <li>I had a similar eyelash comb and used it for many years, but poked myself in the eye with the sharp metal comb 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li>The first one was a Kurlash, I bought it in 1995 and it finally gave out just a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second one, and my first lasted forever.</li>
            <li>Its kind of sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The fact that they fold in helps keep them clean away from snagging at other items while in tow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can comb from the top down and curl upwards for extra lash lift.</li>
            <li>The teeth, as indicated by other reviewers, are very sharp; this sharpness is what makes this comb so effective.</li>
            <li>However, I have poked myself in the eye with the super sharp tips and</li>
            <li>It is super sharp.</li>
            <li>But...the user must be very  careful as the comb  is some kind of metal and very sharp.</li>
            <li>But what a waste of product, and a huge risk for smudges.</li>
            <li>The handle was cracked at the hinge when I received it, however being a clear plastic</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely fallen apart.</li>
            <li>It seems sturdy enough--I often end up putting on my eye makeup either sitting at my desk (before my work day begins), or, if I miss the early bus, in my car.  </li>
            <li>This tool is a regular part of my makeup regimen because I have wavy lashes that don&#x27;t stay straight and separated when I put on mascara.  </li>
            <li>A vital part of doing my make up.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference with my lashes when I use it.</li>
            <li>so much I have purchased for friends who couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tines are too far apart - lashes often get clumped together after combing</li>
            <li>When I used it, it literally removed nearly all my mascara.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Tweezerman directly about the problem and never received a response.</li>
            <li>have Asian sparse, straight lashes and preferred a volume waterproof mascara like Covergirl Lashblast.</li>
            <li>I try not to use this comb when my four year old daughter is anywhere near me.</li>
            <li>You need to use it right away while the mascara is still wet too.</li>
            <li>Folds up small for travel, and the metal &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are fine to separate each eyelash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second one only because I lost the first.</li>
            <li>This little comb remedies the situation easily and at the same time, rids my lashes of unsightly clumps.  </li>
            <li>ONLY way you are supposed to clean this eyelash comb is by using an eyebrow brush and brush outward towards the sharp tips.  </li>
            <li>I needed a simple little comb to brush out those tedious clumps from mascara, and this worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>The only little thing that could make this comb any better is if it came in different colors.</li>
            <li>(teeth in lash comb are sharp as pins), however, when you try to wipe it clean, the little teeth come right out, leaving bare patches in the com</li>
            <li>To my knowledge, there&#x27;s no better lash comb available.  </li>
            <li>Hint: for a serious business false lashes look, start with a good primer (I recommend Ardell Lash &amp; Brow Growth Accelerator) and layer LashBlast Fusion or L&#x27;Extreme on top.</li>
            <li>I have found super glue extends the life by a few months.</li>
            <li>As stated before, the teeth are pretty sharp, but I think that&#x27;s part of why it works so well.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m buying a few more in other colors.</li>
            <li>I remain a fan of the concept because serious eyelash combs are much better than a needle for separating mascaraed lashes, but this time I will try a different brand.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to do, even if you use it slowly and are careful.</li>
            <li>It looks white in the pic but its lucite clear with gold sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li>Note, it WILL stab if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>I have spent tons of money looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump (they all do despite the claims) when all I really needed was this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing an eyelash comb, you need to make sure it has thin metal teeth.  </li>
            <li>This little gem combs right through those lashes and separates them.</li>
            <li>This is my second one from Tweezerman and the only reason why I had to replace my first one was because some of the needles were loose and falling off.</li>
            <li>Rub gently with the brush, pat dry and set out on a towel to dry completely.</li>
            <li>This is the only eyelash comb I could ever recommend because the ones with plastic teeth are worthless, and other combs with metal tines (the only effective kind) have caps for the tines that fall off and get lost in your makeup bag, so the tines get bent or spread gross leftover mascara everywhere.</li>
            <li>I know the needles are sharp but since it&#x27;s so fine-toothed, it really does help separate my lashes and remove excess clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li>The teeth on that comb are more dull and I have to work a lot harder to comb through my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sharpness of the teeth means the comb works very well for breaking up clumps in mascara, but you have to be very careful while using it.  </li>
            <li>It folds up neatly, no sharp edges are left exposed.  </li>
            <li>but it does get rid of major clumps and separates your lashes decently enough.</li>
            <li>I suggest getting a color other than clear as I have the clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of eyelash curlers, or mascara in general.</li>
            <li>you can definitely injure your eye if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>It separates lashes well, but you could actually poke poke your eye out if you&#x27;re not very careful.  </li>
            <li>This lives up to the high quality of other precision Tweezerman products that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s sharp and you have to be careful - that the metal tines are so fine and sharp</li>
            <li>You can add layer upon layer of mascara and comb them out between each layer and your lashes will be super thick and won&#x27;t look like fuzzy spider legs.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to carry, it takes up little space, but this eyelash comb lost one tooth and rusty after a few cleanings.</li>
            <li>wow!  Not for use for the inexperienced.  </li>
            <li>Scared me to have loose metal pins near my eyes, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Then I wash with soap and pop it back in the clear plastic and air dry.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful because the teeth are pretty sharp</li>
            <li>Its got very pointy little brissles</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.</li>
            <li> The metal teeth work great to separate lashes clumped together by mascara.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with great lashes.  </li>
            <li> This works great at removing the clumps.</li>
            <li> This comb does a great job of separating mascaraed lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> Works great until the combs start falling out....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, great value,</li>
            <li> Another great tool from tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> The best of its kind, but they do wear out.  </li>
            <li> Use with care and you will love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li> VERY HANDY</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
            <li> Much better than the toothbrush I used to use, LOL!</li>
            <li> If you want to get the most out of your mascara these will work perfectly for you.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re going for a perfect look and have the time to do so, but when you&#x27;re in a rush the plastic combs are probably better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as good as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handle is the perfect length for holding comfortably</li>
            <li> hoping for some good CSR experience here...</li>
            <li> This comb is nice and very handy, but when I was cleaning it, the metal bristle part popped off the comb.</li>
            <li> The teeth are very fine and work great to separate your lashes and remove excess mascara.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but for sure you had best take caution when you use it.</li>
            <li> Great for making sure mascara does not clump.</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite eyelash comb!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I repurchased!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyelash comb!  </li>
            <li> Therefore, you can have many coats of clump-free mascara!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this comb!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job separating the lashes and taking out clumps.</li>
            <li> They separate amazingly.</li>
            <li> Its so compact and folds nicely.</li>
            <li> The fact that it folds into itself is handy as well.</li>
            <li> I have had others (non-folding kind) that have lasted 15 years.</li>
            <li> The lashcomb itself is sturdy and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> This folding comb fits nicely into the makeup kit that lives in my purse.  </li>
            <li> Safe,easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Works well, separates lashes nicely.  </li>
            <li> I like finding inexpensive and effective products, this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I recommend wiping an mascara residue off before using each time, otherwise it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best eyelash comb ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many eyelash combs through the years, and this model has the best length teeth with the right width in-between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these because I thought it would be a great alternative to the safety pin I have used since puberty to separate my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> But it does do a great job of making average-and-up quality look so clean, separated, unclumped, etc.     </li>
            <li> it was very easy</li>
            <li> more effectively - helping create a fuller look and avoid the \\&quot;spider leg\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this item so far.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty item I own.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lash comb/separator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> this is the by far the best eyelash comb i have ever used!  </li>
            <li> The very fine tips can separate anything, unlike any plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very fine teeth to separate lashes.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of this product since it was a replacement for a similar eyelash comb I had.  </li>
            <li> This eyelash comb is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I just love this eyelash separator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to mention this again, but you have to maintain caution to avoid poking yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> Way better than plastic combs.</li>
            <li> safe design.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the plastic eyelash combs.  </li>
            <li> It gives me more stability</li>
            <li> love this eyelash comb, hereafter referred to as comb.  </li>
            <li> I love having this comb in my makeup</li>
            <li> Love this comb.</li>
            <li> I have owned five of these eyelash combs and I love them.</li>
            <li> I have been through so many plastic eyelash combs, both cheaper versions and the more upscale.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best beauty tool in my make-up bag!</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It does a better job of separating my lashes than do combs with plastic tines.  </li>
            <li> This metal comb is so much better then the plastic crappy combs that you can buy.  </li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> Bought for myself and ended up buying more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would separate my lashes more than it does.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> The metal comb works so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> Now I do it with 20 needles at the same time - swoosh, and I got perfectly separated lashes.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelash comb.  </li>
            <li> I love that it folds up so that I don&#x27;t poke myself on it when digging through my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought an eyelash comb would make my lashes look stunning.</li>
            <li> I spiral brush works better on my brows</li>
            <li> much better than using a comb with plastic prongs.</li>
            <li> I love also that it folds in</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> A metal eyelash comb is miles better than a plastic one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so much better than the plastic combs.</li>
            <li> I absolutly LOVE this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> It works better than a safety pin.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Then went some more years without it, thinking some mascara was going to not include clumps.</li>
            <li> (Believe me, I have tried many and found this is something that works and it can be replaced every 3-4 months)</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Im sure</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> I buy only this brand as it seems to be the one that holds up the best.</li>
            <li> an products are far superior!</li>
            <li> When I first received this eyelash comb, I loved it.</li>
            <li> This comb is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very fine comb that can separate even the densest lashes with all types of mascara.  </li>
            <li> One coat of mascara, let it dry, then comb away for best results.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman eyelash comb has a fine metal comb that separates eyelashes easily (be sure you don&#x27;t poke your eye -</li>
            <li> I love the way the fine teeth of the comb separate lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tool is tiny but very easy to use, great for me to comb after using mascara.</li>
            <li> It makes crappy mascara look better until you can buy a kind that really works for you!  </li>
            <li> Able to rake thru the thickest of mascara to leave clump free &amp; separated.</li>
            <li> Curl first then comb and you have perfectly flirty natural eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> and you can fold in and keep the brissles safe, so all in all.. its worth it!</li>
            <li> It folds easily, but isn&#x27;t flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> Separates lashes, cleans easily, stores conveniently.</li>
            <li> I lose them easily</li>
            <li> Does its job - helps me easily remove clumps in my mascara and separate my lashes.</li>
            <li> Also, the metal teeth are much sturdier and MUCH more effective than any plastic combs I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> This is a strong, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> And no clumps on the first application because you are using this amazing comb which keeps the lashes separate.</li>
            <li> I feel like this should have been priced more reasonably since it is made kind of cheaply.</li>
            <li> The comb&#x27;s teeth pull out for cleaning and fold down and into the handle perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is very sharp but it&#x27;s also the greatest eyelash separator in the world.  </li>
            <li> Just as described, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to buy one of these for awhile, and so happy I finally did!  </li>
            <li> and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Real Techniques Lash/Brow Groomer as a replacement and although it is sturdier than this lash comb, it is not as effective at separating and de-clumping my lashes.</li>
            <li> gone are the clumps and each lash is free to flutter.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean mascara off and folds to protect the pins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very durable plastic and the prongs are nicely spaced.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> I tried these several times after applying mascara and they just didn&#x27;t do that great of a job at separating my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Why anyone is walking around with clumpy eyelashes is beyond me with products like this one available.</li>
            <li> It gets through the mascara and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It makes any mascara look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Perfect product for separating eyelashes after mascara has dried.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for removing clumps from mascara and gives extra definition to your lashes making them look much fuller.</li>
            <li> to clean?</li>
            <li> Just clean the comb with a cotton swab dipped in mascara remover.  </li>
            <li> The comb is made of metal and can be pulled out to clean.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman website says not to use eye make up remover to clean it but to dab  it with alcohol, which I did.  </li>
            <li> Because it folds it stays clean and the tines don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> the easiest way to clean</li>
            <li> No matter how gently I clean it</li>
            <li> For the many years I&#x27;ve had it certainly got my money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li> I find it works best (for me) if you only use one coat of mascara and let it dry, then use the comb (using more than one coat of mascara</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Really makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The metal teeth seem quite a bit finer than most of the plastic eyelash combs, and they work really well to separate eyelashes and remove clumps of mascara.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always fresh and free of fuzz and debris when you need it.</li>
            <li> FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.THIS IS A GOOD BRAND....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this; it really helps to separate the lashes and de-clump them after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> This brand is very longlasting - I&#x27;ve had my tweezer from Tweezerman also for as many years</li>
            <li> Last a good while though.</li>
            <li> Thick, perfect lashes.</li>
            <li> The worlds BEST eyelash comb hands down!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great lash comb, but be advised: the teeth of the comb are SHARP.  </li>
            <li> I use waterproof mascara and it dries quickly, often drawing my lashes together as it dries.  </li>
            <li> super glue again.</li>
            <li> I always stored the comb in the super organized makeup drawer in my bathroom, banging around in a makeup bag or purse was not an issue.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a quick arrival.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Ladies, we all know through the gazillion tubes of mascara, whether high end or drugstore, there isn&#x27;t a magical mascara that is going to do everything we need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When the time comes for a new lash comb, I&#x27;ll be looking for a plastic one with more blunt ends.</li>
            <li> I really like the strong metal tongs on this.</li>
            <li> It easily removes all the gunky bits left by mascara and it super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very fast and gets it perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> Its pretty easy to clean, i just used a baby wipe and was gentle with it</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> However, on my first attempt to clean the brush (using a pulling motion)</li>
            <li> At first I thought my cleaning method was faulty (the manufacturer says to clean it with alcohol).</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> I use a damp cotton pad or simply wash with warm water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Affordable?</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY tool that truly separates my thinning lashes effectively, getting in between each lash.  </li>
            <li> It did separate lashes nicely and combed out extra mascara as promised.  </li>
            <li> I see some women using PINS and wow, as a doctor I can sure recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;drkimsagewellsolutions</li>
            <li> but it is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works fine if you have a fairly steady hand</li>
            <li> First the pins fall out, which can be reset and secured with super glue, then the case breaks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands that just didn&#x27;t work right, but the Tweezerman is perfect for separating lashes because of the sharp, metal teeth and can glide through clumps.  </li>
            <li> The teeth are definitely sharp and work fairly well on eyelashes, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It broke right after I received it</li>
            <li> The metal part does pop out after cleaning, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it since it&#x27;s easy to fit back in and fold up again.</li>
            <li> NO MORE CLUMPS OF MASCARA WHEN I USE THIS GREAT LASH SEPARATOR.</li>
            <li> indispensable!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped it super fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean; I hold it down at the bottom of the basin under really hot water and all traces of mascara are gone.</li>
            <li> The tiny metal tines get between lashes easily, separating them quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought two combs for just this reason, it is easy to replace the teeth that fall out: remove a tooth from one comb with tweezers, then place it in the emplty hole, unless you are lucky enough to find where the tooth fell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you wear contacts, put them in first so that if you accidentally stab yourself, your eye will be protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure enough Tweezerman had what i needed!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> , can someone explain to me why I should put on eye shadow, then buff it in and follow it with three more layers of eye shadow, in the same color, layered and buffed onto my eye lid?  </li>
            <li> It works just as well as it did the first day.</li>
            <li> This comb&#x27;s metal teeth aren&#x27;t likely to break like so many plastic ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Most others have a wide-tooth comb that simply do not work, so why bother.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I used the Tweezeman comb with different mascara brands to separate when needed and found that this one is much better</li>
            <li> Maybe soaking it would work better; I used a bit of soap and a Q-tip to rub back and forth to remove the mascara</li>
            <li> but they really do the job!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I rub the comb against the mascara wand first and then apply the mascara with the comb.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time today, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Yes it is sharp but it needs to be in order to be so effective in doing its job.  </li>
            <li> Seperates lashes and makes them look full and lush!</li>
            <li> The plastic is very flimsy and cheap and if you aren&#x27;t careful, will snap easily.</li>
            <li> After using it, it helps to rub it sideways on an old washcloth to clean it before it dries on.  </li>
            <li> You could definitely poke your eye, but if you have relatively good hand control and take your time, it&#x27;s not too likely.</li>
            <li> I love this tool; it&#x27;s become an absolute makeup essential for me!</li>
            <li> (I figured since I threw away the packaging, I may try to &amp;#34;save it&amp;#34; with good &#x27;ol superglue -as duck tape is not a quick fix in this particular situation ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not long, and easy to stick together after i applied mascara.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, sharp teeth, easy to clean, folds up for safe-keeping.</li>
            <li> love long lashes that aren&#x27;t stuck together</li>
            <li> This comb removes all clumps my mascara may leave behind, and separates my lashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I love that it folds into itself making it even smaller for travel (always a plus!); and it keeps the metal tips safe from puncturing other items in my bag, and dust/other items from damaging the metal</li>
            <li> I ordered this little tool and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> For the price, I would have expected more uses other than just for lashes, but it does fold up nicely for care-taking and quality.</li>
            <li> I use tends to clump easily without the proper tools.</li>
            <li> I wash and dry it (with my hair dryer) after (ok, almost) every use, and it is holding up well.  </li>
            <li> This eyelash comb is the only product that actually breaks the clumps apart, so in this respect I love it!</li>
            <li> Hard to find and good to have.  </li>
            <li> While the product is effective, its not very safe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little product for travel, and really for regular home use as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much  </li>
            <li> Thanks T-man</li>
            <li> sturdy, works very well.  </li>
            <li> It seems very sturdy and folds up so it is very compact.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it</li>
            <li> The plastic on this comb is very flimsy and prone to breaking.</li>
            <li> Does that really produce luminous eyes?  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and the metal comb spikes have not bent or rusted.</li>
            <li> Separates lashes really well.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to get into the lashes and separate them.  </li>
            <li> I really like this makeup tool.</li>
            <li> (I wash it every time I use it to keep it running smoothly through my lashes), but that&#x27;s basically standard with lash combs.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WILL LAST A LOT LONGER THAN THE CHEAP PLASTIC, PRODUCTS SOLD</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful for separatng lashes after mascara application.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> I know some girls use pins and needles to get rid of their mascara clumps, but I value my eyesight too much to do that.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to the cheap plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much I needed this until I had it.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s metal ~ not the plastic combs that really didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> combs straight through it and evens out mascara</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> Definitely take your time, not like with the cheap plastic versions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LiLash, and my eyelashes are so much longer.  </li>
            <li> The metal comb REALLY separates your lashes.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for separating eye lashes after you have applied mascara.  </li>
            <li> They have really skyrocketed over the years</li>
            <li> Yes, you need to be careful, as then ends are sharp, but even my teenagers are able to use this without incident and they all love it as well.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to poke yourself in the eye, the teeth are sharp, but they do a great job of eliminating clumps.</li>
            <li> It is too sharp to be safe.</li>
            <li> But it does the job better than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Use hot water and any stiff fine brush (old toothbrush, brow brush, clean mascara wand; Q-tip will also do in a pinch).</li>
            <li> thoroughly clean this thing, you need a tiny toothbrush or one of those disposable mascara wands from Sephora to get between the teeth.</li>
            <li> to really get the clumps out, and make your lashes look natural (if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for), this comb with the metal teeth is an absolute MUST!</li>
            <li> I find it works better if you use it after the first coat has dried.</li>
            <li> effective, but the clear thin stem looks like it&#x27;s easy to break.</li>
            <li> It is very well made and yes, as many reviewers have noted, it IS sharp, but that is the point!</li>
            <li> Being small and flat it takes up virtually no space making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> I love that it folds down to keep the teeth from breaking and bending.</li>
            <li> The teeth are actually pointed, so they separate better than any other comb I&#x27;ve used, it cleans easily (unlike most others), and so far none of the teeth have broken off, probably because they&#x27;re actually metal and not the flimsy plastic that most combs use.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like me and you go through more mascara than Tammy Faye Bakker (or even if you don&#x27;t, because it will work great for you too), just throw out all your stupid plastic-tined combs or safety pins or whatever and just buy this because you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> This one is much better quality than the one I had previously.</li>
            <li> I put on several coats of mascara, and comb and kind of wiggle the comb through the wet lashes to evenly spread the mascara and remove clumps.</li>
            <li> putting on mascara was such a hassle, until this little baby came into my life, this and smashbox mascara primer has whipped my lashes into straight little soldiers LoL!!</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look beautiful, long, and plentiful; no more clumpy lashes for this Betty!</li>
            <li> It is high quality</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash comb after my sister highly encouraged me to buy one; I saw an immediate difference in my eyelashes after one use.</li>
            <li> This little comb is a magical tool that every woman needs.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT A TOY, SO BE SURE TO KEEP OUT OF THE HANDS OF LITTLE ONES WHO LIKE TO PLAY WITH MOM&#x27;S MAKE-UP.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I probably treat the comb a little rougher than most women.  </li>
            <li> I love this little eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> You can easily take the lashcomb and stick all of the points under your skin on your finger for example, just like with a saftey pin or other pin.</li>
            <li> Separate my eyelashes like no other!!!!</li>
            <li> I have two of these little combs and they are efficient and easy to keep clean, just a quick wipe with a tissue or with a cotton pad and a little makeup remover (if you&#x27;re using waterproof mascara).  </li>
            <li> I guess I really wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash comb that&#x27;s worth anything.  </li>
            <li> I take a cotton round, put my favorite eye makeup remover on it and give it a wipe and never had a problem with the teeth pulling out or the case cracking.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is the new favorite in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> This little folding eyelash comb works very well to separate lashes, but it&#x27;s easy to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> are very strong and sharp, so be careful if this is your first time using an eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> It popped right back on, but I took a star off -</li>
            <li> I feel like it actually separates my lashes and it is small and easy to clean after to use.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be treating myself to a new one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need a new brand of mascara</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well the comb separated the lashes.</li>
            <li> Of course it has to be that way to work properly, just something to remember when using, so use it very gently.</li>
            <li> ...it is easier not to pull the teeth too hard when they are wet with mascara, just lightly rub the teeth against a tissue, better if the tissue has some alcohol on it.</li>
            <li> I had a similar eyelash comb and used it for many years, but poked myself in the eye with the sharp metal comb 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li> The first one was a Kurlash, I bought it in 1995 and it finally gave out just a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one, and my first lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Its kind of sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The fact that they fold in helps keep them clean away from snagging at other items while in tow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can comb from the top down and curl upwards for extra lash lift.</li>
            <li> The teeth, as indicated by other reviewers, are very sharp; this sharpness is what makes this comb so effective.</li>
            <li> However, I have poked myself in the eye with the super sharp tips and</li>
            <li> It is super sharp.</li>
            <li> But...the user must be very  careful as the comb  is some kind of metal and very sharp.</li>
            <li> But what a waste of product, and a huge risk for smudges.</li>
            <li> The handle was cracked at the hinge when I received it, however being a clear plastic</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely fallen apart.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy enough--I often end up putting on my eye makeup either sitting at my desk (before my work day begins), or, if I miss the early bus, in my car.  </li>
            <li> This tool is a regular part of my makeup regimen because I have wavy lashes that don&#x27;t stay straight and separated when I put on mascara.  </li>
            <li> A vital part of doing my make up.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference with my lashes when I use it.</li>
            <li> so much I have purchased for friends who couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tines are too far apart - lashes often get clumped together after combing</li>
            <li> When I used it, it literally removed nearly all my mascara.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Tweezerman directly about the problem and never received a response.</li>
            <li> have Asian sparse, straight lashes and preferred a volume waterproof mascara like Covergirl Lashblast.</li>
            <li> I try not to use this comb when my four year old daughter is anywhere near me.</li>
            <li> You need to use it right away while the mascara is still wet too.</li>
            <li> Folds up small for travel, and the metal &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are fine to separate each eyelash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one only because I lost the first.</li>
            <li> This little comb remedies the situation easily and at the same time, rids my lashes of unsightly clumps.  </li>
            <li> ONLY way you are supposed to clean this eyelash comb is by using an eyebrow brush and brush outward towards the sharp tips.  </li>
            <li> I needed a simple little comb to brush out those tedious clumps from mascara, and this worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> The only little thing that could make this comb any better is if it came in different colors.</li>
            <li> (teeth in lash comb are sharp as pins), however, when you try to wipe it clean, the little teeth come right out, leaving bare patches in the com</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, there&#x27;s no better lash comb available.  </li>
            <li> Hint: for a serious business false lashes look, start with a good primer (I recommend Ardell Lash &amp; Brow Growth Accelerator) and layer LashBlast Fusion or L&#x27;Extreme on top.</li>
            <li> I have found super glue extends the life by a few months.</li>
            <li> As stated before, the teeth are pretty sharp, but I think that&#x27;s part of why it works so well.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m buying a few more in other colors.</li>
            <li> I remain a fan of the concept because serious eyelash combs are much better than a needle for separating mascaraed lashes, but this time I will try a different brand.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to do, even if you use it slowly and are careful.</li>
            <li> It looks white in the pic but its lucite clear with gold sturdy bristles.</li>
            <li> Note, it WILL stab if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump (they all do despite the claims) when all I really needed was this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing an eyelash comb, you need to make sure it has thin metal teeth.  </li>
            <li> This little gem combs right through those lashes and separates them.</li>
            <li> This is my second one from Tweezerman and the only reason why I had to replace my first one was because some of the needles were loose and falling off.</li>
            <li> Rub gently with the brush, pat dry and set out on a towel to dry completely.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash comb I could ever recommend because the ones with plastic teeth are worthless, and other combs with metal tines (the only effective kind) have caps for the tines that fall off and get lost in your makeup bag, so the tines get bent or spread gross leftover mascara everywhere.</li>
            <li> I know the needles are sharp but since it&#x27;s so fine-toothed, it really does help separate my lashes and remove excess clumpy mascara.</li>
            <li> The teeth on that comb are more dull and I have to work a lot harder to comb through my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sharpness of the teeth means the comb works very well for breaking up clumps in mascara, but you have to be very careful while using it.  </li>
            <li> It folds up neatly, no sharp edges are left exposed.  </li>
            <li> but it does get rid of major clumps and separates your lashes decently enough.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting a color other than clear as I have the clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of eyelash curlers, or mascara in general.</li>
            <li> you can definitely injure your eye if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It separates lashes well, but you could actually poke poke your eye out if you&#x27;re not very careful.  </li>
            <li> This lives up to the high quality of other precision Tweezerman products that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s sharp and you have to be careful - that the metal tines are so fine and sharp</li>
            <li> You can add layer upon layer of mascara and comb them out between each layer and your lashes will be super thick and won&#x27;t look like fuzzy spider legs.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to carry, it takes up little space, but this eyelash comb lost one tooth and rusty after a few cleanings.</li>
            <li> wow!  Not for use for the inexperienced.  </li>
            <li> Scared me to have loose metal pins near my eyes, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Then I wash with soap and pop it back in the clear plastic and air dry.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful because the teeth are pretty sharp</li>
            <li> Its got very pointy little brissles</li>
            <li> I will use on special occasion only, because I&#x27;m usually pressed for time and since this is sharp, any type of rushing would take out an eyeball.</li>
            <li> The teeth are very sharp (unlike any plastic eyelash comb&#x27;s which are too thick to divide clumped lashes) which allows them to easily divide lashes that have become clumped with mascara.  </li>
            <li> These bristles are sharp so if you miss and stick your eye they hurt, but after a couple uses they are easier to use and work fantastic,even my 15 year old uses them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of using a needle to separate lashes, but I&#x27;m usually in too much of a rush to have enough control to not poke my eye out.</li>
            <li> Although its smaller size and the fact that it&#x27;s clear make it a little easier to misplace in your makeup bag, I find that since it&#x27;s smaller and not like mounted on a stick, it&#x27;s easier to use.  </li>
            <li> It clumps on my lashes and usually I just use a tissue to gently wipe my lashes to take off excess.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I went online searching for eyelash brushes--</li>
            <li> I have very long and unruly lashes, they criss cross and are all over the place,</li>
            <li> These were impossible to find in any drugstores, or the Walmart, K-mart, Target type stores, so I was thrilled to find them here.</li>
            <li> no pressure will be applied) however after a few (maybe 3) uses, the complete row of teeth fell out, as one piece, &amp; the piece ultimately broke off at the hairline crack...</li>
            <li> Better than the plastic mascara combs, the metal spike really separate lashes if you hate the &#x27;spider lash&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with the quality of the comb…I have a more expensive eyelash comb with sharp metal teeth that can also come out after cleaning them with a tissue.</li>
            <li> This is the way to have natural looking dark eyelashes without the clumps!  </li>
            <li> I had a eyelash comb a long time ago</li>
            <li> and I think it will provide a long life of use.</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long as the rest.</li>
            <li> That being said,maybe I need to find a new mascara if I&#x27;m having such a hard time with clumping.....</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars is due to the price.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when using it, because the comb is actually wire</li>
            <li> (even when it&#x27;s dry) makes the lashes look goopy and gloppy even after you comb them).</li>
            <li> Shake off water and air dry.    </li>
            <li> Then I give it a rinse and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do NOT use them on dry lashes, all they will do is pull out your lashes.</li>
            <li> use this with Blinc tubing mascara to separate lashes after primer coat is dry, and immediately apply the mascara coat, then comb any stuck lashes before they dry.  </li>
            <li> These combs last a long time, and I only bought this one because my last one was missing a few teeth.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more annoying than spending the time to put on primer and mascara, only to find several lashes clumped together.  </li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes that get tangled in each other and caught in my eye.</li>
            <li> It gets right in at the base of the lashes and when you draw it upwards toward the tip, it makes them fan out in a pretty way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with previous lash combs because they&#x27;d have plastic on either end of the actual comb, which made it harder for me to separate my lashed.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of every single clump!  </li>
            <li> separates every single lash!</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried since other people said it was too sharp/dangerous to use, but as long as your careful (and you&#x27;re working on your eyes, so why wouldn&#x27;t you be?)</li>
            <li> But the little combs were very seperated &amp; thick &amp; did nothing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Apply mascara, comb while wet, wait for it to dry, then add another coat, comb while wet (again), and voila!</li>
            <li> I travel at least twice a month, so i keep nearly doubles or travel sizes of all my beauty routine</li>
            <li> This is not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Careful thought -</li>
            <li> Use it immediately after putting on mascara so your lashes or wet and you aren&#x27;t pulling on them.</li>
            <li> Do be careful though</li>
            <li> Wet the comb, let it sit for a minute to soften the mascara, then wipe it with the spoolie brush and rinse.</li>
            <li> ot hold it closed.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps you can use it for a craft project if you&#x27;re really careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> But please please be careful.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> need to be careful not to slip while using it, ouch in the eye</li>
            <li> Never ever bother with plastic combs, waste of time and money, much too thick to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well but be careful as it is sharp.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL though, as this thing is SHARP.</li>
            <li> The comb IS needle sharp so do be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful as this thing is not joking around: it&#x27;s got sharp, metal pin like teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you are careful with the sharp, pointy teeth, this does the job and separates eyelashes well.</li>
            <li> The teeth of the comb are sharp so be careful not to poke yourself.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, so just be careful.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that it&#x27;s sharp, so use it carefully.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when i figured there were other items like this</li>
            <li> The sharp, pointed tips allow me to separate my lashes</li>
            <li> The teeth on this comb are literally sharp like needles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even opened the other comb.  </li>
            <li> But be careful because it can hurt if your hand slips!</li>
            <li> Brushes out the clumps and folds away so the comb doesn&#x27;t get stuck on other items in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This lash brush works well at separating eyelashes but the teeth are really sharp.  </li>
            <li> I use it with extreme caution on my lashes but not my brows.  </li>
            <li> They are also sharp, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only apply mascara once at home, but think if I travelled with it I would probably put a small rubber band around the end</li>
            <li> You do have to use caution when picking it up or cleaning it, as it is sharp.  </li>
            <li> And yes, they are sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought two other for friends</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to poke yourself in the eye!</li>
            <li> me careful!</li>
            <li> Be very careful, though, as the teeth are extremely sharp - like needles.</li>
            <li> be careful the tips are sharp!</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL</li>
            <li> If you must use it, be very, very careful.  </li>
            <li> , so be VERY careful not to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> There are, however, a few major cons:    - hard to clean and must be cleaned often  - dangerous -</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it&#x27;s so small that I lost it,</li>
            <li> Folds up small, and was just a little difficult to get clean.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with it since it is actual pin tips because you could do some serious damamge to your eye</li>
            <li> i thought this was a little expensive at first</li>
            <li> Only negative about it is that eventually the tines will fall out.</li>
            <li> I am a little leary of the metal combs that was mentioned in previous reviews, just trying to be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful, though, the teeth are very sharp!</li>
            <li> I pull it out about once a month and rub a q-tip soaked in eye makeup remover up and down the comb to remove the mascara from between the metal.</li>
            <li> it folds down compact and would travel well.</li>
            <li> A little sharp, so just pay attention when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup to my other Tweezerman Folding Eyelash Comb, just in case I lose it or it breaks!  </li>
            <li> It is dark black, coats like a gel, gives me volume after 2 coats, build-able, and holds a curl.  </li>
            <li> The ones that were thin enough to separate your lashes broke teeth off constantly, and the ones that were sturdier weren&#x27;t thin enough to comb through the lashes.</li>
            <li> Yes, you must be careful about pulling too hard as the teeth can be removed---I have had this same model in the past.</li>
            <li> AS THE METAL TEETH ARE VERY SHARP, BUT IT FOLDS INTO A PLASTIC COVER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve poked my eye with it and object is very sharp  and made of metal.</li>
            <li> Also, the ends are very sharp (which makes it work so well)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp, but if it weren&#x27;t, it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very sharp though so</li>
            <li> The tweezerman gets in where the typical, plastic combs falter.  </li>
            <li> It is also probably a lot safer than the safety pins I was previously using to declump my lashes.  </li>
            <li> but be very careful, it&#x27;s no fun to poke yourself with those sharp little teeth!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would mess up my mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> have owned this comb for little over a year now</li>
            <li> folding mechanism is a little flimsy but it still works well.</li>
            <li> The little metal comb part is removable which makes it even easier.</li>
            <li> And it has a little protector that goes over the comb to keep makeup-box junk out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased 2 of these combs because I broke the 1st one being very hard on the teeth.</li>
            <li> It did manage to seperate dried mascara without yanking hair out.</li>
            <li> this is a bit harsh on my extensions.</li>
            <li> Separates all of your lashes in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Had one several years ago and threw it out because it was broken.  </li>
            <li> I have a few of them being</li>
            <li> I was having trouble keeping them separated when I put on my liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> When I can be bothered to wear makeup, I tend to pile on layers and layers of mascara because I like the false-eyelashes look without the trouble of gluing them on, and unsurprisingly, this leads to a lot of clumps.  </li>
            <li> , it is very sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!  </li>
            <li> The plastic holding the comb broke in less than a week!  </li>
            <li> Usually I had to replace my lash comb 1-2 times a year with other brands I&#x27;d used in the past</li>
            <li> - I usually just wipe off the masacara from the comb with tissue paper but just be careful not to wipe or tug too hard as this was the eventual cause of the needles coming off.</li>
            <li> Having gone through plastic eyelash combs every few months, I&#x27;m ecstatic to say I&#x27;ve been with this little guy for 4 years!</li>
            <li> metal tips on the comb are VERY sharp (possibly dangerous near the eye)&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter what a mascara&#x27;s marketing tells you, there are none out there that don&#x27;t clump at least a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I like how it folds up small.  </li>
            <li> Its also small and compact</li>
            <li> There is no way to judge how far the pins at the end come thus leaving you in a possibly dangerous situation.</li>
            <li> No more clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> No more Tammy Faye eyes.</li>
            <li> see how durable it is after a few months of use, but for now this is a 5 star winner!</li>
            <li> but worse, leaving little headless pins scattered round for you to poke yourself or someone else.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful at the base of your lid with these because the needles/fingers are very sharp, but that is necessary for precision and beauty.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I gently wiped it with an eye-makeup remover pad, some teeth fell out, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> Ironically, I had been looking for something other than the cheesy little eyelash brush that comes with makeup kits.  </li>
            <li> ill have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Hard to comb lashes.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find in my make-up kit</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is that after awhile the hinge on both of mine loosened and now it&#x27;s awkward to use</li>
            <li> *are* dangerous, but they are the only way to achieve this look!</li>
            <li> Seriously I&#x27;ve tried them all....</li>
            <li> Seriously,  what are you waiting for?  </li>
            <li> A little too expensive for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are crazy sharp.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use!  </li>
            <li> Because the suckers break!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> The ends on this are pointed and very sharp, I just end up stabbing myself in the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I hate clumpy looking eyelashes (as a former user of eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> but these are thin and get between every eyelash.</li>
            <li> No rust, nothing is broken, and all teeth are accounted for.</li>
            <li> I was beyond frustrated with your typical plastic lash comb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it tends to bend or fold as I am trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be awkward to hold but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The beauty of this \\&quot;newer\\&quot; model is that it folds over - thus preventing me from stabbing myself when blindly hunting around in my make-up case!  </li>
            <li> (if that&#x27;s a bad description, I apologize).</li>
            <li> And if you use bad clumpy mascara, this will not save you on its lonesome.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad of a problem.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it  :(</li>
            <li> Metal dangerous!</li>
            <li> you would be CRAZY to use this as intended or any where else on your body!  </li>
            <li> Very painful and required 8 eye doctor visits, eye drops 4 times a day for 2 months, and a painful procedure as well.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the Tweezerman company and do not recommend this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Hard to comb lashes.  Doesn&#x27;t do much  Wish handle was longer.</li>
            <li> This is not really what I was looking for. I have long eyelashes that get tangled in each other and caught in my eye. The ends on this are pointed and very sharp, I just end up stabbing myself in the eyelid.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash comb that&#x27;s worth anything.  The tiny metal tines get between lashes easily, separating them quickly.  I can&#x27;t see how anyone could actually use a plastic lash comb.  I have two of these little combs and they are efficient and easy to keep clean, just a quick wipe with a tissue or with a cotton pad and a little makeup remover (if you&#x27;re using waterproof mascara).  My lashes always clump a bit no matter what brand of mascara I use so separating them is a critical part of my routine.  This little comb is a magical tool that every woman needs.  It gets right in at the base of the lashes and when you draw it upwards toward the tip, it makes them fan out in a pretty way.  I use waterproof mascara and it dries quickly, often drawing my lashes together as it dries.  This little comb remedies the situation easily and at the same time, rids my lashes of unsightly clumps.  It&#x27;s a lifesaver.  Without it, I would have clumpy, stuck-together eyelashes, lol!  I definitely recommend it.  To my knowledge, there&#x27;s no better lash comb available.  Totally worth the money and you&#x27;ll have it forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to buy one of these for awhile, and so happy I finally did!  No matter what a mascara&#x27;s marketing tells you, there are none out there that don&#x27;t clump at least a little bit.  The Tweezerman Folding Eyelash Comb is the solution to that makeup faux pas!  It separates each individual lash so you don&#x27;t have spider legs sticking out of your lids.  This lives up to the high quality of other precision Tweezerman products that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well the comb separated the lashes. I find it works best (for me) if you only use one coat of mascara and let it dry, then use the comb (using more than one coat of mascara (even when it&#x27;s dry) makes the lashes look goopy and gloppy even after you comb them). One coat of mascara, let it dry, then comb away for best results.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It works well.  I wash it with soap and water and I think it&#x27;s starting to rust into the plastic where the metal is held (if that&#x27;s a bad description, I apologize). However, I have poked myself in the eye with the super sharp tips and wow!  Not for use for the inexperienced.  But I think it beats the safety pin I used as a teen.  Anyway, if you wear contacts, put them in first so that if you accidentally stab yourself, your eye will be protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To thoroughly clean this thing, you need a tiny toothbrush or one of those disposable mascara wands from Sephora to get between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Hard to find and good to have.  I truly like having this versatile tool to use -especially when I am traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product  like this for quite some time.  Thanks T-man</li>
            <li> This is a awsome eyelash seperator.It takes some getting used to and has metal bristles. These bristles are sharp so if you miss and stick your eye they hurt, but after a couple uses they are easier to use and work fantastic,even my 15 year old uses them.</li>
            <li> I bought mascara from Sonia Kushak that came with an eyelash seperator at one end. But the little combs were very seperated &amp; thick &amp; did nothing for my lashes. That&#x27;s when i figured there were other items like this so i hopped on Amazon &amp; sure enough Tweezerman had what i needed! I adore this product &amp; take it wherever i go! Just don&#x27;t use it in your car or you will fork your eye out!  8/25/2011 EDIT:  About a week ago when I was cleaning this eyelash comb, four teeth came out. I tried to slide them back in but they kept falling out. Now, i&#x27;m looking for a different one that will last longer than four months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of this product since it was a replacement for a similar eyelash comb I had.  The beauty of this \\&quot;newer\\&quot; model is that it folds over - thus preventing me from stabbing myself when blindly hunting around in my make-up case!  I hate clumpy looking eyelashes (as a former user of eyelash extensions - it&#x27;s the length I&#x27;m trying to achieve with my mascara) and this eyelash comb ensures that won&#x27;t be a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I received mine today and tested it out on already-done lashes. It did manage to seperate dried mascara without yanking hair out. It looks white in the pic but its lucite clear with gold sturdy bristles. Its so compact and folds nicely. It is not flimsy and is a handy tool to have to perfect your makeup. I will use on special occasion only, because I&#x27;m usually pressed for time and since this is sharp, any type of rushing would take out an eyeball.</li>
            <li> This eyelash comb is fantastic!  Yes it is sharp but it needs to be in order to be so effective in doing its job.  I suggest getting a color other than clear as I have the clear and it&#x27;s hard to find in my make-up kit so I&#x27;m buying a few more in other colors.</li>
            <li> Truly one of the coolest products I didn&#x27;t know I ever needed! Lol.  It&#x27;s especially handy because the fiberlash mascara I use tends to clump easily without the proper tools. The tweezerman gets in where the typical, plastic combs falter.  The sharp, pointed tips allow me to separate my lashes more effectively - helping create a fuller look and avoid the \\&quot;spider leg\\&quot; effect. You do need to use them with caution bec. you can definitely injure your eye if you are not careful. (Just remember: no one - including yourself - will care how beautiful your lashes look if your poke your eyes out.)  The fact that they fold in helps keep them clean away from snagging at other items while in tow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;De-clump stubborn mascara balls? Check!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean? Yup. I use a damp cotton pad or simply wash with warm water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Affordable? C&#x27;mon. $10 bucks and some change - plus Prime shipping? Fa&#x27;getabaw-tit. It&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> The metal teeth seem quite a bit finer than most of the plastic eyelash combs, and they work really well to separate eyelashes and remove clumps of mascara. The fact that it folds into itself is handy as well.</li>
            <li> I like how it folds up small.  Just clean the comb with a cotton swab dipped in mascara remover.  It does the job well.</li>
            <li> I just love this eyelash separator. It&#x27;s very easy to clean; I hold it down at the bottom of the basin under really hot water and all traces of mascara are gone. I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to mention this again, but you have to maintain caution to avoid poking yourself in the eye. Ouch... Only negative about it is that eventually the tines will fall out.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash comb I have ever used. It separates your lashes perfectly. Way better than plastic combs. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Works well but be careful as it is sharp.</li>
            <li> It broke right after I received it</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry, it takes up little space, but this eyelash comb lost one tooth and rusty after a few cleanings. It is too sharp to be safe.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash comb out there!</li>
            <li> sturdy, works very well.  safe design.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist.  This eyelash comb fell apart after one cleaning.  I bought another one and the same thing happened.  I have had others (non-folding kind) that have lasted 15 years.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is the new favorite in my makeup bag.  It&#x27;s a great tool for separating lashes and getting the clumps out of mascara.  It seems very sturdy and folds up so it is very compact.</li>
            <li> NO MORE CLUMPS OF MASCARA WHEN I USE THIS GREAT LASH SEPARATOR. BE VERY CAREFUL AS THE METAL TEETH ARE VERY SHARP, BUT IT FOLDS INTO A PLASTIC COVER SO YOU WON&#x27;T STAB YOURSELF REACHING FOR IT.  IT&#x27;S A GREAT BEAUTY PRODUCT, BUT IT&#x27;S NOT A TOY, SO BE SURE TO KEEP OUT OF THE HANDS OF LITTLE ONES WHO LIKE TO PLAY WITH MOM&#x27;S MAKE-UP.</li>
            <li> Exactly as good as everyone says it is. Note, it WILL stab if you&#x27;re not careful, you DO need a mirror, etc. And if you use bad clumpy mascara, this will not save you on its lonesome. But it does do a great job of making average-and-up quality look so clean, separated, unclumped, etc.     It folds easily, but isn&#x27;t flimsy at all. Cleaning&#x27;s a breeze; there&#x27;s no need to worry about teeth falling out. Use hot water and any stiff fine brush (old toothbrush, brow brush, clean mascara wand; Q-tip will also do in a pinch). Shake off water and air dry.    Hint: for a serious business false lashes look, start with a good primer (I recommend Ardell Lash &amp; Brow Growth Accelerator) and layer LashBlast Fusion or L&#x27;Extreme on top. This comb is essential for that wide-eyed, clean-eyed, doll quality.</li>
            <li> Works great, I like that you can fold it for travel</li>
            <li> This little folding eyelash comb works very well to separate lashes, but it&#x27;s easy to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Some of the eyelash combs I&#x27;ve seen before have teeth too big but these are thin and get between every eyelash.</li>
            <li> The teeth on this comb are literally sharp like needles. I have returned the item as I was terrified to put it close to my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I first received this eyelash comb, I loved it. It does an amazing job separating the lashes and taking out clumps. The teeth, as indicated by other reviewers, are very sharp; this sharpness is what makes this comb so effective. However, on my first attempt to clean the brush (using a pulling motion) some of the teeth fell out! I didn&#x27;t think much of it so I just slipped the teeth back in place and used it as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this comb for little over a year now and it&#x27;s completely fallen apart. The plastic on this comb is very flimsy and prone to breaking. The comb head broke away from the handle and the teeth are falling out here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Real Techniques Lash/Brow Groomer as a replacement and although it is sturdier than this lash comb, it is not as effective at separating and de-clumping my lashes. The teeth on that comb are more dull and I have to work a lot harder to comb through my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great at separating lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Travel-friendly/Compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Flimsy plastic; prone to breaking&lt;br /&gt;- Teeth will fall out</li>
            <li> This works much better than the plastic eyelash combs.  I feel like it actually separates my lashes and it is small and easy to clean after to use.  I am very impressed with this item so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the fact that it folds up, so you can throw it in your make up bag and it&#x27;s always fresh and free of fuzz and debris when you need it.</li>
            <li> This eyelash comb works awesomely! Just don&#x27;t get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> The comb is made of actual pin tips. It is the best lash comb you will come across. Just be careful with it since it is actual pin tips because you could do some serious damamge to your eye and/or eyelid with it. You can easily take the lashcomb and stick all of the points under your skin on your finger for example, just like with a saftey pin or other pin. It is super sharp. The lashcomb itself is sturdy and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> I travel at least twice a month, so i keep nearly doubles or travel sizes of all my beauty routine essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this eyelash comb in my travel bag so I don&#x27;t use it every day. But when I do use it, it works great! I hold it by the area where the comb folds into, not by the end. It gives me more stability so I don&#x27;t accidentally stab myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folding mechanism is a little flimsy but it still works well. I love that it folds into itself making it even smaller for travel (always a plus!); and it keeps the metal tips safe from puncturing other items in my bag, and dust/other items from damaging the metal tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little product for travel, and really for regular home use as well.</li>
            <li> How have I lived all these years and not known about eyelash combs?  A couple of weeks ago, I watched a video about how to create \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; eyes.  Yeah, I see those eyes rolling.  At any rate, the only thing that I got out of the video, beside the fact that the make-up artist was nuts, was discovering the concept of eyelash combs.  Ironically, I had been looking for something other than the cheesy little eyelash brush that comes with makeup kits.  Long story short, I went online searching for eyelash brushes--obviously my local drug stores have nothing that comes close to this.  I ordered two different combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this eyelash comb, hereafter referred to as comb.  I haven&#x27;t even opened the other comb.  This folding comb fits nicely into the makeup kit that lives in my purse.  It seems sturdy enough--I often end up putting on my eye makeup either sitting at my desk (before my work day begins), or, if I miss the early bus, in my car.  For that reason, I probably treat the comb a little rougher than most women.  I&#x27;m in a hurry.  I love having this comb in my makeup arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, can someone explain to me why I should put on eye shadow, then buff it in and follow it with three more layers of eye shadow, in the same color, layered and buffed onto my eye lid?  Does that really produce luminous eyes?  And what are luminous eyes anyway?</li>
            <li> Love this comb. I was a bit worried since other people said it was too sharp/dangerous to use, but as long as your careful (and you&#x27;re working on your eyes, so why wouldn&#x27;t you be?) they&#x27;re great! It easily removes all the gunky bits left by mascara and it super easy to clean. I just run it under water &amp; then wipe it with a washcloth. The little metal comb part is removable which makes it even easier. Anyway, totally recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This tool is a regular part of my makeup regimen because I have wavy lashes that don&#x27;t stay straight and separated when I put on mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands that just didn&#x27;t work right, but the Tweezerman is perfect for separating lashes because of the sharp, metal teeth and can glide through clumps.  But be careful because it can hurt if your hand slips!</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 1 1/2 years ago. The comb is made of metal and can be pulled out to clean. I pull it out about once a month and rub a q-tip soaked in eye makeup remover up and down the comb to remove the mascara from between the metal. Then I wash with soap and pop it back in the clear plastic and air dry. It is very sturdy and the metal comb spikes have not bent or rusted. It works just as well as it did the first day. Usually I had to replace my lash comb 1-2 times a year with other brands I&#x27;d used in the past but with this one I haven&#x27;t had to. I would recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Ladies, please pass on this product.  If you must use it, be very, very careful.  I had a similar eyelash comb and used it for many years, but poked myself in the eye with the sharp metal comb 2 months ago.  Caused deep scratches to my cornea.  Very painful and required 8 eye doctor visits, eye drops 4 times a day for 2 months, and a painful procedure as well.  Now I have to use an ointment every night for months so the healed area won&#x27;t stick to my eyelid.  Use a type of mascara brush that doesn&#x27;t leave a blob of mascara on your lashes.  I threw mine away and will never use one again.  Reminds me of the Christmas Story movie quote, &#x27;You&#x27;ll shoot your eye out&#x27;.  Or in this case, &#x27;You&#x27;ll poke your eye out&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone can not have one of these in their collection.  It makes crappy mascara look better until you can buy a kind that really works for you!  Use with care and you will love it!!</li>
            <li> I have owned five of these eyelash combs and I love them. They do a great job of separating eyelashes...gone are the clumps and each lash is free to flutter. However, why have I owned five? Because the suckers break! First the pins fall out, which can be reset and secured with super glue, then the case breaks...super glue again. I always stored the comb in the super organized makeup drawer in my bathroom, banging around in a makeup bag or purse was not an issue. I have found super glue extends the life by a few months. At first I thought my cleaning method was faulty (the manufacturer says to clean it with alcohol). After acquiring my third comb, I soaked two cotton balls in alcohol and set one on each side of the teeth for several minutes and squeezed the balls together...no wiping, and still the pins fell out). I remain a fan of the concept because serious eyelash combs are much better than a needle for separating mascaraed lashes, but this time I will try a different brand. As others have noted, you can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This comb works well for using between coats of mascara. Separates lashes really well. There are, however, a few major cons:    - hard to clean and must be cleaned often  - dangerous - I stabbed myself accidentally    Overall it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re going for a perfect look and have the time to do so, but when you&#x27;re in a rush the plastic combs are probably better.</li>
            <li> A vital part of doing my make up.  Couldn&#x27;t stand to not have it.</li>
            <li> I was beyond frustrated with your typical plastic lash comb. The ones that were thin enough to separate your lashes broke teeth off constantly, and the ones that were sturdier weren&#x27;t thin enough to comb through the lashes. This thing is amazing! Sturdy, sharp teeth, easy to clean, folds up for safe-keeping. Having gone through plastic eyelash combs every few months, I&#x27;m ecstatic to say I&#x27;ve been with this little guy for 4 years!</li>
            <li> Perfect product. It is easy to clean mascara off and folds to protect the pins. I thought it might be awkward to hold but it isn&#x27;t. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have been through so many plastic eyelash combs, both cheaper versions and the more upscale. This is the ONLY tool that truly separates my thinning lashes effectively, getting in between each lash.  Yes, you need to be careful, as then ends are sharp, but even my teenagers are able to use this without incident and they all love it as well.  This comb&#x27;s metal teeth aren&#x27;t likely to break like so many plastic ones I&#x27;ve had. To us, it&#x27;s the perfect tool!</li>
            <li> This is hands-down my favorite beauty tool. I would forego mascara rather than wear it without using this comb. It separates clumpy mascara-ed eyelashes perfectly with it&#x27;s tiny teeth. As stated before, the teeth are pretty sharp, but I think that&#x27;s part of why it works so well. Also, the metal teeth are much sturdier and MUCH more effective than any plastic combs I&#x27;ve ever seen. Definitely the best beauty tool in my make-up bag!</li>
            <li> This item was received on time and it is absolutely wonderful!  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite eyelash comb! I had my last one for over 12 years and the only I am buying another is my daughter took it. The Tweezerman eyelash comb has a fine metal comb that separates eyelashes easily (be sure you don&#x27;t poke your eye - it hurts). Most others have a wide-tooth comb that simply do not work, so why bother. The only downside I can see with this comb is it does not have the eyebrow brush...not a deal killer for me.</li>
            <li> It did separate lashes nicely and combed out extra mascara as promised.  Tweezerman website says not to use eye make up remover to clean it but to dab  it with alcohol, which I did.  The plastic holding the comb broke in less than a week!  Only used it about 4 times.  I would not recommend it  :(</li>
            <li> I needed a simple little comb to brush out those tedious clumps from mascara, and this worked perfectly! Its got very pointy little brissles and they seperate my eyes lashes perfectly. Its pretty easy to clean, i just used a baby wipe and was gentle with it and i like it. Its also small and compact so i can take it anywhere and you can fold in and keep the brissles safe, so all in all.. its worth it!</li>
            <li> It is high quality and I like the metal comb part.  It does a better job of separating my lashes than do combs with plastic tines.  Unfortunately, it tends to bend or fold as I am trying to use it.  This makes it difficult to use.  I will purchase a different style of eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> I prefer a brush...this is a bit harsh on my extensions.</li>
            <li> This metal comb is so much better then the plastic crappy combs that you can buy.  It is much easier to get into the lashes and separate them.  I really like this makeup tool.</li>
            <li> Safe,easy to use and effective. I see some women using PINS and wow, as a doctor I can sure recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;drkimsagewellsolutions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of eyelash curlers, or mascara in general. It clumps on my lashes and usually I just use a tissue to gently wipe my lashes to take off excess. But what a waste of product, and a huge risk for smudges. I ordered this little tool and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Curlers make my lashes look shorter by bending them, but this tool lengthens them while actually straightening them, making them look defined and longer, and also taking away the clumps! You could definitely poke your eye, but if you have relatively good hand control and take your time, it&#x27;s not too likely. I love this tool; it&#x27;s become an absolute makeup essential for me!</li>
            <li> For the price, I would have expected more uses other than just for lashes, but it does fold up nicely for care-taking and quality. It&#x27;s a very durable plastic and the prongs are nicely spaced. A little sharp, so just pay attention when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> Best one on the market. Metal needles are the only way to go. Won&#x27;t break like the cheapie plastic combs.</li>
            <li> This is a great lash comb, but be advised: the teeth of the comb are SHARP.  The sharpness of the teeth means the comb works very well for breaking up clumps in mascara, but you have to be very careful while using it.  It requires quite a bit of maintenance (I wash it every time I use it to keep it running smoothly through my lashes), but that&#x27;s basically standard with lash combs.</li>
            <li> Separate my eyelashes like no other!!!! Love love love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I&#x27;m on my second one only because I lost the first. Yes it&#x27;s sharp and you have to be careful - that the metal tines are so fine and sharp is what makes it work so well. Because it folds it stays clean and the tines don&#x27;t break. I have no problem cleaning mine - I take a cotton round, put my favorite eye makeup remover on it and give it a wipe and never had a problem with the teeth pulling out or the case cracking. Then I give it a rinse and let it air dry. My one and only complaint is that after awhile the hinge on both of mine loosened and now it&#x27;s awkward to use so I&#x27;ll be treating myself to a new one. For the many years I&#x27;ve had it certainly got my money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li> Bought for myself and ended up buying more for my daughters. Much better than the toothbrush I used to use, LOL!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need. AND it fold up so it is protected and fits in my makeup bag. Fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is alright. It works. It looks and feels very cheaply made. Guess you get what you pay for. It works so that is what I needed it to do. Thank you for a quick arrival.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok. I do like that it folds down compact and would travel well. The only problem is, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference with my lashes when I use it. I was hoping it would separate my lashes more than it does. You need to use it right away while the mascara is still wet too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many eyelash combs through the years, and this model has the best length teeth with the right width in-between the teeth. Yes, you must be careful about pulling too hard as the teeth can be removed---I have had this same model in the past. I bought two combs for just this reason, it is easy to replace the teeth that fall out: remove a tooth from one comb with tweezers, then place it in the emplty hole, unless you are lucky enough to find where the tooth fell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...it is easier not to pull the teeth too hard when they are wet with mascara, just lightly rub the teeth against a tissue, better if the tissue has some alcohol on it. I wash them once a week with a soft tooth brush wet with shampoo and baking soda. Rub gently with the brush, pat dry and set out on a towel to dry completely. Great purchase. These were impossible to find in any drugstores, or the Walmart, K-mart, Target type stores, so I was thrilled to find them here. Never ever bother with plastic combs, waste of time and money, much too thick to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT use them on dry lashes, all they will do is pull out your lashes. I put on several coats of mascara, and comb and kind of wiggle the comb through the wet lashes to evenly spread the mascara and remove clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that impressed.  I was excited to get these because I thought it would be a great alternative to the safety pin I have used since puberty to separate my eyelashes.  I tried these several times after applying mascara and they just didn&#x27;t do that great of a job at separating my lashes.  I ended up going back to my trusty safety pin.  I do like the size and the fact that they fold up to protect the teeth.  Product was in excellent condition and packaging was excellent.  Nothing works like my safety pin.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WILL LAST A LOT LONGER THAN THE CHEAP PLASTIC, PRODUCTS SOLD FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.THIS IS A GOOD BRAND....</li>
            <li> Love this.  If you are purchasing an eyelash comb, you need to make sure it has thin metal teeth.  This one works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Tweeter an products are far superior!</li>
            <li> The metal comb works so much better than the plastic ones.  I like it so much I have purchased for friends who couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> Separates all of your lashes in just a few seconds. I used to do it with a needle, and it took forever. Now I do it with 20 needles at the same time - swoosh, and I got perfectly separated lashes. Careful thought - it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> Hard to use!  Metal dangerous!</li>
            <li> Why anyone is walking around with clumpy eyelashes is beyond me with products like this one available. The metal teeth work great to separate lashes clumped together by mascara. Similar products I have used left the metal exposed and could stick you when you go for something else in your makeup bag. The Tweezerman Folding Eyelash Comb fixes this by providing a folding option to protect you from pokes and while protecting the metal teeth from breaking.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty item I own. Works beautifully to separate my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelash comb.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I am blessed with great lashes.  Mascara accentuates them but sometimes \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; lashes together.  I used the Tweezeman comb with different mascara brands to separate when needed and found that this one is much better&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002UXRD32 JAPONESQUE Travel Brow/Lash Comb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Small when folded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The metal tips on the comb are VERY sharp (possibly dangerous near the eye)&lt;br /&gt;Tines are too far apart - lashes often get clumped together after combing</li>
            <li> If you value your eyeballs, don&#x27;t buy this thing. If you value the appearance of your eyelashes, buy this thing. Just don&#x27;t drink and expect to use this while keeping your eyeballs in place.</li>
            <li> I love this little eyelash comb. No matter what brand of mascara I use, and believe me, I have dozens, my lashes always look clumpy. This works great at removing the clumps. BE CAREFUL though, as this thing is SHARP. Of course it has to be that way to work properly, just something to remember when using, so use it very gently. Use it immediately after putting on mascara so your lashes or wet and you aren&#x27;t pulling on them. Folds up small, and was just a little difficult to get clean. Maybe soaking it would work better; I used a bit of soap and a Q-tip to rub back and forth to remove the mascara and there was still a bit left. Price is very reasonable for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This comb does a great job of separating mascaraed lashes.  Be very careful, though, as the teeth are extremely sharp - like needles.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful for separatng lashes after mascara application.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without one of these.  This one is much better quality than the one I had previously.</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for an eyelash comb that will last- one without plastic teeth and I found it here! I love that it folds up so that I don&#x27;t poke myself on it when digging through my cosmetic bag. I would highly recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> I had a eyelash comb a long time ago and I lost the teeth part, so I qui wearing mascara, but now I found another one and I absolutely love it! Seperates lashes and makes them look full and lush!</li>
            <li> Brushes out the clumps and folds away so the comb doesn&#x27;t get stuck on other items in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought an eyelash comb would make my lashes look stunning. I can&#x27;t see the difference i nthem when I use the comb.</li>
            <li> The worlds BEST eyelash comb hands down!!! Teeny Tiny comb points get in-between those lashes and de-clump mascara like a pro! Seriously I&#x27;ve tried them all.... LOOK NO FARTHER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. be careful the tips are sharp!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! Separates lashes, cleans easily, stores conveniently. I use it between coats of my 3d fiber lash mascara. No clumps. Do be careful though, it is very sharp!</li>
            <li> This lash brush works well at separating eyelashes but the teeth are really sharp.  I use it with extreme caution on my lashes but not my brows.  I spiral brush works better on my brows and I do not feel like I am scraping my skin</li>
            <li> Better than the plastic mascara combs, the metal spike really separate lashes if you hate the &#x27;spider lash&#x27; look. The metal part does pop out after cleaning, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it since it&#x27;s easy to fit back in and fold up again.</li>
            <li> Tis is a very good eye makeup product.  It works well. But...the user must be very  careful as the comb  is some kind of metal and very sharp.</li>
            <li> This is my second eyelash comb in 20 yrs. The first one was a Kurlash, I bought it in 1995 and it finally gave out just a couple of weeks ago. I didn&#x27;t think anything could replace it. But out of necessity I decided to give the Tweezerman Folding Eyelash Comb a try and I&#x27;m very happy that I did. It&#x27;s handle is the perfect length for holding comfortably and it&#x27;s teeth are very strong and sharp, so be careful if this is your first time using an eyelash comb. The comb&#x27;s teeth pull out for cleaning and fold down and into the handle perfectly. The only little thing that could make this comb any better is if it came in different colors. I always have to hunt for it in my makeup box.</li>
            <li> While the product is effective, its not very safe. I&#x27;ve poked my eye with it and object is very sharp  and made of metal. I threw it out. There is no way to judge how far the pins at the end come thus leaving you in a possibly dangerous situation. I&#x27;ll stick with the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> This comb works great! the easiest way to clean it is with a \\&quot;spoolie\\&quot; brush and soap. Wet the comb, let it sit for a minute to soften the mascara, then wipe it with the spoolie brush and rinse. Very fast and gets it perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> I have two requirements in an eyelash comb: separate individual lashes and don&#x27;t break!  This one satisfies both.  The teeth are actually pointed, so they separate better than any other comb I&#x27;ve used, it cleans easily (unlike most others), and so far none of the teeth have broken off, probably because they&#x27;re actually metal and not the flimsy plastic that most combs use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tool for years.  I know some girls use pins and needles to get rid of their mascara clumps, but I value my eyesight too much to do that.  These combs last a long time, and I only bought this one because my last one was missing a few teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the eyelash comb. It&#x27;s just what I wanted and it arrived quickly. Best price too.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the cheap plastic ones.  This is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of using a needle to separate lashes, but I&#x27;m usually in too much of a rush to have enough control to not poke my eye out. I&#x27;m glad I found this; it really helps to separate the lashes and de-clump them after applying mascara. The comb IS needle sharp so do be careful when using it. I like how it folds to keep dust out, but keep in mind it doesn’t snap into place so it will try to close when using it but it&#x27;s not that bad of a problem. Being small and flat it takes up virtually no space making it great for travel. I believe this to be a must have.</li>
            <li> i thought this was a little expensive at first but it is absolutely worth the money. much better than using a comb with plastic prongs. I love also that it folds in so i don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking any of the teeth! love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much I needed this until I had it. A metal eyelash comb is miles better than a plastic one. Plus it folds for storage to protect the comb.</li>
            <li> I love the way the fine teeth of the comb separate lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It is so much better than the plastic combs.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of every single clump!  Just be careful as this thing is not joking around: it&#x27;s got sharp, metal pin like teeth.  I lost mine a decade ago and I&#x27;m glad I repurchased!  Best lash comb ever!</li>
            <li> Just as described, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I have very long and unruly lashes, they criss cross and are all over the place, putting on mascara was such a hassle, until this little baby came into my life, this and smashbox mascara primer has whipped my lashes into straight little soldiers LoL!! but be very careful, it&#x27;s no fun to poke yourself with those sharp little teeth!!</li>
            <li> Works great until the combs start falling out.... I&#x27;m working with a quarter of a comb at this point.&lt;br /&gt;Great tool... Just want it to hold up.</li>
            <li> Works well, separates lashes nicely.  I like that it&#x27;s metal ~ not the plastic combs that really didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I like that this comb retracts into itself.  Been using it for almost 20 years.  That being said,maybe I need to find a new mascara if I&#x27;m having such a hard time with clumping.....</li>
            <li> VERY HANDY ITEM WORKS GREAT...SHAARP!! WOULD BUY SGIN!</li>
            <li> Perfect for combing through my mascara.  I despise clumpy mascara and this is the perfect solution.  I was worried that it would mess up my mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> An eyelash comb is a must have for all women. I bought this eyelash comb after my sister highly encouraged me to buy one; I saw an immediate difference in my eyelashes after one use. Be very careful when using it, because the comb is actually wire and you do not want to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> I like finding inexpensive and effective products, this is no exception.  My only problem is I find this to be unsafe, I stabbed my eye by accident ...it is very easy to do, even if you use it slowly and are careful. When the time comes for a new lash comb, I&#x27;ll be looking for a plastic one with more blunt ends.</li>
            <li> I absolutly LOVE this eyelash comb. I&#x27;m on my second one, and my first lasted forever. You do have to be careful not to poke yourself in the eye, the teeth are sharp, but they do a great job of eliminating clumps. I recommend wiping an mascara residue off before using each time, otherwise it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very fine comb that can separate even the densest lashes with all types of mascara.  The very fine tips can separate anything, unlike any plastic combs.  They are also sharp, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Blinc tubing mascara to separate lashes after primer coat is dry, and immediately apply the mascara coat, then comb any stuck lashes before they dry.  I think Blinc should offer this comb with their products. This eyelash comb is the best!!!  I also do a ton of water based sports &amp; use this to separate the hardcore waterproof mascara also, but this time use after each coat is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love long lashes that aren&#x27;t stuck together and this is my answer!  I only apply mascara once at home, but think if I travelled with it I would probably put a small rubber band around the end ot hold it closed.  Simple solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great value, indispensable!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped it super fast.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this!! asian eyelashes...short and stubby. combs straight through it and evens out mascara so it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best eyelash comb ever! So easy to use! You have to be careful because the teeth are pretty sharp but they really do the job!</li>
            <li> It does the job. Is well made. I am a little leary of the metal combs that was mentioned in previous reviews, just trying to be careful.</li>
            <li> I guess I really wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly when I ordered this product.  I / you would be CRAZY to use this as intended or any where else on your body!  Perhaps you can use it for a craft project if you&#x27;re really careful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful eyelash comb--easily combs through any clumps.  You do have to use caution when picking it up or cleaning it, as it is sharp.  But it does the job better than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This comb is pretty good. It works better than a safety pin. You can comb from the top down and curl upwards for extra lash lift.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash comb. It gets in between every lash. Its kind of sharp so be careful. Another great tool from tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very durable.</li>
            <li> These items are the best!!! Great for making sure mascara does not clump.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  When I used it, it literally removed nearly all my mascara.  Maybe I need a new brand of mascara but I was using Estee Lauder and maybe I need to use a mascara that dries slower.  Not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> Greatest invention ever! lol</li>
            <li> This tool is no joke.  It separates lashes well, but you could actually poke poke your eye out if you&#x27;re not very careful.  Very sharp!  Definitely take your time, not like with the cheap plastic versions.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not long, and easy to stick together after i applied mascara. This tool is tiny but very easy to use, great for me to comb after using mascara.</li>
            <li> I love these. They separate amazingly. And yes, they are sharp. Be careful. This is my third pair I&#x27;ve purchased. I bought two other for friends</li>
            <li> If you are careful with the sharp, pointy teeth, this does the job and separates eyelashes well. Unfortunately, when I gently wiped it with an eye-makeup remover pad, some teeth fell out, rendering it useless. Scared me to have loose metal pins near my eyes, so I stopped using it. I contacted Tweezerman directly about the problem and never received a response. I am very disappointed with the Tweezerman company and do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else.  It does the job perfectly and leaves my eyelashes looking great, no clumps of mascara.  I agree with other reviews that it&#x27;s sharp, so use it carefully. It folds up neatly, no sharp edges are left exposed.  This is a great product!  I may order another just to have in reserve.</li>
            <li> Had one several years ago and threw it out because it was broken.  Then went some more years without it, thinking some mascara was going to not include clumps. Ladies, we all know through the gazillion tubes of mascara, whether high end or drugstore, there isn&#x27;t a magical mascara that is going to do everything we need.&lt;br /&gt;I have Asian sparse, straight lashes and preferred a volume waterproof mascara like Covergirl Lashblast. (Believe me, I have tried many and found this is something that works and it can be replaced every 3-4 months) It is dark black, coats like a gel, gives me volume after 2 coats, build-able, and holds a curl.  However, it clumps.&lt;br /&gt;I use my Shu-uemura eyelash curler, CG Lashblast, and this comb and had made a world of difference.  I&#x27;m sticking with this beauty regime for now!!&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I did place it at the bottom of my makeup case and it cracked.  Still usable, but would suggest to put it in a travel brush kit to protect it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lash comb/separator I have ever used. I have a few of them being I lose them easily lol</li>
            <li> Able to rake thru the thickest of mascara to leave clump free &amp; separated. Very happy with product &amp; would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The handle was cracked at the hinge when I received it, however being a clear plastic I figured a hairline crack would not be an issue (where I am only combing eyelashes &#x3D; no pressure will be applied) however after a few (maybe 3) uses, the complete row of teeth fell out, as one piece, &amp; the piece ultimately broke off at the hairline crack...I used Superglue to fix it &amp; now does not fold to close at the the hinge (I figured since I threw away the packaging, I may try to &amp;#34;save it&amp;#34; with good &#x27;ol superglue -as duck tape is not a quick fix in this particular situation ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try &amp; return this item thru amazon....hoping for some good CSR experience here...I never returned anything with them before...</li>
            <li> I use this instead of a brush to put on mascara as suggested from a make-up artist friend.  I take the mascara brush from the tube and apply the mascara to the teeth of the comb.  Then I comb the eyelashes.  This is the way to have natural looking dark eyelashes without the clumps!  Curl first then comb and you have perfectly flirty natural eyelashes.  The teeth of the comb are sharp so be careful not to poke yourself.  I love that it folds down to keep the teeth from breaking and bending.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s a Tweezerman so solidly (is that a word) made.  Just be careful not to poke yourself in the eye!</li>
            <li> Works fine if you have a fairly steady hand (teeth in lash comb are sharp as pins), however, when you try to wipe it clean, the little teeth come right out, leaving bare patches in the com but worse, leaving little headless pins scattered round for you to poke yourself or someone else. Found one this morning with my foot! No matter how gently I clean it this happens. Is mine defective perhaps? Maybe they forgot the glue.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing clumps and excess mascara.  Be careful, though, the teeth are very sharp!</li>
            <li> I really like the strong metal tongs on this. It gets through the mascara and easy to clean. Tje plastic part that ypu hold could be stronger though.</li>
            <li> Perfectly travel sized. The only down side is that it&#x27;s so small that I lost it, but I can&#x27;t blame the product. This product is one of the BEST I have used. I&#x27;ll never go back to cheapie plastic combs again!</li>
            <li> This eyelash comb didn&#x27;t perform miracles on my eyelashes (probably should not have been expecting it to) but it does get rid of major clumps and separates your lashes decently enough. I haven&#x27;t had problems with the teeth falling out when cleaning them. They are sharp, so just be careful. I especially like how it folds for protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup to my other Tweezerman Folding Eyelash Comb, just in case I lose it or it breaks!  This comb removes all clumps my mascara may leave behind, and separates my lashes beautifully.  Would recommend to the mascara lovers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LiLash, and my eyelashes are so much longer.  I was having trouble keeping them separated when I put on my liquid eyeliner.  This comb works like a charm.  Yes, I have stabbed myself with it, but it took only once for me to get a clue and adjust accordingly!  ha  I wash and dry it (with my hair dryer) after (ok, almost) every use, and it is holding up well.  No rust, nothing is broken, and all teeth are accounted for.</li>
            <li> This comb is nice and very handy, but when I was cleaning it, the metal bristle part popped off the comb. It popped right back on, but I took a star off - I feel like this should have been priced more reasonably since it is made kind of cheaply.</li>
            <li> It works. No more clumpy lashes. And it has a little protector that goes over the comb to keep makeup-box junk out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Very fine teeth to separate lashes. I use after curling and after mascara application before it sets. Seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> If you want to get the most out of your mascara these will work perfectly for you.  You can add layer upon layer of mascara and comb them out between each layer and your lashes will be super thick and won&#x27;t look like fuzzy spider legs.  You do have to be careful at the base of your lid with these because the needles/fingers are very sharp, but that is necessary for precision and beauty.  I have to keep buying these because friends keep stealing them.</li>
            <li> I like this. I would buy it again. Helps to separate my lashes.</li>
            <li> This eyelash comb is the only product that actually breaks the clumps apart, so in this respect I love it! No more Tammy Faye eyes. But please please be careful. The end of the comb is essentially a bunch of needles. I try not to use this comb when my four year old daughter is anywhere near me.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I ended up purchasing this one. It is very well made and yes, as many reviewers have noted, it IS sharp, but that is the point! It needs to be. Also, just an added tip: I actually use the comb to apply the mascara. I rub the comb against the mascara wand first and then apply the mascara with the comb. Wow! Really makes a huge difference! And no clumps on the first application because you are using this amazing comb which keeps the lashes separate.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheaper versions, this has metal teeth and folds into the handle to protect them.  There&#x27;s nothing more annoying than spending the time to put on primer and mascara, only to find several lashes clumped together.  This little gem combs right through those lashes and separates them.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I have been looking for one of these for awhile now and I could not find them in the stores.  This combs my eyelashes beautifully.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> This is a strong, sturdy product. It folds into itself to keep it protected and this makes it perfect for make up bags. Im sure ill have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my second one from Tweezerman and the only reason why I had to replace my first one was because some of the needles were loose and falling off. I bought my 1st one in 2001 and it lasted me for a solid 11 years before I finally gave in and decided to replace it. I know the needles are sharp but since it&#x27;s so fine-toothed, it really does help separate my lashes and remove excess clumpy mascara. Cleaning it was very easy - I usually just wipe off the masacara from the comb with tissue paper but just be careful not to wipe or tug too hard as this was the eventual cause of the needles coming off. This brand is very longlasting - I&#x27;ve had my tweezer from Tweezerman also for as many years and it&#x27;s still holding up to this day. Would definitely buy again and only this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Folds up small for travel, and the metal &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are fine to separate each eyelash.  Affordable  and I think it will provide a long life of use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but for sure you had best take caution when you use it. it would put an eye out if you did not take your time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The metal comb REALLY separates your lashes. It is perfect for removing clumps from mascara and gives extra definition to your lashes making them look much fuller.</li>
            <li> effective, but the clear thin stem looks like it&#x27;s easy to break.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyelash comb!  The teeth are very sharp (unlike any plastic eyelash comb&#x27;s which are too thick to divide clumped lashes) which allows them to easily divide lashes that have become clumped with mascara.  Therefore, you can have many coats of clump-free mascara!  It is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY way you are supposed to clean this eyelash comb is by using an eyebrow brush and brush outward towards the sharp tips.  I have never needed to, but if you can&#x27;t get off all of the mascara that way, you could apply mascara remover to the eyebrow brush and then use it on the comb.  Never use a tissue because you can pull out the teeth.  This has nothing to do with the quality of the comb…I have a more expensive eyelash comb with sharp metal teeth that can also come out after cleaning them with a tissue.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful when using it. If you get too close to the eyelid at the lash line it hurts.</li>
            <li> Does its job - helps me easily remove clumps in my mascara and separate my lashes. Just don&#x27;t stab your eye.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  It makes my eyelashes look beautiful, long, and plentiful; no more clumpy lashes for this Betty!</li>
            <li> I love this! separates every single lash!</li>
            <li> This is about my 100th of these!  The best of its kind, but they do wear out.  Last a good while though.</li>
            <li> to really get the clumps out, and make your lashes look natural (if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for), this comb with the metal teeth is an absolute MUST! Apply mascara, comb while wet, wait for it to dry, then add another coat, comb while wet (again), and voila! Thick, perfect lashes. Those metal teeth *are* dangerous, but they are the only way to achieve this look! Plastic teeth combs do not cut it.</li>
            <li> need to be careful not to slip while using it, ouch in the eye</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product works really well for separating eye lashes after you have applied mascara.  After using it, it helps to rub it sideways on an old washcloth to clean it before it dries on.  Also, the ends are very sharp (which makes it work so well), so be VERY careful not to poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll poke my eye out! The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are crazy sharp.  I do not like this product, and would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time today, and it works like a charm. I find it works better if you use it after the first coat has dried.The teeth are very fine and work great to separate your lashes and remove excess mascara.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how durable it is after a few months of use, but for now this is a 5 star winner!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this thing</li>
            <li> When I can be bothered to wear makeup, I tend to pile on layers and layers of mascara because I like the false-eyelashes look without the trouble of gluing them on, and unsurprisingly, this leads to a lot of clumps.  This eyelash comb is a lifesaver.  This is the only eyelash comb I could ever recommend because the ones with plastic teeth are worthless, and other combs with metal tines (the only effective kind) have caps for the tines that fall off and get lost in your makeup bag, so the tines get bent or spread gross leftover mascara everywhere. This handy-dandy comb avoids all that by folding into itself.  It is also probably a lot safer than the safety pins I was previously using to declump my lashes.  Although its smaller size and the fact that it&#x27;s clear make it a little easier to misplace in your makeup bag, I find that since it&#x27;s smaller and not like mounted on a stick, it&#x27;s easier to use.  So if you&#x27;re like me and you go through more mascara than Tammy Faye Bakker (or even if you don&#x27;t, because it will work great for you too), just throw out all your stupid plastic-tined combs or safety pins or whatever and just buy this because you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> This is very sharp but it&#x27;s also the greatest eyelash separator in the world.  I get compliments constantly on my perfect eyelashes.  It makes any mascara look fantastic.  Seriously,  what are you waiting for?  Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Wish I had had one of these years ago. What a nifty gadget getting all the clumps out of mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash comb. It works perfectly for de-clumping my mascara. It is also very easy to clean. You can&#x27;t be in a rush when using this; however, because you can stab yourself in the eye. It&#x27;s very sharp, but if it weren&#x27;t, it wouldn&#x27;t work as well. I have spent tons of money looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump (they all do despite the claims) when all I really needed was this eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for separating eyelashes after mascara has dried.</li>
            <li> this is the by far the best eyelash comb i have ever used!  it&#x27;s very sharp though so me careful!</li>
            <li> I love this comb! I&#x27;ve always had problems with previous lash combs because they&#x27;d have plastic on either end of the actual comb, which made it harder for me to separate my lashed. I&#x27;ve actually purchased 2 of these combs because I broke the 1st one being very hard on the teeth. Then I also got one as a stocking stuffer. Best comb out there and I&#x27;ve used several!</li>
            <li> Perfect for combing through any clumps after applying mascara. Just be careful, it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> A little too expensive for the quality of the product. The plastic is very flimsy and cheap and if you aren&#x27;t careful, will snap easily. The teeth are definitely sharp and work fairly well on eyelashes, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I cant seem to be without one of these. I buy only this brand as it seems to be the one that holds up the best. My only gripe is the price. They have really skyrocketed over the years but I use the heck out of this so I will pay what is asked. I hope this one lasts as long as the rest. These make great gifts too! The only reason I give it four stars is due to the price.</li>
