            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for this product.</li>

            <li>I have long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It had my hair baby soft, it also made it easy to detangle as well and the softness lasted at least a whole week or longer, I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for softer more manageble hair, but note that I didn&#x27;t purchase this off of amazon</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a intense moisture and repair treatment for your hair.</li>
            <li>When I first decided to go natural</li>
            <li>It felt soft at first</li>
            <li>I lightly wash it out &amp; blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>but this may become a new go to.</li>
            <li>Every year I try something new for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I over heard two sales associates talking about this new product and figured I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how it may transform my natural locks!</li>
            <li>The Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque really works.</li>

            <li>I am natural and my hair has never been so moisturized and shiny.</li>
            <li>I left it on the whole day then washed it out at night in the shower.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and my hair is so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I flat iron my hair and wear it straight..</li>
            <li>My hair hair a few textures, but mostly 3c, and 3b and a few straight areas as well.</li>

            <li> Put it on my hair after shampooing and left on for almost an hour.  Helped soften my hair and was great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my hair so shiny, super straight and silky to the touch. It takes half the time to blow dry my hair when use this product. I want to order the daily conditioner too. I recommended  this to a Co worker.</li>
            <li> Makes my relaxed hair super soft,but not for me didn&#x27;t stop breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s rich and luxurious and smells great. I love the way it makes my hair feel and look. I have long hair that tangles easily. The Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque really works. And that&#x27;s saying a lot for me. it&#x27;s thick and rich and I just can&#x27;t say enough about it. It detangles without causing breakage. Great Stuff!!!  I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for this product.</li>
            <li> absolutely excellent product, smells great and my damaged, curly, dyed and highlighted hair feels extremely soft right out of the shower. I literally try everything but this may become a new go to.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that needs moisture often. The first time I used this I fell in love. It gives so much slip to my curls when detangling. It also leaves my hair so soft and manageable. If you want your hair to be soft after only one use, this item is for you.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for all my curls life</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soooo soft and silky. Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!  The mask leaves your hair shiny, beautiful and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Every year I try something new for my hair.  Well, it was great and I am in need for more.</li>
            <li> Good and leaves the hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> I first tried this product while employed at Sally Beauty Supply. I have naturally curly hair around a 3C pattern...Sometimes I flat iron my hair and wear it straight..when I wash it from being straight it usually takes a few days for my natural curls to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; back into life..however, after my first usage of this Masque my hair begins curling so beautifully while I have the stuff in my hair! I love it so much it only takes a little even though my hair is thick this conditioning masque just seems to saturate all through my hair. And it leaves it soft, shiny and feels so much stronger with less breakage and smells amazing! I use it once or  twice a week or every other week, depending on how I&#x27;m styling my hair! The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little pricey (about 12 bucks) BUT it is worth it! I really wish they would make it available in a bigger container. But this one lasted me about 6 weeks:))</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past several years, I also use the oil, which I also like.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a pre poo treatment too, i never follow the instructions so I left this in my hair for at least an hour and when I rinsed it out It had my hair baby soft, it also made it easy to detangle as well and the softness lasted at least a whole week or longer, I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for softer more manageble hair, but note that I didn&#x27;t purchase this off of amazon, i went to my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Suppy and got for at least $12, the money was worth it</li>
            <li> THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT...JUST AFTER 2 APPLICATIONS ON THIS CONDITIONING MASK MY HAIR HAS BEEN MUCH SOFTER AND SHINY, ACTUALLY LOOKING HEALTHIER. I USE IT TWICE A WEEK IN THE SHOWER. USE JUST SMALL DAB AND WORK IT INTO HAIR FROM THE ENDS ON UP TO SCALP. RUN COMB THRU HAIR AND PROTECT HAIR WHILE SHOWERING. AFTER SHOWER IS DONE, PULL HAIR DOWN OR TK SHOWER CAP OFF AND RINSE WITH WARM WATER. USUALLY STAYS IN FOR 7-10 MINUTES. WOULDVE LOVED A STRONGER FRAGRANCE. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have used this in my hair three times already. I am amazed it smells good and as soon as I put it in my hair it is easy to manage and detangle. I am natural and my hair has never been so moisturized and shiny. It is the ONLY product that I actually purchase for my hair, the rest are hand made. People ask me do I have a perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put it in my hair for about an hour even though it says 7 mins... with a plastic cap. I lightly wash it out &amp; blow dry my hair. I have not used it with wash and go hair but I intend to try it this weekend... I got this Product from sallies &amp; it was the best purchase I have made thus far...</li>
            <li> Will follow up with a review once used...this is just to inform those who are able...Sally&#x27;s is having their BOGO on this product and several others. I picked up this, and another one, since it&#x27;s free, or $10.89 today!! Smells amazing and the texture is creamy. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it may transform my natural locks!</li>
            <li> With natural hair being all the rage, there are so many products to choose from. When I first decided to go natural ( no more relaxers) I did not know that I needed to deep condition my hair. After a lot of trial and error, I realized that I need to deep conditioning every other week. My hair hair a few textures, but mostly 3c, and 3b and a few straight areas as well. I saw this product in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply ( if you become a member for $5.00-you can get a monthly discount sent to you-you can get %15 off your entire purchase!!!!!) and saw that this item was on special. I read the packaging and noticed that it is made with some great things, and now I am hooked. If you want your hair to be soft after only one use, this item is for you.</li>
            <li> Ok well the day before i bought the product i had curled my hair, so I already had 3rd day hair. I DID NOT follow instructions. I went ahead and wet my hair a little then a applied it on the bottom of my hair. I left it on the whole day then washed it out at night in the shower. It felt soft at first but then it felt realy dry, Im gonna try it one more time by following the exact instructions.</li>
            <li> Im not the one to write reviews about any products. This is one of the best hair masks i ever used ever and i had spent a lot of money on hair product . Im obsessed with the smell and the texture of my hair its incredible so soft and did i say smells lovely. I will not dare to but another product. I also use its a perfect 10 leave in hair conditioner and my hair has been getting stronger and thicker by the weeks after all the damage i put my hair thru this is worth it !!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good! Smells nice!</li>
            <li> your hair is soo silky smooth afterwards! you will love it. I use it once a week and my hair is so soft afterwards. it is a gift to long  thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Just used this product today for the first time.  My hair has been platinum blonde and over processed for over two years.  I&#x27;m a natural dirty blonde.  Well I decided to &#x27;try&#x27; to go back to my natural hair color and failed.  I had to have corrective color repair at a salon.  She basically had to do two intensive shampoo caps to get the ashy color out.  Needless to say, even after a Keratin treatment, my hair still felt brittle. I have very fine, porous hair.  I used the shampoo and this masque and MAN OH MAN.  It has already done wonders for my hair after one use.  I can run my fingers through my hair.  It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  It already feels 100% healthier.  I&#x27;m so happy I went to Sally&#x27;s and the clerk recommended this to me.  And yes, they are by one get one now!  So hurry up and buy this product.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My hair is severly damaged from coloring and flat irons etc. I frizzy split end mess...I over heard two sales associates talking about this new product and figured I would give it a shot. I purchased this and the hair syrum and I have to give it a thumbs up. I used as directed and and I have to say how much nicer my hair looks and feels. I cant wait to try the Shampoo and conditioner now. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a intense moisture and repair treatment for your hair. A little goes a long way and I dont feel its to pricey for what it is. LOVE IT!</li>
