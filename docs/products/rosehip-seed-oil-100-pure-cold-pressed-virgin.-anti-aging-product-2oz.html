            <li>Even before using this stuff no one has ever been able to guess my Mother&#x27;s age.</li>

            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with cocunut oil and together I have a nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Use it mainly in skin moisturizer and has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use oil slightly higher than the tip of the dropper.  </li>
            <li>The estimated delivery date was like well over a month which did not make me happy, to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different companies.......</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I only received my order about 10 days ago and so far I am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully my skin will show positive results in no time.</li>
            <li>much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil really hydrates your skin and erases wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and this is very moisturizing with out being greasy.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin and absorbs well, not leaving a heavy oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Because it was my first time buying it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money because I have sensitive skin and never know how I am going to react to certain things.  </li>
            <li>My aunt gave me my first bottle after I told her how soft her skin looked.</li>
            <li>He did not recommend this particular company, but I searched it out on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Product took a little long to get to me, but overall performance is great.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Rosehip Seed Oil</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it makes your face super smooth.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face and neck really soft.  </li>
            <li>Wake up in the morning with a soft glow.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft.  </li>
            <li>The best, no more expensive moisturizers.</li>
            <li>My facial skin is also SO very soft and my complexion</li>
            <li>I have not really used the oil long enough to make any judgment on how effective it is on dark spots, lines, wrinkles,  or other skin defects.  </li>
            <li>I think it is too early to say if it has any long term effects</li>

            <li> Having dry skin...</li>
            <li> Anyway, so I went with this particular brand because it says 100% Pure Cold Pressed, Virgin, which was what Dr. Oz had recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought the product after reading about its potential to reduce the visibility of dark (age) spots and to even out variations in skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Once I picked a rose and let it touch my face, my skin and throat were itching like crazy!  </li>
            <li> I must be allergic, it causes my skin to itch and get very dry and peel.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little and I do mix it with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used the oil when I was in Korea and it little different.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for two weeks and can already see results in my dark spots as well.</li>
            <li> only complaint was that when I ordered the oil, I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from another country.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for dark circles and wrinkles, age spots on face, but don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face seemd to be at least 50% improved</li>
            <li> use a small drop along with my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Experiment, but start slow and build up, then you will find it to be dewey, not oily.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> bad reaction to this, burned badly turned red, had to throw it out</li>
            <li> Wanted rosehip seed oil that was cold pressed.  </li>

            <li> too greasy feeling....</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I love it. I have used it now for two weeks and can already see results in my dark spots as well. It just takes a little and I do mix it with my daily moisturizer.</li>

The estimated delivery date was like well over a month which did not make me happy, to say the least.  Fortunately, It only took just over a couple weeks to arrive.  Not ideal when you are use to Prime but considering the price, the dark colored bottle with dropper, and the nice oil, I&#x27;d buy it again.  I&#x27;ll just make sure I order it way before I run out!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just over a month now.  I must say that I am very impressed by the results thus far.

            <li> I&#x27;m blessed with good genes. I&#x27;m 49 and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles buy this stuff has given my skin a nice texture.  Now I have my mother using rose hip oil.  Even before using this stuff no one has ever been able to guess my Mother&#x27;s age. They are always about 20 to 25 years off.  She will be 90 in 2 months and now the texture if her skin has improved also.  I will definitely reorder this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful on my face. Wake up in the morning with a soft glow. A little bit goes a long way and it makes your face super smooth.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil really hydrates your skin and erases wrinkles.</li>

            <li> Great stuff!!!! Works on all skin ailments. Will never be without it. Use it mainly in skin moisturizer and has been fantastic. I have oily skin but doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> I oredered one and they shipped two. I used for 4 weeks and NO results at all!</li>
            <li> I only received my order about 10 days ago and so far I am very satisfied with the product.  I have not really used the oil long enough to make any judgment on how effective it is on dark spots, lines, wrinkles,  or other skin defects.  It does seem very smooth and mixes well with my moisturizer so I will continue to use and hopefully my skin will show positive results in no time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, thanks!</li>

            <li> Was super excited to try the rosehip oil, I gather my own for tea etc... but don&#x27;t know how to make the oil. I was super excited to try it... I use coconut oil and castor oil on my face as well... All three do a good job keeping my skin clear, and skin healthy looking!!! Thanks for the great oil...</li>
            <li> Love this. I have oily skin and this is very moisturizing with out being greasy. My face is so soft.  I use it night before bed.  Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hands, face, and hair all the time and I still love it. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I love this, wish I would have known about it years ago. I use it on my face morning and evening and now my hands. The best, no more expensive moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Whoa! This stuff works. My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Wanted rosehip seed oil that was cold pressed.  Product took a little long to get to me, but overall performance is great.  Seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> My aunt gave me my first bottle after I told her how soft her skin looked. While it does not erase wrinkles rose hip oil does soften the face and neck, and gives my skin a radiant glow. I use twice daily, morning and night and have had comments about how I &amp;#34; look so rested&amp;#34; and  your make up looks awesome today&amp;#34;. These comments started after only 7 days using. Best thing I have found. And the price is spot on.</li>
            <li> Smells nice .  Haven&#x27;t used it enough to say how well it works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any spectacular results with this oil and for all I know it could have been canola oil-- that&#x27;s Wat it smelled like anyway.... I think I will just stick with vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> bad reaction to this, burned badly turned red, had to throw it out</li>
            <li> I must be allergic, it causes my skin to itch and get very dry and peel. Bought it for dark circles and wrinkles, age spots on face, but don&#x27;t see any difference. Have been using for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love it!  It feels nice on the skin and absorbs well, not leaving a heavy oily feeling. I will be ordering this for life!</li>
            <li> Great, received on time,</li>
