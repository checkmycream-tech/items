            <li>Delivery was timely, packaging secure.  </li>
            <li>We used it on stage and it looked great, fit well, stayed on and was of a much better quality than I had expected.  </li>

            <li>Really well made!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I loved this wig so much, I ordered it from this Seller (Royal-Style), I received the wig that had more Brown than Black in the wig as described, the quality of the hair was good, the style of the wig is as pictured, and the length was a bit longer than the picture.</li>
            <li>Wig is also very shiney and looks more like a costume wig.</li>
            <li>Was very hot to wear.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful wig and came much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>i have done some research on wigs since ordering this one and if you want a natural looking wig, a lace front or a monofilament wig is the best way to go as far as the cap, and if you cant afford a real hair wig; modacrylic looks very much like real hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Seller for an accurate description, as well as fulfilling an order based on the accuracy of their description.</li>
            <li>I would totally order wigs from this brand again and again I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>However, communication and refund was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a wig party, and it was much (much) higher quality than I anticipated for the price.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>This wig is so real looking that my friends all thought it was my hair and that I had gotten a haircut!</li>
            <li>If you maintain this wig correctly, it can give the appearance of being observed as real hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Seller for your customer service, and a quality product.</li>
            <li>Hair keeps falling out even with gentle stroking.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned previously, I cannot speak for others, yet I believe that most women when purchasing wigs, are very selective in their choices of colors, length and style.</li>
            <li>Very soft, thick and has a nice little scalp appearance on top to make it look EXACTLY like the picture.</li>
            <li>This might be ok for a costume, but for everyday use</li>
            <li>I changed to this new Seller (Royal-Style), I received what I ordered/expected, ending my beauty enhancement journey for wigs.</li>
            <li>I tried it on to trick some people into thinking it was my new hair do</li>
            <li>The hair looks nice and can be brushed nicely back into style at any time if it has been stored roughly.</li>
            <li>My first review was cut short!</li>
            <li>its extremely flat, extremely straight, it does not look anything at all like real hair</li>
            <li>Wig is very high quality, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>or if you dont want people to know you are CLEARLY wearing a wig i wouldnt purchace it.</li>
            <li>and they completely believed me</li>
            <li>It looked absolutely natural.</li>
            <li>Usually wigs in this price range (I bought mine for ~15.00 on sale) are waxy and tangle easily.</li>
            <li>it doesnt feel like real hair and is not even the color of real hair its dark brown with what appears to be blue streaks.</li>
            <li>Bangs were much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Rather cute but the color is very dark--almost black and the bangs are very long and thick so they would need to be cut by a stylist.  </li>
            <li>To shiny not at all like real hair too dark</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really love this wig , and for the price it is great!! The hair looks nice and can be brushed nicely back into style at any time if it has been stored roughly. It looks exactly like the picture and i am a big fan of this cut.  And it is adjustable so it fits all different shaped heads well.  Super cute !</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig and came much sooner than expected. The bangs can be styled in a few different ways and the hair is thick and exactly the color as was pictured. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great wig for the price!</li>
            <li> purchased as a halloween gift for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Some of the hair fell out when I tried it on. Looks really cute on.</li>
            <li> DOES LIKE THE STYLE ON ME</li>
            <li> style was ok. Bangs were much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> To shiny not at all like real hair too dark</li>
            <li> This wig is so real looking that my friends all thought it was my hair and that I had gotten a haircut!</li>
            <li> As I mentioned previously, I cannot speak for others, yet I believe that most women when purchasing wigs, are very selective in their choices of colors, length and style. In February, I ordered this styled wig from another Seller received incorrect wig, and order the same wig again from the same Seller in March with delivery for mid-April, and again did not receive the correct wig, style, color, and length I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I loved this wig so much, I ordered it from this Seller (Royal-Style), I received the wig that had more Brown than Black in the wig as described, the quality of the hair was good, the style of the wig is as pictured, and the length was a bit longer than the picture. This wig was more expensive, it also came with a wig cap, although not mentioned in the advertised title. I am pleased with the purchase of this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beauty enhancement journey to find the wig of my choice, color, style, and length has been an experience, since February through mid-April with another Seller, not receiving what I ordered/expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I changed to this new Seller (Royal-Style), I received what I ordered/expected, ending my beauty enhancement journey for wigs. This wig is very nice, the color, style, and quality of hair is great, appears very natural.  If you maintain this wig correctly, it can give the appearance of being observed as real hair.  Thanks to the Seller for an accurate description, as well as fulfilling an order based on the accuracy of their description. I would recommend this Seller to others, as well as Amazon Customers. Delivery was timely, packaging secure.  Thanks Amazon and Seller for your customer service, and a quality product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality for the price! Doesn&#x27;t shed that bad, looks fairly realistic (I wear it to cover a mohawk in a medical setting and get compliments all day on my hair cut). I could see it running a little tight if you have a lot of hair/a large head, but fits me like a dream. No itching,  slipping, breathes well.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is fantastic wig!  We used it on stage and it looked great, fit well, stayed on and was of a much better quality than I had expected.  I honestly thought it was going to be comparable to the wigs one buys at a place like Walmart at Halloween time.  Waaaaaay better. It is so nice that it could be worn on the street.  My actress that I bought it for wanted to keep it!</li>
            <li> Not suitable for me.  Was very hot to wear.  Shed profusely!!</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing. I tried it on to trick some people into thinking it was my new hair do and they completely believed me it&#x27;s that good. Very soft, thick and has a nice little scalp appearance on top to make it look EXACTLY like the picture. I would totally order wigs from this brand again and again I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome. Super cute! Really well made!!! I totally recommend it! You get your value PLUS for the money!!!</li>
            <li> Love this wig! Looks great on. Feels soft and falls beautifully. Wonderful color too. I did have to trim some stray bang hairs but that was easy.For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong .</li>
            <li> My first review was cut short! Wig is very high quality, especially for the price.  Brushes and styles well, would purchase from this seller again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Really cute. Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I thought out of all the wigs this looked the best however the product that arrived was a bit different it still did the trick..</li>
            <li> in this wig.  it  looks nothing like the picture. it has no body whatsoever. its extremely flat, extremely straight, it does not look anything at all like real hair it doesnt feel like real hair and is not even the color of real hair its dark brown with what appears to be blue streaks. its full of static electricity, you cant really tell the top from the bottom, and its waaaaay too shiny lol. . I hate it and wouldnt be caught dead in this wig. i just went ahead and spent 125.00 on a wig by Rene of Paris. This might be ok for a costume, but for everyday use or if you dont want people to know you are CLEARLY wearing a wig i wouldnt purchace it.

            <li> We attended a ROARING 20&#x27;s PARTY...Sooo many compliments on this wig...some that did not know me or had seen me in awhile, wondered if I had cut my hair and loved this style on me. I had my hairdresser trim it to fit my face.</li>
            <li> This wig fit well and was transforming in terms of helping to create a persona.  It was very comfortable and shipped on time.  It looked absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> Personally, it did not fit well for me and the quality was a little below average. Hair keeps falling out even with gentle stroking. However, communication and refund was very fast and efficient. Very satisfied with customer service and not so satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I like the style and the color, but the wig is coming a part, hair are falling off and it is impossible to wear it.</li>
            <li> Rather cute but the color is very dark--almost black and the bangs are very long and thick so they would need to be cut by a stylist.  Wig is also very shiney and looks more like a costume wig.</li>
