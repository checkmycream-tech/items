    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is wonderful stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dandruff shampoo yet!  </li>
            <li>Hair feels great.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>It has kept my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>Shipment came promptly which I was happy about.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this from Amazon.com at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be a good shampoo for my thinning hair; however it does not combat and resolve the scalp itch like the Nioxin Scalp Recovery Medicating Cleanser Shampoo (which contains pyrithone zinc).</li>
            <li>price is great - my hairdresser charges more than twice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo did feel nice on my scalp, although it is a bit runny which will no doubt lead to using way more product than needed.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to go with the larger size which is 33.8 oz</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t run out again, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I originally made this as a comment to another post, but felt I should make it a stand alone comment to be able to rate the product and also give others who might buy it another take on</li>
            <li>I was excited to think I got a pyrithone zinc product that wouldn&#x27;t be as drying as head and shoulders as no SLS</li>
            <li>I have seen significant improvement since using this product.</li>
            <li>I was using some cream of nioxin scalp recovery for erase the white things, that some one had told to me , and i wanted to proof the shampo , and yes im happy , because so far it is doing wonderful things on my scalp , now is not too dry like before and the duff had been decrese a lot.</li>
            <li>The product description is, &#x27;a color safe, sulfate-free skin cleanser that gently soothes and moisturizes the scalp...&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin really keeps the scalp healthy for maximum hair growth.</li>
            <li>it does feel more soothing and gentle than Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had scalp issues my whole life - this product makes life better.  </li>
            <li>Noxin Scalp Recovery is a good shampoo for treating dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I think if it is was thicker you could get a better massaging action on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Regular use of the Shampoo and Conditioner has made me feel like my seborrhic dermatitis is finally under control; additionally, the shampoo and conditioner smell good and leave my hair feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even notice it at first.</li>
            <li>And considering the price and reputation Nizoral has I would consider it more a higher end product than low</li>
            <li>Started working from the first use.</li>
            <li>Ran out of my first bottle and had to use another brand.....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even open the bottle or try it because my primary reason for purchasing was that it was sulfate-free.  </li>
            <li>Used to have so much dandruff</li>
            <li>and I am noticing that I am not losing as much hair.</li>
            <li>little dab&#x27;ll do ya&amp;#34; rubbed in right on the spots and then either skip the full hairwash or use another nonirritating shampoo for the full hairwash.  </li>
            <li>I felt really duped because normally I read ingredients before buying a shampoo as I can&#x27;t even use SLS in toothpaste as it causes mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li>But even after a few weeks I noticed how much better my scalp was.</li>
            <li>so I turned to Amazon and found this economically desirable giant size bottle of it.  </li>
            <li>So naturally I don&#x27;t want it in my shampoo on my fragile hair and super sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the shot if you suffer from dry scalp.</li>
            <li>For ease of handling, I use my old smaller bottle, which I will refill from the new large one.</li>
            <li>So far it prevent scaling and dandruff on my scalp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for sensitive, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>Most all of the expensive shampoos today are becoming sulfate free, and I have a hard time understanding how Nioxin can promote this as such a gentle shampoo for problematic scalps with all that SLS (it must be a big ingredient being listed as number two in the line up of ingredients).</li>
            <li>Considering the price and the fact that it is formulated for people who typically already have fragile or thinning hair, it just boggles my mind that they would not have made this a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li>the main ingredient (pyrithione zinc) IS something that can help treat hair fall due to the sebum unclogging action and the sebum is where a lot of the DHT in our hair follicles live.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times thinking it was sulfate free as that is how it was advertised on several places online.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my scalp clear of psoriasis.</li>
            <li>but now I can barely notice any as I scratch my scalp.  </li>

            <li> am giving it three stars instead of two only because as of right now it seems to be the less drying and harsh of the other DHT reducing shampoos I have tried (Head and Shoulders and Nizoral).</li>
            <li> One bottle will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Both bottle tops were loose</li>

            <li> After fighting dandruff, dry, itchy scalp for years; this cured it!  </li>
            <li> (I got the big 1 liter on sale for $29 - almost same price as the small bottle</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve changed the active ingredient percentage from 2% to 1% but product works well when combined with other shampoos like Nizeral and such.</li>
            <li> The winter here is very dry, and I tried everything and nothing worked, till my hair dresser told me about this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think what I have used of it so far is &#x27;terrible&#x27;, my hair feels okay afterwards and FAR less drying than Nizoral (another anti dandruff shampoo with SLS but much other drying ingredients as well).</li>
            <li> For product conservation, since I have only a few chronic itchy spots, I use &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 10 years now, and I definitely have less dandruff because of it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what I will do with this big bottle I have now</li>
            <li> I might keep it on hand and use it in a rotation with other DHT fighting shampoos.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I received it, the 2nd and 3rd ingredients were sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I also get less</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more itch, no more flakes.</li>
            <li> SLS simply is NOT a healthy ingredient for a scalp that is already irritated or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the company felt the need to add sulfates when the higher end shampoo industry (and even some of the cheaper products) is going the way of REMOVING it.  </li>
            <li> but alas, that is not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very disappointed to see that SLS (sodium Laurel Sulfate) is the number two ingredient in this shampoo.</li>

            <li> Both bottle tops were loose an the product ran out!!</li>

Unfortunately, when I received it, the 2nd and 3rd ingredients were sulfates.  I didn&#x27;t even open the bottle or try it because my primary reason for purchasing was that it was sulfate-free.  I am returning this immediately.  Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cleared up dandruff in three shampoos.  Hair feels great.  Scalp cleared up totally.  Nioxin really keeps the scalp healthy for maximum hair growth.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  The winter here is very dry, and I tried everything and nothing worked, till my hair dresser told me about this.  No more itch, no more flakes.</li>

Considering the price and the fact that it is formulated for people who typically already have fragile or thinning hair, it just boggles my mind that they would not have made this a sulfate free product. Most all of the expensive shampoos today are becoming sulfate free, and I have a hard time understanding how Nioxin can promote this as such a gentle shampoo for problematic scalps with all that SLS (it must be a big ingredient being listed as number two in the line up of ingredients). SLS simply is NOT a healthy ingredient for a scalp that is already irritated or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even notice it at first. I used it a few times thinking it was sulfate free as that is how it was advertised on several places online. Then I decided to see what ingredient was giving it the minty smell and tingly feeling and so I grabbed the bottle out of the shower and started reading ingredients. That is when I saw SLS as number two. I felt really duped because normally I read ingredients before buying a shampoo as I can&#x27;t even use SLS in toothpaste as it causes mouth ulcers. So naturally I don&#x27;t want it in my shampoo on my fragile hair and super sensitive skin and scalp. The only reason I didn&#x27;t check it when buying was the ads and even reviews touting it as SLS free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did feel nice on my scalp, although it is a bit runny which will no doubt lead to using way more product than needed. I think if it is was thicker you could get a better massaging action on the scalp. I don&#x27;t think what I have used of it so far is &#x27;terrible&#x27;, my hair feels okay afterwards and FAR less drying than Nizoral (another anti dandruff shampoo with SLS but much other drying ingredients as well). I know Nioxin isn&#x27;t labeled to treat hair falling out however the main ingredient (pyrithione zinc) IS something that can help treat hair fall due to the sebum unclogging action and the sebum is where a lot of the DHT in our hair follicles live. I was excited to think I got a pyrithone zinc product that wouldn&#x27;t be as drying as head and shoulders as no SLS but alas, that is not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what I will do with this big bottle I have now (I got the big 1 liter on sale for $29 - almost same price as the small bottle so I figured why not). I might keep it on hand and use it in a rotation with other DHT fighting shampoos. I still have to use Nizoral in my regimen as when my scalp starts to hurt from inflammation Nizoral is the only thing that will make the inflammation go down. Maybe I can rotate this Nioxin for that puprose as even though it has SLS it does feel more soothing and gentle than Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d give this a 4 starts if the SLS was not included. I am disappointed that the company felt the need to add sulfates when the higher end shampoo industry (and even some of the cheaper products) is going the way of REMOVING it.  And considering the price and reputation Nizoral has I would consider it more a higher end product than low end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it three stars instead of two only because as of right now it seems to be the less drying and harsh of the other DHT reducing shampoos I have tried (Head and Shoulders and Nizoral).</li>
            <li> I can feel my scalp tingle when I use it. It seems to reduce dandruff. I also get less itching.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great - my hairdresser charges more than twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had scalp issues my whole life - this product makes life better.  I would recommend this to anyone with scalp issues.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve changed the active ingredient percentage from 2% to 1% but product works well when combined with other shampoos like Nizeral and such.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few years now. This is the only product that keeps my scalp clear of psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have dermatitis of the scalp.  This shampoo has basically cleared all of it up. Used to have so much dandruff but now I can barely notice any as I scratch my scalp.  I have been using this for about 6 months now.  It took about 4 months of constant use to get to this condition.  But even after a few weeks I noticed how much better my scalp was. This product is worth the shot if you suffer from dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years, I have seen a lot of improvement in my scalp. So far it prevent scaling and dandruff on my scalp. I would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> Noxin Scalp Recovery is a good shampoo for treating dry scalp. It has kept my hair looking great. 2more words required.</li>
            <li> After fighting dandruff, dry, itchy scalp for years; this cured it!  One bottle will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Shipment came promptly which I was happy about.  Love this shampoo it&#x27;s for sensitive, itchy scalp.  It&#x27;s best to go with the larger size which is 33.8 oz it last longer.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Scalp Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner works wonders for my scalp. Prior to using Nioxin products, each time that I would wash my hair, my scalp would flake immediately after washing and blow drying my hair, regardless of me using prescription shampoo. Regular use of the Shampoo and Conditioner has made me feel like my seborrhic dermatitis is finally under control; additionally, the shampoo and conditioner smell good and leave my hair feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff.  It relieves itchyness and irritation on scalp and also subdues and skin irritations on shoulders, chest, thighs, etc.  I discovered it about a year ago at my hairdresser&#x27;s; but then they didn&#x27;t have it back in stock when I ran out so I turned to Amazon and found this economically desirable giant size bottle of it.  For ease of handling, I use my old smaller bottle, which I will refill from the new large one. For product conservation, since I have only a few chronic itchy spots, I use &amp;#34;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya&amp;#34; rubbed in right on the spots and then either skip the full hairwash or use another nonirritating shampoo for the full hairwash.  NOTE:  Nioxin also makes a &amp;#34;Cleanser&amp;#34; for shampooing.  I find this to be a good shampoo for my thinning hair; however it does not combat and resolve the scalp itch like the Nioxin Scalp Recovery Medicating Cleanser Shampoo (which contains pyrithone zinc).</li>
            <li> I was using some cream of nioxin scalp recovery for erase the white things, that some one had told to me , and i wanted to proof the shampo , and yes im happy , because so far it is doing wonderful things on my scalp , now is not too dry like before and the duff had been decrese a lot.</li>
            <li> This product helps my husband&#x27;s scalp immensely. Clears up all the irritation and dryness. Started working from the first use.</li>
            <li> I have seen significant improvement since using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best dandruff shampoo yet!  Ran out of my first bottle and had to use another brand.....YUK.  Ordered this from Amazon.com at a great price.  I won&#x27;t run out again, that&#x27;s for sure.  If you order......YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY</li>
            <li> It has helped the itching on my scalp and I am noticing that I am not losing as much hair. I have already told friends about the product.</li>
