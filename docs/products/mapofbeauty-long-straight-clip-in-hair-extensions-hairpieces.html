            <li>soft a good amount of hair- clips look great!</li>
            <li>It is a really nice piece</li>
            <li>A clip came off very easily</li>
            <li>so, if you do not do that yourself, then I can&#x27;t say how impressed you will be with a &#x27;natural look.&#x27;</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful as when I first bought them.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>

            <li>Absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it should&#x27;ve held up for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I get soooo many complements on it all the time.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how beautiful this is!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold.... will get more.  </li>
            <li>io se los recomiendo &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>But make sure you choose a color that matches yours.</li>
            <li>Needs more layers.</li>
            <li>I love them otherwise.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing again unless I can find out how to keep them in better condition</li>
            <li>okay, so i ordered mine Feb 6, took about 2 days to send out, and it came in Feb 22, i am in California btw</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even been able to wear them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a reddish burgendy ..</li>
            <li>Cute for play.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love.</li>
            <li>but love it.</li>
            <li>This piece is lovely.</li>
            <li>They are very nice quality and look real.  </li>
            <li>however, You can use heat tools with it on a low setting which is very nice!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It took a while to recieve full package but they were extremely nice</li>
            <li>so far im happy with it...</li>
            <li>Good looks real but sheds alot</li>
            <li>but if you want to experiment before buying real ones and paying the money for them this is a good way to go(:</li>
            <li>the clips are very sturdy so that&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li>but thats not a bad thing!</li>
            <li>Also they tangle easy</li>
            <li>but they tangled so easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Got tangled easy.</li>
            <li>The hair comes out easily where it&#x27;s sown in.</li>
            <li>Easy to style.</li>
            <li>They clip in really easily too</li>
            <li>Matched my hair perfectly which at the time was dark auburn brown.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, just wish I&#x27;d done one of better quality.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I am sure it will look very pretty..</li>
            <li>These are beautiful and shiny but they are so long they are easily</li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting cheap feeling and looking hair.</li>
            <li>I use a boar bristle brush to lightly comb through it.</li>
            <li>but I ordered mine in light brown</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s on it stays secure.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
            <li>CHEAP HAIR FOR CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li>Not the best quality but does create a different look that is fun to wear on certain occasions.</li>
            <li>But this is not what I expected at all this hair is so beautiful ‚ù§</li>
            <li>Other than that it was a good purchase!</li>
            <li>Very long looks great</li>
            <li>Some strands were stating to get more bumps and waves in them, so it got kind of frizzy after the third time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Great buy for $5 which will actually be $10 when I get the second one but still super cheap for the nice quality.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and love the extenion</li>
            <li>if you want a true brown, this is not the piece for you.</li>
            <li>I give them four stars, the actual hair was a very nice product I&#x27;ve bought the same ones for my girlfriend from salons that weren&#x27;t this nice</li>
            <li>I loved it for the first few times I used it, but then it started to get kind of wavy.  </li>
            <li>I also have never washed one, but at this price, by the time most people have to wash a hair piece, another brand new one could be on the way...</li>
            <li>I wore this all the time when I first got it!</li>
            <li>For the price, this piece is amazing, and I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to much because of how cheap it is</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>It also sheds every where, which is kind of gross</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I tried it and gets super tangled</li>
            <li>They are easy to brush and although they tangle easily they can be brushed out.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Not the right color.</li>
            <li>so these extensions don&#x27;t blend exactly right with it</li>
            <li>They really are so long and gorgeous</li>
            <li>All the tangles brushed right out and looked good as new.</li>
            <li>Great love it a bit heavy but definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>All in all it is really nice and long, one piece works for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that it looked pretty good in my hair  </li>
            <li>Exactly the right color.</li>
            <li>ive gotten that its good hair to mess with</li>
            <li>But it is very straight and silky looking..</li>
            <li>Now, mine shed a lot, but if I actually took the time to brush it out then it would probably be okay.</li>
            <li>So much shedding!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>So pretty</li>
            <li>, most likely going to purchase a second one to add more thickness to them.</li>
            <li>but they look so pretty.</li>
            <li>It was an exact match to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Plan to use for the first time tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Shipping took a while, while brushing a good amount of hair fell off and it gets knotted easily, dark brown is more like reddish brown and it is pretty long.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easy, the clips don&#x27;t hold well unless you use hair spray with it, and after all of my efforts it ended up falling out after I made sure that the clips were firmly set.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent hair extension for the price!</li>
            <li>It is a little dark brown/auburn but it matched my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>First of all I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting anything high end when I first bought this</li>
            <li>Using it as actual length in your hair is tricky because it&#x27;s SO easily tangled.</li>
            <li>Love these extensions easy for beginners they came to me earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>It has red undertones in the sunlight, which for me is fine since my hair does as well.</li>
            <li>And was a little shinier than my own hair.</li>
            <li>Got here quick and they are super long and look like real hair.</li>
            <li>Really good just hard to comb.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t sleep in them, or they will get very tangled.</li>
            <li>but it tangles so fast.</li>
            <li>and it was cheap which actually scared me a bit.</li>
            <li>Way too much hair fall</li>
            <li>Still don&#x27;t really know how to put it on my hair though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to solve that problem.</li>
            <li>it comes fast</li>
            <li>and when I put it up to my hair it is a light brown with a red tent to it.</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair, feels like real hair</li>
            <li>the hair feels really silky and real</li>
            <li>They look close to real.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t look or feel as real as I thought and</li>
            <li>so I went out and bought real ones.</li>
            <li>I really like it..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nappy</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really get them in my hair.</li>
            <li>So shiny and looked so real.</li>
            <li>i need to make my cuzin fix it because she works with this kind of stuff and its also kinda heavy</li>
            <li>As for the quality - It&#x27;s very soft, shiny and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, worth it!</li>
            <li>and they are to smooth and long.</li>
            <li>Pretty shiny and long great for the price shipping was slow but</li>
            <li>I showed were  natural hair ends so pretty its like a espresso brown</li>
            <li>So realistic</li>
            <li>but this is not even decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>This has cinnamon overtones to it and is not a simple dark brown because it has a great deal of red.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep it in good condition (especially when storing it), it will last!</li>
            <li>The dark brown has a slight auburn tint to it which is great because my hair does too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These extensions are very silky soft.</li>
            <li>I might buy a few more, for extras.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall.... its worth your money.. if you are looking for extra lenght, I would say purchase this..</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair with a kind of faded red in it because of how I dyed my hair a year ago.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and long and I straightened them when I took them out of the package because they were a bit wavy</li>
            <li>Its very thick on its own and realistic looking.</li>
            <li>I ordered Dark Brown and they came a really light brown. 2).</li>
            <li>The color is a pretty, deep brown.</li>
            <li>Not what i thought it Would look like , it&#x27;s pretty simple .</li>
            <li>They last for a very Long time and don&#x27;t get messed up easily.</li>
            <li>They are super long and i would suggest ordering more than one if you have thick hair .</li>
            <li>Surprising thick and very long!  </li>
            <li>and it fixed it up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>It is soft but it does tangle</li>
            <li>If you are going to get it for daily wear, buy one that&#x27;s real hair.</li>
            <li>the hair is soft and feels like natural.</li>
            <li>es muj suwave yse siente como pelo natural.</li>
            <li>but so far hasn&#x27;t shed and</li>
            <li>But, I haven&#x27;t really worn it ,outside  or anything , for any length of time, yet.</li>
            <li>It arrived about 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the low price...</li>
            <li>Other than that, I got dark brown ones and they&#x27;re such a gorgeous dark chocolate look but with a red tint which is fine with me because my hair is like that anyways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long and pretty.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re someone who is looking for an almost black, red free extension, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Cut shorter plenty long(: looks real.</li>
            <li>The color is right on also - I ordered dark brown.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confused as to why NO ONE mentioned in their reviews how many they had to buy just for them to look natural.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wear them, I decided to use them for cutting practice, but their limp-ness didn&#x27;t take a nice layered cut very well either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super long and thin and super soft.</li>
            <li>Such a waste of money , its really shiny doesn&#x27;t look natural at all &amp; sheds &amp; get VERY tangled ,never agin</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really brush it because it would mangle the look of it, so shake it out, brush through with your fingers and store it carefully to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li>a big chunky hair piece on me does not look natural.  </li>
            <li>It stays clipped in very well with minimal effort after parting your hair half-up.</li>
            <li>, I barely notice they&#x27;re in my hair.</li>
            <li>i have the dark brown one, its a mixed with a slight winey red and dark brown, its beautiful, VERY LONG.</li>
            <li>its very soft and long.. I would buy again..</li>
            <li>but my hair is also not super thick kind of just in the middle</li>
            <li>so you have to constantly brush them but other than that they look real .</li>
            <li>accidentally got sent the wrong thing, but i emailed them and they were very polite, very considerate, and they corrected their mistake as well as apologized many times and sent me an extra small gift for my troubles.</li>
            <li>I had to cut some of it shorter to flow with my natural hair (and I have really long hair).  </li>
            <li>Got so many compliments on how pretty and long my hair was, nobody ever knew it was fake!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just so frustrating that they tangle so easily.</li>
            <li>Some customers stated that some of the clips were broken, but mine were fine, no problems at all.</li>

            <li> Very nice piece like clip ins they hold in place.</li>
            <li> but it was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The colour is good but it sheds continuously.</li>
            <li> but you have to take good care of it</li>
            <li> i loved it.</li>
            <li> The hair was good</li>
            <li> it looks good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> Its A good extensions but the color was not my color</li>
            <li> For shipping from another country, MapofBeauty did a good job in getting the extensions to me in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Beautiful I love them.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these gorgeous extensions!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I really really really love this product and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> However, they aren&#x27;t able to be bleached!</li>
            <li> The clips are nice and don&#x27;t pull or tug on my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> They are nice.</li>
            <li> soft a good amount of hair- clips look great!</li>
            <li> It is a really nice piece</li>
            <li> A clip came off very easily</li>
            <li> so, if you do not do that yourself, then I can&#x27;t say how impressed you will be with a &#x27;natural look.&#x27;</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful as when I first bought them.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Very affordable and good quality !</li>
            <li> They are very cheap though</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It looks convincing on me.</li>
            <li> They look like real hair, blends in great, and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this hair extension.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a auburn reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the softness and length</li>
            <li> I love the length</li>
            <li> but I wish could do more with them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but it should&#x27;ve held up for more than a day.</li>
            <li> I get soooo many complements on it all the time.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how beautiful this is!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold.... will get more.  </li>
            <li> io se los recomiendo &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> But make sure you choose a color that matches yours.</li>
            <li> Needs more layers.</li>
            <li> I love them otherwise.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing again unless I can find out how to keep them in better condition</li>
            <li> okay, so i ordered mine Feb 6, took about 2 days to send out, and it came in Feb 22, i am in California btw</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even been able to wear them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like a reddish burgendy ..</li>
            <li> Cute for play.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love.</li>
            <li> but love it.</li>
            <li> This piece is lovely.</li>
            <li> They are very nice quality and look real.  </li>
            <li> however, You can use heat tools with it on a low setting which is very nice!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It took a while to recieve full package but they were extremely nice</li>
            <li> so far im happy with it...</li>
            <li> Good looks real but sheds alot</li>
            <li> but if you want to experiment before buying real ones and paying the money for them this is a good way to go(:</li>
            <li> the clips are very sturdy so that&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li> but thats not a bad thing!</li>
            <li> Also they tangle easy</li>
            <li> but they tangled so easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Got tangled easy.</li>
            <li> The hair comes out easily where it&#x27;s sown in.</li>
            <li> Easy to style.</li>
            <li> They clip in really easily too</li>
            <li> Matched my hair perfectly which at the time was dark auburn brown.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, just wish I&#x27;d done one of better quality.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> I am sure it will look very pretty..</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and shiny but they are so long they are easily</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting cheap feeling and looking hair.</li>
            <li> I use a boar bristle brush to lightly comb through it.</li>
            <li> but I ordered mine in light brown</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s on it stays secure.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
            <li> CHEAP HAIR FOR CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but does create a different look that is fun to wear on certain occasions.</li>
            <li> But this is not what I expected at all this hair is so beautiful ‚ù§</li>
            <li> Other than that it was a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Very long looks great</li>
            <li> Some strands were stating to get more bumps and waves in them, so it got kind of frizzy after the third time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Great buy for $5 which will actually be $10 when I get the second one but still super cheap for the nice quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the extenion</li>
            <li> if you want a true brown, this is not the piece for you.</li>
            <li> I give them four stars, the actual hair was a very nice product I&#x27;ve bought the same ones for my girlfriend from salons that weren&#x27;t this nice</li>
            <li> I loved it for the first few times I used it, but then it started to get kind of wavy.  </li>
            <li> I also have never washed one, but at this price, by the time most people have to wash a hair piece, another brand new one could be on the way...</li>
            <li> I wore this all the time when I first got it!</li>
            <li> For the price, this piece is amazing, and I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to much because of how cheap it is</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> It also sheds every where, which is kind of gross</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried it and gets super tangled</li>
            <li> They are easy to brush and although they tangle easily they can be brushed out.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> Not the right color.</li>
            <li> so these extensions don&#x27;t blend exactly right with it</li>
            <li> They really are so long and gorgeous</li>
            <li> All the tangles brushed right out and looked good as new.</li>
            <li> Great love it a bit heavy but definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> All in all it is really nice and long, one piece works for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that it looked pretty good in my hair  </li>
            <li> Exactly the right color.</li>
            <li> ive gotten that its good hair to mess with</li>
            <li> But it is very straight and silky looking..</li>
            <li> Now, mine shed a lot, but if I actually took the time to brush it out then it would probably be okay.</li>
            <li> So much shedding!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> So pretty</li>
            <li> , most likely going to purchase a second one to add more thickness to them.</li>
            <li> but they look so pretty.</li>
            <li> It was an exact match to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Plan to use for the first time tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, while brushing a good amount of hair fell off and it gets knotted easily, dark brown is more like reddish brown and it is pretty long.</li>
            <li> It does tangle easy, the clips don&#x27;t hold well unless you use hair spray with it, and after all of my efforts it ended up falling out after I made sure that the clips were firmly set.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent hair extension for the price!</li>
            <li> It is a little dark brown/auburn but it matched my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> First of all I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting anything high end when I first bought this</li>
            <li> Using it as actual length in your hair is tricky because it&#x27;s SO easily tangled.</li>
            <li> Love these extensions easy for beginners they came to me earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It has red undertones in the sunlight, which for me is fine since my hair does as well.</li>
            <li> And was a little shinier than my own hair.</li>
            <li> Got here quick and they are super long and look like real hair.</li>
            <li> Really good just hard to comb.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t sleep in them, or they will get very tangled.</li>
            <li> but it tangles so fast.</li>
            <li> and it was cheap which actually scared me a bit.</li>
            <li> Way too much hair fall</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t really know how to put it on my hair though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to solve that problem.</li>
            <li> it comes fast</li>
            <li> and when I put it up to my hair it is a light brown with a red tent to it.</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair, feels like real hair</li>
            <li> the hair feels really silky and real</li>
            <li> They look close to real.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t look or feel as real as I thought and</li>
            <li> so I went out and bought real ones.</li>
            <li> I really like it..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nappy</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really get them in my hair.</li>
            <li> So shiny and looked so real.</li>
            <li> i need to make my cuzin fix it because she works with this kind of stuff and its also kinda heavy</li>
            <li> As for the quality - It&#x27;s very soft, shiny and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, worth it!</li>
            <li> and they are to smooth and long.</li>
            <li> Pretty shiny and long great for the price shipping was slow but</li>
            <li> I showed were  natural hair ends so pretty its like a espresso brown</li>
            <li> So realistic</li>
            <li> but this is not even decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> This has cinnamon overtones to it and is not a simple dark brown because it has a great deal of red.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep it in good condition (especially when storing it), it will last!</li>
            <li> The dark brown has a slight auburn tint to it which is great because my hair does too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These extensions are very silky soft.</li>
            <li> I might buy a few more, for extras.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall.... its worth your money.. if you are looking for extra lenght, I would say purchase this..</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with a kind of faded red in it because of how I dyed my hair a year ago.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and long and I straightened them when I took them out of the package because they were a bit wavy</li>
            <li> Its very thick on its own and realistic looking.</li>
            <li> I ordered Dark Brown and they came a really light brown. 2).</li>
            <li> The color is a pretty, deep brown.</li>
            <li> Not what i thought it Would look like , it&#x27;s pretty simple .</li>
            <li> They last for a very Long time and don&#x27;t get messed up easily.</li>
            <li> They are super long and i would suggest ordering more than one if you have thick hair .</li>
            <li> Surprising thick and very long!  </li>
            <li> and it fixed it up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> It is soft but it does tangle</li>
            <li> If you are going to get it for daily wear, buy one that&#x27;s real hair.</li>
            <li> the hair is soft and feels like natural.</li>
            <li> es muj suwave yse siente como pelo natural.</li>
            <li> but so far hasn&#x27;t shed and</li>
            <li> But, I haven&#x27;t really worn it ,outside  or anything , for any length of time, yet.</li>
            <li> It arrived about 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the low price...</li>
            <li> Other than that, I got dark brown ones and they&#x27;re such a gorgeous dark chocolate look but with a red tint which is fine with me because my hair is like that anyways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long and pretty.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re someone who is looking for an almost black, red free extension, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Cut shorter plenty long(: looks real.</li>
            <li> The color is right on also - I ordered dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused as to why NO ONE mentioned in their reviews how many they had to buy just for them to look natural.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear them, I decided to use them for cutting practice, but their limp-ness didn&#x27;t take a nice layered cut very well either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super long and thin and super soft.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money , its really shiny doesn&#x27;t look natural at all &amp; sheds &amp; get VERY tangled ,never agin</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really brush it because it would mangle the look of it, so shake it out, brush through with your fingers and store it carefully to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li> a big chunky hair piece on me does not look natural.  </li>
            <li> It stays clipped in very well with minimal effort after parting your hair half-up.</li>
            <li> , I barely notice they&#x27;re in my hair.</li>
            <li> i have the dark brown one, its a mixed with a slight winey red and dark brown, its beautiful, VERY LONG.</li>
            <li> its very soft and long.. I would buy again..</li>
            <li> but my hair is also not super thick kind of just in the middle</li>
            <li> so you have to constantly brush them but other than that they look real .</li>
            <li> accidentally got sent the wrong thing, but i emailed them and they were very polite, very considerate, and they corrected their mistake as well as apologized many times and sent me an extra small gift for my troubles.</li>
            <li> I had to cut some of it shorter to flow with my natural hair (and I have really long hair).  </li>
            <li> Got so many compliments on how pretty and long my hair was, nobody ever knew it was fake!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so frustrating that they tangle so easily.</li>
            <li> Some customers stated that some of the clips were broken, but mine were fine, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing for me was that when brushing it gently, some of the hair fell out, which is to be expected for only $5, so no real huge complaints.</li>
            <li> It is very shiny and my hair is long, but totally dead from having blonde hair recently.</li>
            <li> But make sure if you have thick hair buy 2!!!</li>
            <li> It didnt match up right :( and was super shiney</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bit long since I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2</li>
            <li> But I braid my hair and wear it and it makes my hair look sooo long.</li>
            <li> Not as long as pictured.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really long</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while but still earlier than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Long Straight Clip in Hair Extensions Hairpieces because I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It is VERY long.</li>
            <li> Extremely fake, super long.</li>
            <li> Not normal sized.</li>
            <li> I was really worried when I bought this one, I thought it will look very fake with so many defects because of the price, but no, I actually loved it.</li>
            <li> Takes waayy too long to get!!</li>
            <li> the headband in a tight double knot ,&lt;br /&gt;You made headband extensions</li>
            <li> Two is definitely not enough and no one mentioned that the extensions are literally made for little people heads.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more hair on it and be less heavy, I mean that the clips and area around them is so thick and the hair so sparse that it feels like a like of clips giving me a bulky line and the some hAirs just for show.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> is really LONG !!!</li>
            <li> It got here way before I expected.</li>
            <li> Careful with hair pieces from this seller.</li>
            <li> I got it faster than I expected</li>
            <li> but I was not being careful with brushing ^-^.</li>
            <li> but that was expected.</li>
            <li> One thing to consider though is that just be careful with it as you brush and of course, if not in use, put it in a place where it won&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> Its a bit longer than I expected</li>
            <li> get me wrong, it looks pretty to look at and feel, but it&#x27;s just not very practical.</li>
            <li> shipped fast, is thick and heavy, but for $5 you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Also the strip of clips is a bit too long for my head, but I&#x27;m also a really little person.</li>
            <li> I recommend these against other extensions.</li>
            <li> I received my hair in the mail the other day</li>
            <li> And it came sooner than the expected date!</li>
            <li> This was the wrong color, in the picture you can&#x27;t really tell but it is reddish, my hair is dark brown, so I never could use it, they gave me a partial refund</li>
            <li> Just a little longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of trying to dye it to my dark brown color</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be dark brown</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and it came in as a auburn..</li>
            <li> i ordered dark brown</li>
            <li> I thought the dark brown would be a DARK BROWN</li>
            <li> Not even close to dark brown..</li>
            <li> The moment we took them out of package the hair was  falling out of the clips and still are, by far worse product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> it weighs Down hair</li>
            <li> They are a bit heavy (especially since I have to wear 3 cause of my thick hair)</li>
            <li> Feels fake can&#x27;t do much with it too heavy on head</li>
            <li> I have black hair and figured I&#x27;d just dye these extensions to match.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t gross thin like I expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always used human hair so this is definitely not as good.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 because I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> It also took a little less than a month to get here.</li>
            <li> The hair does come out a little but not a lot.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit of shedding</li>
            <li> im not to fond of the clips because it pulls my hair a little which hurts..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I expected it will be thick..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just awfully heavy.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with the tangles in the hair.</li>
            <li> Oh and its REALLY heavy</li>
            <li> The only problem i have is with the combs being a little uncomfortable..</li>
            <li> I reviewed the wrong hair piece earlier.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> They are too big for my head but after cutting them a clip down they worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly hard to adjust the clips</li>
            <li> and then its not so im confused a little on the quality.</li>
            <li> This one is thick.</li>
            <li> But I need to order another one cause my hair it so thick.</li>
            <li> I have to wear it in a pony tail because I have thick hair</li>
            <li> but if you have thick or poffy hair you might wanna buy 2 or 3..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> it is very fake and obvious though.</li>
            <li> Terrible, cheap, thin, fell out a ton, and knotted.</li>
            <li> To be expected with artificial hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick too, not so thin.</li>
            <li> this piece was not too thin and not too thick...</li>
            <li> Very thick.  </li>
            <li> off all the clips&lt;br /&gt;Get a stretchy thin headband,&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> a pipe cleaner (any thin</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t blend well unless you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I cut and thin out all of my pieces to match my layered locks,</li>
            <li> I still layer and thin out mine, because I have thin hair, so</li>
            <li> One of the clips was broken, but I blame it on the distance of the shipping, not the company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thin hair</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> but my hair is just shy of the length of these already</li>
            <li> It looks soooo fake and feels so fake as well.  </li>
            <li> it was fake with just one.</li>
            <li> very thin ..</li>
            <li> It lasted for a few days than got really nasty.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s at the awkward stage)</li>
            <li> Extremely unhappy...</li>
            <li> I wore it to a concert and was afraid of it getting tangled and ratty.</li>
            <li> Clips are very weird and don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> and it does not tangle as badly as these do.</li>
            <li> looks bad</li>
            <li> it still is so bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not bad at all</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just crap.</li>
            <li> It took like a month to get to my house, and they don&#x27;t provide a tracking number which was annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair do not buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It got here way before I expected. In fact, my account still says that it hasn&#x27;t been delivered. It&#x27;s very soft and feels like real hair. It is a little dark brown/auburn but it matched my hair wonderfully. It is VERY long. I absolutely love it. It looks convincing on me. Now, mine shed a lot, but if I actually took the time to brush it out then it would probably be okay. For the price, this piece is amazing, and I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really good just hard to comb.</li>
            <li> These are great. They look like real hair, blends in great, and looks so shiny. I recommend these against other extensions. They&#x27;re thick too, not so thin. They last for a very Long time and don&#x27;t get messed up easily. Just don&#x27;t sleep in them, or they will get very tangled. Take them out every night.</li>
            <li> This was the wrong color, in the picture you can&#x27;t really tell but it is reddish, my hair is dark brown, so I never could use it, they gave me a partial refund</li>
            <li> Love these extensions easy for beginners they came to me earlier than expected. The only downside is they do shed a bit</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the extenion</li>
            <li> It lasted for a few days than got really nasty.</li>
            <li> Omg!!! For the price I was expecting cheap feeling and looking hair. But this is not what I expected at all this hair is so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è And it came 2 weeks earlier üôà I love it</li>
            <li> Sorry. I reviewed the wrong hair piece earlier. This one is thick. The colour is good but it sheds continuously.Careful with hair pieces from this seller. I also purchased a 20\\&quot; curly piece and had the same shedding problem.</li>
            <li> I love this hair extension. Its very thick on its own and realistic looking. It was a bit too shiny so I just added some baby powder and it fixed it up. It looks great in a ponytail and down.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit long since I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 so I just trimmed it</li>
            <li> A clip came off very easily i need to make my cuzin fix it because she works with this kind of stuff and its also kinda heavy</li>
            <li> Washed it and it got tangled.</li>
            <li> Arrived a week after buying them. Only having two problems. 1). I ordered Dark Brown and they came a really light brown. 2). They are too big for my head but after cutting them a clip down they worked. I am too scared to dye them my hair color because of the reviews. Probably the best extensions for $5 I have gotten.</li>
            <li> Love them! So realistic</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this ladies heres an easier way to wear these ;&lt;br /&gt;Cut off all the clips&lt;br /&gt;Get a stretchy thin headband,&lt;br /&gt;Take a pipe cleaner (any thin wire)&lt;br /&gt;Attach the headband on the wire and slide it thru where the clips would be connected ,&lt;br /&gt;Then slide the wire out&lt;br /&gt;Tie the headband in a tight double knot ,&lt;br /&gt;You made headband extensions</li>
            <li> I got it faster than I expected but the color did not match the picture at all. it&#x27;s more of a auburn reddish brown. it&#x27;s so soft but it tangles so fast. one of the clips is also broke. doesn&#x27;t blend well unless you have thin hair. I&#x27;m thinking of trying to dye it to my dark brown color but I don&#x27;t think the color will take to the hair.</li>
            <li> Good looks real but sheds alot</li>
            <li> Great love it a bit heavy but definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, while brushing a good amount of hair fell off and it gets knotted easily, dark brown is more like reddish brown and it is pretty long.</li>
            <li> Great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is a great product but it takes a while for it to ship</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering synthetic hair I usually go with human hair but I wanted to see what it would look like and it was cheap which actually scared me a bit. I order two of the MapofBeauty 23&amp;#34; Long Straight Clip in Hair Extensions Hairpieces because I have thick hair and I love it, it came way before the estimated arrival time. It is soft but it does tangle but you can brush it out with a comb or brush the clips are stable. The hair does come out a little but not a lot. I will be wearing it to an upcoming party.</li>
            <li> Pretty shiny and long great for the price shipping was slow but</li>
            <li> I just got it this morning and they are to smooth and long.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Couldn&#x27;t wear it once. Way too much hair fall</li>
            <li> Not great because you can&#x27;t use any heat on it, and it does not stay smooth all day. I know hair tangles but my hair is just shy of the length of these already and it does not tangle as badly as these do. Not bad for the price, just wish I&#x27;d done one of better quality. If you are going to get it for daily wear, buy one that&#x27;s real hair.</li>
            <li> I rated them a 4 because they are not the best hair extensions you can buy, but for 5$ the quality is great! I have blunt ends so when I put the extensions in you could tell I was wearing extensions, but I decided to try curling it with my curling iron. I used 330 degree heat on it and it did not damage it amd after curling it you couldn&#x27;t tell. I noticed a little bit of shedding but I was not being careful with brushing ^-^.</li>
            <li> very thin .. I expected it will be thick..</li>
            <li> I wore this all the time when I first got it! Got so many compliments on how pretty and long my hair was, nobody ever knew it was fake! As long as you keep it in good condition (especially when storing it), it will last! The clips are nice and don&#x27;t pull or tug on my scalp or hair. I use a boar bristle brush to lightly comb through it.</li>
            <li> Loved it, matched my hair color perfect. Still don&#x27;t really know how to put it on my hair though.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get here but that was expected. But I need to order another one cause my hair it so thick. But I braid my hair and wear it and it makes my hair look sooo long. It&#x27;s kinda has a redish tent to it but it still matched my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused as to why NO ONE mentioned in their reviews how many they had to buy just for them to look natural. Two is definitely not enough and no one mentioned that the extensions are literally made for little people heads. Not normal sized. Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> This hair sheds but looks alright when you put them in . They are super long and i would suggest ordering more than one if you have thick hair . Also they tangle easy so you have to constantly brush them but other than that they look real .</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this product. The hair looks real, not cheap, it actually looks like my hair. I was really worried when I bought this one, I thought it will look very fake with so many defects because of the price, but no, I actually loved it. One thing to consider though is that just be careful with it as you brush and of course, if not in use, put it in a place where it won&#x27;t get tangled. For the price, I think it is worth it. I might buy a few more, for extras. :)</li>
            <li> These extensions delivered a lot quicker than I thought. I love the softness and length but they tangled so easily. I tried to curl them and nothing happened. They are a bit heavy (especially since I have to wear 3 cause of my thick hair) but I ordered mine in light brown and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the color. For $5 you can&#x27;t beat it and for $15 all together I can&#x27;t complain. I love the length but I wish could do more with them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely. The dark brown has a slight auburn tint to it which is great because my hair does too. It&#x27;s super long and thin and super soft. It&#x27;s slightly hard to adjust the clips just right but once it&#x27;s on it stays secure. Easy to work with. I love it.</li>
            <li> Feels fake can&#x27;t do much with it too heavy on head wasn&#x27;t worth it weighs Down hair hurts head looks bad</li>
            <li> I use this to extend my hair into a braid/to make a bun thicker, and it works wonderfully for that. Using it as actual length in your hair is tricky because it&#x27;s SO easily tangled. I don&#x27;t really know how to solve that problem.</li>
            <li> Very long looks great the only thing I wish it could do is that it could be curled or straightned</li>
            <li> First of all I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting anything high end when I first bought this but it should&#x27;ve held up for more than a day. It does tangle easy, the clips don&#x27;t hold well unless you use hair spray with it, and after all of my efforts it ended up falling out after I made sure that the clips were firmly set.</li>
            <li> These are horrible! So much shedding! I wore it for a couple days and all the hair was out of the clip! That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap. I do not recommend even tho it comes fast it still is so bad.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and good quality !</li>
            <li> Not the right color. It&#x27;s synthetic. It&#x27;s just crap.</li>
            <li> PERFECT. Although if you have think hair like I do you should absoutley order two. They can be curled. (I curled mine on low heat). They are easy to brush and although they tangle easily they can be brushed out. I strongly recommend these gorgeous extensions!</li>
            <li> I decided i no longer wanted this hair extention. i returned the piece and they fully credited my money back.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be dark brown and when I put it up to my hair it is a light brown with a red tent to it.</li>
            <li> Very nice piece like clip ins they hold in place.</li>
            <li> I received my hair in the mail the other day and I absolutely fell in love with it! It looks like real hair, feels like real hair, I  can even turn my straightener on low and straighten it. I get soooo many complements on it all the time. I really really really love this product and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all. As soon as I started to run my fingers through it, the hair started to fall out.</li>
            <li> Takes waayy too long to get!!</li>
            <li> Deliver took a bit long.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is really LONG !!!&lt;br /&gt;Hair is reallt think !!!&lt;br /&gt;Colour is same as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair tangles allot.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot curl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.... its worth your money.. if you are looking for extra lenght, I would say purchase this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad at all</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how beautiful this is!  Just got it in the mail and I am floored.  I just ordered another and I have big plans.</li>
            <li> The hair is great but you have to take good care of it</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but does create a different look that is fun to wear on certain occasions. Can&#x27;t really brush it because it would mangle the look of it, so shake it out, brush through with your fingers and store it carefully to avoid tangles.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality when compared to the price.  I cut and thin out all of my pieces to match my layered locks, so, if you do not do that yourself, then I can&#x27;t say how impressed you will be with a &#x27;natural look.&#x27; But, I can say they do lean on the waxy/shiny side.... I dust my piece thouroughly with baby powder and pat and brush through before wearing.... my mom was a beautition in the height of wigs and hair pieces and she could not even tell it was in.  I have never had the need to style one, so I cannot attest to it holding up to heat, but use caution by only using heating irons that have control over heat level and use low heat...  this piece was not too thin and not too thick... I still layer and thin out mine, because I have thin hair, so a big chunky hair piece on me does not look natural.  I also have never washed one, but at this price, by the time most people have to wash a hair piece, another brand new one could be on the way... lol.  I&#x27;m sold.... will get more.  Word of advice....back up the stitching on the clips if you can.... at these prices never hurts to guaranty your piece won&#x27;t fall out in the middle of flirting with that hottie...</li>
            <li> the hair feels really silky and real it doesn&#x27;t tangle it doesn&#x27;t shed like some of the reviews I saw stated. I&#x27;m really happy with it. And it came sooner than the expected date!</li>
            <li> About this product...I can only say I was trhoughly disapointed with the amount of hair on the extension. I wish there was more hair on it and be less heavy, I mean that the clips and area around them is so thick and the hair so sparse that it feels like a like of clips giving me a bulky line and the some hAirs just for show.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it looks pretty to look at and feel, but it&#x27;s just not very practical. Can&#x27;t wear it so that&#x27;s a problem. For someone else it may be just what they wanted but for me it just did not work.</li>
            <li> They are nice. They look close to real. The color is a pretty, deep brown. They&#x27;re just awfully heavy.</li>
            <li> i loved it. im a satasfied costumer. the hair is soft and feels like natural. hair &amp; matched my hair perfect.  i recomened it. es muj suwave yse siente como pelo natural. io se los recomiendo &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> So far so good! Its a bit longer than I expected but thats not a bad thing!</li>
            <li> The hair was good but it didn&#x27;t look or feel as real as I thought and the color was a lot lighter than my hair. however, You can use heat tools with it on a low setting which is very nice!</li>
            <li> I will buy again. Got tangled easy. Cut shorter plenty long(: looks real.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried it and gets super tangled so I went out and bought real ones.</li>
            <li> The hair comes out easily where it&#x27;s sown in. I tried to trim them and they dulled my scissors but if you want to experiment before buying real ones and paying the money for them this is a good way to go(:</li>
            <li> Had trouble with the tangles in the hair. Other than that it was a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Clips are very weird and don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmologist. These extensions are very silky soft. But make sure you choose a color that matches yours. I have black hair and figured I&#x27;d just dye these extensions to match. But they will not take color at all.&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t wear them, I decided to use them for cutting practice, but their limp-ness didn&#x27;t take a nice layered cut very well either.</li>
            <li> Not the color they described at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long and pretty. it is very fake and obvious though. Needs more layers. It also sheds every where, which is kind of gross</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have short hair and am growing it out (it&#x27;s at the awkward stage) I have to wear it in a pony tail because I have thick hair but so far hasn&#x27;t shed and it looks good I wear a headband because of the clips but it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> I really like it.. but if you have thick or poffy hair you might wanna buy 2 or 3.. the clips are very sturdy so that&#x27;s good.. its very soft and long.. I would buy again.. ;)</li>
            <li> One of the clips was broken, but I blame it on the distance of the shipping, not the company. However, they aren&#x27;t able to be bleached! I love them otherwise.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and shiny but they are so long they are easily tangled.&lt;br /&gt;I spend about an hour every night detangling and straightening on very low heat and they aren&#x27;t nearly as beautiful as when I first bought them. They really are so long and gorgeous it&#x27;s just so frustrating that they tangle so easily. They are very cheap though and I&#x27;ve always used human hair so this is definitely not as good. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again unless I can find out how to keep them in better condition</li>
            <li> Not as long as pictured. Howecver its a beautiful synthetic piece. Easy to style. Hairs fall out on the quicks. Its a great help though.</li>
            <li> accidentally got sent the wrong thing, but i emailed them and they were very polite, very considerate, and they corrected their mistake as well as apologized many times and sent me an extra small gift for my troubles. they were great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful I love them. So pretty</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually worn this out of the house, yet.. But it is very straight and silky looking.. I am sure it will look very pretty.. The only problem i have is with the combs being a little uncomfortable.. But, I haven&#x27;t really worn it ,outside  or anything , for any length of time, yet.</li>
            <li> for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> CHEAP HAIR FOR CHEAP PRICE</li>
            <li> Great for the cost. It is very shiny and my hair is long, but totally dead from having blonde hair recently. It took like a month to get to my house, and they don&#x27;t provide a tracking number which was annoying. Also the strip of clips is a bit too long for my head, but I&#x27;m also a really little person. All in all it is really nice and long, one piece works for me.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair do not buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> shipped fast, is thick and heavy, but for $5 you can&#x27;t beat that! also it is darker than what it is in the picture</li>
            <li> Not what i thought it Would look like , it&#x27;s pretty simple . I guess it goes with the price</li>
            <li> Extremely fake, super long. It looks soooo fake and feels so fake as well.  I ordered dark brown and it came in as a auburn.. Extremely unhappy... I didn&#x27;t expect to much because of how cheap it is but this is not even decent. Oh and its REALLY heavy</li>
            <li> I loved it for the first few times I used it, but then it started to get kind of wavy.  Some strands were stating to get more bumps and waves in them, so it got kind of frizzy after the third time I used it.  It also took a little less than a month to get here. Other than that it looked pretty good in my hair  I have dark brown hair with a kind of faded red in it because of how I dyed my hair a year ago.  It blended in well with my hair and added a great deal of length.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It didnt match up right :( and was super shiney</li>
            <li> Exactly the right color. Matched my hair perfectly which at the time was dark auburn brown. Just a little longer than I expected. And was a little shinier than my own hair. To be expected with artificial hair. Otherwise a great product. Friends were envious!</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful color, however its got an auburn tint to it.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted it matches my hair it&#x27;s thick and it&#x27;s really long</li>
            <li> okay, so i ordered mine Feb 6, took about 2 days to send out, and it came in Feb 22, i am in California btw...came from Honk kong i believe.. i have the dark brown one, its a mixed with a slight winey red and dark brown, its beautiful, VERY LONG. im not to fond of the clips because it pulls my hair a little which hurts.. i have no yet tried to straighten it or curl it, which i need to for a wedding soon.. so far im happy with it... so well see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kanekalon Fiber- do your research.. ive gotten that its good hair to mess with and then its not so im confused a little on the quality.</li>
            <li> It took a while to recieve full package but they were extremely nice I give them four stars, the actual hair was a very nice product I&#x27;ve bought the same ones for my girlfriend from salons that weren&#x27;t this nice</li>
            <li> Pretty decent hair extension for the price! Some customers stated that some of the clips were broken, but mine were fine, no problems at all. It stays clipped in very well with minimal effort after parting your hair half-up. As for the quality - It&#x27;s very soft, shiny and not fake looking at all. It has red undertones in the sunlight, which for me is fine since my hair does as well. However, if you&#x27;re someone who is looking for an almost black, red free extension, this isn&#x27;t it. The only thing for me was that when brushing it gently, some of the hair fell out, which is to be expected for only $5, so no real huge complaints. Overall, worth it!</li>
            <li> The moment we took them out of package the hair was  falling out of the clips and still are, by far worse product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Haven&#x27;t even been able to wear them.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  Good quality!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its A good extensions but the color was not my color i ordered dark brown and it looked red when i got it and when i ran my fingers through the hair it already started coming off . It just wasnt for me</li>
            <li> I thought the dark brown would be a DARK BROWN it&#x27;s more like a reddish burgendy ..it&#x27;s very nappy</li>
            <li> You would need to buy a lot to meet expectations for what the product looks and says it is. Yeah</li>
            <li> Cute for play. Like pics. I don&#x27;t think I would wear it in public though</li>
            <li> Got here quick and they are super long and look like real hair.</li>
            <li> Just purchased these extensions! Shipping took a while but still earlier than the expected delivery date. I don&#x27;t have thin hair but my hair is also not super thick kind of just in the middle so these extensions don&#x27;t blend exactly right with it, most likely going to purchase a second one to add more thickness to them. Other than that, I got dark brown ones and they&#x27;re such a gorgeous dark chocolate look but with a red tint which is fine with me because my hair is like that anyways. They&#x27;re super soft and long and I straightened them when I took them out of the package because they were a bit wavy but they look so pretty. Great buy for $5 which will actually be $10 when I get the second one but still super cheap for the nice quality. They clip in really easily too, I barely notice they&#x27;re in my hair. Absolutely love.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really get them in my hair.</li>
            <li> Surprising thick and very long!  I was amazed at how beautiful the extensions are.  They are very nice quality and look real.  I had to cut some of it shorter to flow with my natural hair (and I have really long hair).  The color is right on also - I ordered dark brown.  For shipping from another country, MapofBeauty did a good job in getting the extensions to me in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Loved the hair! So shiny and looked so real. I wore it to a concert and was afraid of it getting tangled and ratty. It stayed great all night. All the tangles brushed right out and looked good as new. It was an exact match to my hair.  I ordered 2 because I have thick long hair. But,  I only needed one. It arrived about 2 weeks early. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not even close to dark brown..smh! Terrible!!</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday! but love it. soft a good amount of hair- clips look great! Plan to use for the first time tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for price!!! But make sure if you have thick hair buy 2!!! Needed to order another because it was too obvious it was fake with just one.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money , its really shiny doesn&#x27;t look natural at all &amp; sheds &amp; get VERY tangled ,never agin</li>
            <li> Terrible, cheap, thin, fell out a ton, and knotted. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This piece is lovely. Just a heads up though- if you want a true brown, this is not the piece for you. This has cinnamon overtones to it and is not a simple dark brown because it has a great deal of red. It is a really nice piece and I have re-ordered a different color because you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> I showed were  natural hair ends so pretty its like a espresso brown</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the low price...but it was AMAZING! It isn&#x27;t gross thin like I expected. It went perfect with my hair!! Love, love, love!</li>
