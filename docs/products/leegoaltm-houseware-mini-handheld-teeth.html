            <li>Good well.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review, so happy with my buy</li>
            <li>However, its a good price and&lt;br /&gt;according</li>
            <li>to all the reviews its a good product</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>..not so good</li>
            <li>it was as described, good purchase</li>
            <li>So for me, I can&#x27;t give a fair review.</li>

            <li>Love this product, works great with the 5 min whitening gel from walmart</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great item and received quickly!</li>
            <li>and I have seen an amazing change in my teeth in a week.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly with my whitening pen.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the whitening results and I assume the light couldn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>&amp; I loved the price even more...</li>
            <li>What kind of company sends things like that?</li>
            <li>Kind of tricky getting the batteries inserted correctly.</li>
            <li>Just being honest because I was asked to by the seller who gave me a discount.  </li>
            <li>If you can prove it doesn&#x27;t work, please don&#x27;t bother telling me as I already own it.</li>
            <li>I received this at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>It came in good shape and the light does turn on, so that is good.</li>
            <li>Nice one for the price</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but it took a while and so research on how to use it since it did not come with any instructions.</li>
            <li>I used it with a whitening gel and it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>: I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li>FAST shipping, works great!</li>
            <li>brand new product, excellent price.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue my use and look forward to more products from the seller! :)</li>
            <li>The LED light is really bright .</li>
            <li>Light is bright and improves gel whitening when used in conjunction.</li>
            <li>it has a nice bright light love</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t drop it, it breaks easily, but works well we ordered another and we had a replacement in a day!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with any teeth whitener!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super bright &amp; you can practically use it as a flash light!</li>
            <li>as described :)</li>
            <li>and I get faster and better results.</li>
            <li>I paid 3$ for it but in just two days it has done more whitening than my dentist has ever done</li>
            <li>What a difference this light makes with my whitening gel!</li>
            <li>but it sure looks like it.</li>
            <li>The light is good value for so cheap</li>
            <li>IT DOES, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT??</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>but this might work better if they gave even a scrap of paper for even the most cursory instructions on use.</li>
            <li>How come  more then one month&lt;br /&gt;until</li>
            <li>Enjoying this product</li>
            <li>Heh... make sure you read the information.</li>
            <li>it does not affect, just a light!.</li>
            <li>In just one week, I have seen much better results</li>
            <li>and then you will be able to turn it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>but I am glad it does come with working battery&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Make sure to always use with some sort of whitening paste</li>
            <li>Use all the time and love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the teeth whitener</li>
            <li>Good product, ok price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>So excited to have this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very important for you to also have gel because the led light itself doesn&#x27;t whiten</li>
            <li>I cannot for sure say that the light makes any difference in the tooth whitening kit I bought to do at home.  </li>
            <li>The light would have served a greater purpose had it come with &amp;#34;the gel AND the trays for your teeth!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Ok so my dad was messing around with this light and held it up to his eyes and his vision went blurry and a lot of pressure went to his eyes.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold in your mouth as you go about your business</li>
            <li>This is easy to hold in your mouth and does not slip on the guard when whitening teeth while doing your household chores.  </li>
            <li>Lite weight and easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to wear.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just tun it on and hold it securely between your lips; easy to care for, but NOT watertight I suspect, so</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear and cleans up easily, which is why I assigned 2 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Mine works fine</li>
            <li>so I guess just invest in the time and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>once I found and removed it was working just fine...</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>very cheap plastic, you have to hold it just right for the light to stay on.</li>
            <li>i used it one time and it worked ok,not a huge difference in using this along with teeth whitening gel.</li>
            <li>The light seemed to work to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>I used whitening gel in conjunction with the light.</li>
            <li>Cheap price as well.  </li>
            <li>The light alone will do nothing</li>
            <li>Comfortable while using.</li>
            <li>I started off with that statement because I received this light without instructions or suggestions.  </li>
            <li>I had to figure out that I need to purchase a gel whitener to pair with this accelerator light.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>Great my teeth are already white cause</li>
            <li>It had no directions with the light and never mentioned that there was plastic between the batteries that had to be removed.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a one word description of this light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would not recommend this light from this seller.  </li>
            <li>so figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try the kit and also a light.</li>
            <li>So I am a walking \\&quot;poster child\\&quot; for the benefits of LED light.</li>
            <li>I tend to leave the light on my teeth about 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the light.</li>
            <li>The light does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant because it is so cheap</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of ordering the light but not the solution.  </li>
            <li>It comes with batteries and the light turns on as it should.  </li>
            <li>There is basically no weight this this light.  </li>
            <li>THE LIGHT DOES WORK WELL EVEN WITHOUT THE SYRINGES</li>
            <li>BUT THE LIGHT DIES</li>
            <li>Cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This light did seem to help with the whitening process.</li>
            <li>Seems good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li>The light is very bright and not defective like a previous one.....</li>
            <li>it would still be worth it!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product however upon opening the box</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and most of them say it doesn&#x27;t work but the first time using it</li>
            <li>So  excited to whiten my teeth tonight</li>
            <li>Once this is removed the light works fine and the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good to have as a backup if the one that came in my actual package stops working</li>
            <li>brightens your smile quickly!</li>
            <li>U need a special paste for it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to find the special batteries just to make them work, if I even can.</li>
            <li>After the first one  did not work the  second one I received has been doing much better thank you !!</li>
            <li>This seems to amplify the whitening process really quickly</li>
            <li>It seems to work, I know that most professional whitening uses trays, gels and uv light.</li>
            <li>Tried my teeth whitening first two times without this light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable &amp; I don&#x27;t have to sit &amp; hold the LED light in place.</li>
            <li>some of theese always came whith problems, but its ok, the seller always send new ones for the defectives.</li>
            <li>Works good but stays on very long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really into clean teeth very neat product will order more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Even though I could not get a positive result from the whitener which  I used with this, I need to say that this LED light visibly expedite the activity of whitening product</li>
            <li>Works pretty well too!</li>
            <li>Getting married August 1st can&#x27;t wait to see ending results!</li>
            <li>And new batteries are worth more than the product itself.</li>
            <li>The light turns right on first try, a nice blue</li>
            <li>Product is good little light which helps accelerate teeth whitening products.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this works especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>30 minutes with light showed better results than all night with gel only!</li>
            <li>If you order this product, make sure to take out the clear plastic piece between the batteries</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Everything was worth gettingðªð¯ð°</li>
            <li>They work beautifully, I will definitely order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>This one works right</li>
            <li>I happened to have a gel on hand to work with right away.  </li>
            <li>The price was right to give it a try.</li>
            <li>product is not in any sealed package which give you an uneasy feeling right away.  </li>
            <li>im really enjoy these new products for my teeth</li>
            <li>received this item quick and fast but its not working...</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a cheaper version actually worked really good.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, product is lightweight, which I really like.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this light along with these strips (Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Strips 28</li>
            <li>At first I thought so to</li>
            <li>The ones that were already in it did not last more than four uses.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference the light makes.</li>
            <li>In one application of the gel and this light I saw a marked difference.  </li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on very upset!</li>
            <li>This nothing more then a hustle from China - junk, no instructions,  BIG joke.</li>
            <li>And for bleaching at home &amp; or for maintaining the results of a professional bleaching, I have learned to find the strongest % bleach available, which can be found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>this really works!</li>
            <li>Used it the first day with dazzlingWHITE whitening pen I bought from Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li>I used this the first day I got.</li>
            <li>if it actually does anything productive is another question:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item was very scratched up and didn&#x27;t look new, so I expressed my concerns to Amazon who were right on it and did refund my original purchase amount, still out $5.00 for batteries.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, seriously.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much.</li>
            <li>Easy to put back together.</li>
            <li>Go with this one Simple to use.is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I suspect that there is a certain amount of &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; involved in this</li>
            <li>The light is bright and small enough to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li>I got this accelerator light after my other one fell in a full sink and malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li>really whitens your teeth</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>Really speeds up whitening.</li>
            <li>and it seems to really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I use it with them, and only keep the strips and light in my mouth for 10 mins.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t get your light to turn on simply twist the battery cover and remove both batteries.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonably priced gadget that increases the power of gel tooth whiteners.</li>
            <li>I used the gel for days and saw a very gradual result.  </li>
            <li>It is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>Inwaited a whole month for this product to come in and I.finally got it</li>
            <li>If someone can prove to all of us that it works than it deserves a 5-star rating simply because it is cheap.</li>
            <li>It really helped the gel to work faster.</li>
            <li>What I have is a blue flash light.</li>
            <li>They are reasonable in price but really make the brightening gel work to its maximum.</li>
            <li>You do actually need whitening gel before using this light...</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think its whiting my teeth</li>
            <li>I am a big believer in \\&quot;light treatment\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have an entire spa system set up in my home that is all \\&quot;skin light treatment\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This product does come with batteries &amp; instructions (all ready to go).</li>
            <li>So it was simply a matter of placing the LED light gadget over my trays.</li>
            <li>service was very helpful and this works for faster results....</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t notice a difference...</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY FAST IVE HAD THREE ALREADY</li>
            <li>it hope it really works</li>
            <li>This alone will not whiten your teeth you need the whole kit no need to be sold alone</li>
            <li>Just got this, and started using it I can&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li>I used this light with the 35% peroxide I got on here, and my teeth were glaring white in five minutes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been three days and my teeth are already a nice white</li>
            <li>Works good and to turn it on you have t open the battery and take out a clear disc then turn it on only downside</li>
            <li>Slow delivery but good product.</li>
            <li>But it does function as expected, lights up with a UV light, doesn&#x27;t feel hot or burn that I could tell.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to buy one for alot of money unless it was by professional.</li>
            <li>It seems to be pretty well built and is dependable so far.</li>
            <li>Cheap and fast shipping.it works like it should .theres not much to review but for 2$ I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t send it back because it cost more to send back than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more 2 star reviews on this, especially considering the low price!</li>
            <li>and they left his teeth with stains, so we are going to try the professional teeth whitening light to make his teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>and she asked if I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened!!</li>
            <li>This product really worked for me like getting my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have to do the whitening treatment for 15 min 2x&#x27;s a day for 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li>Works good as a flashlight... not sure if actually helps whitening.</li>
            <li>So down to the review:  I found that this light for whatever reason really does enhance the power of my gel whitener.  ???  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to buy a new battery.</li>
            <li>I finally took the next step &amp; ordered this LED light.</li>
            <li>My other light up thing broke quickly (idk if it was a product defect or if it got wet or if it was a s***ty brand).</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>After seeing celebs post themselves on IG using these devices I decided I wanted to try it for myself, but I knew that the ones they were using were the real and expensive kind and as much I wanted my teeth to be whiten</li>
            <li>I noticed results first time I tried it, although I did use it with a whitening gel (shown in the picture: plus white whitening gel, 4$ at wal mart)</li>
            <li>One of the units was acting funny with the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>No way I would ever dare to allow it near my mouth!</li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty white naturally</li>
            <li>and then just pop the light in your mouth and the little rubber tray glows.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say I&#x27;m noticing a difference in using this little light, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed for 2 weeks and saw a clear difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>Would need a professional opinion to verify that.</li>
            <li>Completely as described.  </li>
            <li>The price is so low that I think anyone who wants to give it a test run should.  </li>
            <li>It was also very disconcerting that no instructions were included, I had to go back and look at the product description on here to know how to use it.</li>
            <li>me just buy crest 3d whote professional strips they work</li>
            <li>I have had my teeth professionally lightened.</li>
            <li>they were so sensitive for about two days.so if u can stand the pain.</li>
            <li>Just make sure u open the battery and take out the little plastic separating the batteries so that it can work!</li>
            <li>Arrived okay, was never bright, and within a week it was basically a dud</li>
            <li>This little gadget was a tremendous help to speed up the process of whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>a few hours later my noticed that the light was on.</li>
            <li>but if you take the time to open it there are clear instructions on the inside of the battery slot telling you to remove the applicator and flip both batteries around!</li>
            <li>Over all great product, the only thing bad I would have to say about it is that it makes my teeth very sensitive the day I use it.</li>
            <li>Only used one time so far...</li>
            <li>So far the switch for the 2nd unit is still working</li>
            <li>Wow, I used it with the whitening fluid my dentist gave me...</li>
            <li>Because you have to show up to be able to play in the game.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was way too slow and the light is lightweight and not well made.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use but a little messy and hurts sensitive teeth but does the job</li>
            <li>It really does work, but I feel kinda weird putting the light to my body.</li>
            <li>I am not really sure if the blue light helped speed the process or if it got my teeth any extra white</li>
            <li>It functions properly, but I have only used it twice, so it is too early to tell if it actually speeds up the whitening.</li>
            <li>At first I used it every couple of days, but that was harsh on my enamel</li>
            <li>Some people complain about it coming and not working, you have to take the batteries out when you first get it and take the little plastic thing out to put the batteries back in otherwise</li>
            <li>That is far too long!</li>
            <li>So using the strongest bleach gel definitely works for me, but it usually takes at least 21 days or more of bleaching every single day for a whole hour, until I truly get the results I want.</li>

            <li> Good well.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review, so happy with my buy</li>
            <li> However, its a good price and&lt;br /&gt;according</li>
            <li> to all the reviews its a good product</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> ..not so good</li>
            <li> it was as described, good purchase</li>
            <li> So for me, I can&#x27;t give a fair review.</li>
            <li> This helped me teeth really good because I didn&#x27;t not so god teeth now</li>
            <li> This worked great for my teeth, and it was very easy to use.</li>

            <li> and I have seen an amazing change in my teeth in a week.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly with my whitening pen.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the whitening results and I assume the light couldn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> &amp; I loved the price even more...</li>
            <li> What kind of company sends things like that?</li>
            <li> Kind of tricky getting the batteries inserted correctly.</li>
            <li> Just being honest because I was asked to by the seller who gave me a discount.  </li>
            <li> If you can prove it doesn&#x27;t work, please don&#x27;t bother telling me as I already own it.</li>
            <li> I received this at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> It came in good shape and the light does turn on, so that is good.</li>
            <li> Nice one for the price</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it took a while and so research on how to use it since it did not come with any instructions.</li>
            <li> I used it with a whitening gel and it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> : I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> FAST shipping, works great!</li>
            <li> brand new product, excellent price.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue my use and look forward to more products from the seller! :)</li>
            <li> The LED light is really bright .</li>
            <li> Light is bright and improves gel whitening when used in conjunction.</li>
            <li> it has a nice bright light love</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t drop it, it breaks easily, but works well we ordered another and we had a replacement in a day!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with any teeth whitener!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super bright &amp; you can practically use it as a flash light!</li>
            <li> as described :)</li>
            <li> and I get faster and better results.</li>
            <li> I paid 3$ for it but in just two days it has done more whitening than my dentist has ever done</li>
            <li> What a difference this light makes with my whitening gel!</li>
            <li> but it sure looks like it.</li>
            <li> The light is good value for so cheap</li>
            <li> IT DOES, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT??</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> but this might work better if they gave even a scrap of paper for even the most cursory instructions on use.</li>
            <li> How come  more then one month&lt;br /&gt;until</li>
            <li> Enjoying this product</li>
            <li> Heh... make sure you read the information.</li>
            <li> it does not affect, just a light!.</li>
            <li> In just one week, I have seen much better results</li>
            <li> and then you will be able to turn it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> but I am glad it does come with working battery&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Make sure to always use with some sort of whitening paste</li>
            <li> Use all the time and love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the teeth whitener</li>
            <li> Good product, ok price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So excited to have this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very important for you to also have gel because the led light itself doesn&#x27;t whiten</li>
            <li> I cannot for sure say that the light makes any difference in the tooth whitening kit I bought to do at home.  </li>
            <li> The light would have served a greater purpose had it come with &amp;#34;the gel AND the trays for your teeth!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ok so my dad was messing around with this light and held it up to his eyes and his vision went blurry and a lot of pressure went to his eyes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold in your mouth as you go about your business</li>
            <li> This is easy to hold in your mouth and does not slip on the guard when whitening teeth while doing your household chores.  </li>
            <li> Lite weight and easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just tun it on and hold it securely between your lips; easy to care for, but NOT watertight I suspect, so</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear and cleans up easily, which is why I assigned 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Mine works fine</li>
            <li> so I guess just invest in the time and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> once I found and removed it was working just fine...</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> very cheap plastic, you have to hold it just right for the light to stay on.</li>
            <li> i used it one time and it worked ok,not a huge difference in using this along with teeth whitening gel.</li>
            <li> The light seemed to work to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I used whitening gel in conjunction with the light.</li>
            <li> Cheap price as well.  </li>
            <li> The light alone will do nothing</li>
            <li> Comfortable while using.</li>
            <li> I started off with that statement because I received this light without instructions or suggestions.  </li>
            <li> I had to figure out that I need to purchase a gel whitener to pair with this accelerator light.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> Great my teeth are already white cause</li>
            <li> It had no directions with the light and never mentioned that there was plastic between the batteries that had to be removed.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a one word description of this light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would not recommend this light from this seller.  </li>
            <li> so figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try the kit and also a light.</li>
            <li> So I am a walking \\&quot;poster child\\&quot; for the benefits of LED light.</li>
            <li> I tend to leave the light on my teeth about 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the light.</li>
            <li> The light does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because it is so cheap</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering the light but not the solution.  </li>
            <li> It comes with batteries and the light turns on as it should.  </li>
            <li> There is basically no weight this this light.  </li>
            <li> THE LIGHT DOES WORK WELL EVEN WITHOUT THE SYRINGES</li>
            <li> BUT THE LIGHT DIES</li>
            <li> Cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This light did seem to help with the whitening process.</li>
            <li> Seems good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li> The light is very bright and not defective like a previous one.....</li>
            <li> it would still be worth it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product however upon opening the box</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and most of them say it doesn&#x27;t work but the first time using it</li>
            <li> So  excited to whiten my teeth tonight</li>
            <li> Once this is removed the light works fine and the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good to have as a backup if the one that came in my actual package stops working</li>
            <li> brightens your smile quickly!</li>
            <li> U need a special paste for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to find the special batteries just to make them work, if I even can.</li>
            <li> After the first one  did not work the  second one I received has been doing much better thank you !!</li>
            <li> This seems to amplify the whitening process really quickly</li>
            <li> It seems to work, I know that most professional whitening uses trays, gels and uv light.</li>
            <li> Tried my teeth whitening first two times without this light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable &amp; I don&#x27;t have to sit &amp; hold the LED light in place.</li>
            <li> some of theese always came whith problems, but its ok, the seller always send new ones for the defectives.</li>
            <li> Works good but stays on very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really into clean teeth very neat product will order more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Even though I could not get a positive result from the whitener which  I used with this, I need to say that this LED light visibly expedite the activity of whitening product</li>
            <li> Works pretty well too!</li>
            <li> Getting married August 1st can&#x27;t wait to see ending results!</li>
            <li> And new batteries are worth more than the product itself.</li>
            <li> The light turns right on first try, a nice blue</li>
            <li> Product is good little light which helps accelerate teeth whitening products.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this works especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes with light showed better results than all night with gel only!</li>
            <li> If you order this product, make sure to take out the clear plastic piece between the batteries</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Everything was worth gettingðªð¯ð°</li>
            <li> They work beautifully, I will definitely order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> This one works right</li>
            <li> I happened to have a gel on hand to work with right away.  </li>
            <li> The price was right to give it a try.</li>
            <li> product is not in any sealed package which give you an uneasy feeling right away.  </li>
            <li> im really enjoy these new products for my teeth</li>
            <li> received this item quick and fast but its not working...</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a cheaper version actually worked really good.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, product is lightweight, which I really like.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this light along with these strips (Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Strips 28</li>
            <li> At first I thought so to</li>
            <li> The ones that were already in it did not last more than four uses.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference the light makes.</li>
            <li> In one application of the gel and this light I saw a marked difference.  </li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on very upset!</li>
            <li> This nothing more then a hustle from China - junk, no instructions,  BIG joke.</li>
            <li> And for bleaching at home &amp; or for maintaining the results of a professional bleaching, I have learned to find the strongest % bleach available, which can be found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this really works!</li>
            <li> Used it the first day with dazzlingWHITE whitening pen I bought from Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li> I used this the first day I got.</li>
            <li> if it actually does anything productive is another question:)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The item was very scratched up and didn&#x27;t look new, so I expressed my concerns to Amazon who were right on it and did refund my original purchase amount, still out $5.00 for batteries.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, seriously.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much.</li>
            <li> Easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> Go with this one Simple to use.is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I suspect that there is a certain amount of &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; involved in this</li>
            <li> The light is bright and small enough to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> I got this accelerator light after my other one fell in a full sink and malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li> really whitens your teeth</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> Really speeds up whitening.</li>
            <li> and it seems to really make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I use it with them, and only keep the strips and light in my mouth for 10 mins.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get your light to turn on simply twist the battery cover and remove both batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced gadget that increases the power of gel tooth whiteners.</li>
            <li> I used the gel for days and saw a very gradual result.  </li>
            <li> It is also very affordable.</li>
            <li> Inwaited a whole month for this product to come in and I.finally got it</li>
            <li> If someone can prove to all of us that it works than it deserves a 5-star rating simply because it is cheap.</li>
            <li> It really helped the gel to work faster.</li>
            <li> What I have is a blue flash light.</li>
            <li> They are reasonable in price but really make the brightening gel work to its maximum.</li>
            <li> You do actually need whitening gel before using this light...</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think its whiting my teeth</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in \\&quot;light treatment\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have an entire spa system set up in my home that is all \\&quot;skin light treatment\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product does come with batteries &amp; instructions (all ready to go).</li>
            <li> So it was simply a matter of placing the LED light gadget over my trays.</li>
            <li> service was very helpful and this works for faster results....</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t notice a difference...</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY FAST IVE HAD THREE ALREADY</li>
            <li> it hope it really works</li>
            <li> This alone will not whiten your teeth you need the whole kit no need to be sold alone</li>
            <li> Just got this, and started using it I can&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li> I used this light with the 35% peroxide I got on here, and my teeth were glaring white in five minutes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been three days and my teeth are already a nice white</li>
            <li> Works good and to turn it on you have t open the battery and take out a clear disc then turn it on only downside</li>
            <li> Slow delivery but good product.</li>
            <li> But it does function as expected, lights up with a UV light, doesn&#x27;t feel hot or burn that I could tell.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to buy one for alot of money unless it was by professional.</li>
            <li> It seems to be pretty well built and is dependable so far.</li>
            <li> Cheap and fast shipping.it works like it should .theres not much to review but for 2$ I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t send it back because it cost more to send back than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more 2 star reviews on this, especially considering the low price!</li>
            <li> and they left his teeth with stains, so we are going to try the professional teeth whitening light to make his teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Wow!!  </li>
            <li> and she asked if I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened!!</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me like getting my teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have to do the whitening treatment for 15 min 2x&#x27;s a day for 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li> Works good as a flashlight... not sure if actually helps whitening.</li>
            <li> So down to the review:  I found that this light for whatever reason really does enhance the power of my gel whitener.  ???  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to buy a new battery.</li>
            <li> I finally took the next step &amp; ordered this LED light.</li>
            <li> My other light up thing broke quickly (idk if it was a product defect or if it got wet or if it was a s***ty brand).</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> After seeing celebs post themselves on IG using these devices I decided I wanted to try it for myself, but I knew that the ones they were using were the real and expensive kind and as much I wanted my teeth to be whiten</li>
            <li> I noticed results first time I tried it, although I did use it with a whitening gel (shown in the picture: plus white whitening gel, 4$ at wal mart)</li>
            <li> One of the units was acting funny with the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> No way I would ever dare to allow it near my mouth!</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty white naturally</li>
            <li> and then just pop the light in your mouth and the little rubber tray glows.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I&#x27;m noticing a difference in using this little light, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed for 2 weeks and saw a clear difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Would need a professional opinion to verify that.</li>
            <li> Completely as described.  </li>
            <li> The price is so low that I think anyone who wants to give it a test run should.  </li>
            <li> It was also very disconcerting that no instructions were included, I had to go back and look at the product description on here to know how to use it.</li>
            <li> me just buy crest 3d whote professional strips they work</li>
            <li> I have had my teeth professionally lightened.</li>
            <li> they were so sensitive for about two days.so if u can stand the pain.</li>
            <li> Just make sure u open the battery and take out the little plastic separating the batteries so that it can work!</li>
            <li> Arrived okay, was never bright, and within a week it was basically a dud</li>
            <li> This little gadget was a tremendous help to speed up the process of whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> a few hours later my noticed that the light was on.</li>
            <li> but if you take the time to open it there are clear instructions on the inside of the battery slot telling you to remove the applicator and flip both batteries around!</li>
            <li> Over all great product, the only thing bad I would have to say about it is that it makes my teeth very sensitive the day I use it.</li>
            <li> Only used one time so far...</li>
            <li> So far the switch for the 2nd unit is still working</li>
            <li> Wow, I used it with the whitening fluid my dentist gave me...</li>
            <li> Because you have to show up to be able to play in the game.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was way too slow and the light is lightweight and not well made.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use but a little messy and hurts sensitive teeth but does the job</li>
            <li> It really does work, but I feel kinda weird putting the light to my body.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure if the blue light helped speed the process or if it got my teeth any extra white</li>
            <li> It functions properly, but I have only used it twice, so it is too early to tell if it actually speeds up the whitening.</li>
            <li> At first I used it every couple of days, but that was harsh on my enamel</li>
            <li> Some people complain about it coming and not working, you have to take the batteries out when you first get it and take the little plastic thing out to put the batteries back in otherwise</li>
            <li> That is far too long!</li>
            <li> So using the strongest bleach gel definitely works for me, but it usually takes at least 21 days or more of bleaching every single day for a whole hour, until I truly get the results I want.</li>
            <li> Came with dead batteries but with new batteries it helped whiten my teeth a ton!</li>
            <li> I was tired of my teeth not looking white enough, now I can smile without feeling wondering if anyone is watching my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really do like this, but the batteries are really hard to find.</li>
            <li> I got this a long with a gel tooth whitener to help whiten my teeth since I&#x27;ve quit smoking</li>
            <li> A waste of money do not waste your money out of this is not do anything for you believe me</li>
            <li> I hope the battery lasts long...</li>
            <li> Hope it last longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.... took a while to arive tough.</li>
            <li> The lights last ((on average))</li>
            <li> now they are white when using this along with the extreme whitening gel kit!  </li>
            <li> Was a little Skeptical about this because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> My mom only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I expected some sort of instructions or encouragement of how to use this item.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really curious what brand this is?</li>
            <li> I thought it was small enough that it wasn&#x27;t awkward to fit into my mouth for the time either.</li>
            <li> It has lasted than what I expected from other reviews.</li>
            <li> You should not get tired of holding between your teeth unless you are biting down on it the whole time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some other thing to buy.</li>
            <li> There are other lights like this on Amazon that ship from the USA.</li>
            <li> Delivery Was Faster Than Expected !</li>
            <li> not worth to buy...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work not worth the money</li>
            <li> at $1.89, it&#x27;s not worth replacing the battery.</li>
            <li> Most of the &#x27;as seen on TV\\&quot; bleaching products are worthless.</li>
            <li> Not real sure its working but</li>
            <li> I decided to order this one and after using it for less then a week</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it several times now and it only makes the whitening process difficult.</li>
            <li> As I saw in previous reviews the item was not delivered with a dead battery but did have a battery saver.</li>
            <li> I use this little gizmo with my whitening gel I got from my orthodontist</li>
            <li> I do like this little gadget</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment and a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have a little experience with teeth bleaching, so hopefully my review will help others.</li>
            <li> So it is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Came with dead batteries.  </li>
            <li> so dont waste your time purchasing this item</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money.</li>
            <li> today as i was about to use it again i realized the batteries are dead.</li>
            <li> I ordered this few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> The battery is dead.</li>
            <li> Dis like it nothing like the picture doesn&#x27;t work came with dead batteries</li>
            <li> keep in mind to flip the batteries and take out the plastic round thing inside.</li>
            <li> but I have read reviews complaining about the battery being dead on arrival.  </li>
            <li> Waste.....</li>
            <li> So its a waste</li>
            <li> battery was dead.</li>
            <li> Had some trouble getting started it has a plastic disk to prevent battery operation....</li>
            <li> It killed my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although inexpensive, batteries were dead</li>
            <li> Yet, it does not turn on consistently which makes it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Pointless, waste of money</li>
            <li> the product took long to come and plus it was broken when i eceived it</li>
            <li> this product is not worth it!!</li>
            <li> This little thing works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference between when I have lightened in the past without this gadget and now that I am using it.</li>
            <li> I was informed that the results are usually on teeth that are stained with coffee, wine, tea, or food stains.  </li>
            <li> Even once I get it on, I am not sure it will stay on when I put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Not sure....</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too back to add to the experience since you already have weird trays in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Not only did this thing arrive dirty and scratched to heck, the batteries included were completely dead</li>
            <li> Hard to say,</li>
            <li> AND TO EVERY REVIEW THAT COMPLAINED ABOUT BATTERIES BEING DEFECTIVE</li>
            <li> I mean you do place this item in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very small design.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to have in your mouth for 10-30 minutes, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> but she got frustrated with it because she felt it was working too slow.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but it works just as well as an expensive one.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be sorry....</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so scratched and dirty.</li>
            <li> bad did not work.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>
            <li> That was very disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> shows both your teeth&#x27;s finest and worst parts.</li>
            <li> but damn this is an awful product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible</li>
            <li> worst product ever bought.</li>
            <li> I find this thing horrible to try to hold in my mouth, with the tray of whitening gel, for 10-20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product, ok price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> really whitens your teeth</li>
            <li> The light seemed to work to whiten my teeth. I used whitening gel in conjunction with the light.</li>
            <li> Just as I thought. Good well.</li>
            <li> IÂ´m using it with the gel and results are great</li>
            <li> This is a very good item. It&#x27;s super bright &amp; you can practically use it as a flash light! Works pretty well too! I like it alot &amp; I loved the price even more... it was under $4 bucks!</li>
            <li> brand new product, excellent price. Bright LED. Cant beat the deal. Although since overseas it did take a while to get here.</li>
            <li> some of theese always came whith problems, but its ok, the seller always send new ones for the defectives.</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail I was expecting it to be package in a hygienic form but, it wasn&#x27;t. It arrived in a zip-lock bag. What kind of company sends things like that? And I can&#x27;t send it back because it cost more to send back than what I paid for it. So it is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more 2 star reviews on this, especially considering the low price! This worked great for my teeth, and it was very easy to use. I used it as directed for 2 weeks and saw a clear difference in my teeth. I plan to continue my use and look forward to more products from the seller! :) Thanks.</li>
            <li> This seemed to do the job.  My son had yellow teeth from medicine he took as a child...now they are white when using this along with the extreme whitening gel kit!  Cheap price as well.  Just don&#x27;t drop it, it breaks easily, but works well we ordered another and we had a replacement in a day!</li>
            <li> No directions!!! How do I Use this?</li>
            <li> great deal and quality</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on 12/04/14 and did not receive it until 1/03/14. As I saw in previous reviews the item was not delivered with a dead battery but did have a battery saver. I have only used this a couple of times and I can see results when used with a gel teeth whitener.</li>
            <li> Hope it last longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! I saw a lot of complaints on here about this product, but I have NONE! I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a month, and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This really does work. I use the 5 minute whitening kit from Dollar Tree. Use the gel, the rubber tray they  give you and then just pop the light in your mouth and the little rubber tray glows. This seems to amplify the whitening process really quickly</li>
            <li> Came with dead batteries.  I bought another kit with whitening and it worked great. My teeth became whiter in a week. Seven days, fifteen mins.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Item as described :)</li>
            <li> received this item quick and fast but its not working...not worth to buy...so dont waste your time purchasing this item</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great. Kind of tricky getting the batteries inserted correctly. Really speeds up whitening. Can&#x27;t believe the excellent price.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this light along with these strips (Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Strips 28 Count - 14 Day Supply + Bonus Shade Guide) that I also purchased on Amazon and my teeth have been getting whiter each time I use them both. Not real sure its working but the combination of the teo have gotten my teeth a nice whiteness to them!</li>
            <li> It does seem to help and was affordable.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I&#x27;m noticing a difference in using this little light, but I don&#x27;t. It is comfortable to wear and cleans up easily, which is why I assigned 2 stars. I&#x27;ve used it 6 times now. I don&#x27;t see any difference between when I have lightened in the past without this gadget and now that I am using it. Bummer. I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I never actually got a chance to use this article! Believe it or not my dog are it! Need to buy another!</li>
            <li> I use this little gizmo with my whitening gel I got from my orthodontist and it seems to really make a difference.  Normally, I have to do the whitening treatment for 15 min 2x&#x27;s a day for 5-7 days.  With this, I only do 15-min for three days and I get faster and better results.</li>
            <li> It really does work, but I feel kinda weird putting the light to my body.</li>
            <li> This product is great, seriously. I paid 3$ for it but in just two days it has done more whitening than my dentist has ever done and I pay 250$ for one session if I paid 80$ for this product it would still be worth it! But take into consideration that my teeth are only slightly yellow and I leave it on in my mouth for 2.5hours WITH GEL it&#x27;s very important for you to also have gel because the led light itself doesn&#x27;t whiten you&#x27;re teeth, it kickstarts the hydrogen peroxide that&#x27;s in your teeth whitener giving you faster results.. The light alone will do nothing and I also got my whitening gel on Amazon for 5$!! AND TO EVERY REVIEW THAT COMPLAINED ABOUT BATTERIES BEING DEFECTIVE they aren&#x27;t!!! At first I thought so to but if you take the time to open it there are clear instructions on the inside of the battery slot telling you to remove the applicator and flip both batteries around! All in all awesome product couldn&#x27;t be happier &amp; hope this helps !!</li>
            <li> Well Made and Bright.  It may increase the whitening speed and improve the results.  Would need a professional opinion to verify that.</li>
            <li> I just hope my teeth like it too.  Haven&#x27;t yet noticed a whitening improvement.</li>
            <li> bad did not work. all parts not included</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product however upon opening the box I discovered that the unit did not work whatsoever. I tried to contact the seller but I received no response at all.</li>
            <li> Seems to be what was advertised.  Just started using hoping for  great results!!!</li>
            <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> WOW! What a difference this light makes with my whitening gel! 30 minutes with light showed better results than all night with gel only! A definate \\&quot;gotta have\\&quot; !</li>
            <li> Seems good so far. Getting married August 1st can&#x27;t wait to see ending results!</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great with the 5 min whitening gel from walmart it&#x27;s only been three days and my teeth are already a nice white but I don&#x27;t drink any caffeine or eat berries that could stain my teeth.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 2 hours then died. And new batteries are worth more than the product itself. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Item works as advertised. No problem. Comfortable while using.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only used one time so far...</li>
            <li> a lot of reviews said it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s because there is a plastic cover on the battery, take it off and it works like a charm!! great product and whitens teeth alot</li>
            <li> Pointless, waste of money</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!!! My teeth are supper white(: works best if you buy whitening strips and then use it while you have the strips on.</li>
            <li> My other light up thing broke quickly (idk if it was a product defect or if it got wet or if it was a s***ty brand). This one works right, I wash it regularly and it still works after. Idk if it does what its supposed to (enhance teeth whiting) but it sure looks like it.</li>
            <li> Mind as well invest your money in a actual product that works see no diffrence been using this product for a month</li>
            <li> Awsome! As someother reviewers have said, it works well with gel. I found that it works very good with the Dollar tree Bright Smile Whitening strips. I use it with them, and only keep the strips and light in my mouth for 10 mins. Onc I brush, there is a 3-4 shade difference. I am a smoker, and it even gets rid of the front tooth nicotine stains.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps speed the whirring process up.</li>
            <li> This thing makes my teeth blue!!  I just use the white strips without it now.  I used it twice and just see a hint of blue in my teeth.  Again....you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works good and to turn it on you have t open the battery and take out a clear disc then turn it on only downside it doesn&#x27;t come with jell or trays</li>
            <li> Slow delivery but good product.</li>
            <li> been using this with the 5 minute whitening gel and there is no change in color.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT DIDN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> The volume needs to be stronger</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.... took a while to arive tough.</li>
            <li> I do like this little gadget and I do think it helped along with the whitening trays.</li>
            <li> Gotta remove the plastic from battery</li>
            <li> Love this light can see a noticeable difference after one use with whitening cream!!!!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get your light to turn on simply twist the battery cover and remove both batteries. There will be a plastic film that you must remove before putting the batteries back in. Voila! It will now turn on.</li>
            <li> After seeing celebs post themselves on IG using these devices I decided I wanted to try it for myself, but I knew that the ones they were using were the real and expensive kind and as much I wanted my teeth to be whiten I wasn&#x27;t willing to buy one for alot of money unless it was by professional. I decided to order this one and after using it for less then a week I could see a difference instantly. I was surprised that a cheaper version actually worked really good.</li>
            <li> buyer beware!! this product is not worth it!! i used it one time and it worked ok,not a huge difference in using this along with teeth whitening gel. today as i was about to use it again i realized the batteries are dead. after one use! Such a disappointment and a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> it works but sow result</li>
            <li> The light is good value for so cheap but it just doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Wow!!  Great product for the price.  Completely as described.  Works great @ has batteries included.  So excited to have this product!</li>
            <li> Bottom was broke. HAVE TO HOLD TOGETHER TO USE</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and batteries were included. I have used it several times with my whitening strips and it does make a difference. It&#x27;s a little awkward to have in your mouth for 10-30 minutes, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review, so happy with my buy Ive been using it with my whitening tooth paste every night for 15 mins and I&#x27;m starting to see a big difference</li>
            <li> I really do like this, but the batteries are really hard to find. The ones that were already in it did not last more than four uses.</li>
            <li> U need a special paste for it they should add some with it and it didn&#x27;t have instructions</li>
            <li> IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?? works well with the 99 cent store whitening gel</li>
            <li> Tried my teeth whitening first two times without this light.  Wow, what a difference the light makes. i dont know how, but it does.</li>
            <li> I ordered this few weeks ago but I found that this product will be delivered to my house 20 to 30 days from now on. However, its a good price and&lt;br /&gt;according to all the reviews its a good product</li>
            <li> It functions properly, but I have only used it twice, so it is too early to tell if it actually speeds up the whitening.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work not worth the money</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced gadget that increases the power of gel tooth whiteners. I started off with that statement because I received this light without instructions or suggestions.  I had to figure out that I need to purchase a gel whitener to pair with this accelerator light.  No problem.  I happened to have a gel on hand to work with right away.  This is just heads up for anyone who does not keep gel whiteners on hand.  So down to the review:  I found that this light for whatever reason really does enhance the power of my gel whitener.  ???  I used the gel for days and saw a very gradual result.  In one application of the gel and this light I saw a marked difference.  Just being honest because I was asked to by the seller who gave me a discount.  The price is so low that I think anyone who wants to give it a test run should.  I was informed that the results are usually on teeth that are stained with coffee, wine, tea, or food stains.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> shows both your teeth&#x27;s finest and worst parts. And that&#x27;s not the best part yet. It is also very affordable.</li>
            <li> I give a three because when the product came it didn&#x27;t work, I have to see if it&#x27;s the batteries, before I can ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> Product is too fragile.</li>
            <li> Inwaited a whole month for this product to come in and I.finally got it and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on very upset!</li>
            <li> Does not work too well.</li>
            <li> I have yet to determine how ANYONE could claim that this product either WORKS or DOES NOT WORK. I suspect that there is a certain amount of &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; involved in this but as I cannot see any difference between using it and not using it for whitening my teeth so I choose to use it when I can. Easy to use, just tun it on and hold it securely between your lips; easy to care for, but NOT watertight I suspect, so I use a Q-tip and alcohol. If someone can prove to all of us that it works than it deserves a 5-star rating simply because it is cheap. If you can prove it doesn&#x27;t work, please don&#x27;t bother telling me as I already own it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all .. It actually burned my damn tongue and I will never order from this person again !!!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It really helped the gel to work faster.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but a little messy and hurts sensitive teeth but does the job</li>
            <li> I got this a long with a gel tooth whitener to help whiten my teeth since I&#x27;ve quit smoking and I have seen an amazing change in my teeth in a week. I use it twice a day and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything.. It doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it several times now and it only makes the whitening process difficult.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this works especially considering the price. I noticed results first time I tried it, although I did use it with a whitening gel (shown in the picture: plus white whitening gel, 4$ at wal mart)</li>
            <li> received it yesterday, and used it once and it works!</li>
            <li> This does not work. The battery is dead. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to buy a new battery.</li>
            <li> The light turns right on first try, a nice blue but this might work better if they gave even a scrap of paper for even the most cursory instructions on use. What I have is a blue flash light.</li>
            <li> In theory, this is a great tool. Yet, it does not turn on consistently which makes it impossible to use. Even once I get it on, I am not sure it will stay on when I put it in my mouth. Disappointed...</li>
            <li> A waste of money do not waste your money out of this is not do anything for you believe me</li>
            <li> no problem light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;including battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It would not turn on.</li>
            <li> You have to take the batteries out first for it to work, because there is a small plastic piece in there keeping it from working. Mine works fine</li>
            <li> I received this at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review. I have tried this several times and cannot tell any change at all. It was also very disconcerting that no instructions were included, I had to go back and look at the product description on here to know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Great my teeth are already white cause I&#x27;m really into clean teeth very neat product will order more as gifts. Easy to use with any teeth whitener! Yes any I&#x27;ve use 3 different kinds of whitener an it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it! Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This works amazingly with my whitening pen. I definitely notice my teeth look whiter. Some people complain about it coming and not working, you have to take the batteries out when you first get it and take the little plastic thing out to put the batteries back in otherwise it will not work. Absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> Dis like it nothing like the picture doesn&#x27;t work came with dead batteries wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li> The fact that it won&#x27;t be J.uly  until I can use this..I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d get it a 1 star for performance. Because you have to show up to be able to play in the game.  That is far too long!</li>
            <li> after receiving this product i then realize whitening gel is needed.  no where did it explain the gel was sold seperately.</li>
            <li> This nothing more then a hustle from China - junk, no instructions,  BIG joke. Amazon should banned this company .</li>
            <li> I got this accelerator light after my other one fell in a full sink and malfunctioned.  They are reasonable in price but really make the brightening gel work to its maximum.</li>
            <li> Does it work? Not sure....</li>
            <li> How come  more then one month&lt;br /&gt;until now not receive it</li>
            <li> This little gadget was a tremendous help to speed up the process of whiten my teeth. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It worked well once I made contact with their customer service.  It had no directions with the light and never mentioned that there was plastic between the batteries that had to be removed.</li>
            <li> I wish i can give it no stars but damn this is an awful product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not even work...</li>
            <li> I was tired of my teeth not looking white enough, now I can smile without feeling wondering if anyone is watching my teeth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work when it got here. Terrible</li>
            <li> Ordered on June 26 got it in the mail July 7th. So people keeping say it does not work....keep in mind to flip the batteries and take out the plastic round thing inside. Mine came on with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my teeth whitening gel... only time will tell if this will actually do the trick combined with the gel. There are no directions with this.</li>
            <li> Hm? It was shipped from Japan,,with no instructions and a non working battery....a month after I recieved the rest of the kit.</li>
            <li> My mom only used it a few times but she got frustrated with it because she felt it was working too slow. However it does work so I guess just invest in the time and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Not info accompanied the item at all.  Not even a registration card.  I expected some sort of instructions or encouragement of how to use this item.  It came in good shape and the light does turn on, so that is good.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time you wont use it much it will get lost trust me just buy crest 3d whote professional strips they work yes there about $40 but they work with brushing and you just wear them for 30 mins trust me results will show within 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> Cheap and good to have as a backup if the one that came in my actual package stops working</li>
            <li> I like this product but I have read reviews complaining about the battery being dead on arrival.  There are no directions with this but it has a battery deactivator disc between the two batteries.  This is a 1/2 inch piece of plastic that sits between the two batteries so the unit cannot be turned on accidentally during shipping.  Once this is removed the light works fine and the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li> No did&#x27;t work as i notice ..not so good</li>
            <li> Enjoying this product</li>
            <li> This item was inexpensive relative to overall teeth whitening costs.  I am not really sure if the blue light helped speed the process or if it got my teeth any extra white but it wasn&#x27;t too back to add to the experience since you already have weird trays in your mouth.  Overall it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Heh... make sure you read the information. You do actually need whitening gel before using this light... I&#x27;ve got some other thing to buy.</li>
            <li> Didnt even work. Waist of money</li>
            <li> worst product ever bought. took 2 months for delivery, when I got it, it didn&#x27;t work at all. I wish I can give it ZERO star!</li>
            <li> I keep using it thinking it will do something but I really don&#x27;t think its whiting my teeth</li>
            <li> The product is fine. What they don&#x27;t tell you is that there is a plastic disk between batteries to prevent battery drain. Take that out. It seems to work, I know that most professional whitening uses trays, gels and uv light. Does it 100 produce results? Hard to say, but it seems to help so why not?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at the white I am after but, yes it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and no saliva coming out of my mouth either,  bonus.</li>
            <li> Works good but stays on very long</li>
            <li> Great product, very easy to use. I use it with the Dr Songs teeth whitening kit. It seems to be pretty well built and is dependable so far.</li>
            <li> Waste..... I dont know how to use it ... I think you need something with it that didn&#x27;t come with it. No instructions on how to even use it. I don&#x27;t even know. So its a waste</li>
            <li> Junk.  That&#x27;s a one word description of this light.  I ordered 2 of these on July 14 and I received them from China on August 18.  One was for my wife and one for myself.  Both lights came with two (2) 2032 batteries.  I took the plastic disk out of both units and turned them on.  One of the units was acting funny with the on/off switch.  I put it on the counter and a few hours later my noticed that the light was on. so she tried to turn it off but the switch would not work.  So now the only way to turn it off and on is by removing the batteries.  So far the switch for the 2nd unit is still working but I&#x27;m not holding out a lot of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would not recommend this light from this seller.  The shipping was way too slow and the light is lightweight and not well made.  There are other lights like this on Amazon that ship from the USA.</li>
            <li> Works good as a flashlight... not sure if actually helps whitening.</li>
            <li> it does not affect, just a light!.</li>
            <li> I cannot for sure say that the light makes any difference in the tooth whitening kit I bought to do at home.  My teeth are pretty white naturally and because I have started drinking stronger tea I feel maybe they aren&#x27;t white enough.  I notice people&#x27;s teeth and I worry about mine so figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try the kit and also a light. It is easy to hold in your mouth as you go about your business (well, at home...wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing in public).  I am happy with the whitening results and I assume the light couldn&#x27;t hurt.  The price was right to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have a little experience with teeth bleaching, so hopefully my review will help others. I have had my teeth professionally lightened. And for bleaching at home &amp; or for maintaining the results of a professional bleaching, I have learned to find the strongest % bleach available, which can be found here on Amazon. Most of the &#x27;as seen on TV\\&quot; bleaching products are worthless. So using the strongest bleach gel definitely works for me, but it usually takes at least 21 days or more of bleaching every single day for a whole hour, until I truly get the results I want. I finally took the next step &amp; ordered this LED light. And the results are night &amp; day, better! In just one week, I have seen much better results &amp; I&#x27;m guessing by the end of week 2, the results will be gorgeous! I am a big believer in \\&quot;light treatment\\&quot;. I have an entire spa system set up in my home that is all \\&quot;skin light treatment\\&quot;. So I am a walking \\&quot;poster child\\&quot; for the benefits of LED light. This product does come with batteries &amp; instructions (all ready to go). But you need to buy the bleach separately. And you need to buy trays too. I already had both. So it was simply a matter of placing the LED light gadget over my trays. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable &amp; I don&#x27;t have to sit &amp; hold the LED light in place. Great product!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but I&#x27;ve seen better whitening when I just hold my mouth open. But then again, I&#x27;m using the pen...</li>
            <li> Nice one for the price</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Came with dead batteries but with new batteries it helped whiten my teeth a ton!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product ... We guarantee 100%&lt;br /&gt;I have had no fault with the product purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards&lt;br /&gt;J D</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it took a while and so research on how to use it since it did not come with any instructions. That was very disappointing to me. I was very excited to receive the teeth whitener and there was nothing to tell me how to use it. Once I researched it I learned that you use it with a whitening gel or some sort of teeth bleaching product. I used it with a whitening gel and it worked nicely. I tend to leave the light on my teeth about 10-20 minutes. My son has left it on for 30 minutes. It seems to be working well. I plan to continue to use it and see how white my teeth will get. I bought an extra one for my son because he had his braces removes in July and they left his teeth with stains, so we are going to try the professional teeth whitening light to make his teeth whiter. If you order this product, make sure to take out the clear plastic piece between the batteries and then you will be able to turn it on. Otherwise you will think it does not work. It is definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This little thing works!</li>
            <li> it was as described, good purchase</li>
            <li> battery was dead. at $1.89, it&#x27;s not worth replacing the battery.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and most of them say it doesn&#x27;t work but the first time using it I noticed improvement of my teeth!!</li>
            <li> Wow, I used it with the whitening fluid my dentist gave me...what a difference!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep it on enough. It&#x27;s not the light. It&#x27;s me.  So for me, I can&#x27;t give a fair review. Sorry</li>
            <li> The light does what it says it does. Dropped it once and it feel apart. Easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> Even though I could not get a positive result from the whitener which  I used with this, I need to say that this LED light visibly expedite the activity of whitening product</li>
            <li> Love this! I was hesitant because it is so cheap but it works just as well as an expensive one. Just make sure u open the battery and take out the little plastic separating the batteries so that it can work! I hope the battery lasts long... Only thing I&#x27;m worried about. But I&#x27;ve used twice already with gel and I see results !!!</li>
            <li> Delivery Was Faster Than Expected ! Can&#x27;t Wait To Try It Out !</li>
            <li> Had some trouble getting started it has a plastic disk to prevent battery operation....once I found and removed it was working just fine...Cust. service was very helpful and this works for faster results....no instruction&#x27;s to I figured it out and cust. sent suggestions&#x27; I used and no problems whatsoever....great buy and you won&#x27;t be sorry....brightens your smile quickly!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering the light but not the solution.  I can say that this item does perform as it should.  It comes with batteries and the light turns on as it should.  It is a very small design.  I would be tempted to put this in my purse and take with me in case I miss a treatment at home.  I would say its the size of a roll of tape.  There is basically no weight this this light.  You should not get tired of holding between your teeth unless you are biting down on it the whole time.</li>
            <li> Switched batteries and still don&#x27;t work mine didn&#x27;t even come with the teeth whitening gel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything different with my teeth, after one month of trying it.</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t turn on when they arrived. I&#x27;m going to have to find the special batteries just to make them work, if I even can. So far, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> After the first one  did not work the  second one I received has been doing much better thank you !!</li>
            <li> im really enjoy these new products for my teeth but I&#x27;m really curious what brand this is?</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, product is lightweight, which I really like. I use it with whitening gel &amp; tray. It seems to work great. The price is nice too!! :)</li>
            <li> Cheap and fast shipping.it works like it should .theres not much to review but for 2$ I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> this really works! It seems to work immediately after use with gel.  However, after about a day or two without use my color seems to go back a bit. I think this would work well with white strips!</li>
            <li> Works great. You can buy the toothpaste in dollar tree</li>
            <li> Was to use, fits with mouthgards.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t notice a difference...</li>
            <li> Useless. Second-handed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I can&#x27;t tell different after use yet. i feel like the same. The LED light is really bright .</li>
            <li> This product did help accelerate the process of teeth whitening gel I purchased.</li>
            <li> Arrived okay, was never bright, and within a week it was basically a dud</li>
            <li> Used for applying my own braces (successfully), and teeth whitening afterwards</li>
            <li> Product is good little light which helps accelerate teeth whitening products.  Would recommend this item for anyone using whitening applications.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t help what so ever</li>
            <li> Used it the first day with dazzlingWHITE whitening pen I bought from Dollar Tree. I only used it for 10 minutes and I see a difference already I can&#x27;t wait until my Dr Songs 44% gel arrives.My teeth will be blindingly white!</li>
            <li> Generic size for all mouths. Light is bright and improves gel whitening when used in conjunction. Replaceable batteries a plus. Great price, too !</li>
            <li> This Accelerator Light is perfect with the Whitening Refill and it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I really like this, i dont use it to often, but works great.</li>
            <li> This is easy to hold in your mouth and does not slip on the guard when whitening teeth while doing your household chores.  It is lightweight and you don&#x27;t feel you need to hang on to it or stretch your lips while wearing it.</li>
            <li> CAUTION! THE LIGHT DOES WORK WELL EVEN WITHOUT THE SYRINGES BUT THE LIGHT DIES EXTREMELY FAST IVE HAD THREE ALREADY</li>
            <li> The light is bright and small enough to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> Just received ! So  excited to whiten my teeth tonight it has a nice bright light love it hope it really works</li>
            <li> Lite weight and easy to use</li>
            <li> I used this the first day I got. It works great. It killed my teeth and gums. they were so sensitive for about two days.so if u can stand the pain. this is the ticket.....</li>
            <li> very cheap plastic, you have to hold it just right for the light to stay on. Doesnt appear to make a difference if you even use it or not</li>
            <li> Cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although inexpensive, batteries were dead so there&#x27;s another $5.00 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not in any sealed package which give you an uneasy feeling right away.  I mean you do place this item in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was very scratched up and didn&#x27;t look new, so I expressed my concerns to Amazon who were right on it and did refund my original purchase amount, still out $5.00 for batteries.  I didn&#x27;t use the product at all nor did I request a replacement.</li>
            <li> Product  was defiantly a great price. Go with this one Simple to use.is easy to use.I&#x27;ll definitely order this one again. Great price and great service. Thanks very much. Highly recommend.fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Everything was worth gettingðªð¯ð°</li>
            <li> This alone will not whiten your teeth you need the whole kit no need to be sold alone the kits always come with this.</li>
            <li> The light would have served a greater purpose had it come with &amp;#34;the gel AND the trays for your teeth!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Batteries did not work.  Product will be returned.</li>
            <li> Just got this, and started using it I can&#x27;t really notice a difference but I am glad it does come with working battery&#x27;s. Make sure to always use with some sort of whitening paste</li>
            <li> I used it with the plus white 5 minute bleaching gel.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> Use all the time and love it</li>
            <li> The light is very bright and not defective like a previous one.....if it actually does anything productive is another question:)</li>
            <li> These thing arrived with no instructions and a battery that kept falling out. I ended up throwing it away because I did&#x27;nt know how it worked</li>
            <li> It works so good so grab one today!</li>
            <li> Not only did this thing arrive dirty and scratched to heck, the batteries included were completely dead so it&#x27;s DOA. This thing looks like I&#x27;m the 3rd owner it&#x27;s so scratched and dirty. No way I would ever dare to allow it near my mouth!</li>
            <li> VENDEDOR RECOMENDADO, EL PRODUCTO CORRECTO Y LLEGO EN BUEN ESTADO. EXCELENTE COMPRA QUE TERMINO DE FORMA Exitosa GRACIAS A DIOS</li>
            <li> You will want this to enhance your teeth witening.</li>
            <li> It works just fine. It has lasted than what I expected from other reviews. Over all great product, the only thing bad I would have to say about it is that it makes my teeth very sensitive the day I use it.</li>
            <li> No noticeable results.</li>
            <li> This helped me teeth really good because I didn&#x27;t not so god teeth now It is Snow White thank you</li>
            <li> I have this in my mouth as I work on the computer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these lights along with bleach for about 2 years. At first I used it every couple of days, but that was harsh on my enamel so now I use this once a week. It&#x27;s amazing. I went to the dentist last week and she asked if I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened!! The lights last ((on average)) a couple of months but with the price so low it doesn&#x27;t even matter if it breaks. I think it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time with my 5 minute whitener gel. I love it</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me like getting my teeth professionally whitened. I thought it was small enough that it wasn&#x27;t awkward to fit into my mouth for the time either. I love it!</li>
            <li> Was a little Skeptical about this because it was so cheap. but it works great and saw noticable results just afer 2 uses of 10 mins</li>
            <li> They work beautifully, I will definitely order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Never could get it to work</li>
            <li> Did not receive the whitening gel</li>
            <li> FAST shipping, works great!</li>
            <li> This light did seem to help with the whitening process. Easy to wear.</li>
            <li> Great item and received quickly!</li>
            <li> Ok so my dad was messing around with this light and held it up to his eyes and his vision went blurry and a lot of pressure went to his eyes. And you have to have whitening gel for the thing to even work and it does not say that anywhere on the description!</li>
            <li> I finally received my product. The customer service was helpful with my concerns. The product I received was as described.</li>
            <li> I used this light with the 35% peroxide I got on here, and my teeth were glaring white in five minutes.</li>
            <li> If you use the system it works. Got it for my daughter 2 use for prom. She loved it !</li>
            <li> I find this thing horrible to try to hold in my mouth, with the tray of whitening gel, for 10-20 minutes. I start having saliva build up and my mouth aches keeping it in place.  But it does function as expected, lights up with a UV light, doesn&#x27;t feel hot or burn that I could tell.  I just don&#x27;t have the patience for it.  I am sanitizing it and giving it to my sister...she likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> the product took long to come and plus it was broken when i eceived it</li>
