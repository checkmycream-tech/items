            <li>This is good, but DEFINATELY NOT for $30, WAAY too pricey (taken one star</li>
            <li>I bought this cream as a moisturizer and it is good for that.</li>
            <li>Feels so good on your skin and you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I read that this is a good cream for someone who has acne prone skin, but</li>
            <li>I love this cream, while it is a bit pricy; it cleared up a rash within 24 hours that had been plaguing me for a great number of months.</li>
            <li>I do LOVE ASDM&#x27;s Organic Maracuja Oil!</li>
            <li>Really love it!</li>

            <li>Like this product, nice rose smell.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the fast absorption.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing they add rose oil for the effects it has on acne.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product ASDM Beverly Hills!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>But it absorbes very quickly, and it ends up feeling SO good on the break out areas</li>
            <li>great face cream with fresh scent</li>
            <li>an so far my skin looks great!!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!  </li>

            <li>I do love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>I love it as a sun burn cream.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion,it is the ideal weight for my combination skin, helps clear blemishes and hopefully is preventing wrinkles as well.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are top notch....</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if it were not MY face and hands, but the sunspots and wrinkles are being erased more and more.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this cream, and will definitely continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>one thing, I could give four stars because I don&#x27;t get an option of better shipment</li>
            <li>Excellent daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but i love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly, which was nice.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and works well on its own or under makeup.</li>
            <li>smells very good and it hydrates my skin, time will only tell.</li>
            <li>Will have to give it more time but so far so good</li>
            <li>Great cream specially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s just good to help in healing new scars.</li>
            <li>Gives skin a taught and smooth feeling and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged well for shipping.</li>
            <li>I was a bit dubious when I saw this cream is a light brown, but my skin has never felt softer after using this cream.  </li>
            <li>I know rose oil is &#x27;natural&#x27;, but its mostly a fragrant oil.</li>
            <li>and so far my face feels good.</li>
            <li>Shipping is always super quick!</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing, you can see a difference overnight, as far as healing wounds</li>
            <li>It was very creamy &amp; went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It smells like rose oil and is not gritty.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they took it out or at least had a brand option without rose oil.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell but leaving the cap off a night or two helps diminish it.</li>
            <li>I love the natural glow it gives me.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described and arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li>, this is very light weight, and not moisturinzing enough for</li>
            <li>It kept my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>Absolutely my go to face cream!</li>
            <li>For the first time I don&#x27;t have a reaction to moisturizer with this cream.</li>
            <li>An absolute must to use after glycolic peels to calm the skin.</li>
            <li>I would love to see them go back to the drawing board and create a gel or water based moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why exactly</li>
            <li>It is the first product that has had a noticeable anti-aging effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I had to reorder this cream again; because the first order got lost by the post office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive this product works.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using the cream for my feet and it seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like your skin is breathing and all and even though it absorbs quickly it is heavier than 2 layers of makeup, which completely surprised me.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs this cream quickly and my skin feels soft and quenched.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok and help calm everything down a bit.</li>
            <li>Pure Emu Oil, Pure Rice Bran Oil, Tepezcohuite Tree Bark Powder Extract, Pure Grape seed Oil, Pure Camellia Oil, Vitamin E, Honey Extract, Mango Alphonso Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract.  </li>
            <li>My mom has a problem with very sensitive, red skin, and cant use most products on her face because they sting or irritate.</li>
            <li>, sometimes i will actually go back later and put more on those spots!  </li>
            <li>is the ENTIRE list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;De-Ionized Water, Grapeseed Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Camellia Seed Oil, Pure Emu Oil, [Bees Wax, HE-Cellulose, Polyglyceryl Oleate], Pure Tepezcohuite Tree Bark, Vitamin B3, Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate), Allantoin, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Mango Extract, Honey Extract, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin c), Essential Oil Rose Geranium, Sorbitol,</li>
            <li>but I do not see much difference  after one month.  </li>
            <li>it so much.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the container I was a bit surprised at the grey color, but after using the cream for about a week, I can say that I am beyond pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very soothing and absorbs completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love how it makes my skin feel especially after a day in the sun, I use it with jenu and my skin feels so soft and hydrated in the morning.</li>
            <li>Heals my new scars quickly but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the old acne scars I have, which for some reason I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It started feeling more moisturizing, and kept my skin softer longer than my other face cream.</li>
            <li>So far I like the cream very much.</li>
            <li>it also looks like you can buy this for much cheaper on ASDMs direct website</li>
            <li>and wow did my skin really hold the moisture without any oiliness.</li>
            <li>that is why i initially bought this cream, wanted something for break outs but not crazy about the acne products that are so drying...</li>
            <li>Love it so far, not a heavy cream and did not break me out like I do with other creams.  </li>
            <li>clearly listed, no gunk!</li>
            <li>This may work for you if you have whiteheads or postule acne, but if you have pustule, cystic or nodule acne you need to make sure you try a small sample before buying it.</li>
            <li>I suffered from acne for years, resulting in some scarring which is becoming less visible already!  </li>
            <li>I understand how this can work for mild acne, but severe acne sufferers will need to really be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of moisture for my dry face.</li>
            <li>If you have an area of acne, the angry kind thats red and inflamed, and you couldnt even imaging putting a cream on it, this is exactly what you need to put on it!  </li>
            <li>It took a couple of weeks, but I can see a clear difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The product completely absorbs within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry/oily combo skin and have had acne problems all of my adult life.</li>
            <li>This size is more than enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>So when I am make up free I tend to just want to let my skin breath and wear as little product as possible.</li>
            <li>But, its really frustrating to have the fragrance (rose essential oil) in it.</li>
            <li>Similarly, it will do nothing for adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, pretty average, with the occassional patch of break out around my chin, jaw line...</li>
            <li>At first it burned and made my skin a little dryer, but then everything changed.</li>
            <li>Funny how they only listed the Active Ingreiendts but left out the ones</li>
            <li>I usually break out right away</li>
    </ol>

            <li> clearly listed, no gunk!</li>
            <li> This may work for you if you have whiteheads or postule acne, but if you have pustule, cystic or nodule acne you need to make sure you try a small sample before buying it.</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne for years, resulting in some scarring which is becoming less visible already!  </li>
            <li> I understand how this can work for mild acne, but severe acne sufferers will need to really be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of moisture for my dry face.</li>
            <li> If you have an area of acne, the angry kind thats red and inflamed, and you couldnt even imaging putting a cream on it, this is exactly what you need to put on it!  </li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks, but I can see a clear difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The product completely absorbs within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry/oily combo skin and have had acne problems all of my adult life.</li>
            <li> This size is more than enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> So when I am make up free I tend to just want to let my skin breath and wear as little product as possible.</li>
            <li> But, its really frustrating to have the fragrance (rose essential oil) in it.</li>
            <li> Similarly, it will do nothing for adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, pretty average, with the occassional patch of break out around my chin, jaw line...</li>
            <li> At first it burned and made my skin a little dryer, but then everything changed.</li>
            <li> Funny how they only listed the Active Ingreiendts but left out the ones</li>
            <li> I usually break out right away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A lil goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my face moisturized all day without being heavy or greasy and seems to help my acne  heal a bit quicker than normal.</li>
            <li> We live in an area of hot sun and are ill suited to it-</li>
            <li> It has taken a few weeks and an acne facial to have my skin calm down even a little.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my more severe type of acne because it feels like it&#x27;s cutting off the oxygen supply to my skin.</li>
            <li> I got a sample with my order and used it after going too long with a lactic peel.</li>
            <li> But then again, I shouldn&#x27;t punish Amazon for the lack of service that my local post office have.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in my second order, Amazon gave me a complementary 2oz tepezcohuite cream to make up for my previous lost order.</li>
            <li> , this is NOT totally &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; as the name clearly implies, as it contains preservatives and a few other toxic ingredients, that I would normally not put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it to pple with dry skin, maybe it works for someone else, not for me.</li>
            <li> I use a benzoyl was peroxide face wash which tends to dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> It truly does take down the inflammation, seems to &#x27;take the red out&#x27; .  </li>
            <li> I would rather a post-peel cream especially, (and any cream really), be bland and fragrance-free, which is what derms recommend.</li>
            <li> It even gave my skin a bit of a matte look that actually lasted for quite a few hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to add much and can be irritating.</li>
            <li> I saw no positive results</li>
            <li> Like I said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This may work wonders for other people, but I have acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> : Active Ingredients:</li>
            <li> These arent as bad as some others, but I still prefer to be PRESERVATIVE FREE and I felt the wording of the INgredients description was misleading.  </li>
            <li> If the cream had done anything beneficial, I would have ignored the off-putting greenish-brown color, and the odd tree bark smell.  </li>
            <li> I wish they could use the benefits of tepezcohuite and make something less hydrophobic.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like teh Black stuff it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li> It has a slight medicinal smell but it is not bothersome.</li>
            <li> not too heavy but its not too matte either.</li>
            <li> I think I may have wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Whats crazier, its very thick and initially feels almost greasy, or too thick.  </li>
            <li> I also think it has helped with small wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li> Know your acne and try a small sample if you can.</li>
            <li> what it did was it made my skin break out with small pimples all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this cream if you have rosacea, as it will make your red-faced symptoms worse.  </li>
            <li> So for the false advertising, taking one star off.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I had trouble sleeping after I put it on, because the smell was so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this works, but it took about a week and a half to get to me and it smells awful.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and prone to random cystic acne out breaks.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, there will not be a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> It has a sticky texture and bad odor.</li>
            <li> This face cream is awful!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked this product. It was very creamy &amp; went on smoothly. It kept my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> This is good, but DEFINATELY NOT for $30, WAAY too pricey (taken one star off)&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is NOT totally &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; as the name clearly implies, as it contains preservatives and a few other toxic ingredients, that I would normally not put on my skin.  So for the false advertising, taking one star off.&lt;br /&gt;Here they listed the &amp;#34;Active Ingredients&amp;#34;: Active Ingredients: Pure Emu Oil, Pure Rice Bran Oil, Tepezcohuite Tree Bark Powder Extract, Pure Grape seed Oil, Pure Camellia Oil, Vitamin E, Honey Extract, Mango Alphonso Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract.  *BUT neglected to list the harmful ingredients:  Allantoin, Sorbitol, Optiphen.  These arent as bad as some others, but I still prefer to be PRESERVATIVE FREE and I felt the wording of the INgredients description was misleading.  Funny how they only listed the Active Ingreiendts but left out the ones I just mentioned!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Here is the ENTIRE list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;De-Ionized Water, Grapeseed Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Camellia Seed Oil, Pure Emu Oil, [Bees Wax, HE-Cellulose, Polyglyceryl Oleate], Pure Tepezcohuite Tree Bark, Vitamin B3, Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate), Allantoin, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Mango Extract, Honey Extract, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin c), Essential Oil Rose Geranium, Sorbitol, Optiphen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is very light weight, and not moisturinzing enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it also looks like you can buy this for much cheaper on ASDMs direct website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do LOVE ASDM&#x27;s Organic Maracuja Oil!</li>
            <li> Like the produce great moisterizer</li>
            <li> Excellent, does a good job</li>
            <li> I used the cream one time, after I cleaned my face, my face next day broke out in pimples. I don&#x27;t recommend it to pple with dry skin, maybe it works for someone else, not for me.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Saw a difference in my skin almost immediately and the matte finish is nice.</li>
            <li> has an off smell, but feels nice</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing, you can see a difference overnight, as far as healing wounds</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cream after applying it to my face; I know that it supposed to reduce wrinkles but I do not see much difference  after one month.  I still think eating heathy, washing your face morning and nite, not smoking cigarettes, and daily cardio workout with water drinking are also key factors to a younger looking face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my go to face cream! love&#x27;n it so much.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing from now on. Love it</li>
            <li> I do love it. I am 73 and look 20 years younger Thank you. B.</li>
            <li> Gives skin a taught and smooth feeling and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged well for shipping.</li>
            <li> love how it makes my skin feel especially after a day in the sun, I use it with jenu and my skin feels so soft and hydrated in the morning.</li>
            <li> For the first time I don&#x27;t have a reaction to moisturizer with this cream. I also think it has helped with small wrinkles and lines. I&#x27;m happy with it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream!  An absolute must to use after glycolic peels to calm the skin.</li>
            <li> Really love it! So I wanted to give this product a week of use before reviewing. I use a benzoyl was peroxide face wash which tends to dry my skin out.  I have oily skin and prone to random cystic acne out breaks. So when I am make up free I tend to just want to let my skin breath and wear as little product as possible. Enter this moisturizer, I have been using this after my daily face wash and am amazed by just the feel of my skin. It&#x27;s not oily and a little really goes a long way. It even gave my skin a bit of a matte look that actually lasted for quite a few hours. I haven&#x27;t had any break outs and I see a change in the overall texture of my skin. I use a scrub once a week and applied this cream afterwards and wow did my skin really hold the moisture without any oiliness. Have to say I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results! This size is more than enough for everyday use. Like I said a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This face cream is awful!  The only reason that I purchased this pricey cream was because the actress, Salma Hayak, touted the unpronounceable ingredient, tepezcohuite, as being a miracle cure for skin ailments.  If the cream had done anything beneficial, I would have ignored the off-putting greenish-brown color, and the odd tree bark smell.  Don&#x27;t use this cream if you have rosacea, as it will make your red-faced symptoms worse.  Similarly, it will do nothing for adult acne.  Needless to say, there will not be a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious when I saw this cream is a light brown, but my skin has never felt softer after using this cream.  I use it on my hands as well.  Wish it came in a body lotion!!</li>
            <li> Like this product, nice rose smell.</li>
            <li> Very soothing. Nice product</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference within three days. Won&#x27;t go back to Rock.</li>
            <li> Too soon to know. Healing my sunburn wound.</li>
            <li> great face cream with fresh scent</li>
            <li> really love this day cream - perfect for my skin</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly, which was nice. The product completely absorbs within 2 minutes. I was very impressed by the fast absorption. It smells like rose oil and is not gritty. I&#x27;m guessing they add rose oil for the effects it has on acne. It would be nice if they took it out or at least had a brand option without rose oil. This may work for you if you have whiteheads or postule acne, but if you have pustule, cystic or nodule acne you need to make sure you try a small sample before buying it. It didn&#x27;t work for my more severe type of acne because it feels like it&#x27;s cutting off the oxygen supply to my skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like your skin is breathing and all and even though it absorbs quickly it is heavier than 2 layers of makeup, which completely surprised me. There is no film, oil or residue, just a heaviness like you&#x27;re wearing oil based makeup or something. I wish they could use the benefits of tepezcohuite and make something less hydrophobic. This is detrimental to cystic or nodule type acne and you lose all healing benefits. I would love to see them go back to the drawing board and create a gel or water based moisturizer. Know your acne and try a small sample if you can. I understand how this can work for mild acne, but severe acne sufferers will need to really be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream as a moisturizer and it is good for that. But, we&#x27;ve been using it to treat sunburns and I love it for that. I don&#x27;t know why exactly but it takes the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; out and helps with pain. We live in an area of hot sun and are ill suited to it- this is a must have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it as a moisturizer- but there are plenty of those on the market. I love it as a sun burn cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, while it is a bit pricy; it cleared up a rash within 24 hours that had been plaguing me for a great number of months.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li> Great cream specially for sensitive skin. I have allergies to everything an so far my skin looks great!!</li>
            <li> The most hydrating cream I have ever used!! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It makes my skin feel amazing!!! I bought one for my mom too!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the container I was a bit surprised at the grey color, but after using the cream for about a week, I can say that I am beyond pleased with the results.  I already see improvement in my skin tone and texture.  I suffered from acne for years, resulting in some scarring which is becoming less visible already!  I have some spider veins that are fading too.  My only regret is that i didn&#x27;t discover this cream earlier.  Now in my 40s, my skin feels better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell - no big improvement</li>
            <li> I love this lotion,it is the ideal weight for my combination skin, helps clear blemishes and hopefully is preventing wrinkles as well. The ingredients are top notch.... I wont ever go back to using anything else!</li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks, but I can see a clear difference in my skin. At first it burned and made my skin a little dryer, but then everything changed. It started feeling more moisturizing, and kept my skin softer longer than my other face cream. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if it were not MY face and hands, but the sunspots and wrinkles are being erased more and more. I am very happy with this cream, and will definitely continue to buy it. It is the first product that has had a noticeable anti-aging effect on my skin. I love it!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like teh Black stuff it leaves on your face. would never buy this again</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried them all, but this one I can honestly say I feel and see a difference!</li>
            <li> I like it.  I can see a big difference in my skin, and I haven&#x27;t had a big breakout since.  Won&#x27;t ever try anything else again, this is it.  I just ordered the serum to use with it.  A lil goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin...softer, brighter.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it!  I don&#x27;t mind the smell...it&#x27;s soothing.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs this cream quickly and my skin feels soft and quenched.</li>
            <li> I got a sample with my order and used it after going too long with a lactic peel. It seemed to work ok and help calm everything down a bit. But, its really frustrating to have the fragrance (rose essential oil) in it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to add much and can be irritating. I would rather a post-peel cream especially, (and any cream really), be bland and fragrance-free, which is what derms recommend. I know rose oil is &#x27;natural&#x27;, but its mostly a fragrant oil. I searched google scholar and found nothing showing it was beneficial. Might try the serum since it has no fragrance oils.</li>
            <li> So far I like the cream very much. I usually break out right away and so far my face feels good. It is not too heavy and really softens my skin. Will have to give it more time but so far so good</li>
            <li> Feels so good on your skin and you can feel the difference. I even apply it to some of my scars, especially the one from C-Section, it actually improves the appearance.</li>
            <li> Heals my new scars quickly but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the old acne scars I have, which for some reason I thought it would.  Used it under my eyes for two months and saw no change. Guess it&#x27;s just good to help in healing new scars.</li>
            <li> I saw no positive results</li>
            <li> just the right amount of moisture for my dry face. not too heavy but its not too matte either. It has a slight medicinal smell but it is not bothersome.</li>
            <li> Love it so far, not a heavy cream and did not break me out like I do with other creams.  I will buy it again when I get low. Thanks for a great product ASDM Beverly Hills!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this cream for about a year now. Love love love it!  I have normal to dry skin, pretty average, with the occassional patch of break out around my chin, jaw line...that is why i initially bought this cream, wanted something for break outs but not crazy about the acne products that are so drying...this was my answer!  If you have an area of acne, the angry kind thats red and inflamed, and you couldnt even imaging putting a cream on it, this is exactly what you need to put on it!  Whats crazier, its very thick and initially feels almost greasy, or too thick.  But it absorbes very quickly, and it ends up feeling SO good on the break out areas, sometimes i will actually go back later and put more on those spots!  It truly does take down the inflammation, seems to &#x27;take the red out&#x27; .  I also have my sister in law and mom using it. My mom has a problem with very sensitive, red skin, and cant use most products on her face because they sting or irritate. She loves this. I also have the tepezcohuite serum from this seller, and the exfoliant too, they are amazing products...ASDM Bevely Hills is also a pleasure to order from.  ( check out their ebay store).  Shipping is always super quick!</li>
            <li> I bought the serum and the cream.  Both products work terrific together--I use the cream on my legs and feet also.  This cream is very soothing and absorbs completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tammi Johnson</li>
            <li> Great day cream, no funky unnatural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Clears up any blemishes.  Another great product from ASDM.&lt;br /&gt;Ingreadiants clearly listed, no gunk!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I am fighting breast cancer and I went through radiation therapy, and tepezcohuite cream is great as a complement for the healing process of the skin. I also noticed that it helped me to get rid of some stubborn pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing, I could give four stars because I don&#x27;t get an option of better shipment and I had to reorder this cream again; because the first order got lost by the post office. But then again, I shouldn&#x27;t punish Amazon for the lack of service that my local post office have.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in my second order, Amazon gave me a complementary 2oz tepezcohuite cream to make up for my previous lost order. So now I am happy.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  I have sensitive dry/oily combo skin and have had acne problems all of my adult life. This stuff keeps my face moisturized all day without being heavy or greasy and seems to help my acne  heal a bit quicker than normal. Excellent daily moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and works well on its own or under makeup. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way. Not crazy about the smell but leaving the cap off a night or two helps diminish it.</li>
            <li> It has a sticky texture and bad odor. I think I may have wasted my money on this product.I will stick to products from Korea from now on.</li>
            <li> too soon to see results, but i love the smell and texture. and, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> My only moisturizer now. I love the natural glow it gives me. I also used it on my teenage daughter&#x27;s acne and it cleared it up. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great cream!! Has already reduced wrinkles!</li>
            <li> smells very good and it hydrates my skin, time will only tell. I&#x27;m positive this product works.</li>
            <li> Very good choice...very pleased !!</li>
            <li> This may work wonders for other people, but I have acne prone skin.  I read that this is a good cream for someone who has acne prone skin, but what it did was it made my skin break out with small pimples all over my face.  It has taken a few weeks and an acne facial to have my skin calm down even a little.  Right now I&#x27;m using the cream for my feet and it seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this works, but it took about a week and a half to get to me and it smells awful. I had trouble sleeping after I put it on, because the smell was so bad.</li>
            <li> Notice a difference with in a couple days.  Helped with acne and blemishes.  Love this product!</li>
