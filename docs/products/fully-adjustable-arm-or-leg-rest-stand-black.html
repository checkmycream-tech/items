            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>but I was impressed for the price.</li>
            <li>..works great now</li>
            <li>It seems nice, and very nicely made, except for the fact that its not sturdy!!!</li>
            <li>After that, this armrest worked great.</li>
            <li>Looks and works great.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality for price</li>
            <li>.. built very cheap .</li>
            <li>i reinforced it with better wood and four bolts instead of one</li>
            <li>never used it once because of the shoty connection of the top.</li>
            <li>the lock mechanism on the top of the rest doesn&#x27;t function correctly</li>
            <li>It comes with no instructions for putting it together, and even after you are able to get it together, it seems like junk.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, it looks nice sitting in the corner of my studio collecting dust.</li>
            <li>The pieces don&#x27;t even fit together right.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got a lucky one</li>
            <li>Product is as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It definitely made my life a lot easier and my clients love it as well!</li>
            <li>I know right</li>
            <li>A little bit of assembly but good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Broke off the pedestal the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Really dont know why I even gave one star !</li>
            <li>Flimsy and rarely stays in place, no matter how much you tighten the bolts.  </li>
            <li>Had to break the fabric to be able to istalled it... and the screw is too short for the assembly.</li>
            <li>pretty much comes already stripped because of the particle board.</li>
            <li>Replace the hardware and you just might have a nice set up but alone its average.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Moves way too much dont buy it</li>
            <li>I did however screw the stand into the arm with a wee bit too much force and tore the plastic liner on the underside.</li>
            <li>Spend some more money and find something a little higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Slightly wobbly but couldn&#x27;t expect much more from something so lightweight.</li>
            <li>First off it embarrassed the hell out of me in front of my client when after only one sitting it broke!!!</li>
            <li>The arm rest did not stabily hold itself up right, it got loose all the time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay in a fixed position and will not work for tattooing.</li>
            <li>is complete garbage.  </li>
            <li>it is a cheap drum symbol stand with a pad with very little padding</li>
            <li>Its true that you get what you pay for but in this case, you are paying next to nothing and getting less.</li>
            <li>I should have paid better attention to the salers name if I would have known I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money, products that I have bought in the past and this one including are junk,</li>

            <li> The mounting bolt for the top is too long and goes to the fake leather&lt;br</li>
            <li> the single bolt the padded board sits on is not enough to withstand the pressure my clients put on it ..</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money here.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this very long before it broke.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read the other reviews before now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously unusable and complete poor quality</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> this is just a waste of money..</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money ever!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a terrible product and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> hard to adjust.</li>
            <li> but this thing seriously needs to be discountinued or redesigned.</li>
            <li> Wouldnt recommend for the serious tattoo artist .</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> just be careful when screwing the arm to the base.</li>
            <li> Very poor construction.</li>
            <li> very unfortunate having to adjust it every 5 minutes..</li>
            <li> I dont like writing bad reviews</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> The base needs to attach to the armrest through a port in the bottom that is under material when you receive it and also has an additional nut you must remove.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> it is a cheap drum symbol stand with a pad with very little padding</li>
            <li> Definitely not what i was looking for. now used as a coat rack.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.. Its true that you get what you pay for but in this case, you are paying next to nothing and getting less. Very dissapointed in this purchase. Will NEVER buy from monster point again.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It definitely made my life a lot easier and my clients love it as well! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Very poor construction. Broke off the pedestal the first time I used it. Total junk, should be removed from Amazon and all monies refundee</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product. A little bit of assembly but good bang for your buck. Would recommend giving it a go.</li>
            <li> The arm rest did not stabily hold itself up right, it got loose all the time. I would appreciate a refund!!!</li>
            <li> the single bolt the padded board sits on is not enough to withstand the pressure my clients put on it ..it webble wobbles and it broke withen a week ..i reinforced it with better wood and four bolts instead of one ..works great now</li>
            <li> Good quality for price</li>
            <li> The mounting bolt for the top is too long and goes to the fake leather&lt;br /&gt;The adjustment screws are nuts and bolts no wing nuts so u need a wrench every time&lt;br /&gt;Seriously unusable and complete poor quality</li>
            <li> never used it once because of the shoty connection of the top. pretty much comes already stripped because of the particle board. used. I dont like writing bad reviews but this thing seriously needs to be discountinued or redesigned.</li>
            <li> When I got it in it was rusted and pittied everywhere this is junk</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money ever! Why is this seller selling stuff? Its garbage DO NOT ORDER! Wish I would have read the other reviews before now.</li>
            <li> Really dont know why I even gave one star ! First off it embarrassed the hell out of me in front of my client when after only one sitting it broke!!! Yeah I know right .. built very cheap . Wouldnt recommend for the serious tattoo artist . Invest in quality equipment it pays it self...</li>
            <li> Not too bad. Bought this for traveling purposes. Perfect! Lightweight and collapsible. Slightly wobbly but couldn&#x27;t expect much more from something so lightweight. An adjustment though would be to include wing nuts instead so that the tilt is easier adjusted. Maybe I got a lucky one but I was impressed for the price.</li>
            <li> Moves way too much dont buy it i tried everything to tighten it up n it still moves ur better off buying an expensive one this is just a waste of money..</li>
            <li> hard to adjust. Replace the hardware and you just might have a nice set up but alone its average.</li>
            <li> It seems nice, and very nicely made, except for the fact that its not sturdy!!! very unfortunate having to adjust it every 5 minutes..</li>
            <li> This arrived as parts in a box, no receipt, no instructions. The base needs to attach to the armrest through a port in the bottom that is under material when you receive it and also has an additional nut you must remove. After that, this armrest worked great. I plan to get larger butterfly nuts to make adjustments easier.</li>
            <li> I should have paid better attention to the salers name if I would have known I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money, products that I have bought in the past and this one including are junk, the lock mechanism on the top of the rest doesn&#x27;t function correctly I will pay closer attention next time this is the final sale this company will me to me.... if you can&#x27;t sale quality then don&#x27;t sale, if I did my job like this I wouldn&#x27;t have one</li>
            <li> This arm/legrest is flimsy. The pieces don&#x27;t even fit together right. It also doesn&#x27;t tighten up properly. It doesn&#x27;t stay in a fixed position and will not work for tattooing. Overall this is a terrible product and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This arm rest was/is complete garbage.  It comes with no instructions for putting it together, and even after you are able to get it together, it seems like junk.  Flimsy and rarely stays in place, no matter how much you tighten the bolts.  Complete waste of money here.  Spend some more money and find something a little higher quality.  On a positive note, it looks nice sitting in the corner of my studio collecting dust.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this very long before it broke. It had a hole to screw in the stand to the arm rest but I had to find it and cut a hole in the leather also the screw hole is made of wood totally stripped. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Garbage. No istructions. Had to break the fabric to be able to istalled it... and the screw is too short for the assembly. Couldnt even use it once,  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Looks and works great.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and arrived quickly. I did however screw the stand into the arm with a wee bit too much force and tore the plastic liner on the underside. just be careful when screwing the arm to the base.</li>
