    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The kids like it best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to convince their parents of the no-fluoride concept, but until then, I will keep the kids stocked with this great toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste itself is great.</li>
            <li>Great deal for what you get.</li>
            <li>Flouride is poison, so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative at a great price.</li>
            <li>I wish more toothpaste manufacturers would follow Tom&#x27;s lead and make non-minty toothpastes, not everyone likes mint!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great price and with free shipping you can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>so I am thrilled to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for carrying this excellent product.</li>
            <li>There is no resemblance to strawberries or berries of any kind.  </li>
            <li>but with one child, I still have 4 more tubes to use up.    </li>
            <li>My son and daughter both love the taste of this toothpaste, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them swallowing it since there&#x27;s no fluoride.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they have it, most times they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>They always have the peppermint and spearmint, but my children love the strawberry.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and so do my kids.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for my son and I&#x27;m truly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Will let my daughter use it as soon as she is able to.  </li>
            <li>They love the taste and the name.</li>
            <li>She has enjoyed this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean their teeth better than that baby stuff at the stores and tastes better too.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the initial flavor, but  have to say, I am not too impressed with how well it cleans or with the flavor after the initial flavor wears off.</li>
            <li>The orange was too sweet for my girls, but they love the strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it&#x27;s fluoride free.</li>
            <li>Not to mention its floride free and natrual.</li>
            <li>Got this last week after reading the great reviews and doing alot of reaserch.</li>
            <li>BUT the kids seem to like it, and it is fluoride free, so I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Although this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t taste the best (very bland)</li>
            <li>Yes, the taste takes a little time to get use to, but it is a great, healthy product.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it so much that she keeps wanting to brush her teeth with more after already having done it once.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Flouride-free toothpaste is not only great for kids, but adults as well.</li>
            <li>Fluoride is a poison and who wants to give our kids that stuff!  </li>
            <li>and low and behold LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>He has been pretty good and cooperative with brushing but suddenly refused to open his mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is a great price here compared to my local Whole foods-the only local place I can reliably find it.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for my daughter who does not like most other toothpastes because they are \\&quot;too spicy\\</li>
            <li>The next morning I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth looked and felt.</li>
            <li>but our child wouldnt use after first taste, so I tried it myself and found it pretty gross tasting.</li>
            <li>only reason why I gave it 1 star was that the tube is huge compared to most flouride free toothpastes - I mean this thing could last you years given that you only use a teeny-tiny bit for toddlers.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t occur to me that it was the new toothpaste he was rejecting until I tasted it and realized why.  </li>
            <li>They love the silly strawberry and their mom loves that its fluoride free.</li>
            <li>One downside is that it does not leave the mouth feeling as fresh and clean as long as other pastes.</li>
            <li>We buy several tubes whenever we can find it, it is getting more and more difficult to find in retail stores near us</li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s new favorite toothpaste and I have trouble finding it locally in the fluoride-free version.  </li>
            <li>My 9-year old picked this toothpaste when shopping in the US.</li>
            <li>I did a little taste test and it is mild, and not too toothpastey.</li>
            <li>The foaming action is moderate.</li>

            <li> Though I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine products for years, I&#x27;ve recently become aware of the negative impact of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS).  </li>
            <li> The tube is as big as any other tube of toothpaste and I haven&#x27;t had any problems finding the toothpaste at various stores or online.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you are looking for a non-fluoride past for your child.</li>

            <li> As was said in a previous review, my daughter also thinks all other toothpastes are \\&quot;too spicy\\&quot; and she complains that they burn her tongue.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste because the other flavors of Tom&#x27;s were too harsh for my kid&#x27;s mouths.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly murky beige color, though.</li>
            <li> It tastes like a chemical of some sort after a few brushes.</li>
            <li> While this toothpaste has a subtle, fruity flavor, it does not really bring strawberries to mind.</li>
            <li> I am unsure why one reviewer mentions the size as being too small.</li>
            <li> I had no idea the tubes were so small.  </li>
            <li> Its bland and doesn&#x27;t give you a minty fresh feeling but for me thats what I always hated.</li>
            <li> SLS is commonly used as a foaming agent and is linked to canker sores.</li>
            <li> How can you not smile with a name like &#x27;Silly Strawberry&#x27;?</li>
            <li> Whatever it takes to keep the kids brushing everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I hated the taste.</li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am unsure why one reviewer mentions the size as being too small. One tube seems to last for over two months as you only use a pea size amount anyway. In fact, we wanted to try a different flavor/brand but with one child, I still have 4 more tubes to use up.    Highly recommend it if you are looking for a non-fluoride past for your child.</li>
            <li> Anything that will make brushing the teeth of small children easier is a big help. My son and daughter both love the taste of this toothpaste, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them swallowing it since there&#x27;s no fluoride.</li>
            <li> thought we would try this but our child wouldnt use after first taste, so I tried it myself and found it pretty gross tasting.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this toothpaste for several years now, and it is the only one she will use.  We buy several tubes whenever we can find it, it is getting more and more difficult to find in retail stores near us so I am thrilled to see it on Amazon.  As was said in a previous review, my daughter also thinks all other toothpastes are \\&quot;too spicy\\&quot; and she complains that they burn her tongue.  I wish more toothpaste manufacturers would follow Tom&#x27;s lead and make non-minty toothpastes, not everyone likes mint!  Other toothpastes that claim to be berry, or bubblegum flavored still burn my daughter&#x27;s tongue.  Thanks again Amazon for carrying this excellent product.</li>

            <li> Lets face it.  Fluoride is a poison and who wants to give our kids that stuff!  I love this toothpaste and so do my kids.  It seems to clean their teeth better than that baby stuff at the stores and tastes better too.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine products for years, I&#x27;ve recently become aware of the negative impact of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS).  Tom&#x27;s does make an SLS-free version of its toothpaste, but not in kids&#x27; flavors.  SLS is commonly used as a foaming agent and is linked to canker sores.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for my son and I&#x27;m truly satisfied.  Will let my daughter use it as soon as she is able to.  Purchase this product....you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The kids like it best.</li>
            <li> Although this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t taste the best (very bland) I do like the fact that it&#x27;s fluoride free. The tube is as big as any other tube of toothpaste and I haven&#x27;t had any problems finding the toothpaste at various stores or online.</li>
            <li> I buy this toothpaste for my grandchildren. They love the taste and the name. How can you not smile with a name like &#x27;Silly Strawberry&#x27;? I&#x27;m still trying to convince their parents of the no-fluoride concept, but until then, I will keep the kids stocked with this great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I had no idea the tubes were so small.  They are about the size of your thumb.  The toothpaste itself is great.</li>
            <li> Gift for the grandkids.  They love the silly strawberry and their mom loves that its fluoride free.</li>
            <li> I love this! I was trying to brush my teeth with regular tooth paste but ever since I was a kid I hated the taste. I saw some of this at Big Lots and said I&#x27;ll try it! and low and behold LOVE IT. Its bland and doesn&#x27;t give you a minty fresh feeling but for me thats what I always hated. Not to mention its floride free and natrual. Just makes my day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to remind my kids anymore to brush their teeth.  They look forward to it with this stuff! Ages 3, 5, &amp; 7.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s new favorite toothpaste and I have trouble finding it locally in the fluoride-free version.  It is a great price here compared to my local Whole foods-the only local place I can reliably find it.  I try to avoid fluoride (and food colorings etc...) This toothpaste meets my criteria.    We love it!</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter who does not like most other toothpastes because they are \\&quot;too spicy\\&quot; that is they tend to burn her tongue.  She has enjoyed this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Flouride-free toothpaste is not only great for kids, but adults as well. Yes, the taste takes a little time to get use to, but it is a great, healthy product. Flouride is poison, so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative at a great price.</li>
            <li> The orange was too sweet for my girls, but they love the strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect tooth paste for the three kids.</li>
            <li> While this toothpaste has a subtle, fruity flavor, it does not really bring strawberries to mind. Thankfully, it&#x27;s not chalky nor gritty at all. The gums feel soothed after using this paste. It has a slightly murky beige color, though. The foaming action is moderate. One downside is that it does not leave the mouth feeling as fresh and clean as long as other pastes.</li>
            <li> Got this last week after reading the great reviews and doing alot of reaserch. My daughter loves it so much that she keeps wanting to brush her teeth with more after already having done it once. I did a little taste test and it is mild, and not too toothpastey.Great deal for what you get. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste because the other flavors of Tom&#x27;s were too harsh for my kid&#x27;s mouths. I was happy with the initial flavor, but  have to say, I am not too impressed with how well it cleans or with the flavor after the initial flavor wears off. It tastes like a chemical of some sort after a few brushes. BUT the kids seem to like it, and it is fluoride free, so I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This was provided to my toddler during a dental visit.  He has been pretty good and cooperative with brushing but suddenly refused to open his mouth.  It didn&#x27;t occur to me that it was the new toothpaste he was rejecting until I tasted it and realized why.  It tastes gross.  There is no resemblance to strawberries or berries of any kind.  I thought maybe it was rancid?  But I checked the pull date on the tube and it was years away from being expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave it 1 star was that the tube is huge compared to most flouride free toothpastes - I mean this thing could last you years given that you only use a teeny-tiny bit for toddlers.</li>
            <li> Love it. We don&#x27;t use any other and we dip it in neem tooth powder.</li>
            <li> Doing the job on our dogs.  I know it is not marketed for pets but my vet recommended it.</li>
            <li> My 9-year old picked this toothpaste when shopping in the US. Back home in Finland, I tried it myself. The next morning I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth looked and felt. I&#x27;ve now used this toothpaste for a couple of months and my dentist just told me that we can extend the period until my next cleansing with three months. The product has changed my life! Amazon, please stock the Orange-Mango flavor, too!</li>
