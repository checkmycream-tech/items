            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Its got Sandlewood in it so thats the musk aspect, but it has a light femine sweet tone too.</li>
            <li>but what stood out the most was the personal touch of note from seller stating how important customer satisfaction is ; 0) nice</li>
            <li>This spray takes me back in time to old wonderful memories ...</li>
            <li>Smells so good, different, compliments!</li>
            <li>I actually am not in love with this scent but, as far as musks go this is probably the best one money can buy.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to certain smells and most fragrances make me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores, so I am happy they have it online.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this its also been discontinued only place you can find it is on here</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>

            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>It was a gift and went over very well.</li>
            <li>It mists onto the body very well.  </li>
            <li>They got it to me earlier than expected and the bottle was in good condition...</li>
            <li>I ordered one body spray and they were kind enough to surprise me with an extra one!</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite and the bath and body works in green bay WI</li>
            <li>It does not smell old at all.</li>
            <li>frequently</li>
            <li>This fragrance is for in my opinion a woman not teen or an older female because frankly is inappropriate in strength for a young girl &amp; may be too loud for some older ladies so guessingly saying its basically 20s-40s scent.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s supose to be a new version of sentual amber mixed with something else</li>

            <li> I am very sensitive to certain smells and most fragrances make me feel nauseous. This fragrance is great and smells really nice (as long as I don&#x27;t spray too much of it. haha). I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> After taking a shower with the gel, I apply my lotion, and then the mist - this is laying and I just love the scent!  Will be buying these again</li>

            <li> Very well-packed and shipped nicely in this extreme weather we have been having. Good job.</li>
            <li> Amber Scent is one of my favorite fragrance. I really love Bath and Body products. I recommend to any female who loves the scent of Amber.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite fragrance ~ please keep these in supply!</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s my favorite and the bath and body works in green bay WI sadly discontinued it few months ago thank god I found it it&#x27;s the bomb compairing to the Amber blush that&#x27;s supose to be a new version of sentual amber mixed with something else</li>
            <li> Smell good, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This smell is like a woman after shave should be. Great fragrant, I will definetly buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> This scent is not what I hoped for. It smells like a vanilla musk.  I&#x27;m not a big vanilla fan. If you like vanilla and musk, this should be your scent. The seller was great though. I can&#x27;t complain there. They got it to me earlier than expected and the bottle was in good condition... Anyway, I gave this body spray to my cousin and she really liked it! Just not a scent for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent of all time</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Hard to find in stores, so I am happy they have it online. Started using it in 2009 and still obsessed with the smell!</li>
            <li> would not spray so finally threw it away to get rid of the stress.  Another rip.</li>
            <li> I received this scent before as a gift and from that point on, it was a must have! It just smells so sexy... If that makes any sense! Lol! I love it so much! My Hubby says it makes me smell like chocolate cake? Idk, I don&#x27;t smell that when I have it on! But this is a MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered one body spray and they were kind enough to surprise me with an extra one! Very very pleased!</li>
            <li> I keep having women stop me to see what I am wearing. .. frequently</li>
            <li> I think this is a great smell. SMells expensive without giving a headache or smelling like a grandma. I think it is suitable for all ages. awesome price, too.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and went over very well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for date night!</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this order. It doesnt smell as good as the room spray they had in this scent. this is more like designer imposter perfume you can get at walmart.</li>
            <li> I actually am not in love with this scent but, as far as musks go this is probably the best one money can buy. Why? Because its actually very subtle. Its got Sandlewood in it so thats the musk aspect, but it has a light femine sweet tone too. This fragrance is for in my opinion a woman not teen or an older female because frankly is inappropriate in strength for a young girl &amp; may be too loud for some older ladies so guessingly saying its basically 20s-40s scent. It actually is almost unisex as well fyi. If this were a gift pair it with a mahogany teakwood candle the lotion, shower gel and this splash...very romantic gift for your lady.</li>
            <li> Great scent. A little goes a long way and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, different, compliments!</li>
            <li> Again Love the B&amp;BW body mists! Always have liked the Sensual Amber!!!</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this scent.  It mists onto the body very well.  It is a heavier scent so not everyone is going to like it.</li>
            <li> wonderful smell and it came earlier than expected will order again.</li>
            <li> smells great!!! for the price who can beat this wonderful smell for the summer!! i need to order another bottle ASAP</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance</li>

            <li> Sexy scent! Can&#x27;t go wrong with the body mist. Layer the gel, body cream and mist, you will smell magnificent all day long!</li>
            <li> I not really like..it was ok</li>
            <li> love the fragrance.  Have scent in other products.  They are well received as gifts for all sorts of occasions</li>
            <li> Came in less than a week. Was all wrapped up so it was very secure. Came with the receipt which I liked very much :) This perfume is my favorite, along with Velvet Sugar. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it :) Will be ordering again. Thank you! :)</li>
