    <ol>
            <li>Good luck!!</li>
            <li>Lasts a good time when fully charged...but the best is that you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in to the wall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are in the market for an epilator, this one is great for the price.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a great deal &amp; it does not pull the hair out.  </li>
            <li>thank u great item</li>
            <li>I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion I see nothing but good things about its use comparing it to waxing or shaving and is just what I expected:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d this one as a Christmas gift off my wish list and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Best is that it works well, even does a pretty good job around the knees.  </li>
            <li>I love it--you just have to plug it in!</li>
            <li>I bought this epilady after borrowing a friend&#x27;s and falling in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Fits in to your hand nicely.</li>
            <li>I have never ever used any kind of Epilators.</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging, and it&#x27;s a nice shape and size.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>It works better on the legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>However, after using for just two weeks my hair is already growing more</li>
            <li>More like a razor.  </li>
            <li>That is OK but limits where you stand to use it.</li>
            <li>and I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re minimum and always can use tweezers for a better finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I personaly think that its really good.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Excellent epilator, I&#x27;d recommend it widely.  </li>
            <li>loved it so much that asked me to order one for her.</li>
            <li>Even so, I like it better than the original.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product is incredible and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wanted it primarily for facial/chin hair.  </li>
            <li>one thing I did notice is the charge light does not say it is charged</li>
            <li>and I love the item very much  </li>
            <li>After 20+ years using my original epilady, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Which is no problem, the original wasn&#x27;t either, and I just plug it in.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it does get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good epilator however; the charge does not last more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>after a while the power of the epilator kind of starts dying out even if you have it plugged in its not as strong as when it was first new</li>
            <li>Its not painful on hands and legs.</li>
            <li>But overall a good product</li>
            <li>The battery dies quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the classic Epi for years and have enjoyed silky, stubbless legs.  </li>
            <li>I am not all that thrilled with the way it functions in general.  </li>
            <li>Earlier, I had the old model and felt it was more safe than the tweezer apparatus.</li>
            <li>This one works ok, its just better for touch ups, its a little slower than the legend.</li>
            <li>thank you very much  kerstin</li>
            <li>I got this as my first epilator.</li>
            <li>No epilator is going to get all the hair first go, but after running it over a couple of times it removed my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>And, it requires more maintenance for personal care than the ad indicates.  </li>
            <li>After I depilated the first time I just had to maintain it.</li>
            <li>However, when plugged into an outlet (and it has a nice long cord), it does a fabulous job on facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with this, seeing as I&#x27;m always at home, near an outlet, when engaging in hair removal, but the product&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;as described&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>use at your own risk for that (NOT WORTH THE PAIN!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well, misses very few hairs.</li>
            <li>He said, \\&quot;you can use this one for traveling.\\&quot;  Smart man.</li>
            <li>This product Epilady is very convenient with 22 tweezers.</li>
            <li>The reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t really work when it&#x27;s not plugged in.  </li>
            <li>and it saves me so much time.</li>
            <li>Mine does hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li>However, I would not repurchase this particular product again.</li>
            <li>, this particular model is not made for your underarms...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The 1st one I got was the epilady legend, much bigger, sturdier, more effective and expensive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to fast for certain areas, it simply snaps the hair off too quickly creating an effect the same as a razor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I could live without this</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this new mini a try</li>
            <li>I guess because they&#x27;re new)</li>
            <li>go back to the classic style and can&#x27;t wait to get my old, smooth &amp; silky legs back!</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Technically, it does still spin when it&#x27;s not plugged in, but it moves much more slowly and dies after about 10min, so it pretty much needs to be plugged in all the time.  </li>
            <li>the first time in years I&#x27;ve got stubbles and even though I go over and over them, this shaver cannot get close enough to get them.  </li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t take quite so long, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>However, as far as usage capability, I charge it as directed however the battery dies literally in about 5-10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>The next time is even easier than the first, and the hair grows back less noticeable and fine.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions of charging it for 15 hours, and I waited for the light to turn green.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used the old, wire version of the epilady for years before it finally died and I had to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>3 Days later, the light still didn&#x27;t turn green.  </li>
            <li>The regrowth is fast &amp; is not worth the pain.  </li>
            <li>But, a little too Big for those really \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas.</li>
            <li>So it has good and bad, out of the cheaper of the epilady products you get what you pay for</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long enough cord that I don&#x27;t bother charging, I just plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li> and it definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with such red points as wax does even a week later (they appear but smaller and disappear in less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I am somewhat afraid of it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use this without the cord as It will not charge after several tries.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it still hurts, you&#x27;re still ripping out hair, though my personal opinion is that it hurts way less than waxing.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little bigger</li>
            <li> It has half of the tweezers and takes me three times as long to get my legs done.  </li>
            <li> This works well for hair removal, but I end up with unsightly and sometimes irritating red bumps when I use it regularly on my underarm area.</li>
            <li> But yes for underarms it is.. and it also takes time to remove all your hair, its not quick.</li>
            <li> My husband finally told me to just buy the other one because he was tired of hearing about it.  </li>
            <li> and it does hurt a little</li>
            <li> Maybe there can be a few little ones that won&#x27;t come out</li>
            <li> Yes, it is painful, but it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li> You do have to go over the area a few times to get it all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen any green lights as the manual says.  </li>
            <li> If missing a few ones, you can pass it over again (usually movements in circles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, as a first time user, it hurts, but it&#x27;s not as painful as I thought.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot quieter than its predecessor, and seems to work just as well, if not better.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these in the past.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the power when not plugged in was pretty weak.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts but at least for me it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> Dont know if it is just bad luck or that the product simply is not being built well anymore.  </li>
            <li> This review focuses on the product itself and its usability...not the pain behind the process of every epilator.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> It is efficient and not too painful.</li>
            <li> That is my disappointment with it !  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is ok.  I am a little disappointed in this product.  I wanted it primarily for facial/chin hair.  It does grab some of them but not all. It works better on the legs and bikini area.  However, I would not repurchase this particular product again.</li>
            <li> Note ***This review focuses on the product itself and its usability...not the pain behind the process of every epilator.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright guys, I am not going to beat around the bush...This thing hurts.  However, after using for just two weeks my hair is already growing more sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plugs in to the wall to charge.  Lasts a good time when fully charged...but the best is that you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in to the wall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely pay attention to the directions on how to use it!&lt;br /&gt;Also, this particular model is not made for your underarms...use at your own risk for that (NOT WORTH THE PAIN!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for an epilator, this one is great for the price.  Does its job well.  Fits in to your hand nicely. But, a little too Big for those really \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas. (Bikini Line, Under arms)  For those, look to another</li>
            <li> This does not work nearly as well as I expected.  It hurts a great deal &amp; it does not pull the hair out.  More like a razor.  The regrowth is fast &amp; is not worth the pain.  Guess you get what you pay for.  Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first epilator. I&#x27;m not going to lie, as a first time user, it hurts, but it&#x27;s not as painful as I thought. I wish it were a little bigger so it wouldn&#x27;t take quite so long, but it works pretty well. No epilator is going to get all the hair first go, but after running it over a couple of times it removed my hair pretty well. So far I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> This product Epilady is very convenient with 22 tweezers. However, as far as usage capability, I charge it as directed however the battery dies literally in about 5-10 minutes of use. Then I have to charge it again for about ten minutes becauses I could not get all the hairs out that I wanted. Other than that, the product is incredible and easy to use. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used the old, wire version of the epilady for years before it finally died and I had to get a new one.  This one is a lot quieter than its predecessor, and seems to work just as well, if not better.  Yes, it still hurts, you&#x27;re still ripping out hair, though my personal opinion is that it hurts way less than waxing.  The reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that it doesn&#x27;t really work when it&#x27;s not plugged in.  Technically, it does still spin when it&#x27;s not plugged in, but it moves much more slowly and dies after about 10min, so it pretty much needs to be plugged in all the time.

            <li> This works well for hair removal, but I end up with unsightly and sometimes irritating red bumps when I use it regularly on my underarm area.</li>
            <li> after a while the power of the epilator kind of starts dying out even if you have it plugged in its not as strong as when it was first new</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these in the past. The battery dies quickly.  I have to use them with the AC adapter. That is OK but limits where you stand to use it. It is efficient and not too painful. Don&#x27;t think I could live without this</li>
            <li> This epilator has never been rechargeable from the moment I got it. I plugged it in for days, but when unplugged, it did nothing. However, when plugged into an outlet (and it has a nice long cord), it does a fabulous job on facial hair. I love it--you just have to plug it in!</li>
            <li> I cannot use this without the cord as It will not charge after several tries.  That is my disappointment with it !  Otherwise it does get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I also had the coil epilator that went ka-put.  I rec&#x27;d this one as a Christmas gift off my wish list and am very pleased with the results.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> thank u great item and I love the item very much  I will look again sometime  thank you very much  kerstin</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good epilator however; the charge does not last more than 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t mind this because I can just keep it plugged in and use it. I think it needs speed control... it&#x27;s to fast for certain areas, it simply snaps the hair off too quickly creating an effect the same as a razor. So it has good and bad, out of the cheaper of the epilady products you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I am somewhat afraid of it.  And, it requires more maintenance for personal care than the ad indicates.  Earlier, I had the old model and felt it was more safe than the tweezer apparatus.</li>
            <li> This works just like it says it does.  You do have to go over the area a few times to get it all and it does hurt a little but you get used to it and it saves me so much time. Mine does hold a charge very well. I left it plugged in all day and then un plugged it and have used it about 3 times since I charged it.  one thing I did notice is the charge light does not say it is charged but it is.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying the smaller one now for my eye brows.  This one is every thing it says it is to me.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the power when not plugged in was pretty weak.  I am not all that thrilled with the way it functions in general.  I feel like it leaves a lot of stray hairs on my legs that I usually go back and pluck out with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well, misses very few hairs. Long enough cord that I don&#x27;t bother charging, I just plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the classic Epi for years and have enjoyed silky, stubbless legs.  Thought I&#x27;d give this new mini a try but the results are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years I&#x27;ve got stubbles and even though I go over and over them, this shaver cannot get close enough to get them.  I&#x27;m going to&lt;br /&gt;to go back to the classic style and can&#x27;t wait to get my old, smooth &amp; silky legs back!</li>
            <li> but I bought 2 of these and neither one did. Dont know if it is just bad luck or that the product simply is not being built well anymore.  But I am not trying a third time.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd epilady, my 1st stopped charging after I took it with me on a trip. The 1st one I got was the epilady legend, much bigger, sturdier, more effective and expensive. This one works ok, its just better for touch ups, its a little slower than the legend. If I had to buy again I would spend the extra $$ on the Legend, and remember to take it as carry on!</li>
            <li> I have never ever used any kind of Epilators. Always did waxing. I just decided to order this one day. Came on time. As a first time user, I personaly think that its really good.I am happy with it. Its not painful on hands and legs. But yes for underarms it is.. and it also takes time to remove all your hair, its not quick. But overall a good product and I would surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent epilator, I&#x27;d recommend it widely.  I came to visit my family and my sister loved it so much that asked me to order one for her. In my opinion I see nothing but good things about its use comparing it to waxing or shaving and is just what I expected:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * I have VERY sensitive skin and it definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with such red points as wax does even a week later (they appear but smaller and disappear in less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * If missing a few ones, you can pass it over again (usually movements in circles work well), and don&#x27;t have to burn again the skin as with wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  Yes, it hurts but at least for me it&#x27;s tolerable. I&#x27;ve tried not to think about it and somehow I got used to it (DEFINITELY I prefer some pain every 3 weeks than having to shave every 2-3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  Don&#x27;t have to deal with wax stains on the floor or with residues on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  No accidentally cuttings and saves time almost like when shaving!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  After I depilated the first time I just had to maintain it. Everytime I see some growing (they seem thinner I guess because they&#x27;re new), I just have to turn my epilator on and pass it over (don&#x27;t have to wait for wax melting, again saving time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  Maybe there can be a few little ones that won&#x27;t come out but they&#x27;re minimum and always can use tweezers for a better finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  I can carry it in my purse, the size is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * If it lasts as some reviews I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;d save money because I only had to buy it once and not the wax device plus the wax or razor every time when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hope this helps. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> After 20+ years using my original epilady, I decided to give this one a try. I liked the packaging, and it&#x27;s a nice shape and size.  Best is that it works well, even does a pretty good job around the knees.  Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it&#x27;s not cordless.  Which is no problem, the original wasn&#x27;t either, and I just plug it in.  But this part of the advertising: &amp;#34;Corded or cordless use. Charge lasts up to 45 minutes.&amp;#34; should not be there. Even so, I like it better than the original.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilady after borrowing a friend&#x27;s and falling in love with it!  Yes, it is painful, but it&#x27;s so worth it.  The next time is even easier than the first, and the hair grows back less noticeable and fine.  I followed the directions of charging it for 15 hours, and I waited for the light to turn green.  3 Days later, the light still didn&#x27;t turn green.  It is still red to the day.  I&#x27;ve never seen any green lights as the manual says.  Also, this is a baby compared to the Panasonic I borrowed from my friend.  It has half of the tweezers and takes me three times as long to get my legs done.  My husband finally told me to just buy the other one because he was tired of hearing about it.  He said, \\&quot;you can use this one for traveling.\\&quot;  Smart man.</li>
