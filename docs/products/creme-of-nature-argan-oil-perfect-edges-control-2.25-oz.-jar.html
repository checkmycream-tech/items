    <ol>
            <li> Like the way it spreads. I use with a toothbrush and hair is smooth and slick. It does the job it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural and this stuff keeps my edges on fleek! It&#x27;s the only edge control I&#x27;ve used and my edges didn&#x27;t curl back up. My edges stay sleek all day long &amp; its well worth it for the price. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This edge control came a day before expected and it slicks down very kinky natural hair ! I didn&#x27;t even need a brush , just by applying it and slicking it back with my hands it stayed and place and gave the hair a great shine ! Definitely glad I bought !</li>
            <li> It arrive while I was in Va and was on time. I love it</li>
            <li> Does thee dew just fine.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent but it&#x27;s too strong for me. Maybe if I leave the cap off the jar the scent will fade. The hold seems to be good.</li>
            <li> Love it it holds down my edge real good</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I live in HOT Florida so this product does not keep my edges laid. I don&#x27;t get a white residue that others speak of. It&#x27;s just that when I use this, it doesn&#x27;t hold. Like my edges just poof back up within 10 minutes. I have tried to use this with a Spritz and even an extra holding gel and it still does not hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t keep my edge down</li>
            <li> This edge control is running neck to neck with another very good one by hicks. It keeps edges slick all day and the price is jaw dropping. I&#x27;ll always purchase this brand its Awesome.</li>
            <li> He should be able to hold more then it did other then that it&#x27;s nice and smell good ... O</li>
            <li> Great product. It just didn&#x27;t get here when the supplier said it would.</li>
            <li> Love how it works on me &amp; my daughters hair! It makes our hair wave up so pretty!!! I dont really car for the smell though! And ot seems to wear off on my hair faster than the ors edge control does.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister and she love this stuff</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li> This edge control cream works well and most importantly, it smells good!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s cheaper here than at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Good edge control.  A thick gel that makes edges look shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have a pretty good texture of hair so it&#x27;s rare that I use anything for my edges but a long time ago I did use Jam and Queen Helene and in my experience they were rather drying, cause build up and tend to flake. Not so with this-- it feels nice. I like that it moisturizes and has a glossy sheen as well. The ingredients also are good for the hair. I&#x27;ve read quite a few people didn&#x27;t care for it because it didn&#x27;t work on their edges but seems to work fine for me.</li>
            <li> Love the shines this give off and works very well. To be honest it&#x27;s works way better than Hicks and the ORS Olive Oil edge control, those leave your hair dry and with white flakes. This is the total opposite, your hair will be smooth, LAID as they say and most importantly you can it again the next day without worrying about buildup.</li>
            <li> I did not like this and I would recommend this gel called gorilla snot.. Lol I know it sound funny but gorilla snot gel works great</li>
