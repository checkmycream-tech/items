            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>I keep a bottle handy for burns (while cooking) ...</li>
            <li>Excellent product that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Almost better than having your own Aloe Vera plant handy (which we do).</li>
            <li>Great substitute for hair gel that is natural and works great.</li>
            <li>It also rinses very easily from my hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will also come in handy for summer burns.</li>
            <li>Received fast in good packing!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will buy again and again.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Aloe seems to be the magic bullet for me.  </li>
            <li>aloe has many uses.</li>
            <li>SURE MANY OTHERS</li>
            <li>I have some keratosis (fellow sufferers know what I&#x27;m talking about) on my upper arms, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for softening and smoothing my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also add this to a mister bottle with water for a refreshing mist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite brand of AVG.</li>
            <li>I can use for many things: sunburn, iching,redness,mask...</li>
            <li>Very nice fast relief for skin rashes from irritation or diaper rashes.  </li>
            <li>THE FUR BABIES LICK THEIR FACES OR ARMS WHEN PLAYING OR YOUR JUST COMING HOME ETC AND EXCITED TO SEE YOU!</li>
            <li>Great product - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this very pure aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>In fact, simply wiping off the excess gel without water works beautifully.</li>
            <li>It is especially effective in making beeswax hand creams less viscous and easier to spread.</li>
            <li>I use it for EVERYTHING--to soothe my skin, to smooth my hair, to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>oh well you can make your own aloe vera gel straight from aloe vera leafs .</li>
            <li>Thankfully I still had a cheap store brand that after one application, I noticed a differance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily in conjunction with a moisturizing bodywash for over 3 months now, and it has been GREAT for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a great product overall!</li>
            <li>And, it has no alcohol, fragrance free, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>liked the aloe gel so much that I re orderd it - like</li>
            <li>aloe vera gel and is far superior to the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand in my opinion.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t add much body to my fine hair, it does a great job of providing soft hold for my hair.  </li>
            <li>using it as hair gel instead of other chemical-heavy products - does not irritate scalp, and is light but has a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for over-night skin care on the face - keeps dryness away and seems to soothe and make skin softer... :-)</li>
            <li>I have fair, dry skin and have had persistent problems with it flaking and getting burned easily.  </li>
            <li>It also seeps into your skin quickly after you stop rubbing, so the majority of it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what all those chemicals are, but I know it causes the aloe to feel thicker than the real pure stuff and made my skin prickle a bit.  </li>
            <li>The pump really makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also good for my dry skin as I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on that as well;</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait on anything such as a particular hair product, if you don&#x27;t get what you want or like, then get up and make it with your own creative idea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s also good for dry skin ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years now, love this clear one</li>
            <li>IF YOU PUT ON FRESH AND</li>
            <li>Hey, you want it to be unscented, right?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what it really smells like!</li>
            <li>It stings very slightly at first on damaged skin.</li>
            <li>We love the clear aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the bottles we ordered leaked during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Other vendors we have use put tape or shrink-wrap on each&lt;br /&gt;bottle to prevent spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the loss of a small amount out of each bottle,&lt;br /&gt;we were very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li>and it is a soothing thick gel anyone would be happy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for small cuts &amp; scrapes also!</li>
            <li>Was great for my sunburns this past summer, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many aloe products over the year since I&#x27;ve got dry skin living in the desert.</li>
            <li>However, for those looking for 100% pure aloe, this is not the product for you.    </li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re probably put in there to stabilize the aloe, but whatever the reason this is NOT 100% pure.    </li>
            <li>A lot ppl complain it is not 100% pure aloe vera...</li>
            <li>I mix it with DMAE (pure) powder.</li>
            <li>It is almost pure Aleo Vera.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using aloe for over 30 years, either straight from the plant or out of a bottle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>my mother uses it for her psoriasis and it works really well ...</li>
            <li>can highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Helped me so much.</li>
            <li>healing and very soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe (the label actually says it&#x27;s \\&quot;pure gel\\&quot;), but 100% pure aloe would decay after a few days, so I&#x27;m glad!  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Triethanolamine,  safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my skin looked completely normal.</li>
            <li>So i just purchased a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>Love this product as hair gel because it does not contain alcohol or similar ingredient and lasts long time.</li>
            <li>You need larger amounts for burns, and it will penetrate faster on burned skin because it soaks it right up.</li>
            <li>, I bought the same brand the first time I purchase aloe vera.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear.</li>
            <li>Uhhhh it says this product is clear and no color added I bought this</li>
            <li>I wanted an aloe vera that was clear, without coloring...</li>
            <li>You can use in place of gel for natural hold.  </li>
            <li>No green additives</li>
            <li>I love this gel for thinning the heavy creams I use to prevent the drying and cracking associated with low humidity and chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>So much better and soothing than the products sold in the drug stores, which contain very little actual aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I tried different brands of aloe gel and chose this particular one and the pump is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>This stuff actually seems to help damaged skin heal faster, as only pure aloe can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never sticky, is orderless--other than a slight fresh aloe smell.</li>
            <li>quickly cleared up a dry skin problem I got from the dry air in a Buffalo winter.</li>
            <li>It smells like pure aloe up close, slightly \\&quot;fishy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, god forbid - it contains no alcohol - just a slight tingle like pure aloe.</li>
            <li>We have used Fruit of the Earth 100% Gel Aloe Vera for sunburn treatment, dry skin, natural hair gel -</li>
            <li>I bought this as a scalp conditioner to soothe dry scalp in the winter after going to all natural hair products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very difficult to find a good product, since I work in a place that is dehumidified all the time, but this definitely does the trick.</li>

            <li> I tried different brands of aloe gel and chose this particular one and the pump is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> This stuff actually seems to help damaged skin heal faster, as only pure aloe can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never sticky, is orderless--other than a slight fresh aloe smell.</li>
            <li> quickly cleared up a dry skin problem I got from the dry air in a Buffalo winter.</li>
            <li> It smells like pure aloe up close, slightly \\&quot;fishy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> , god forbid - it contains no alcohol - just a slight tingle like pure aloe.</li>
            <li> We have used Fruit of the Earth 100% Gel Aloe Vera for sunburn treatment, dry skin, natural hair gel -</li>
            <li> I bought this as a scalp conditioner to soothe dry scalp in the winter after going to all natural hair products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very difficult to find a good product, since I work in a place that is dehumidified all the time, but this definitely does the trick.</li>
            <li> Got a really bad burn last July and tried some other brands with anesthetics and other garbage in them and were no where near as effective as the pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> Lots of product for the price, very big bottle, will last a very long time, no additives or colors, recommend for any skin irritations including cuts.  </li>
            <li> But I can tell this is very close to pure because it behaves like pure aloe in four ways: (1)</li>
            <li> A little of this stuff goes a long way for general skin care.  </li>
            <li> As it dries it it feels sticky to the touch, and when completely dry it feels silky.</li>
            <li> This was an add on for my daughter to use to mix with loose body glitter.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my moisturizer and never have dry skin, even living in the desert!  </li>
            <li> Next day, sunburn gone or very much less</li>
            <li> Little blisters were forming on it the last time i checked and now my skin looks like nothing happened.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I bought this product and it contains Triethanolamine which I found is not to be used in products that are left on the skin, I will be throwing this away but wanted to warn others before they order that this may not be the product they want, I will stick with straight Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li> A few hours later I remembered and looked at my legs.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I prefer this pump applicator to other squeeze bottles.</li>
            <li> sunburns can require several thick applications -</li>
            <li> I no longer have problems with hair products irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes it has a soothing, slightly anesthetic effect.</li>
            <li> By the time i came inside my skin was showing little bumps...</li>
            <li> Did see a review about the \\&quot;sticky film\\&quot; left behind on another site.  </li>
            <li> and I can use this product in the morning, and when I shower after work the water will reactivate the gel as if the product dried immediately and sat there...</li>
            <li> Few brands like this product.</li>
            <li> IT HAS NO RIGHT BEING IN THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> We also buy the small travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s no nice</li>
            <li> expensive botanical treatments, dermatologist prescribed medicines, etc.  </li>
            <li> I got a horrible sun burn on my legs the other day.</li>
            <li> (yeah, it was that bad).  </li>
            <li> I use this as a base for my home made face serum.</li>
            <li> ITS HORRIFYING THE SIDE EFFECTS</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this product in my hair, face, body, hands and feet. I love this product and will buy again and again.  Thanks for having it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for EVERYTHING--to soothe my skin, to smooth my hair, to moisturize my skin. It&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s never sticky, is orderless--other than a slight fresh aloe smell. The pump really makes it easy to use. My only gripe is that I have a lot of product left at the bottom of my bottle, but the straw straw doesn&#x27;t reach, so I have to constantly upturn the bottle, or dig and scrape the bottom to get the last of my gel out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now, love this clear one and it&#x27;s no nice it&#x27;s in a pump bottle!  I use it with my moisturizer and never have dry skin, even living in the desert!  It&#x27;s great for small cuts &amp; scrapes also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using aloe for over 30 years, either straight from the plant or out of a bottle. Fruit of the Earth is the closest I have found to what&#x27;s actually inside an aloe leaf. It&#x27;s not 100% pure aloe (the label actually says it&#x27;s \\&quot;pure gel\\&quot;), but 100% pure aloe would decay after a few days, so I&#x27;m glad!  But I can tell this is very close to pure because it behaves like pure aloe in four ways: (1) As it dries it it feels sticky to the touch, and when completely dry it feels silky. (2) It smells like pure aloe up close, slightly \\&quot;fishy.\\&quot; Hey, you want it to be unscented, right? That&#x27;s what it really smells like! (3) It stings very slightly at first on damaged skin. Not like alcohol, god forbid - it contains no alcohol - just a slight tingle like pure aloe. After a few minutes it has a soothing, slightly anesthetic effect. (4) This stuff actually seems to help damaged skin heal faster, as only pure aloe can. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fair, dry skin and have had persistent problems with it flaking and getting burned easily.  Got a really bad burn last July and tried some other brands with anesthetics and other garbage in them and were no where near as effective as the pure aloe vera.  This was the largest bottle I could find and went through two of them (yeah, it was that bad).  Amazing stuff.  Also good for my dry skin as I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on that as well; expensive botanical treatments, dermatologist prescribed medicines, etc.  Aloe seems to be the magic bullet for me.  Try it.  Couldn&#x27;t hurt!  Did see a review about the \\&quot;sticky film\\&quot; left behind on another site.  Uhhh, yeah if you don&#x27;t rub it in until it penetrates the skin, then you&#x27;re gonna have a film of aloe on the surface.  A little of this stuff goes a long way for general skin care.  You need larger amounts for burns, and it will penetrate faster on burned skin because it soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> Good quality aloe vera without added color. The pump works well and aloe has many uses. I like it after sun exposure.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I bought this product and it contains Triethanolamine which I found is not to be used in products that are left on the skin, I will be throwing this away but wanted to warn others before they order that this may not be the product they want, I will stick with straight Aloe Vera Gel. \\&quot;Triethanolamine,  safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with the skin, the concentration of Triethanolamine.. should not exceed 5%.\\&quot; [...]</li>
            <li> Almost better than having your own Aloe Vera plant handy (which we do). We have used Fruit of the Earth 100% Gel Aloe Vera for sunburn treatment, dry skin, natural hair gel - especially handy in the pump version! We also buy the small travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad sunburns can require several thick applications - as it dries, just keep slathering it on! Rinse it off after several layers, then repeat. Next day, sunburn gone or very much less critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love using it as hair gel instead of other chemical-heavy products - does not irritate scalp, and is light but has a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for over-night skin care on the face - keeps dryness away and seems to soothe and make skin softer... :-)</li>
            <li> This is a good product, and relieved my sunburned skin.  However, for those looking for 100% pure aloe, this is not the product for you.    I initially bought this product to put into my organic face mask mixtures, but this gel is actually a mixture of aloe gel and water, triethanolamine, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, tetrasodium edta, dmdm hydantoin, and diazolidinyl urea.  I have no idea what all those chemicals are, but I know it causes the aloe to feel thicker than the real pure stuff and made my skin prickle a bit.  I think they&#x27;re probably put in there to stabilize the aloe, but whatever the reason this is NOT 100% pure.    Otherwise, for those looking for a soothing aloe gel without added colors or fragrances, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> A lot ppl complain it is not 100% pure aloe vera...oh well you can make your own aloe vera gel straight from aloe vera leafs . I grow it too and is planning making Aloe vera gel with shea butter calling shea gel. Don&#x27;t wait on anything such as a particular hair product, if you don&#x27;t get what you want or like, then get up and make it with your own creative idea. But be safe!</li>
            <li> I use this to make bath products. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This product contains stabilizers and vitamin E. It was perfect for what I wanted. I added lavender oil and tea tree oil to it. My skin has never been so clear. I will buy it again when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> HOW CAN THEY PUT THIS IN A PRODUCT THAT SAYS ..HEALS?? LOOK IT UP...ITS HORRIFYING THE SIDE EFFECTS&lt;br /&gt;AND YES HUMANS WILL NOT BE INGESTING IT (WHICH SAYS CAN BE FATAL) MY DOGS AND IM SURE MANY OTHERS PET OWNERS WILL SAY..THE FUR BABIES LICK THEIR FACES OR ARMS WHEN PLAYING OR YOUR JUST COMING HOME ETC AND EXCITED TO SEE YOU! WELL THEN..THEY..ARE INGESTED THE PRODUCT!!! ESP IF YOU PUT ON FRESH AND YOUR DOG/CAT HAPPENES TO LICK YOU! UGH THIS PEEVES ME OFF! IT HAS NO RIGHT BEING IN THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Uhhhh it says this product is clear and no color added I bought this and it was blue</li>
            <li> Great product - can&#x27;t live without it. Also, this is the best deal anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many aloe products over the year since I&#x27;ve got dry skin living in the desert. This one dries sticky and leaves a filmy sense on the skin. Try a different one.</li>
            <li> Just like the title says, this product doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. I&#x27;m in the desert and I can use this product in the morning, and when I shower after work the water will reactivate the gel as if the product dried immediately and sat there... no absorbtion... no change in condition, even after days of use(two applications per day).    Thankfully I still had a cheap store brand that after one application, I noticed a differance. This is a horrible product. I&#x27;m thankful that I didn&#x27;t buy the twin pack.</li>
            <li> quickly cleared up a dry skin problem I got from the dry air in a Buffalo winter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I&#x27;d highly recommend. It soothes your skin after a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as suggested for a noncomedogenic hair gel.  I have been very pleased!  While it doesn&#x27;t add much body to my fine hair, it does a great job of providing soft hold for my hair.  I no longer have problems with hair products irritating my sensitive skin.  It also rinses very easily from my hands.  In fact, simply wiping off the excess gel without water works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for hair gel that is natural and works great.</li>
            <li> i use this on my toddler because sometimes i need some hair gel for her but im scared to put in \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; products in her hair. works great but detangle the hair before you use this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily in conjunction with a moisturizing bodywash for over 3 months now, and it has been GREAT for my skin. I have some keratosis (fellow sufferers know what I&#x27;m talking about) on my upper arms, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for softening and smoothing my skin. It&#x27;s been very difficult to find a good product, since I work in a place that is dehumidified all the time, but this definitely does the trick. Was great for my sunburns this past summer, too! All in all, great stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base for my home made face serum. I mix it with DMAE (pure) powder. Wrinkles vanish, skin glows. wonderful combo. Aloe Vera is so good for the skin &amp; this brand is excellant!</li>
            <li> This works great for a lotion, but it works as a massage gel as well.  I have a chronic pain condition, and have to massage my abdomen 2-4 times daily.  It&#x27;s incredibly afordable, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that greasy feeling lotion does.  It also seeps into your skin quickly after you stop rubbing, so the majority of it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I love this gel for thinning the heavy creams I use to prevent the drying and cracking associated with low humidity and chapped hands.  It is especially effective in making beeswax hand creams less viscous and easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this very pure aloe vera gel.  So much better and soothing than the products sold in the drug stores, which contain very little actual aloe vera.</li>
            <li> Very nice fast relief for skin rashes from irritation or diaper rashes.  Soothes lots of itchy and  burning  skin issues.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and uses it as aftershave.  It&#x27;s great as an after-sun lotion, too.  This is the best Aloe Vera Gel out there.</li>
            <li> We love the clear aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the bottles we ordered leaked during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Other vendors we have use put tape or shrink-wrap on each&lt;br /&gt;bottle to prevent spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the loss of a small amount out of each bottle,&lt;br /&gt;we were very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li> The Aloe Vera is always good. I like this brand, I bought the same brand the first time I purchase aloe vera. and it is good to use it after sun expose</li>
            <li> Lots of product for the price, very big bottle, will last a very long time, no additives or colors, recommend for any skin irritations including cuts.  Received fast in good packing!</li>
            <li> Great product and good price, good service. I have ued this product for feveral years. It has a lot of healing powers. It is almost pure Aleo Vera. Made by the best and most reliable company that I have ever done business with.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. As described. Fast shipping. A++ Thanks.</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle handy for burns (while cooking) ... I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s also good for dry skin ... my mother uses it for her psoriasis and it works really well ... can highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a scalp conditioner to soothe dry scalp in the winter after going to all natural hair products. It works great and doesn&#x27;t cause residual oiliness. I&#x27;m sure it will also come in handy for summer burns.</li>
            <li> As a cancer survivor I used this when having my radiation treatments. Helped me so much. healing and very soothing.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle! I got a horrible sun burn on my legs the other day. By the time i came inside my skin was showing little bumps...it was blistering. I applied a bunch of this gel several times for about one hour. Pain was gone and I forgot about the sunburn. A few hours later I remembered and looked at my legs. OMG....my skin looked completely normal. I don&#x27;t even know how that was possible. Little blisters were forming on it the last time i checked and now my skin looks like nothing happened. So i just purchased a few more bottles. I love this product. I am now using it all over my body instead of lotion.</li>
            <li> This was an add on for my daughter to use to mix with loose body glitter.  It&#x27;s been a great product overall!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products!&lt;br /&gt;I use this for after sun care.  I use on face to help with blemishes and to lock on moisture.  Also great for hair!!!! You can use in place of gel for natural hold.  Or mix with conditioner to bring extra moisture in.  I also add this to a mister bottle with water for a refreshing mist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite brand of AVG.</li>
            <li> I love Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel!  No green additives and it is a soothing thick gel anyone would be happy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product as hair gel because it does not contain alcohol or similar ingredient and lasts long time. Few brands like this product.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my hands and feet.  I tried different brands of aloe gel and chose this particular one and the pump is a bonus.  And, it has no alcohol, fragrance free, and no color added!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good product. I can use for many things: sunburn, iching,redness,mask...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic. I ecommend for my friends and my family.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I prefer this pump applicator to other squeeze bottles. When I run out, I will buy this again. Quality wise, it is comparable to Fruit of the Earth brand aloe vera gel and is far superior to the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand in my opinion. This product also does not contain alcohol, which is a plus for my purposes. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> liked the aloe gel so much that I re orderd it - like that there&#x27;s no addtives</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aloe gel...what can I say.  I wanted an aloe vera that was clear, without coloring...that&#x27;s what I got.  I guess it still has some additives, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
