            <li>Brown sugar and fig is what they name this product, but what I smell is a very strong coconut scent, and it&#x27;s very generic.</li>
            <li>u will 100% love and ware everyday day so happy too have it back</li>
            <li>I ordered this body spray because I had bought one many years back</li>

            <li>This body spray was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and sweet like the other reviewers said, but the coconut is way too strong.</li>
            <li>This body splash is light enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about using too much, and it&#x27;s not a seasonal fragrance</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely edible.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when the company discontinued it.</li>

            <li>I know coconut milk is in the description scent, but I think it overwhelms even the fig and brown sugar which are supposed to be the main scents.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>in brand new unused condition</li>
            <li>it has such a warm and cozy feel to it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most delicately feminine fragrances Bath and Body Works has to offer.</li>

            <li> I ordered this body spray because I had bought one many years back and I recalled this body spary and tired looking for it at the store, but unfortunately they didint have it anymore, so I searched it amazon until I found it!. It smells amazing,i fell in love with the scent the first time I bought the body spray at the store.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is SO pleasant that I use it as both a body splash AND a deodorizer for my car!  It smells absolutely edible.</li>
            <li> i bought this product, because a friend told me to, and i like it a lot, it has a great smell, buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Everyone is in love with this scent after I purchased it online without even knowing how it smelled (I decided to try it based on reviews online). Next thing I know - my sister, my cousin, my mother and friends all want to smell like me now! LOL. It&#x27;s funny because now I&#x27;ll have to gift every one of them a Brown Sugar &amp; Fig body spray for Christmas now.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent at a garage sale, and immediately loved it, One day I was playing some games with my sister and brother-in-law , and I noticed that he kept sniffing the air , and he kept smelling things ( his wife, the pillow) to find out what it was. After he found out it was my body spray, he asked my sister to buy it because he loved it.    It is great! I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most delicately feminine fragrances Bath and Body Works has to offer. It&#x27;s very sweet and girly without being overdone. This body splash is light enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about using too much, and it&#x27;s not a seasonal fragrance so it&#x27;s perfect year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer K.

            <li> Brown Sugar and Fig is my favorite Bath &amp; Body Works Body Splash.  I find it perfect for times when you want a little sophistication without the overpowering fragrance of perfume.  I think Bath and Body Works consistently delivers a quality product.  I find the oils last a long time both in the bottle and on my body.  They&#x27;re light but interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to use these body splashes prior to dressing because the oils will cause spotting on clothing if they are over-sprayed. Other than that, no problems experienced whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite scents for over 5 years...it has such a warm and cozy feel to it. So excited to see this product available online!</li>
            <li> I love this!!!  It smells so good!  I am going to buy more Plus the body wash!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day and it smells so yummy.  I actually smelled a candle with this scent and I loved it so much that I searched for the perfume.  This body spray was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Brown sugar and fig is what they name this product, but what I smell is a very strong coconut scent, and it&#x27;s very generic. I know coconut milk is in the description scent, but I think it overwhelms even the fig and brown sugar which are supposed to be the main scents. It&#x27;s very feminine and sweet like the other reviewers said, but the coconut is way too strong.</li>
            <li> Bath&amp; Body works recently brought back this fragrance and when I went back to the store it was no longer there. So I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered it from Amazon!! It was so worth it!!</li>
            <li> Really happy to be able to find this perfume. I haven&#x27;t been able to locate it in the bath and body works store for years! Very exciting find.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! I was really upset when the company discontinued it. I&#x27;ve never been able to find it and now I can. My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I GOT BROWN SUGAR &amp; FIG BECAUSE MY MOTHER LIKES IT, AND I BROUGHT IT FOR HER FOR CHRISTMAS. IT SMELLS SO GOOD, AND AT THE TIME BATH AND BODY WORKS WAS NOT SELLING IT. THANK YOU. HAPPY NEW YEAR.</li>
