            <li> I bought this set for my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday and it exceeded my expectations. She did not like the brown colors very much, but the makeup is good quality and stays on really well and for the entire day. The nail polish is quality as well and stays on without chipping. The box arrived in great condition with none of the makeup crushed, or broken. I would recommend the Carry All Train Case Makeup Set and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> My Grandaughter Loves this! The blush did come apart but she uses this as play makeup. It is hard to get off. Just soap and water......</li>
            <li> Great product for a young teenager</li>
            <li> My girls loved these as their gift, on Christmas.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. She is only 7 so this was for playtime with friends and practice only. She was overjoyed with it. I can tell you from hands on experience the case is GREAT and almost worth the price alone.  I cannot personally comment on the make-up since I am just the dad :-) , however my wife said it was all pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> Its good for my 13 year old</li>
            <li> Super product. Giving this as a Christmas gift to our daughter. Thank you!</li>

            <li> My 8 year old granddaughter loved it! It has everything a girl could want all in one case. Eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, lip liner, lipstick and nail polish. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wonderful inexpensive present!</li>
