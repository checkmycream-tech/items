            <li> This conditioner smells great, but after reading magazine ratings of it, I have to disagree that it does anything but dry your hair out more. Disappointed, but looking forward to my aveda conditioner order.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this conditioner. It is light weight and does not bulidup. Like a heavy duty conditioner, it leaves my hair smooth, shiny, static and frizz free. Even the fragrance is light. I will definitely reorde</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty with my hair looking dry and unmanageable, especially after I turned 40. Nothing I was trying was working. A salon stylist recommended this product and now I would not use anything else. I used the shampoo and conditioner and noticed a change in my hair almost immediately. One month later, it looked like it did when I was in my 20s. My hair feels so healthy, I could not imagine using something else ever again. I hope they make this product forever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and was very happy to find that Amazon carries this product and I no longer have to purchase it at a salon.</li>

            <li> I like the smaller container size. It seems thicker. The product in this container seems too runny. Not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> My hair feels light, silky and looks so shiny! Love this with the shampoo and keeps my color strong! Love!</li>

            <li> I have tried different conditioners that actually weigh my hair down.  Wella was recommended by my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;This gives body to my hair, without the feeling of any film.  Would recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Shampoo and conditioner work well, smell great, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>

            <li> This conditioner (and shampoo, purchased separately) has made me a Wella fan!  I couldn&#x27;t stop raving to my hairstylist about how fantastic this product has been to my &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; red hair.  I absolutely love the scent, and I actually feel like I can stretch color treatments a little farther because my color is so well protected!</li>
