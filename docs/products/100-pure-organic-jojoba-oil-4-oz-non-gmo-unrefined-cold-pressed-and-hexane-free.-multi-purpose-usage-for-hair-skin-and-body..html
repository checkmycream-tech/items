            <li> I took this Jojoba Oil with me this past weekend while Girl Scout camping to test it while in the woods on my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It only has a very faint scent, which is preferable, and the company&#x27;s customer service/</li>
            <li> Usually, when I come back from the woods, I have terrible hang nails that are very painful...</li>
            <li> However, the smell is really bad just sayin&#x27;, it goes away after a bit</li>

            <li> Being a handmade soap maker, jojoba oil is one of the oils we love to use for the added luxury in our soaps. It adds a very nice rich moisturizing property and of course, you can just use it on your skin or hair.  I have bragged on this stuff enough that my daughter bought me another bottle on mothers day!  I really do love it.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba for face moisture.</li>
            <li> Great product and would recommend for health and Beauty regimen. Leaves skin soft as a moisturizer and like the jojoba oil as a make up remover too. You can use it for more health benefits too. I really like that this product is without the harsh chemicals and parabens that is in way too many products these days.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:76e3fc694c4b59b6422a503b580af542]]I am very happy with this product.  2 days ago I used some in my foaming face wash and  I loved the results!  I also use Jojoba oil as a carrier oil for my perfume oils.  I also made my caffeine infused eye cream and had wonderful results!!!  So many uses for one product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for homemade soap making, but there are so many other uses. Works great as a facial moisturizer and hair conditioner. I love this! I will be buying much more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this organic jojoba oil I purchased from the Amazing Botanical Store! It only has a very faint scent, which is preferable, and the company&#x27;s customer service/follow up is great. Thank you for offering this oil!&lt;br /&gt;￼￼￼</li>
            <li> Easy transaction, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil in my roller balls with essential oils. I  love that it isn&#x27;t too oily when you apply it to the skin.  Great oil without too much of a scent.</li>
            <li> After a recent surgery for a fractured wrist I decided to research using a natural and organic means to prevent infection and heal the incision. After reading about various oils, I chose Deluxe Botanicals&#x27; 100% pure, organic jojoba oil, and I am absolutely delighted with the results I am getting!  This is a high-quality oil that is light and well absorbing, and it has been extremely effective in reducing the tightness and itching I was experiencing after the stitches were removed.  I feel secure and confident using it knowing it is 100% pure jojoba and not blended with other oils, such as many of the Vitamin E oils I read about in my research, as well as it being organic. I also appreciate that the product comes in a dark bottle to better maintain its integrity and shelf-life.  This is an outstanding product made by a company that genuinely cares about excellence and quality, and I intend to use this product as a skin and hair moisturizer long after my incision has healed.</li>
            <li> good product, my uses it every day and said it was best she has used</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this product. My son has a dry scalp. I have been using this in his hair and around his cuticles, so much better. Must try this. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great for my dandruff! Can already see a difference, love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  Perfect for mixing with EO&#x27;s.  Perfect size.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil! It is light and does not have a strong smell and it absorbs fairly quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Seems okay.  I know next to nothing about jojoba oil, but it&#x27;s clear and has a slightly nutty scent.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning in preparation for my upcoming wedding. I have been using numerous different lotions to try to keep my skin hydrated. As soon as I used the Deluxe Botanicals Jojoba Oil I instantly noticed a different feel in the texture of my sun bathed skin. I will be recommending his product to my friends who spend a lot of time in the sun. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I took this Jojoba Oil with me this past weekend while Girl Scout camping to test it while in the woods on my cuticles.  It did a great job.  Usually, when I come back from the woods, I have terrible hang nails that are very painful...This product did the trick and I have none -- Thank you Deluxe Botanicals!  The product came on time and was well packaged, wrapped in bubble-wrap.  This bottle will last me a long time...  Very satisfied customer.  Will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Loved It! Will definitely be using it in my aromatherapy facial recipes.</li>
            <li> Great oil, very good quality. You can tell it&#x27;s &amp;#34;extra virgin oil,&amp;#34; and not the mass produced oil they use in hair salons.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have use Jojoba oil when mixing my essential oils for use. I like the feel of this oil on the skin. It has become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this jojoba.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller communication. I rubbed some on the back of my hand and arm and it make it feel soft but not greasy. I did not detect any off odors. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I never had jojoba oil before but I can tell this is as advertised. Organic and unrefined pure jojoba oil should have a very mild nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research before using and testing the oil. It seems that it is safe :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a light yellow and slightly oily. After applying a little dab on my hand and rub in a circular motion. The oil dries in less than a minute and it is extremely moisturizing without any irritation or scent. I&#x27;m not sure about using this oil in my hair because it would make my hair really oily looking but it is perfect for skin as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The Deluxe Jojoba Oil is a great oil for after my shower all over skin and nails.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film and is soaks in right away.&lt;br /&gt; It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.I like the way it smells and it is very siIky. I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have you ever used Jojoba oil ?  No, well now is the time to try.  Jojoba oil is a perfect carrier oil to use  w/ your essential oils.  Many uses for your body w/ jojoba oil. I used this brand and I love it .  Great quality and well respected.  Come on over and buy this oil today and mix it with your favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li> This was awesome and worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of a great jojoba oil and finally found one!</li>
            <li> GREAT stuff!  It has helped a skin problem already and I have only applied it a few times.  So happy that a friend had turned me on to the healing qualities of Jojoba.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product a five is because the bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full... Otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic on my skin and wonderful to mix with my Eos or use by itself. Great product</li>
            <li> My friend told me that she uses jojoba oil to remove her make up because it is gentle and it also moisturizes. I was glad to see that th Deluxe Botanical Jojoba Oil is organic and comes in a dark bottle to help protect the oil. I put some jojoba oil on a cottonball every evening to wipe off my makeup before a shower, I then put some drops in my hands and rub into my hair for a few minutes to condition it. After my shower I rub some more jojoba oil with a drop or two of lavender essential oil, on my face and body to help moisturize my skin overnight and to help me relax before sleep.  I received a sample of this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
