            <li>I wish I had more reasons to give people Ove Gloves - they make great housewarming gifts!  </li>
            <li>They are wonderful at keeping your hands cool and the fact that they are pliable is great....</li>
            <li>And my grip on the shovel was good, too.  </li>
            <li>They both cook a lot so the gloves must be good.</li>
            <li>The people who received them loved them so when the 2ct deal came to me</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first pair and it&#x27;s the best oven mitt I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want moisture to get on them or they aren&#x27;t as protective, but we love them!</li>
            <li>the glove fit great and keeps heat from burning your hand.</li>
            <li>My hands stayed warm even though the temperature was 7 degrees below zero.  </li>
            <li>When I take a warm dish to put into the frig...</li>
            <li>The first pair lasted for many, many years in perfect condition until my Lab got hold of them.</li>
            <li>I will probably find more uses for them.</li>
            <li>If the glove came in sizes it would be a lot better.</li>
            <li>Not too many people have even&lt;</li>
            <li>the item doesnt slip out of your hand, will not burn thru,  love love.</li>
            <li>My wife is well pleased with them</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using the Ove Glove.  </li>
            <li>Just love them .  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, and much better than oven mitts.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with my Ove Glove.  </li>
            <li>We must have received an authentic Ove Glove.</li>
            <li>The quality is great and they really work well.</li>
            <li>I quit my job just so I could be available to Amazon for reviews!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought a pair.</li>
            <li>needles to say I am using them every day and am totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the way they protect me from the heat.</li>
            <li>She was pleased with them as she cooks a lot</li>
            <li>They absolutely work as promised, great heat protection, and much better to grip with than oven mitts with no fingers.</li>
            <li>it&#x27; very large for the hands of most women!</li>
            <li>I use these to help me hold the pot securely and safely.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to get a good grip on eveything.</li>
            <li>But they are nice for the hot items.</li>
            <li>The glove worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it when removing stuff from the oven and make a huge difference over using anything else.</li>
            <li>My Girls enjoy the gloves they all enjoy cooking..</li>
            <li>I compared it to the genuine article.</li>
            <li>They really are handy and keep the heat off you.  </li>
            <li>the glove is NOT what we ordered just a cheap knot-off.................</li>
            <li>There are two gloves... and they will both fit either hand...</li>
            <li>I am 80 years young, but I need a good &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; grip when I take out things from my oven or micro.  </li>
            <li>nice glove, they fit good, better than I expected, you can handle hot items from your oven, for the price you cant beat it</li>
            <li>Man... do these gloves really work!!!  </li>
            <li>The Ove Glove works a lot better than a potholder and the one size fits both his large hand and my medium hand just fine.</li>
            <li>I received my ove glove in a timely manner and was so excited I turned my stove to 500 and put a pan in 20 min.</li>
            <li>I just know that she was excited to receive it since it was on her wish list.</li>
            <li>The original link showed no indication they were coming from China - ordered Dec. 7 and just arrived Jan. 2 - not even in time for gifts.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased the original singles from walgreen&#x27;s and gave them as gifts.</li>
            <li>the Ove Glove works great for heat but again, do not get it wet...</li>
            <li>thought I had done my homework to make sure this came from the real Ove Glove.  </li>
            <li>Everything which is listed on the box is true.  </li>
            <li>These ove gloves really make it very easy to remove the scalding hot basket.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of my new pair is just as good as the original pair.</li>
            <li>This works well to grab very hot items from the oven.</li>
            <li>Ok product great not sure if it is a real one or not</li>
            <li>The Ove Glove works great, but DO NOT GET IT WET!!!  </li>
            <li>you can take stuff right out of the oven or barbeque without a problem Would buy again</li>
            <li>You can grab items right out of the oven</li>
            <li>These are fabulous - lots of flexibility and they really work when handling hot pans.  </li>
            <li>They are very reasonable when it comes to price.  </li>
            <li>The first time we used the Ove Glove, we pulled a pizza out of our oven.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really hot.  </li>
            <li>I bought the ove gloves as a gift for my husband because they work so much better than regular oven mitts.  </li>
            <li>and so that I could remove hot dishes from the microwave easier.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for the barbecue, microwave, and oven and haven&#x27;t found anything yet that it too hot for it.  </li>
            <li>I can’t wait to give my 25 year review of the Hutzer banana slicer or Tuscan whole milk!</li>
            <li>We love them and would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>The gloves work exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>A great price, because, seriously, any real cook needs two of them.</li>
            <li>and I can slip my large hands into them.</li>
            <li>And, yes, you can wash these on a gentle cycle, just be sure to air dry.</li>
            <li>It started getting a little warm by the end, but no problem.  </li>
            <li>Original and Only &#x27;Ove&#x27; Glove Hot Surface Handler, made of Kevlar and Nomex by Dupont is only available at the retailers and online sites listed below.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>I think it must be a cheap chinese knockoff.</li>
            <li>Ovglove really works</li>
            <li>Not the real &#x27;Ove Glove.</li>
            <li>Lots of concerns about these being the real Ove Glove.</li>
            <li>I inspected these thoroughly and they are the real deal.</li>
            <li>I like them so much that I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts.</li>
            <li>My hands were warm in them while waiting to take items from oven, not from heat of oven, just my body heat, so I wondered it they would keep my hands warm in cold weather.  </li>
            <li>Although my hands are smaller than most, the ability to grip everything ( so far) has been a pleasure.</li>
            <li>Christmas time they got a total work out and these are by far my wife&#x27;s favorite pot holder.</li>
            <li>We were really excited to finally get a kitchen mitt that stood up to our cooking.  </li>
            <li>They stand up really well to high heat with out feeling it.</li>
            <li>thinking about buying one should read more reviews because I am clearly not right in the head</li>
            <li>For a long time I did hesitate to wash them in the laundry, but other than making them clean and fresh, there was no change in fit or protection</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>As I said when my mother received the glove in the mail, she did not open the box right away</li>
            <li>was wearing only one glove and it was on my right</li>
            <li>a person who cooks cannot live without this product, the gloves have rubber grips on them</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because if they get wet from a hot liquid the hot liquid will burn you</li>
            <li>We have the real OVE Gloves the above picture is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I love these, I have tons less burns on my hand (outer part by my thumb) but the fingertips can still get hot when you hold something too long!</li>
            <li>These are a little large on her but not bad</li>
            <li>No more shuffling items in the oven just to get a better angle for removal.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my knuckles as with a regular hot pad.  </li>
            <li>The only glove you need for handling hot any thing in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable using those included thick rubber gloves that came with the Showtime Rotisserie maker because they smelled funny.  </li>
            <li>Sized large enough for men or women to use.</li>
            <li>Have used them several times and hey have been very helpful.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and cannot find them anymore in the stores near me</li>
            <li>Unable to hold on to a dish, right out of the oven, for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>My wife has small hands and fingers, so it is easy for her to get them on.</li>
            <li>That takes about 30 seconds or so, all the while, my hand in the glove holding the hot pan tilting down.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li>Each already had one Ove Glove, but wanted a second to use on the other hand rather than one glove and a hot pot holder.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a long review I just wanted to announce to the world what a bone head I am.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is won&#x27;t stop steam and if you get them full of steam</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it&#x27;s really hot.  </li>
            <li> I bought the ove gloves as a gift for my husband because they work so much better than regular oven mitts.  </li>
            <li> and so that I could remove hot dishes from the microwave easier.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for the barbecue, microwave, and oven and haven&#x27;t found anything yet that it too hot for it.  </li>
            <li> I can’t wait to give my 25 year review of the Hutzer banana slicer or Tuscan whole milk!</li>
            <li> We love them and would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> The gloves work exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> A great price, because, seriously, any real cook needs two of them.</li>
            <li> and I can slip my large hands into them.</li>
            <li> And, yes, you can wash these on a gentle cycle, just be sure to air dry.</li>
            <li> It started getting a little warm by the end, but no problem.  </li>
            <li> Original and Only &#x27;Ove&#x27; Glove Hot Surface Handler, made of Kevlar and Nomex by Dupont is only available at the retailers and online sites listed below.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I think it must be a cheap chinese knockoff.</li>
            <li> Ovglove really works</li>
            <li> Not the real &#x27;Ove Glove.</li>
            <li> Lots of concerns about these being the real Ove Glove.</li>
            <li> I inspected these thoroughly and they are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I like them so much that I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts.</li>
            <li> My hands were warm in them while waiting to take items from oven, not from heat of oven, just my body heat, so I wondered it they would keep my hands warm in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> Although my hands are smaller than most, the ability to grip everything ( so far) has been a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Christmas time they got a total work out and these are by far my wife&#x27;s favorite pot holder.</li>
            <li> We were really excited to finally get a kitchen mitt that stood up to our cooking.  </li>
            <li> They stand up really well to high heat with out feeling it.</li>
            <li> thinking about buying one should read more reviews because I am clearly not right in the head</li>
            <li> For a long time I did hesitate to wash them in the laundry, but other than making them clean and fresh, there was no change in fit or protection</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a few years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> As I said when my mother received the glove in the mail, she did not open the box right away</li>
            <li> was wearing only one glove and it was on my right</li>
            <li> a person who cooks cannot live without this product, the gloves have rubber grips on them</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because if they get wet from a hot liquid the hot liquid will burn you</li>
            <li> We have the real OVE Gloves the above picture is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I love these, I have tons less burns on my hand (outer part by my thumb) but the fingertips can still get hot when you hold something too long!</li>
            <li> These are a little large on her but not bad</li>
            <li> No more shuffling items in the oven just to get a better angle for removal.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my knuckles as with a regular hot pad.  </li>
            <li> The only glove you need for handling hot any thing in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable using those included thick rubber gloves that came with the Showtime Rotisserie maker because they smelled funny.  </li>
            <li> Sized large enough for men or women to use.</li>
            <li> Have used them several times and hey have been very helpful.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and cannot find them anymore in the stores near me</li>
            <li> Unable to hold on to a dish, right out of the oven, for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> My wife has small hands and fingers, so it is easy for her to get them on.</li>
            <li> That takes about 30 seconds or so, all the while, my hand in the glove holding the hot pan tilting down.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li> Each already had one Ove Glove, but wanted a second to use on the other hand rather than one glove and a hot pot holder.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a long review I just wanted to announce to the world what a bone head I am.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is won&#x27;t stop steam and if you get them full of steam</li>
            <li> These gloves might be a bit large for very small hands, but work well for those who wear medium size gloves or larger.</li>
            <li> Also great for cold weather , keeps hot and cold away from your hands.</li>
            <li> I used my 12-inch cast iron pan in a hot (450 degree) oven, cooking a whole chicken for 35 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritis and for a long time pot holders have not worked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get them.  </li>
            <li> This set does not come in a box and is not padded and thick like the real OVE Gloves.  </li>
            <li> there is absolutely no protection from your hands if the Ove Glove gets wet.  </li>
            <li> Be careful draining pasta.  </li>
            <li> I bought them as a Christmas present for my wife and have used them myself a few times helping in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> As others noted, when they are wet they don&#x27;t protect well.</li>
            <li> One given as a gag gift a few years back!</li>
            <li> I have small hands and the only problem is that It is a little big.  </li>
            <li> Gloves sold on Amazon.com and other sites may be infringing product and may not contain Kevlar and Nomex by Dupont.</li>
            <li> Bought a two pack for my husband at Christmas because his other ones wore out.</li>
            <li> They are soooo large, and I find grabbing things difficult when I have them on.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money bought it because I burned myself on the wood burning stove</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other oven mitt again!</li>
            <li> A little easier to use than an oven mitt.</li>
            <li> But little by little, I started to use it.  </li>
            <li> I bought them a few years ago</li>
            <li> my hand hold had to be firm, and that was when the pan was its hottest.  </li>
            <li> I got the gloves for my boyfriend but they are way too small and tight for him to use.</li>
            <li> A bit less clumsy than the oven mitts or the silicon mitts.  </li>
            <li> My wife has small hands so the &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; usually doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to post on this since it was purchased for our daughter.</li>
            <li> To do that, I had the glove on my left hand, opened the oven, grabbed the handle of the pan, pulled it halfway out and down, so the pan juiced collected, then spooned the juices over the chicken, two times for the breast, once each for the legs.  </li>
            <li> I have a bigger hand and it is very tough to get into them.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> Having separate fingers and not too thick</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that this is advertised as the real deal when it is not!</li>
            <li> Halfway through that time, I started basting the chicken.  </li>
            <li> the cooking time was up, I took the pan with the chicken out of the oven.  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED that AMAZON allows FAKE things to be so late for CHRISTMAS!</li>
            <li> Crap</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great.  We use them to grill outdoors and to bake and cook in the oven.  I have given them as gifts to neighbors and family.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. These work so well. Having separate fingers and not too thick it&#x27;s much easier to get a good grip on eveything. They stand up really well to high heat with out feeling it.</li>
            <li> We were really excited to finally get a kitchen mitt that stood up to our cooking.  The first time we used the Ove Glove, we pulled a pizza out of our oven.  The Ove Glove works great, but DO NOT GET IT WET!!!  The cheese from the pizza burned my thumb...the Ove Glove works great for heat but again, do not get it wet...there is absolutely no protection from your hands if the Ove Glove gets wet.  It feels like no protection whatsoever.  Otherwise, we are happy with it.</li>
            <li> How can Amazon sell a product that is known to be defective, and an infringement on a US patent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had done my homework to make sure this came from the real Ove Glove.  Having reviewed another customers video review (thank you!), I see that mine are probably counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comment below is from the Ove Glove website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: Beware of counterfeit products! Do not get BURNED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Original and Only &#x27;Ove&#x27; Glove Hot Surface Handler, made of Kevlar and Nomex by Dupont is only available at the retailers and online sites listed below. (see their website for locations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ove Gloves sold on Amazon.com and other sites may be infringing product and may not contain Kevlar and Nomex by Dupont. Even if the online websites look like the same item and advertise the item as coming from Joseph Enterprises, it could be an infringing product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! you can take stuff right out of the oven or barbeque without a problem Would buy again</li>
            <li> awesome five stars all the way</li>
            <li> nice glove, they fit good, better than I expected, you can handle hot items from your oven, for the price you cant beat it</li>
            <li> Product was all it claimed to be.  Have used them several times and hey have been very helpful.  My hands were warm in them while waiting to take items from oven, not from heat of oven, just my body heat, so I wondered it they would keep my hands warm in cold weather.  After our next snowfall, when I was shoveling snow off the sidewalk, I tried them out.  My hands stayed warm even though the temperature was 7 degrees below zero.  And my grip on the shovel was good, too.  I would recommend these gloves to anyone.  I will probably find more uses for them.</li>
            <li> This works well to grab very hot items from the oven. If the glove came in sizes it would be a lot better. My wife has small hands and fingers, so it is easy for her to get them on. I have a bigger hand and it is very tough to get into them. But they are nice for the hot items.</li>
            <li> I have several of these.  Only complaint is won&#x27;t stop steam and if you get them full of steam it&#x27;s really hot.  Be careful draining pasta.  Other than that they are great</li>
            <li> I got 2 each for my 3 daughters and my hubby who does the cooking at our house!  They all loved them!!</li>
            <li> Bought a two pack for my husband at Christmas because his other ones wore out. He loves these things and won&#x27;t barbecue without them.</li>
            <li> Excellent pot holders.  Not too many people have even&lt;br /&gt;heard of the ove glove....I bought them a few years ago&lt;br /&gt;and cannot find them anymore in the stores near me&lt;br /&gt;so I bought them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Provides good heat protection!  Only problem I have, it&#x27; very large for the hands of most women! Well-made product, though.</li>
            <li> great product. a person who cooks cannot live without this product, the gloves have rubber grips on them&lt;br /&gt;so the item doesnt slip out of your hand, will not burn thru,  love love. recommend,</li>
            <li> Non-slip grip -- an even better addition to the excellent Ove Gloves!</li>
            <li> Great for grill or oven, but don&#x27;t use them when you need protection from steam.  Sized large enough for men or women to use.</li>
            <li> As I said when my mother received the glove in the mail, she did not open the box right away and when she did there was on,y one glove, not two as advertised.  I just found this out as it is supposed to be a Christmas gift for my brother and now he will only get one.  Can you help me with this?</li>
            <li> Although my hands are smaller than most, the ability to grip everything ( so far) has been a pleasure. No more shuffling items in the oven just to get a better angle for removal.&lt;br /&gt;Love them.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a Christmas present for my wife and have used them myself a few times helping in the kitchen. My wife is well pleased with them and so am I.</li>
            <li> My Girls enjoy the gloves they all enjoy cooking.. I have used the Ove Gove before through the years...AnnMarie Flynn</li>
            <li> I bought the ove gloves as a gift for my husband because they work so much better than regular oven mitts.  The reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because if they get wet from a hot liquid the hot liquid will burn you</li>
            <li> Best thing ever created. I have arthritis and for a long time pot holders have not worked. These are marvelous.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using the Ove Glove.  A little easier to use than an oven mitt. And I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my knuckles as with a regular hot pad.  Love it!</li>
            <li> We use these gloves to prevent burns when tending to the fireplace.  Also great for cold weather , keeps hot and cold away from your hands.</li>
            <li> I have had these for ever!  Just love them .  My daughter is always burning herself soooo made sense; what a great Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t be with out them</li>
            <li> Not worth the money bought it because I burned myself on the wood burning stove one night they actually went on fire</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Ove Gloves so that my husband would stop burning his hands when starting the charcoal grill and so that I could remove hot dishes from the microwave easier.  The Ove Glove works a lot better than a potholder and the one size fits both his large hand and my medium hand just fine.</li>
            <li> These gloves are awesome!  I don&#x27;t feel any heat through them when taking pans out of the oven! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works well, it does come from CHINA which I was un-aware of.  I think it must be a cheap chinese knockoff.</li>
            <li> The only glove you need for handling hot any thing in the kitchen.  Works as advertised, and much better than oven mitts.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with my Ove Glove.  I have used it for the barbecue, microwave, and oven and haven&#x27;t found anything yet that it too hot for it.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Boy the reviews are all over the map on these. We must have received an authentic Ove Glove. The quality is great and they really work well. Christmas time they got a total work out and these are by far my wife&#x27;s favorite pot holder. My wife has small hands so the &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; usually doesn&#x27;t work. These are a little large on her but not bad and I can slip my large hands into them. There&#x27;s enough flex to make them work for both of us. Pulling a dish out of the oven at 375 you can probably hold it 45 seconds before the heat starts to creep through. I tried it with our best pot holder and couldn&#x27;t get over 30 seconds before saying &amp;#34;Oh Crap this is Hot&amp;#34;. We&#x27;re buying another pair for camping trips!</li>
            <li> I ordered two gloves as presents to 2 relatives.  Each already had one Ove Glove, but wanted a second to use on the other hand rather than one glove and a hot pot holder.  They both cook a lot so the gloves must be good.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful at keeping your hands cool and the fact that they are pliable is great....only draw back is they should come in a smaller version for ladies hands</li>
            <li> This review is to placate the mountain of persistent e-mails that woefully fill my inbox. Amazon is so concerned with my satisfaction, they now ask for reviews of your purchase every 72 hours. I can’t wait to give my 25 year review of the Hutzer banana slicer or Tuscan whole milk! I quit my job just so I could be available to Amazon for reviews! With the help of Amazon, it is now my duty to nit pick or wax poetically every item I buy no matter how private or potentially embarrassing it could be! (Viagra) I will lead the unwashed masses to Amazon with my reviews!</li>
            <li> Unable to hold on to a dish, right out of the oven, for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I compared it to the genuine article. I doubt they&#x27;re made of nomex - I&#x27;m thinking they&#x27;re cotton with a possibly toxic flame retardant coating.</li>
            <li> These oven gloves are great.  They really are handy and keep the heat off you.  We love them and would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Seem to work great!  A bit less clumsy than the oven mitts or the silicon mitts.  I would suggest them for people who tend to burn themselves allot!  Haven&#x27;t had to wash yet and there were no washing instructions that I could find.  Guess that is my only criticism.</li>
            <li> Ok product great not sure if it is a real one or not but it does work like I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a long review I just wanted to announce to the world what a bone head I am. I received my ove glove in a timely manner and was so excited I turned my stove to 500 and put a pan in 20 min. later I put the glove on remove the pan placing on the stovetop I was so impressed and realizing the handle was hanging off the stove in an unsafe manner I moved the handle around with my left hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing only one glove and it was on my right hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone thinking about buying one should read more reviews because I am clearly not right in the head</li>
            <li> I have petite hand and these gloves are only slightly bigger. I got the gloves for my boyfriend but they are way too small and tight for him to use.</li>
            <li> We tried another brand but they did not work. Ovglove really works</li>
            <li> Knock Off Product From China. Not the real &#x27;Ove Glove. I purchased this item for my aunt for Christmas and ended up having to buy her something else. Very disappointed that this is advertised as the real deal when it is not! Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> great gift for people who love to cook</li>
            <li> Came as described and in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Ove Glove.  This is my first pair and it&#x27;s the best oven mitt I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I love these, I have tons less burns on my hand (outer part by my thumb) but the fingertips can still get hot when you hold something too long!</li>
            <li> Great gloves! Don&#x27;t want moisture to get on them or they aren&#x27;t as protective, but we love them!</li>
            <li> Not sure how to post on this since it was purchased for our daughter. I just know that she was excited to receive it since it was on her wish list.</li>
            <li> We have the real OVE Gloves the above picture is the real deal.  This set does not come in a box and is not padded and thick like the real OVE Gloves.  We also wanted to use them for gifts.  The original link showed no indication they were coming from China - ordered Dec. 7 and just arrived Jan. 2 - not even in time for gifts.  VERY DISAPPOINTED that AMAZON allows FAKE things to be so late for CHRISTMAS!</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift.  I have had mine for a few years now and love it.  Feel very confident in my safety.</li>
            <li> the glove fit great and keeps heat from burning your hand. the grip is also real good. I would reccomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on TV and thought about how we could avoid be burned by the oven or when camping.  The gloves are amazing!  Everything which is listed on the box is true.  You can grab items right out of the oven and you don&#x27;t get burned.  They are very reasonable when it comes to price.  We purchased 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Lots of concerns about these being the real Ove Glove. I inspected these thoroughly and they are the real deal. A great price, because, seriously, any real cook needs two of them. As others noted, when they are wet they don&#x27;t protect well. And, yes, you can wash these on a gentle cycle, just be sure to air dry.</li>
            <li> My son in law will help with the cooking if he has one of these gloves.  LOL  I ordered two thinking of sending him both for Christmas, however I ended up keeping one for myself.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I use these to take out the basket and skewers of my Showtime Rotisserie maker.  I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable using those included thick rubber gloves that came with the Showtime Rotisserie maker because they smelled funny.  These ove gloves really make it very easy to remove the scalding hot basket.</li>
            <li> Checked the reviews on here before we order...........must be the joined the rest of the rip-offs selling these gloves the box was just in there the glove is NOT what we ordered just a cheap knot-off.................I&#x27;ll never order from them again...... if I could give them a 0 star I would...... Chris&#x27;s Home  is selling a FAKES !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these the same time I got my overn rack covers.  I am 80 years young, but I need a good &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; grip when I take out things from my oven or micro.  Man... do these gloves really work!!!  The grip is GREAT... the protection from heat or burns is also great.  When I take a warm dish to put into the frig... I use these to help me hold the pot securely and safely.  Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get them.  There are two gloves... and they will both fit either hand... as the front and back are manufactured alike with the blue strips and the protective material.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law told me about these and I am so glad I bought a pair. I&#x27;ll never use any other oven mitt again!</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with these. They are soooo large, and I find grabbing things difficult when I have them on.</li>
            <li> I got this Ove glove, watched the video, and saw that it was a counterfeit glove,\.  So I was reluctant to use it.  But little by little, I started to use it.  Last night was the big test.  I used my 12-inch cast iron pan in a hot (450 degree) oven, cooking a whole chicken for 35 minutes.  Halfway through that time, I started basting the chicken.  To do that, I had the glove on my left hand, opened the oven, grabbed the handle of the pan, pulled it halfway out and down, so the pan juiced collected, then spooned the juices over the chicken, two times for the breast, once each for the legs.  That takes about 30 seconds or so, all the while, my hand in the glove holding the hot pan tilting down.  The glove worked fine.  It started getting a little warm by the end, but no problem.  No problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the cooking time was up, I took the pan with the chicken out of the oven.  I only had the one glove on my left hand, so my hand hold had to be firm, and that was when the pan was its hottest.  Again, the glove worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a counterfeit glove; I don&#x27;t know.  But it works great.</li>
            <li> One given as a gag gift a few years back! Can&#x27;t live without it now. A must have in my kitchen!</li>
            <li> Great product for any cook.. Don&#x27;t forget to order two for both hands. You&#x27;ll never regret it. Prevent burns on hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of Ove Gloves. The first pair lasted for many, many years in perfect condition until my Lab got hold of them. I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of my new pair is just as good as the original pair. They are a bit more expensive than other brands, but well worth the difference in price. For a long time I did hesitate to wash them in the laundry, but other than making them clean and fresh, there was no change in fit or protection</li>
            <li> I had purchased the original singles from walgreen&#x27;s and gave them as gifts. The people who received them loved them so when the 2ct deal came to me I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. needles to say I am using them every day and am totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have two - one for each hand.  These are fabulous - lots of flexibility and they really work when handling hot pans.  I like them so much that I&#x27;ve bought them as gifts.</li>
            <li> This is really great.  I have small hands and the only problem is that It is a little big.  Wish they had sizes.</li>
            <li> Gloves are great!!! I use them all the time and I&#x27;m pleased with the way they protect me from the heat.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more reasons to give people Ove Gloves - they make great housewarming gifts!  Everyone needs one - whether you just defrost frozen pizza in the oven, or rival Emeril in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> This was a request from our daughter as one of her Christmas gifts. She was pleased with them as she cooks a lot</li>
            <li> The gloves work exactly as described.  I haven&#x27;t washed them yet so I can&#x27;t speak to how well they&#x27;ll hold up or continue to withstand heat afterwards.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> These gloves might be a bit large for very small hands, but work well for those who wear medium size gloves or larger. They absolutely work as promised, great heat protection, and much better to grip with than oven mitts with no fingers. They are the same quality as those that restaurants use to protect cooks and chefs from burns. They fit either hand and two is perfect to protect both hands!</li>
            <li> I really like these gloves, they are heavy duty and work just like advertised. I use it when removing stuff from the oven and make a huge difference over using anything else. My wife keeps getting burn because she doesn&#x27;t like using the gloves but I do, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t get burn. With that in mind, get yourself a pair of these gloves.</li>
