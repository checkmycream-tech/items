            <li>/&gt;There is no scent at all, that may be a good thing to some people, but I like some scent to my facial products.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to really expect.</li>
            <li>I am a big believer in writing reviews after you have given products a good chance.</li>
            <li>love this has really helped even my skin tone</li>
            <li>It works very well with my moisturizer in the morning and my BB cream on top of it.</li>
            <li>I am currently using it and it makes my face feel good after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural AND incredibly effective.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the fact that it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>Definitely need a good moisturizer to go with it.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this is a good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong too.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had enough time to see how good the result can be, but for the moment i was using, the serum was light and absorb very fast.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>My face and neck felt fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My lines are already less noticeable, but the best thing about the serum is, again, how it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>,it fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Only thing i wish is that it had a scent and wasn&#x27;t so runny, but besides that i am glad i was able to try this product</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, works well in combination with my moisturizer</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to do a quick thought on this product</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought several Serum last times and this one is best among the others.</li>
            <li>It dries absorbs fairly quickly before I move onto my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Yumi Beautiful Vitamin C Serum will brighten, firm, and hydrate your skin while boosting collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super dry and some products make my skin even drier but this one didn’t which is a good point of it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are fantastic, the lack of fragrances and dyes make this a great option for sensitive skin, and the consistency feels refreshing and hydrating rather than heavy and oily.</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it absorbs and how soft my skin feels after using it!  </li>
            <li>Finally though, I&#x27;ve found a super fast absorbing serum and that is Yumi Beautiful&#x27;s Signature Antioxidant Skin Care Serum.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and soaks up fast.</li>
            <li>This product has changed my skin so much!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>So I tried it over night on my hand first and OMG!</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great item, just haven&#x27;t used in long enough yo notice a difference</li>
            <li>skin does look more hydrated and doesn&#x27;t have as many dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced product helps reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li>using this over time will really make a difference in the eye wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>After a short time of use, I cannot speak on whether or not the anti-aging claims of this product are true, however I can confidently say that if you have acne-issues and avoid vitamin C products due to the risk of breakouts, this might be a great product for you to try.</li>
            <li>The serum is not too heavy which I appreciate greatly and does not look greasy or oily after it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>- the skin feels much firmer and smooth.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth to try.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am using this product on my hands and I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it is making me yumi beautiful yet</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>

            <li>Great product so far, but haven&#x27;t been using it long.</li>
            <li>I have the oily T-zone and very large pores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too oily and suitable for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again next time.</li>
            <li>It fits a good niche as a facial gel and in combination with  some of your other favorite products it is a desirable add on.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Good product with all the necessary natural ingredients to make the skin aging gracefully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use this twice, but so far, so good.  </li>

            <li>The shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li>If this serum could be thicker, it would be so very much easier to use.</li>
            <li>I like how this makes my skin feel smooth all day long, and the fine lines seem to disappear</li>
            <li>packaging and bottle looks really pretty.</li>
            <li>but I wanted my skin to get used to the serum first before I start applying it twice a day.</li>

            <li>This is first time I use this product.</li>
            <li>First impression, it&#x27;s a bit sticky</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I reapplied more and still got the same results.  </li>
            <li>, it is so light and absorbs completely without oily residue.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m 33 and I have started using serums and so far I have been acne free</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>IT PUMPS OUT WAY TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>

            <li>I love how this product doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and actually absorbs well into my skin and dries to make my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another in case the first one run out.</li>
            <li>it is so soft and smooth and seems to even be smoothing out wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum!</li>
            <li>, I loved how hydrated my face started to feel after a few times using it.</li>
            <li>Just started using few days ago..feels good.</li>
            <li>Loved the way it made my skin feel firm</li>
            <li>Instantly my hand was so much more smoother then the other, but still wanted to test it through the night to see if I&#x27;d get a reaction of any kind and to my surprise</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews that it gives an amazing result</li>
            <li>I have just recently started using this product, but I am excited over the results I have already seen!</li>
            <li>is a serum and what will it do for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Serums are basically targeted treatments with highly concentrated ingredients designed to be quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had special improvement after use.</li>
            <li>nothing special so far.  </li>
            <li>It quickly removed the dark saggy bags under my eyes and replaced it with youthful healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free Regardless, I only recommend products or services</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a great facial product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really get the exact amount I want out.</li>
            <li>Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy moisturizer, but the serum is full of antioxidants.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product twice a day for a whole week, and I can confidently say that this product really is improving my skin and adding all the extra nourishment I needed.</li>
            <li>I feel I can see a more vibrant and younger skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin) ...</li>
            <li>and i do not have those dry spots any more.</li>
            <li>Its easy on my occasionally troublesome skin.</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>This run out pretty fast, i cant really tell if i see results</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>so I am very particular with the products I use.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a difference in my skin, but so far it has been a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on my face.</li>
            <li>I use it 3-5 times per week and within 2 weeks, there is a visible improvement in fine lines and overall tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>as I thought it would be and also was a little drying to my skin and kind of like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>In just a few uses, my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth soaks in fast the only thing to me</li>
            <li>like that this serum comes in a pump instead of a dropper bottle, it&#x27;s very user</li>
            <li>the skin feels so much smoother and tighter</li>
            <li>i try  really  </li>
            <li>Very helpful serum.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on the skin and works wonders at smoothing out wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite using it at night, and washing my face in the morning, I have noticed a fast improvement in that area.</li>
            <li>and I really the serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Light enough</li>
            <li>I no longer have to wear so much makeup to try to cover up the unevenness of my skin.</li>
            <li>reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Yumi Vitamin C serum is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have noticed, however, it seems to sit on the surface of my skin and not soak in very well.</li>
            <li>But every time I pump, no matter how gently I do it, it gives me way too much of the serum.</li>
            <li>My wife is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thanks</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>What really drew my attention is that it&#x27;s made with organic extracts.</li>
            <li>Another thing that bothered me was that when I ordered this product (at a very steep discount, might I add)</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product</li>
            <li>I really like this Serum.  </li>
            <li>This feels so light and absorbs into my skin instantly.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it for now.</li>
            <li>I expected it to work a lot better</li>
            <li>It is sticky and stings the skin a bit when you put it on and it has not seemed to make any real difference to my skins appearance.</li>
            <li>so I was very suprise.</li>
            <li>and I am really liking the product.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very nourishing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about these products</li>
            <li>and once you&#x27;ve pressed it, too much product squirts out</li>
            <li>I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
            <li>Very good~&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>you so much~</li>
            <li>I love it how it makes my skin so  soft definitely will purchase it again</li>
            <li>I like the fact you only need one pump of the product to cover the entire face, and it has a nice consistency that absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and hope to continue using it for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Vitamin C serums over $75 and this one works just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>I really liked the inclusion of Aloe Vera and all of the other natural extracts.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definite worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting this on for the past month now and love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this and the other Yumi products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>, she wants to try other products now! :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to see the benefits of Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling a little tight after it dries, but it is great for right before bed.</li>
            <li>First of all it is a clear gel like serum.</li>
            <li>Also, their customer service is pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;[I&#x27;m 48, acne prone olive complexion, T-zone as far as oiliness with some discolorations from blemishes and melasma -</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a serum of any type on my face and so far I feel it&#x27;s hydrating, and leaves my skin glowing.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a visible difference in my skin  - my dark spots are fading somewhat and my skin looks more radiant to me.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I could sometimes get a little bit more, instead of a whole squirt.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick this serum absorbed the first time I used it - it took less than a minute!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who just wants to try out a new organic serum.</li>
            <li>I do apply a moisturizing cream in addition to the serum in the evening as I live in the northeast and the winter is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>The consistancy of the serum is light and unscented; it absorbs quicky, but I do let it dry before I continue with my moisturizers...  </li>
            <li>Main ingredients are Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic acid, organic botanicals and superfruit extracts.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more all-in-one product but will definitely use this in conjunction with me regular moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li>Like others, I am not crazy about the pump bottle, it seems like I either get too much or not enough.  </li>
            <li>This item definitely looks like something you would get in a high-end department store, so I love knowing that it&#x27;s offered here for only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>My aunt has used it for about a week now and says that her face feels tighter, which is her main concern.</li>
            <li>Good but not great to much alcohol in product</li>
            <li>One pump is more than enough to cover entire face.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the pump isn&#x27;t as smooth to press down</li>
            <li>The skin on the top area of my cheeks has always felt rough, most moisturizers have improved it for a small period of time but the softness they provide has always faded as the day passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Serum to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Although I do not have major wrinkles, I&#x27;m starting to have fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little drying for me and more watery than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Made my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always very iffy on trying new things on my skin because I have VERY Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Only thing i din&#x27;t like really is that It is a very watery serum its very runny and odorless.</li>
            <li>It is a really great product, I cannot stop raving about this product, you will not be sorry for buying this.</li>
            <li>I have never tried aloe on my skin before and so far I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>I really like the natural botanical ingredients  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Will update after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer in Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid and love the combination in this Yumi serum...  </li>
            <li>I wait a few minutes after applying this serum, and put my moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love the way my face feels just after a few days of using this product.</li>
            <li>I like to wear this under my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I will update after a few more days of use.</li>
            <li>I will try it a few more times</li>
            <li>I have been using Yumi for a few weeks now and believe that my skin is more hydrated as a result.</li>
            <li>Skin feels firm and smooth after application!</li>
            <li>My skin looks radiant and not dull.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first, because it seemed to firm my skin up, but then it became overly dry.</li>
            <li>It is not thin, so be careful how you use it to not use it all quickly.</li>
            <li>Weird consistency kind of liquidy but dries quickly and does help with moisturizing</li>
            <li>and i had new bumps and my face was redder than normal.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it my skin would become very smooth shortly after application.</li>
            <li>I have used other Vitamin C Serums in the past, but wasn&#x27;t as happy as I am with this product.</li>
            <li>so far I am please with the vitamin C product, I have been using it for a few weeks and my skin feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I love that it leaves my skin feeling slightly refreshed and not tight or greasy.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid, this is the ingredient in other skin cream that will make our skin plump and smooth again.  </li>
            <li>My skin feel smooth and not irritate like some other brand Vitamin C serum might do .</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s moisturizing, light and</li>
            <li>The product was slightly stickier  than I liked, took a little more rubbing/dryibut other than that I really like it.  </li>
            <li>(I always am with new products-</li>
            <li>I purchased the products after reading the reviews and it seems to live up to the others reviews.</li>
            <li>It will actively combat the signs of aging by fighting free radical damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t irritate it and within a few uses it was extremely amazing how different my skin felt!</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and silky and its rare when the roughness of my skin come back.</li>
            <li>I started to apply it on my super dry skin 3 weeks ago at nights after removing my make up.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin really soft, so much so that I had my husband feel how soft it felt.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to fit in your current beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product and I&#x27;ve only had this item a few days, but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>irritated my face, but I am very sensitive</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li>This product makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>The design is appealing and the size is reasonable  although I wish it was bigger as I have been using it every day  and would like it to last for a long time...  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my skin, but some fading of dark spots.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face feel so soft!</li>
            <li>When I wake up my skin feels soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this product again also highly recommend to everyone!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for the last two weeks.</li>
            <li>I have paid double even triple for top skin care products  and never had such definite results like this.  </li>
            <li>makes skin really soft!</li>
            <li>This totally resurfaced my face - and gently!</li>
            <li>This is YUMMY stuff for my 50 year old face!</li>
            <li>Plus the natural ingredients - can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>The first one is ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum.</li>
            <li>felt nice and tight when first applied but didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>Light and didn&#x27;t weight my face down</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better serum to use not only after being sick but after washing my face this morning, surprisingly it had no smell</li>
            <li>Very light and fresh,  not too heavy,  one pump is enough for the whole face, tried it only for a couple weeks, morning and night,  no big difference as of yet, but no acne breakout from the formula which is a plus on my oily skin!  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>It has a faint but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with product in my hand and it won&#x27;t last as long using  more than I need.    </li>
            <li>Its a good product, however I broke out not sure if it was due to this.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs pretty quickly and just a little drop of it covers a pretty big area so it will definitely last a while.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard for me to give a good review because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have previously tired another Yumi product, Asteria and had amazing results.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how my skin looks clear and has a glow...</li>
            <li>Consistency is clear and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe: A natural skin moisturizer and anti-inflammatory agent, Aloe will hydrate and soothe your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes my face feel so soft .</li>
            <li>really look at me now and say no way , not possible !</li>
            <li>Thanks will continue to use your products in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li>I never thought my skin could be so soft again, reminds me on when I was a child.</li>
            <li>I was worried because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and so far there&#x27;s been no irritation or issues with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it helps with wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a softer feel to my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin looked refreshed and feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin yet, but it is too early to see that maybe</li>
            <li>I found that the formula works very well, I will be a repeating customer once I start to get low.</li>
            <li>My skin feel soft after I&#x27;ve used it for a week.</li>
            <li>I feel my face soft</li>
            <li>I used it on my 96 year old mother</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to chime in early because I do notice improvement in the brightness/tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>It is soft and not trouble</li>
            <li>My skin does feel soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m too young to say anything on anti-aging since I don&#x27;t have any wrinkle...</li>
            <li>it makes your face feel so soft and it does not irritate your skin</li>
            <li>and i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out so far.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product with natural ingredients and Yumi Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>It tones and improves the appearance of my skin while moisturizing and keeping it soft.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooths.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and refreshed after applying this serum.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky and it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>My face was too sensitive</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not really feeling about it is it&#x27;s pretty sticky at first</li>
            <li>im 38 years old</li>
            <li>There was no trouble since I using one month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for an anti-aging serum that had plenty of natural ingredients in it and that would re-texture the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and found I could not use this in the morning AND evening as the package instructed.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer and brighter, and so soft.</li>
            <li>it soaks into your skin &amp; makes it soft &amp; glowing plus wearing makeup over it</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say I don&#x27;t like about this is the pump style it squirts out to much product</li>
            <li>My face is soooo soft and my skin seems to glow after I apply.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any peeling but when I washed my face I was able to &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; the dead skin off, revealing younger skin underneath.</li>
            <li>But really, the distinguishing factor that sets it apart from other serums is its fast absorption rate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it at night so far to slowly introduce my face to new product and my face has looked very smooth and refreshed in the mornig.</li>
            <li>Again, It is very convenient if you are traveling, you can put it right in your purse and no need to carry other facial products with you.</li>
            <li>I love it so far and its only been a few days!</li>
            <li>The only downside for me is that the serum is very watery and if you are not careful it will drip off your fingers as you are trying to apply it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better my skin looked after only a few days!</li>
            <li>I use two small pumps on my fingertips and apply after/on top of my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s only main thing I wasn&#x27;t fond of.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and I&#x27;ve noticed my dark spots and uneven skin tone  areas on my face, quickly fading.  </li>
            <li>I am totally enjoying my Yumi Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid and 14 Organic Extracts, I especially like adding a little spritz to my hair for extra shine and manageability.</li>
            <li>I suffered from dry patchy skin, and adult acne and this product has help so much with the improvement of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and gives skin a tight, toned feeling.</li>
            <li>It long after you put it on you can feel a real difference.  </li>
            <li>Not fair to say more until I try longer.</li>
            <li>I made my skin looks smooth and help my pore small.</li>
            <li>I have acne scars, so I can&#x27;t wait to see if it will really help with those after long term use.    </li>
            <li>first thing that I noticed about this product i didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I expected.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with very soft skin even during these winter temperatures where my skin normally becomes dry.</li>
            <li>but I also like the idea that I can actually read the ingredients in this product now if only they will offer a cleaner thanks for the product</li>
            <li>Just use a few days, can&#x27;t really tell the really changes on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week, once at night because I have sensitive skin - but so far I haven&#x27;t had any reactions.</li>
            <li>I have used this item and haven&#x27;t realy seen any major changes.  </li>
            <li>I only used it for a few days but so far I have no bad reaction yet,</li>
            <li>So if I had to say what could be improved, not much besides  it is a bit thin and more of a clear gel than very botanical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not sticky, plus a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little sticky at first, but as soon as it drys your skin feels power soft.</li>
            <li>The condition of my skin has definitely improved, my skin looks firmer and has got the natural glow to it.</li>
            <li>I barely have one week using it</li>
            <li>It actually helped my &amp;#34;tired mom eyes&amp;#34; even though I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and wrinkles aren&#x27;t a concern yet.</li>
            <li>I only use natural products, and sometimes the efficacy isn&#x27;t what you would hope for.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a couple days and so far it seems to help.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin so soft for the entire day!</li>
            <li>I use to have certain dry spots on my face especially around my nose</li>
            <li>Two pumps of this serum can cover your whole face so this bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li>I noticed less creasing under my eyes, which I believe is because of the way it sinks into your skin evenly and lightly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to pregnancy, my skin all of a sudden became dry.  </li>
            <li>I received the product a few days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to try at first (after I received my product) as I&#x27;m experiencing some facial skin problems due to pregnancy hormones.</li>
            <li>just a quick push will put a small amount in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I would buy again, but I do feel the price is a bit much considering the dispenser on my bottle released a lot of product with one push, and a lot of the product missed my fingers due to the rapid release of the serum from the pump.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive , dry skin and KP.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got a bad pump - Serum is amazing 5 star for it!</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin was in shock for the first few applications.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, &amp; seems to help with the dry spots on my face that the cold weather is causing.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin but cleansers tend to dry it out.</li>
            <li>no strong scent Con: feels sticky when first applied</li>
            <li>so you have to let it dry completely before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I use one pump on my fingers and spread it on my skin, the serum is a bit thin but dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I switched to using every other day and it leaves my skin soft and radiant!!</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that Amazon shipped the 2nd bottle with my other orders with more protection.</li>
            <li>You can feel it dry on your skin (though not tightly, like a mask might do), so I always use moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have been so hesitant to try new products due to sensitivities and allergies.</li>

            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the fact that it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> Definitely need a good moisturizer to go with it.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this is a good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong too.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had enough time to see how good the result can be, but for the moment i was using, the serum was light and absorb very fast.</li>

            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, works well in combination with my moisturizer</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and is not oily.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to do a quick thought on this product</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought several Serum last times and this one is best among the others.</li>
            <li> It dries absorbs fairly quickly before I move onto my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Yumi Beautiful Vitamin C Serum will brighten, firm, and hydrate your skin while boosting collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super dry and some products make my skin even drier but this one didn’t which is a good point of it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are fantastic, the lack of fragrances and dyes make this a great option for sensitive skin, and the consistency feels refreshing and hydrating rather than heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it absorbs and how soft my skin feels after using it!  </li>
            <li> Finally though, I&#x27;ve found a super fast absorbing serum and that is Yumi Beautiful&#x27;s Signature Antioxidant Skin Care Serum.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and soaks up fast.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my skin so much!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> So I tried it over night on my hand first and OMG!</li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great item, just haven&#x27;t used in long enough yo notice a difference</li>
            <li> skin does look more hydrated and doesn&#x27;t have as many dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced product helps reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li> using this over time will really make a difference in the eye wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> After a short time of use, I cannot speak on whether or not the anti-aging claims of this product are true, however I can confidently say that if you have acne-issues and avoid vitamin C products due to the risk of breakouts, this might be a great product for you to try.</li>
            <li> The serum is not too heavy which I appreciate greatly and does not look greasy or oily after it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> - the skin feels much firmer and smooth.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth to try.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am using this product on my hands and I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is making me yumi beautiful yet</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your skin look soft.  </li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> useful for my skin.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m genuinely amazed at how soft and smooth they feel immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> So far love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>

            <li> packaging and bottle looks really pretty.</li>

            <li> This is first time I use this product.</li>
            <li> First impression, it&#x27;s a bit sticky</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I reapplied more and still got the same results.  </li>
            <li> , it is so light and absorbs completely without oily residue.</li>
            <li> and i ca definitely see results! :)</li>

            <li> The serum brightened and made my skin looked more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel tighter on first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and I have started using serums and so far I have been acne free</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> IT PUMPS OUT WAY TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> but she says it works very well!</li>
            <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and actually absorbs well into my skin and dries to make my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I purchased another in case the first one run out.</li>
            <li> it is so soft and smooth and seems to even be smoothing out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum!</li>
            <li> , I loved how hydrated my face started to feel after a few times using it.</li>
            <li> Just started using few days ago..feels good.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my skin feel firm</li>
            <li> Instantly my hand was so much more smoother then the other, but still wanted to test it through the night to see if I&#x27;d get a reaction of any kind and to my surprise</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that it gives an amazing result</li>
            <li> I have just recently started using this product, but I am excited over the results I have already seen!</li>
            <li> is a serum and what will it do for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Serums are basically targeted treatments with highly concentrated ingredients designed to be quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had special improvement after use.</li>
            <li> nothing special so far.  </li>
            <li> It quickly removed the dark saggy bags under my eyes and replaced it with youthful healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free Regardless, I only recommend products or services</li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s a great facial product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really get the exact amount I want out.</li>
            <li> Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy moisturizer, but the serum is full of antioxidants.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for a whole week, and I can confidently say that this product really is improving my skin and adding all the extra nourishment I needed.</li>
            <li> I feel I can see a more vibrant and younger skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin) ...</li>
            <li> and i do not have those dry spots any more.</li>
            <li> Its easy on my occasionally troublesome skin.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This run out pretty fast, i cant really tell if i see results</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> so I am very particular with the products I use.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a difference in my skin, but so far it has been a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on my face.</li>
            <li> I use it 3-5 times per week and within 2 weeks, there is a visible improvement in fine lines and overall tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> as I thought it would be and also was a little drying to my skin and kind of like alcohol.  </li>
            <li> In just a few uses, my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> goes on smooth soaks in fast the only thing to me</li>
            <li> like that this serum comes in a pump instead of a dropper bottle, it&#x27;s very user</li>
            <li> the skin feels so much smoother and tighter</li>
            <li> i try  really  </li>
            <li> Very helpful serum.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on the skin and works wonders at smoothing out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite using it at night, and washing my face in the morning, I have noticed a fast improvement in that area.</li>
            <li> and I really the serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Light enough</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wear so much makeup to try to cover up the unevenness of my skin.</li>
            <li> reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Yumi Vitamin C serum is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have noticed, however, it seems to sit on the surface of my skin and not soak in very well.</li>
            <li> But every time I pump, no matter how gently I do it, it gives me way too much of the serum.</li>
            <li> My wife is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> What really drew my attention is that it&#x27;s made with organic extracts.</li>
            <li> Another thing that bothered me was that when I ordered this product (at a very steep discount, might I add)</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product</li>
            <li> I really like this Serum.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it for now.</li>
            <li> I expected it to work a lot better</li>
            <li> It is sticky and stings the skin a bit when you put it on and it has not seemed to make any real difference to my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> so I was very suprise.</li>
            <li> and I am really liking the product.</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very nourishing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about these products</li>
            <li> and once you&#x27;ve pressed it, too much product squirts out</li>
            <li> I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
            <li> Very good~&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> you so much~</li>
            <li> I love it how it makes my skin so  soft definitely will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I like the fact you only need one pump of the product to cover the entire face, and it has a nice consistency that absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and hope to continue using it for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Vitamin C serums over $75 and this one works just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> I really liked the inclusion of Aloe Vera and all of the other natural extracts.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definite worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this on for the past month now and love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this and the other Yumi products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> , she wants to try other products now! :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to see the benefits of Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling a little tight after it dries, but it is great for right before bed.</li>
            <li> First of all it is a clear gel like serum.</li>
            <li> Also, their customer service is pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;[I&#x27;m 48, acne prone olive complexion, T-zone as far as oiliness with some discolorations from blemishes and melasma -</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a serum of any type on my face and so far I feel it&#x27;s hydrating, and leaves my skin glowing.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a visible difference in my skin  - my dark spots are fading somewhat and my skin looks more radiant to me.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I could sometimes get a little bit more, instead of a whole squirt.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick this serum absorbed the first time I used it - it took less than a minute!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who just wants to try out a new organic serum.</li>
            <li> I do apply a moisturizing cream in addition to the serum in the evening as I live in the northeast and the winter is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> The consistancy of the serum is light and unscented; it absorbs quicky, but I do let it dry before I continue with my moisturizers...  </li>
            <li> Main ingredients are Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic acid, organic botanicals and superfruit extracts.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more all-in-one product but will definitely use this in conjunction with me regular moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> Like others, I am not crazy about the pump bottle, it seems like I either get too much or not enough.  </li>
            <li> This item definitely looks like something you would get in a high-end department store, so I love knowing that it&#x27;s offered here for only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> My aunt has used it for about a week now and says that her face feels tighter, which is her main concern.</li>
            <li> Good but not great to much alcohol in product</li>
            <li> One pump is more than enough to cover entire face.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the pump isn&#x27;t as smooth to press down</li>
            <li> The skin on the top area of my cheeks has always felt rough, most moisturizers have improved it for a small period of time but the softness they provide has always faded as the day passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Serum to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Although I do not have major wrinkles, I&#x27;m starting to have fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying for me and more watery than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Made my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always very iffy on trying new things on my skin because I have VERY Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only thing i din&#x27;t like really is that It is a very watery serum its very runny and odorless.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product, I cannot stop raving about this product, you will not be sorry for buying this.</li>
            <li> I have never tried aloe on my skin before and so far I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural botanical ingredients  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Will update after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid and love the combination in this Yumi serum...  </li>
            <li> I wait a few minutes after applying this serum, and put my moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love the way my face feels just after a few days of using this product.</li>
            <li> I like to wear this under my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I will update after a few more days of use.</li>
            <li> I will try it a few more times</li>
            <li> I have been using Yumi for a few weeks now and believe that my skin is more hydrated as a result.</li>
            <li> Skin feels firm and smooth after application!</li>
            <li> My skin looks radiant and not dull.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first, because it seemed to firm my skin up, but then it became overly dry.</li>
            <li> It is not thin, so be careful how you use it to not use it all quickly.</li>
            <li> Weird consistency kind of liquidy but dries quickly and does help with moisturizing</li>
            <li> and i had new bumps and my face was redder than normal.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it my skin would become very smooth shortly after application.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C Serums in the past, but wasn&#x27;t as happy as I am with this product.</li>
            <li> so far I am please with the vitamin C product, I have been using it for a few weeks and my skin feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I love that it leaves my skin feeling slightly refreshed and not tight or greasy.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid, this is the ingredient in other skin cream that will make our skin plump and smooth again.  </li>
            <li> My skin feel smooth and not irritate like some other brand Vitamin C serum might do .</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s moisturizing, light and</li>
            <li> The product was slightly stickier  than I liked, took a little more rubbing/dryibut other than that I really like it.  </li>
            <li> (I always am with new products-</li>
            <li> I purchased the products after reading the reviews and it seems to live up to the others reviews.</li>
            <li> It will actively combat the signs of aging by fighting free radical damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t irritate it and within a few uses it was extremely amazing how different my skin felt!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and silky and its rare when the roughness of my skin come back.</li>
            <li> I started to apply it on my super dry skin 3 weeks ago at nights after removing my make up.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin really soft, so much so that I had my husband feel how soft it felt.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to fit in your current beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product and I&#x27;ve only had this item a few days, but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling very soft and silky.</li>

            <li> It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> The design is appealing and the size is reasonable  although I wish it was bigger as I have been using it every day  and would like it to last for a long time...  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my skin, but some fading of dark spots.  </li>

            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again also highly recommend to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for the last two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have paid double even triple for top skin care products  and never had such definite results like this.  </li>
            <li> makes skin really soft!</li>
            <li> This totally resurfaced my face - and gently!</li>
            <li> This is YUMMY stuff for my 50 year old face!</li>
            <li> Plus the natural ingredients - can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> The first one is ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum.</li>
            <li> felt nice and tight when first applied but didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Light and didn&#x27;t weight my face down</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better serum to use not only after being sick but after washing my face this morning, surprisingly it had no smell</li>
            <li> Very light and fresh,  not too heavy,  one pump is enough for the whole face, tried it only for a couple weeks, morning and night,  no big difference as of yet, but no acne breakout from the formula which is a plus on my oily skin!  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with product in my hand and it won&#x27;t last as long using  more than I need.    </li>
            <li> Its a good product, however I broke out not sure if it was due to this.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs pretty quickly and just a little drop of it covers a pretty big area so it will definitely last a while.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard for me to give a good review because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have previously tired another Yumi product, Asteria and had amazing results.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how my skin looks clear and has a glow...</li>
            <li> Consistency is clear and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe: A natural skin moisturizer and anti-inflammatory agent, Aloe will hydrate and soothe your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so soft .</li>
            <li> really look at me now and say no way , not possible !</li>
            <li> Thanks will continue to use your products in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, and doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> I never thought my skin could be so soft again, reminds me on when I was a child.</li>
            <li> I was worried because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and so far there&#x27;s been no irritation or issues with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it helps with wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a softer feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin looked refreshed and feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin yet, but it is too early to see that maybe</li>
            <li> I found that the formula works very well, I will be a repeating customer once I start to get low.</li>
            <li> My skin feel soft after I&#x27;ve used it for a week.</li>
            <li> I feel my face soft</li>
            <li> I used it on my 96 year old mother</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to chime in early because I do notice improvement in the brightness/tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> It is soft and not trouble</li>
            <li> My skin does feel soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m too young to say anything on anti-aging since I don&#x27;t have any wrinkle...</li>
            <li> it makes your face feel so soft and it does not irritate your skin</li>
            <li> and i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out so far.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product with natural ingredients and Yumi Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> It tones and improves the appearance of my skin while moisturizing and keeping it soft.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooths.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and refreshed after applying this serum.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky and it&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> My face was too sensitive</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not really feeling about it is it&#x27;s pretty sticky at first</li>
            <li> im 38 years old</li>
            <li> There was no trouble since I using one month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for an anti-aging serum that had plenty of natural ingredients in it and that would re-texture the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and found I could not use this in the morning AND evening as the package instructed.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer and brighter, and so soft.</li>
            <li> it soaks into your skin &amp; makes it soft &amp; glowing plus wearing makeup over it</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say I don&#x27;t like about this is the pump style it squirts out to much product</li>
            <li> My face is soooo soft and my skin seems to glow after I apply.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any peeling but when I washed my face I was able to &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; the dead skin off, revealing younger skin underneath.</li>
            <li> But really, the distinguishing factor that sets it apart from other serums is its fast absorption rate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it at night so far to slowly introduce my face to new product and my face has looked very smooth and refreshed in the mornig.</li>
            <li> Again, It is very convenient if you are traveling, you can put it right in your purse and no need to carry other facial products with you.</li>
            <li> I love it so far and its only been a few days!</li>
            <li> The only downside for me is that the serum is very watery and if you are not careful it will drip off your fingers as you are trying to apply it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better my skin looked after only a few days!</li>
            <li> I use two small pumps on my fingertips and apply after/on top of my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s only main thing I wasn&#x27;t fond of.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and I&#x27;ve noticed my dark spots and uneven skin tone  areas on my face, quickly fading.  </li>
            <li> I am totally enjoying my Yumi Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid and 14 Organic Extracts, I especially like adding a little spritz to my hair for extra shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> I suffered from dry patchy skin, and adult acne and this product has help so much with the improvement of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and gives skin a tight, toned feeling.</li>
            <li> It long after you put it on you can feel a real difference.  </li>
            <li> Not fair to say more until I try longer.</li>
            <li> I made my skin looks smooth and help my pore small.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars, so I can&#x27;t wait to see if it will really help with those after long term use.    </li>
            <li> first thing that I noticed about this product i didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with very soft skin even during these winter temperatures where my skin normally becomes dry.</li>
            <li> but I also like the idea that I can actually read the ingredients in this product now if only they will offer a cleaner thanks for the product</li>
            <li> Just use a few days, can&#x27;t really tell the really changes on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week, once at night because I have sensitive skin - but so far I haven&#x27;t had any reactions.</li>
            <li> I have used this item and haven&#x27;t realy seen any major changes.  </li>
            <li> I only used it for a few days but so far I have no bad reaction yet,</li>
            <li> So if I had to say what could be improved, not much besides  it is a bit thin and more of a clear gel than very botanical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not sticky, plus a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky at first, but as soon as it drys your skin feels power soft.</li>
            <li> The condition of my skin has definitely improved, my skin looks firmer and has got the natural glow to it.</li>
            <li> I barely have one week using it</li>
            <li> It actually helped my &amp;#34;tired mom eyes&amp;#34; even though I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and wrinkles aren&#x27;t a concern yet.</li>
            <li> I only use natural products, and sometimes the efficacy isn&#x27;t what you would hope for.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple days and so far it seems to help.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin so soft for the entire day!</li>
            <li> I use to have certain dry spots on my face especially around my nose</li>
            <li> Two pumps of this serum can cover your whole face so this bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I noticed less creasing under my eyes, which I believe is because of the way it sinks into your skin evenly and lightly.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to pregnancy, my skin all of a sudden became dry.  </li>
            <li> I received the product a few days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to try at first (after I received my product) as I&#x27;m experiencing some facial skin problems due to pregnancy hormones.</li>
            <li> just a quick push will put a small amount in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I would buy again, but I do feel the price is a bit much considering the dispenser on my bottle released a lot of product with one push, and a lot of the product missed my fingers due to the rapid release of the serum from the pump.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive , dry skin and KP.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad pump - Serum is amazing 5 star for it!</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin was in shock for the first few applications.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, &amp; seems to help with the dry spots on my face that the cold weather is causing.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin but cleansers tend to dry it out.</li>
            <li> no strong scent Con: feels sticky when first applied</li>
            <li> so you have to let it dry completely before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I use one pump on my fingers and spread it on my skin, the serum is a bit thin but dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I switched to using every other day and it leaves my skin soft and radiant!!</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that Amazon shipped the 2nd bottle with my other orders with more protection.</li>
            <li> You can feel it dry on your skin (though not tightly, like a mask might do), so I always use moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been so hesitant to try new products due to sensitivities and allergies.</li>
            <li> The first couple days I thought it made my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> I generally have very dry, coarse skin</li>
            <li> this had me really confused specially since aloe does have a tiny hint of smell to</li>
            <li> I received this for special price and am addicted now.</li>
            <li> Its a decent size bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I apply to dry, clean skin twice a day; at least I try!  </li>
            <li> I received a replacement bottle approximately 1.5 weeks ago and so the review is likely premature in that Vitamin C serums generally take 4-8 weeks of consistent use to see results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any change maybe because I didnot use it long enough!</li>
            <li> I have not taken it long enough to comment on anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li> I have not used this for a long enough time, but I like how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I have to say is that it dries too fast.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin easily especially after wearing make up all day then scrubbing my face to get the makeup off.</li>
            <li> my wife tried this serum for several weeks and she feels her skin is not as dry as before.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and tight.</li>
            <li> Not only did it take care of dry spots under my eyes from tanning, I had wrinkles that have disappeared!</li>
            <li> I love the serum it helps hydrate my skin especially up in Alaska where it&#x27;s cold and dry!</li>
            <li> Very runny so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> ok not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it&#x27;s been helping my crazy acne break out.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after application and &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now and do not have any complaints.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars all day long.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually not sensitive to products</li>
            <li> I expect that I will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still a good lotion to use as a base to refresh my skin after wash and before moisturizer, and it does serve the purpose well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product other than the texture.</li>
            <li> I was only using it once every other day, to get my skin used to it, so</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used very long yet.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s noticed her dry skin has improved and a decrease in oil in the t-zone.</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my dry and oil skin and it makes it feel like if I have baby powder on.</li>
            <li> The dry areas on my face became supple and stayed that way for hours.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like it just made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate or dry my face whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> After application my skins feels dry</li>
            <li> I skin still stayed dry after it soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is softer and not as dry as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Does tighten the skin when dry and will be a noticeable shine.  </li>
            <li> She only used it a few days but said she definitely likes it</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would start off using every other day as it severely dried my skin out using every day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it more on extremely windy or cold days.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on before bed and my face is really soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I read that you&#x27;re only supposed to use a little bit of the serum especially if you have dry skin like me (a little goes a long way after all).</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to help my dry face!</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not super songs on is the packaging.</li>
            <li> Smaller pores, softer skin, and slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> but, I already notice a small difference in how soft my skin feels and its not really flaky anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin started feeling dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my aunt, who is in her late 40&#x27;s and is very conscious of her aging skin.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll definitely need to use a heavy moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> it was a little sticky but that feeling went away shortly</li>
            <li> and it only helped a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too runny for me,  but at the same time it also absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin as well as facial excema and this product has not been at all irritating to me.  </li>
            <li> This serum is a lightweight watery consistency, so it sinks into the skin immediately and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum sinks into my skin immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily, one a day, at night, and have already noticed a difference in my trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a few days and I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and could see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few times.</li>
            <li> It seems to really firm my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few days,  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I was using it in conjunction with moisturizer over it, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to counteract how much it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Now, I won&#x27;t have a dirty screen and take time to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way,</li>
            <li> Also, it is concentrated, so that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn like the other vitamin c serums i&#x27;ve tried .. and does not leave my skin sticky after use .</li>
            <li> I just started using it a few days ago, so I can&#x27;t attest to the long term effects yet.</li>
            <li> Only a small drop is needed.</li>
            <li> I have noticed small lines disappear after two weeks of using, i cant wait to see what the next two weeks will do!</li>
            <li> any as some other reviews had mentioned.</li>
            <li> I would like to try the other products.</li>
            <li> I was wondering if you wear this alone or under other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure my regular moisturizer will work.</li>
            <li> Also a plus due to applying to my face/neck area, my hands nor cuticles have not cracked this winter either.</li>
            <li> Makes face a little dry.</li>
            <li> Since we are in windy season, I tend to get dry skin on my face but since using this product, my face isn&#x27;t suffering the dry skin it usually does.</li>
            <li> After I use it on my face I rub a little on the back of my hands to help lighten a few dark spots.</li>
            <li> It has made a few of my lines a little less obvious and it has also helped lighten some of the spots I have on my face.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other sticky Vit. C &amp; hyaluronic serum (my previous one is OZ Naturals), Yumi provides watery, non-stick (so that you don&#x27;t feel like to wash your hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that it helps with my dark spots too.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> I can use it as the base for my skin maintenance before putting anything else on the top.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times, but it just felt like it was sitting on my skin and not absorbing.</li>
            <li> My skin can go from very tight and dry to slightly oily.</li>
            <li> but I must say that it makes your skin look tighter and lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Skin peels slightly</li>
            <li> I do have slight lives around my eyes..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Over the past month I have noticed a smoothness in my skin even though we are in the harsh winter dry months here in PA.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel a little tight but other than that, it feels softer &amp; is glowing!</li>
            <li> Hopefully my ongoing moisturizing work can keep my skin tight and save me from wrinkles in the future!&lt;br /&gt;NOTE2:</li>
            <li> My skin was dull, dry &amp; flakey.</li>
            <li> Organic botanicals &amp; superfruit extracts, as well as pomegranate, green tea, black berry, noni and kale.</li>
            <li> wish this serum was a thicker consistency, it is a little watery feeling so it does drip off of your hand while you are trying to apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s helped with making my face feel softer and it seems a little brighter.</li>
            <li> This product has little to no smell.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned it is a little watery and does make skin momentarily sticky.</li>
            <li> Feel a little mislead</li>
            <li> It has a little whitening effect to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little running.  </li>
            <li> and my skin felt tight after it dried.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin just after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> which means it&#x27;s sloughing off my dead skin.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a few days and can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that this has dried out my skin</li>
            <li> After about  4 days it wasn&#x27;t so overly dried out</li>
            <li> Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It has uneven skin tones with oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> Once you apply it a few times, you can def.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t seen improvements after just a few days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my face either.</li>
            <li> Also came within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used it every morning &amp; every night and could see a difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week, but I can already see the difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling uncomfortably tight, something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other serums.</li>
            <li> I recently got this and have to say I was skeptical</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft, and helps lock in the moisture, during these cold winter days.</li>
            <li> it does not have a nasty its a ok smell  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday !</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No more dryness in the areas that I had problems with.</li>
            <li> The bottle makes it hard to use just a small amount.</li>
            <li> The serum is very, very thin and one pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hardly noticed I was using it</li>
            <li> and it brightens my skin when it is dull.</li>
            <li> The price point on this product is hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed the dull look</li>
            <li> It was one of the least moisturizing ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use every morning, and every evening - and getting compliments at work on how refreshed I look lately.  </li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not have a negative effect on my problem patches at all, no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My face requires 1.5 pumps, but I&#x27;m forced to use 2 because of the way it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> For a serum is not as thick as I am use to all serums are.  </li>
            <li> However, it brightens skin and does reduce appearance of small wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, only dried out my skin</li>
            <li> Anyway it is apperant that the serum is not good for daytime use.</li>
            <li> It is not good for use before applying makeup as it tends to sticky, and peel off.</li>
            <li> finally after being completely sick this morning i got a chance to try this product</li>
            <li> Sorry, couldn&#x27;t get past the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or too thick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gummy when it&#x27;s cold</li>
            <li> texture is a bit thin and watery and I would have preferred a bit of a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting approximately 15 mins to apply moisturizer to avoid pilling.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to doing another review in approximately 2 months.</li>
            <li> I also became as annoyed as can be with the pump.</li>
            <li> no smell or irritating sensation.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference yet.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are already put together and when I used it, it doesn&#x27;t leave any feeling greasy or filmy like another expensive vitamin serum I bought.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try this.</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little sticky after I applied it but nothing horrible by any means.</li>
            <li> Sorry :(</li>
            <li> so bad.</li>
            <li> expecially in the cold, windy wintertime of Buffalo, NY!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> EACH PUMP :(</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week and have nothing bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> I hated has disappeared.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> In just a few uses, my skin feels amazing.  I noticed less creasing under my eyes, which I believe is because of the way it sinks into your skin evenly and lightly.  Also, it did not irritate my skin, which is fantastic because mine tends to be very sensitive after having children.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants bright youthful looking skin these days, so when I got the chance to try the Yumi Beautiful Vitamin C serum I was very happy. This serum is a lightweight watery consistency, so it sinks into the skin immediately and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a serum and what will it do for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;Serums are basically targeted treatments with highly concentrated ingredients designed to be quickly absorbed into the skin. The Yumi Beautiful Vitamin C Serum will brighten, firm, and hydrate your skin while boosting collagen and elastin production. It will actively combat the signs of aging by fighting free radical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe: A natural skin moisturizer and anti-inflammatory agent, Aloe will hydrate and soothe your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C: Will fight free radical damage which means it will make your skin look bright and youthful. Vitamin C is also great at protecting your skin from sun damage, but you still should always wear sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This serum also includes; Licorice, Green Tea, Pomegranate, Blackberry, Cranberry, Grape, Acai, Bearberry, Goji Berry, Noni, Raspberry, and Kale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros &amp; Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;The Yumi Beautiful Vitamin C Serum makes my skin feel very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The serum sinks into my skin immediately and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;My skin does look more hydrated and doesn&#x27;t have as many dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this serum comes in a pump instead of a dropper bottle, it&#x27;s very user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons-&lt;br /&gt;I wish this serum was a thicker consistency, it is a little watery feeling so it does drip off of your hand while you are trying to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent at all, that may be a good thing to some people, but I like some scent to my facial products.</li>
            <li> First of all, this Vitamin C serum is for brightening and making your skin look more youthful. It helps your skin appear firmer, more touchable and radiant. Main ingredients are Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic acid, organic botanicals and superfruit extracts. It’s based in soothing Aloe vera with hyaluronic acid to intensely hydrate your skin; and contains a stable and effective form of Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and bottle looks really pretty. What I also like about it is that it’s got a pump attached to it which makes the whole applying process more hassle free and easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been applying the serum to my face and neck after I’ve cleansed it every morning. The instructions do say to apply it every morning and night but I wanted my skin to get used to the serum first before I start applying it twice a day. The serum absorbs pretty quickly and just a little drop of it covers a pretty big area so it will definitely last a while. The condition of my skin has definitely improved, my skin looks firmer and has got the natural glow to it. It’s definitely a product that should be added to your beauty regime.</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my skin feel smooth all day long, and the fine lines seem to disappear</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so soft . i love it</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a wonderful feel but I also like the idea that I can actually read the ingredients in this product now if only they will offer a cleaner thanks for the product</li>
            <li> Very good day and night cream. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I do like this product!!  If you have sensitive skin I would start off using every other day as it severely dried my skin out using every day. I switched to using every other day and it leaves my skin soft and radiant!!</li>
            <li> Ordered as a Christmas gift per request</li>
            <li> This is a good one to anti aging.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now and people have noticed a difference! I have been told told I don&#x27;t look like a grandmother and people really look at me now and say no way , not possible ! Thanks will continue to use your products in the future.</li>
            <li> loved it, cooling feeling and i can feel a difference on face the skin feels so much smoother and tighter</li>
            <li> its overdry after use, also peeling off.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth soaks in fast the only thing to me it was a little sticky but that feeling went away shortly</li>
            <li> I bought one for my sister, she felt skin more smooth and shinnig after one week and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture....also looks brighter too!!!</li>
            <li> I had been investigating Vitamin C serums when I found this Yumi one.  I really liked the inclusion of Aloe Vera and all of the other natural extracts.  Since I have been using it, my skin is brighter and more even complected.  I have very dry and sensitive skin as well as facial excema and this product has not been at all irritating to me.  It has even improved my under eye circles.  I use it morning and and night.  The packaging is great and one or two pumps provide plenty of product for my face and neck.  Think this will be my go to product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. This company makes a great product anyway, but this Vitamin C serum is so soothing around the eyes and on the neck. I love it!</li>
            <li> All in one serum! This serum is loaded with organic extracts, vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid. It comes in an easy to use and easy to carry pump canister. I use one pump on my fingers and spread it on my skin, the serum is a bit thin but dries very quickly. I already see that it has brightened my skin and makes it glow and makes it feel very smooth.  I hope as I continue to use it I see more results but I must say that it makes your skin look tighter and lines less noticeable. Again, It is very convenient if you are traveling, you can put it right in your purse and no need to carry other facial products with you.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! I barely have one week using it and it&#x27;s working great!!! My expression lines that I have close to my mouth, are going away!!! I like the product and definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Got it quickly as well :)</li>

            <li> so far I am please with the vitamin C product, I have been using it for a few weeks and my skin feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product and I love how smooth it goes on the face.  I use it every morning before I apply my moisturizer and it automatically gives my face a nice glow, not to mention makes it feel so much softer.  I love the hydration and the ease in applying this product, I would def. recommend this product and would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes my face feel and look amazing</li>
            <li> I like this serum a lot. It&#x27;s not heavy, and doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used the product long enough to know the results, but it feels very good on the skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Today is my second day using the yumi serum and so far I love it. U can feel it working on ur skin. My skin feels soft and tight. I will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> i love it and hope to buy more!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> In one word- Amazing!  I never thought my skin could be so soft again, reminds me on when I was a child. Love it!  I was worried because I have sensitive skin but no worries here it didn&#x27;t irritate it and within a few uses it was extremely amazing how different my skin felt! I would recommend this to anyone looking to smooth out their skin or just wanting a more youthful glow!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced product helps reduce fine lines.  I feel I can see a more vibrant and younger skin tone.  Will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love it how it makes my skin so  soft definitely will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and my skin is super soft. Love this.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product so I will update as soon as I give it enough time to notice if it does anything.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn like the other vitamin c serums i&#x27;ve tried .. and does not leave my skin sticky after use .</li>
            <li> My wife loves that this comes in a pump, make it very easy to use.  She has very sensitive skin and so far there&#x27;s been no irritation or issues with breakouts.  She&#x27;s noticed her dry skin has improved and a decrease in oil in the t-zone.</li>
            <li> This has already helped with my &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots on my hands..Yeah!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel. I put a bit on every morning</li>
            <li> Very helpful serum. Light and didn&#x27;t weight my face down</li>
            <li> I recently got this and have to say I was skeptical (I always am with new products- I have super sensitive skin) ... BUT... I absolutely love it. I use it at night and it leaves my skin feeling tighter and more refreshed!! The serum is not too heavy which I appreciate greatly and does not look greasy or oily after it is absorbed. I am highly impressed! This is definitely a great add to the beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Such a great skin care line. It makes my skin look healthy and hydrated. I put this on at night and love waking up in the morning feeling refresh. It brightens up my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a dream, my skin feels amazing. I just started using it a few days ago, so I can&#x27;t attest to the long term effects yet.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week, so we will see what happens after using it longer. So far I like it. It isn&#x27;t sticky like some serums can be. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face super shiny, which is good. I have normal skin and it goes on smooth and absorbs/drys quickly. It has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I received a discount, so I thought I should try it. I would recommend it and think that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any change maybe because I didnot use it long enough!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I love the way it penetrates so fast! Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to my mom. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Good product, I was very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great product. My skin feel like 5 yrs younger now. If you don&#x27;t have time and money to SPA, this is the product you should try.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It is so gentle on the skin and works wonders at smoothing out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is my Every day, Go To product. It absorbs quickly. The results are amazing. My skin is so healthy and radiant. I tend to have a T zone, and this products had made an amazing difference with the oily skin I had. The product arrived quickly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Very runny so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Good product with all the necessary natural ingredients to make the skin aging gracefully. Vitamin C will make the skin brighter, fight wrinkle because it&#x27;s helping with collagen production. Aloe Vera, so many benefit for the for the skin, will help skin fight aging. Hyaluronic acid, this is the ingredient in other skin cream that will make our skin plump and smooth again.  The ingredients are already put together and when I used it, it doesn&#x27;t leave any feeling greasy or filmy like another expensive vitamin serum I bought.  It&#x27;s absorbed better, leaves the skin no residue and feel fresh. I can use it as the base for my skin maintenance before putting anything else on the top.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I saw a difference in my skin just after a few uses.  I would highly recommend this Serum to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use this twice, but so far, so good.  I have very sensitive skin and this has not given me any problems...no irritation or breakouts.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if it helps with wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a softer feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps all its promises.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid and was very excited to try this serum. It was one of the least moisturizing ones I&#x27;ve tried. It is great if you are only concerned about getting these nutrients into your skin but if you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll definitely need to use a heavy moisturizer with it. I was hoping for a more all-in-one product but will definitely use this in conjunction with me regular moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> Yumi Beautiful product the serum itself is clear and has a clean mild scent. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. This is my first time using a serum so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to really expect. My skin feels soft after application and &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now and do not have any complaints. I also have not had any adverse skin reactions while using it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my skin feel younger. I put it on every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, however I broke out not sure if it was due to this.</li>
            <li> I love these products! Yumi has some great stuff!! Check them out!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed trying this product. I have naturally oily skin but cleansers tend to dry it out. This serum made my face have a almost matte feel to it, wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. I don&#x27;t normally like lotions or anything on my face but the smell was nice and it had a nice texture. Overall a great product</li>
            <li> Beautiful is easy, but give this product a try~~ You will love it~~~</li>
            <li> Looks like something nice!</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to apply. My skin feel smooth and not irritate like some other brand Vitamin C serum might do . It&#x27;s worth to try.</li>
            <li> Love the lightweight serum!  So does my skin...expecially in the cold, windy wintertime of Buffalo, NY!  I use every morning, and every evening - and getting compliments at work on how refreshed I look lately.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Only a small drop is needed. It feels a little sticky at first, but as soon as it drys your skin feels power soft. It made my hands look instantly younger. My face and neck felt fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> So smooth!  Love the way my skin feels after using it.  I received this for special price and am addicted now.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvements after use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week. I really like that it isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky. Leaves my face with a soft smooth texture.</li>
            <li> YUMI BEAUTIFUL contains vitamin c serum with aloe vera. Organic botanicals &amp; superfruit extracts, as well as pomegranate, green tea, black berry, noni and kale. Super pleased when i read about the kale i am a huge kale fan, kale contains antioxidants and has many benefits. Only thing i din&#x27;t like really is that It is a very watery serum its very runny and odorless. If it did have a scent I could not tell honestly. However it is a very good product, I loved how hydrated my face started to feel after a few times using it. I use to have certain dry spots on my face especially around my nose and i do not have those dry spots any more. ﻿&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that my skin started to have this really nice glow to it, i have not had this until i started YUMI BEAUTIFUL.  My overall opinion on this product is that it does as promised fresher, radiant, smoother, touchable skin. Only thing i wish is that it had a scent and wasn&#x27;t so runny, but besides that i am glad i was able to try this product and i am very happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and always give my honest and truthful opinion :)</li>
            <li> Love this product, does wonders when applied at night!</li>
            <li> I placed my second order. Skin peels slightly which means it&#x27;s sloughing off my dead skin. Hence my wife and I use it at night time and follow up with sunscreen in the morning.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had enough time to see how good the result can be, but for the moment i was using, the serum was light and absorb very fast.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.  Love the smell and glides on smoothly</li>
            <li> Very light and fresh,  not too heavy,  one pump is enough for the whole face, tried it only for a couple weeks, morning and night,  no big difference as of yet, but no acne breakout from the formula which is a plus on my oily skin!  May review again after a longer trial.</li>
            <li> So glad I was given the opportunity to try this produc! It does exactly what it says. Gave 4 stars only because it says serum and i thought it would be a LOT thicker, I even thought shaking it would help. Other then that it&#x27;s a great facial product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mom. She only used it a few days but said she definitely likes it, she wants to try other products now! :)</li>
            <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
            <li> Arrived  on time and  I&#x27;d a quality product</li>
            <li> I love the packing and the light citrus scent. It&#x27;s a little drying for me and more watery than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Lightweight serum. Haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference yet.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I do not like the packaging or pump dispenser. The product is great. This is a very light moisturizer that tightens the skin and gives my complexion a nice radiant look. This is not a heavy moisturizer, but the serum is full of antioxidants. The product goes well under tinted moisturizer. I would buy again, but I do feel the price is a bit much considering the dispenser on my bottle released a lot of product with one push, and a lot of the product missed my fingers due to the rapid release of the serum from the pump. Maybe it was just my bottle.</li>
            <li> Just use a few days, can&#x27;t really tell the really changes on the skin. However, the skin more nice and refresh after the use. Will update after using for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. It is not greasy, absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my skin so much!!</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in writing reviews after you have given products a good chance. I think the review process should happen after multiple uses in order to fully grasp how well a product works, especially if it is a skin product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed about this product i didn&#x27;t have to use as much as I expected. It spreads easily and soaks up fast. I have been using this product daily, one a day, at night, and have already noticed a difference in my trouble spots. The skin on the top area of my cheeks has always felt rough, most moisturizers have improved it for a small period of time but the softness they provide has always faded as the day passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite using it at night, and washing my face in the morning, I have noticed a fast improvement in that area. My skin feels soft and silky and its rare when the roughness of my skin come back. I have noticed it more on extremely windy or cold days. All in all, I am very happy this purchase</li>
            <li> Left my skin flaky..not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, let me feel young again!</li>
            <li> I love using this after washing off my makeup and before going to bed! When I wake up my skin feels soft and refreshed! After a week of using I can already see a difference in the clarity of my skin! A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s definite worth the price!</li>
            <li> I use this serum on my dry and oil skin and it makes it feel like if I have baby powder on. It&#x27;s so smooth and soft. I absolutely love it!  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is glowing too! Thank you Yumi Beautiful for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It makes your skin taute but supple. I&#x27;ll be buying again, for sure!</li>
            <li> I like mixing this with a moisturizer. I feel like my moisturizer stays on betters. I feel like my skin has been brighter since using this product. My husban uses it and also has been happy with it. I would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> great deal for daily serum</li>
            <li> Great product, works well!</li>
            <li> I am using this product on my hands and I am pleased so far.  It is not thin, so be careful how you use it to not use it all quickly.</li>
            <li> Good service and quality</li>
            <li> A great product gives skin a silk feeling and nice touch, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because she&#x27;s always looking for anti-aging stuff to try out. I actually tried it for a couple days myself out of curiosity. It actually helped my &amp;#34;tired mom eyes&amp;#34; even though I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and wrinkles aren&#x27;t a concern yet. Mom hasn&#x27;t had any complaints, although it hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles for her either. Part of me wishes I had kept it for myself though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and I really the serum. Admittedly, I don&#x27;t always use it twice a day, like the instructions say, but i think my skin tone has actually evened out. The serum is very, very thin and one pump goes a long way. You can feel it dry on your skin (though not tightly, like a mask might do), so I always use moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> easy to absorb, waiting to see results</li>
            <li> Very nice product - the skin feels much firmer and smooth. It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a few days and I can already see a difference in my skin. My skin is brighter and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I have just recently started using this product, but I am excited over the results I have already seen! It makes my skin looked refreshed and feel amazingly soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not the best vitamin serum I&#x27;ve tried. Hardly noticed I was using it and my skin felt tight after it dried. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this product. My skin feels &amp; looks smoother. Would definitely recommend this product!! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and am very pleased so far!  I am just using it nightly, not the recommended 2 times per day.  I can tell a difference in my skin already, not as many breakouts and wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  Like others, I am not crazy about the pump bottle, it seems like I either get too much or not enough.  I will definitely by this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to absorb, very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and I have to say it is a pretty great product. I like the fact you only need one pump of the product to cover the entire face, and it has a nice consistency that absorbs well. Not sure if it is making me yumi beautiful yet ;) but I believe with continued use I shall see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I have to say it is a pretty great product~It goes on super smoothly :) I love it &amp; I used it every night ~ Now, I can already see the difference !!  My skin looks so refreshed now. I will definitely buy this product again also highly recommend to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product and I&#x27;ve only had this item a few days, but so far, I love it! It feels good on my face. Time will tell if it makes a difference, but my skin feels really good after putting this on. I&#x27;ve had good hyaluronic acid and some not so good. and I believe this is one of the better ones. It is nice that it also has vitamin C serum as well. I believe I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Light enough you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on your face, and can see results and only been using about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this serum just last night and this morning and can already feel a difference!  It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this after receiving a discount on the product. I&#x27;ve been using it at night before going to bed and in the morning. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for the last two weeks. I have to say it&#x27;s helped with making my face feel softer and it seems a little brighter. Its a decent size bottle and a little goes a long way. I will definitely purchase this again as I like the results!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes your skin look soft.  Tried it for a few days and can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply, just a drop or two for the whole face .. i use it at night, follow by facial lotion.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has done wonders to my face. I suffered from dry patchy skin, and adult acne and this product has help so much with the improvement of my skin.  I have previously tired another Yumi product, Asteria and had amazing results. I decided to give the vitamin C serum a try and I&#x27;m so happy I did. My skin has truly never looked or felt better.  My skin is brighter and smoother.  I no longer have to wear so much makeup to try to cover up the unevenness of my skin. Its truly amazing. I would say if you have tried many other products and not had very good results, give Yumi Vitamin C serum a try.  I have paid double even triple for top skin care products  and never had such definite results like this.  The only issue I had was with the pump, when I go to use it, the serum shoots out, so I kind of have to cup my hand to catch it, instead of just being able to apply it to the tips of my fingers.</li>
            <li> love yumi products! I have noticed small lines disappear after two weeks of using, i cant wait to see what the next two weeks will do!</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry skin !!</li>
            <li> I love this! Use every night before I go to bed. My skin looks healthier</li>
            <li> Great product! Weird consistency kind of liquidy but dries quickly and does help with moisturizing</li>
            <li> very nice serum. good</li>
            <li> I have a good experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks~</li>
            <li> reasonable price. feels good, use it every day. skin feels smoother .</li>
            <li> I love these products, they are awesome and have become my favorite. Leaving my skin clean and smooth</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on.  I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin yet, but it is too early to see that maybe</li>
            <li> The product has good quality. good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Absorb easily.  Even the skin tone and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I LOVE YUMI PRODUCTS THEY ARE GREAT</li>
            <li> I found that the formula works very well, I will be a repeating customer once I start to get low.</li>
            <li> After using YUMI for about a week, I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It feels a lot smoother.  I have used other Vitamin C Serums in the past, but wasn&#x27;t as happy as I am with this product.</li>
            <li> Works wonders thanks!</li>
            <li> I received the product a few days ago and started using it right away. Although I do not have major wrinkles, I&#x27;m starting to have fine lines. I find that the serum is easy to apply and dries quickly, leaving my face feeling soft. My lines are already less noticeable, but the best thing about the serum is, again, how it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this every bought before I go to bed after I clean my face.  Since adding it to my nightly routine, my face feels tighter and looks younger.</li>
            <li> it really is great makes my skin feel so light</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had special improvement after use. Maybe, it needs time. I&#x27;ll be patient to see its effect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  It is thin and goes on smooth. It long after you put it on you can feel a real difference.  Would def purchase this product again!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I purchased it for my aunt, who is in her late 40&#x27;s and is very conscious of her aging skin. She was thrilled when I gave this to her - she scolded me for purchasing something so expensive for her, not knowing that I got it for a great price! This item definitely looks like something you would get in a high-end department store, so I love knowing that it&#x27;s offered here for only a fraction of the price. When I first gave it to her, I tried a bit of it on my own skin just to see how it felt. It glided on very smoothly and was so light and easy to spread that I likened it almost to a moisturizer more so than a serum. Most department store serums I&#x27;ve used before are not as easy to apply. My aunt has used it for about a week now and says that her face feels tighter, which is her main concern. As long as she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, so this was overall a great purchase for me!    I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> makes skin really soft!</li>
            <li> I recommend good product</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin feel soft after I&#x27;ve used it for a week. The shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful for my skin. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> really good , after I use, I feel better for my skin</li>
            <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
            <li> Yumi Vitamin C serum is very good!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this gift very happy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second night using it I feel my face soft I will update in a week or 2</li>
            <li> Love that its not greasy, but leaves my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> This was gifted to my mother. She loves it! Leaves her skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 days now. I have noticed that my skin feels softer to the touch now. I use this every night before I apply my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a bit thin and watery and I would have preferred a bit of a thicker consistency. I have not noticed that this has dried out my skin any as some other reviews had mentioned. I have noticed, however, it seems to sit on the surface of my skin and not soak in very well.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I could feel my skin tightening,  My skin looks smoother and clearer.  I used it on my 96 year old mother and she liked it too!!</li>
            <li> I received a replacement bottle approximately 1.5 weeks ago and so the review is likely premature in that Vitamin C serums generally take 4-8 weeks of consistent use to see results.  However, I wanted to chime in early because I do notice improvement in the brightness/tone of my skin.  I believe most folks will likely need to apply moisturizer after, it sets in fairly &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; within 5 minutes of applying - I&#x27;ve been waiting approximately 15 mins to apply moisturizer to avoid pilling.  I look forward to doing another review in approximately 2 months. Also, their customer service is pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;[I&#x27;m 48, acne prone olive complexion, T-zone as far as oiliness with some discolorations from blemishes and melasma - but I do luv that SUN!!]</li>
            <li> Lovely product...  I am a firm believer in Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid and love the combination in this Yumi serum...  I apply to dry, clean skin twice a day; at least I try!  I feel like this really keeps my skin exfoliated, moisturized, and bright!  I get compliments on how my skin looks clear and has a glow... The consistancy of the serum is light and unscented; it absorbs quicky, but I do let it dry before I continue with my moisturizers...  I have purchased this product twice...  Really love having it my regimen!  Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sticky. I just started using and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> vitamin C is great for the skin.  Definitely have to use a moisturizer on top of this. Fabulous price.  glad i was able to try this!</li>
            <li> I really love your product  (Yumi Beautiful Vitamin C Serum   I love how it makes my face feel And look.   Will definitely be ordering again..</li>
            <li> the product dries white on my face. I tried several ways of applying the product to try to prevent the streaks, but no luck. Fortunately the company quickly refunded my money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and could see the difference. I would like to try the other products.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging of this product. I especially love that it has the pump. However, the pump doesn&#x27;t always work as well as I hope it will. I read that you&#x27;re only supposed to use a little bit of the serum especially if you have dry skin like me (a little goes a long way after all). But every time I pump, no matter how gently I do it, it gives me way too much of the serum. Other than that, great product. I leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> It was OK. It started to irritate my face so I stop using it</li>
            <li> It is soft and not trouble</li>
            <li> This is a Great product !  It dries quickly, and I&#x27;ve noticed my dark spots and uneven skin tone  areas on my face, quickly fading.  I wait a few minutes after applying this serum, and put my moisturizer on top of it.  My skin does feel soft and supple.  Will gladly purchase again !</li>
            <li> BEST LOTION, LEAVES YOUR SKIN GLOWING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of vitamin c serum. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used yet. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My wife is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I want to recommend to others</li>
            <li> Recommended Cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;Well right on my skin&lt;br /&gt;Thank you good deals</li>
            <li> So refreshing please go out and get this product</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used very long yet. But it feels great, feels refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product,and I love it I like the way it feels on my face,it fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Just started using few days ago..feels good. Not fair to say more until I try longer. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few times. It seems to really firm my facial skin. It is smooth and feels great. Im sure using this over time will really make a difference in the eye wrinkles and fine lines. I would recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> Disappointed, only dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this serum. It absorbs quickly, works well in combination with my moisturizer and it brightens my skin when it is dull.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My face looks more firmer and youthful.</li>
            <li> love this has really helped even my skin tone</li>
            <li> For me the best&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> For me the best&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> When I take it, there are something white in my face. I don&#x27;t know whether the serum is good for my skin or not yet. Anyway it is apperant that the serum is not good for daytime use.</li>
            <li> Love it. In my second tube and is great to have some glow back in my skin.</li>
            <li> i received this product from tomoson.com for testing and reviewing purposes. this serum made my rosacea flare up so bad. i woke up the next morning and i had new bumps and my face was redder than normal.</li>
            <li> It feels nice after applying the serum on my face, and the smell is not that strong. great deal. thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week since I received and started working using the Yumi Vitamin C Serum.  The first couple days I thought it made my skin a little dry. Thought my skin was looking brighter. After about  4 days it wasn&#x27;t so overly dried out and I also noticed that the two lines on my forehead were almost gone. I will continue to use this product and hope to see even better results as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Keep my skin moisture all day&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product, it is well packaged in a pump bottle that performs well. It leaves the skin feeling very soft and silky. The only downside for me is that the serum is very watery and if you are not careful it will drip off your fingers as you are trying to apply it. If this serum could be thicker, it would be so very much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this product at such a great deal.   It is nice, clear, non-irritating and lists awesome ingredients.  It absorbs quickly into the skin and is not oily.  The design is appealing and the size is reasonable  although I wish it was bigger as I have been using it every day  and would like it to last for a long time...  So if I had to say what could be improved, not much besides  it is a bit thin and more of a clear gel than very botanical.  I love fruits and herbs so would not object to lots of that too.  I can tell it has Aloe and Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C plus  which are all desirable ingredients for many these days.  It fits a good niche as a facial gel and in combination with  some of your other favorite products it is a desirable add on.  Thanks. I hope it works to rejuvenate too, it refreshes for sure.  I have not taken it long enough to comment on anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, quality made.  Works well!  I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
            <li> ok not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Makes face a little dry. Will have to wait and see further.Sticky too</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> ok but wouldn&#x27;t order again,  felt nice and tight when first applied but didn&#x27;t last long.  Betty</li>
            <li> This serum is so great! It leaves my face feeling soft, and helps lock in the moisture, during these cold winter days.</li>
            <li> Good but not great to much alcohol in product no results on face too soon since purchase</li>
            <li> I love this so much!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very well designed; the serum is watery, yet POWERFUL on moisturizing. Unlike some other sticky Vit. C &amp; hyaluronic serum (my previous one is OZ Naturals), Yumi provides watery, non-stick (so that you don&#x27;t feel like to wash your hand) solution on moisturizing facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I&#x27;m too young to say anything on anti-aging since I don&#x27;t have any wrinkle... yet. Hopefully my ongoing moisturizing work can keep my skin tight and save me from wrinkles in the future!&lt;br /&gt;NOTE2: Although I didn&#x27;t pay attention on anti-aging, I can assure you that keeping your skin moisturized would definitely make you look younger!</li>
            <li> I love it! My skin looks and feels so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the yumi I on my face. Light and my make-up goes on smooth.I am going to definitely share this product with others.</li>
            <li> Feels Sooo good on your face!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great customer service! I love the serum it helps hydrate my skin especially up in Alaska where it&#x27;s cold and dry! I would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I love that it leaves my skin feeling slightly refreshed and not tight or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s so lite and silky drys smooth. Great product and I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It made my face feel great!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it!!! She loves the way her skin felt after applying the serum. It was super soft, and she felt like it just looked better, it has more of a glow to it.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product so far, but haven&#x27;t been using it long. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, which is a major plus. Smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Like product, use nightly.</li>
            <li> irritated my face, but I am very sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gummy when it&#x27;s cold but i am looking forward to the benefits.</li>
            <li> The first day of trying this product I could immediately see results.  This is a must have for every woman.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this product. The only problem I&#x27;m having is I don&#x27;t know who to contact with questions on using it. I was wondering if you wear this alone or under other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this it makes your face feel so soft and it does not irritate your skin and i have really sensitive skin it does not have a nasty its a ok smell  any one looking for a really good serum i recommend you trying this out&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for free in an exchange for my thoughts</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this serum.I love the fact that I can get my VitaminC and Hylauronic acid in one serum and not have to make 2 seperate purchases to get what I need for my skin to be at it&#x27;s best.Thank you YUMI for providing such an excellent line of skincare.I am now buying it again because it works so well!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I can see and feel my skin getting smoother as I keep using it.  I have acne prone and combination skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out so far.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I made my skin looks smooth and help my pore small. I love the design too</li>
            <li> I got this product for my wife and she has been very satisfied with it.  She has been using it for about a week now and has noticed her skin looking smoother.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times, but it just felt like it was sitting on my skin and not absorbing. Also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the sticky feeling..3 Stars though as Yumi does have great customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Sorry, couldn&#x27;t get past the chemical smell. Don&#x27;t know if it actually works.</li>
            <li> I received this product acouple days ago and I&#x27;m always very iffy on trying new things on my skin because I have VERY Sensitive skin. So I tried it over night on my hand first and OMG! Instantly my hand was so much more smoother then the other, but still wanted to test it through the night to see if I&#x27;d get a reaction of any kind and to my surprise I didn&#x27;t! I then went ahead and tried it over night again but on my face. Woke up with thee softest baby smooth skin! I absolutely love this stuff and will be buying again once I run out!</li>
            <li> This product works and works well. Its easy on my occasionally troublesome skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to pregnancy, my skin all of a sudden became dry.  I put this serum on and instantly felt the difference.  The dry areas on my face became supple and stayed that way for hours.  It&#x27;s light and not sticky, plus a little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been applying it in the morning and at night and it keeps my skin hydrated. Love it so far!</li>
            <li> I used the Yumi serum for the crows feet around my eyes and with in 3 days I saw signs of improvement.  I like the way it feels when applied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through a deal that was shared on instagram, so I got a great deal on it! What really drew my attention is that it&#x27;s made with organic extracts. I&#x27;m always looking for organic skin products, so it was nice to run into this one! I ordered it before Christmas, but want allowed to open any of the packages until then lol, my hubby is a stickler. Anyway, I finally got to try it out! I&#x27;ve been using it for a buy over a week, and I can definitely see the difference. When I put it on, it feels so gentle, and leaves my skin very smooth. I have acne scars, so I can&#x27;t wait to see if it will really help with those after long term use.    The only thing I&#x27;m not super songs on is the packaging. I can&#x27;t really get the exact amount I want out. The way the pump is required me to pump an entire \\&quot;serving\\&quot;. I just wish I could sometimes get a little bit more, instead of a whole squirt. This definitely wouldn&#x27;t keep me from buying it in the future though!    **** Update****    I&#x27;m no longer as impressed with this product as I started out. After extended use, it kind of fizzled out. The first few times I used it my skin would become very smooth shortly after application. That&#x27;s no longer the case. I don&#x27;t see the smoothness I saw at the beginning. Maybe my skin was in shock for the first few applications. I also became as annoyed as can be with the pump. My face requires 1.5 pumps, but I&#x27;m forced to use 2 because of the way it&#x27;s made. I&#x27;m left with product in my hand and it won&#x27;t last as long using  more than I need.    Another thing that bothered me was that when I ordered this product (at a very steep discount, might I add) it said 14 Organic Extracts in the title. However, nowhere in the product description, or the ingredients on the bottle does it say organic. This is probably what put me off the most about the product. Does it have organic ingredients, or doesn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;d like to know what I&#x27;m putting on my face, and I purchased this product and gave it a try for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> finally after being completely sick this morning i got a chance to try this product and i have to say i am amazed the aloe help sooth my skin from the red patches i had and the vitamin c did not irritate my skin like i was expecting it to do! I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better serum to use not only after being sick but after washing my face this morning, surprisingly it had no smell this had me really confused specially since aloe does have a tiny hint of smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This serum doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, or sticky at all. I&#x27;ve been using it overnight and I wake up with very soft skin even during these winter temperatures where my skin normally becomes dry. With a bit moisturizer in the AM, it&#x27;s the perfect combo.</li>
            <li> Great serum. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Actually ordered a second one yesterday to give to a friend. Would definately recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days but I really love the fresh feel I&#x27;ve had from it in the mornings. It shoots out of the squirty fast and it goes on very smooth. I&#x27;ve only used it at night so far to slowly introduce my face to new product and my face has looked very smooth and refreshed in the mornig. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Vitamin C serums.  Price ranging from $140 to $16.  This product compares to the ones I have used on the upper end of the price point.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to see the benefits of Vitamin C.  The price point on this product is hard to beat.  The percentage of Vitamin C in the product is also on the upper end.  This will now be my go to Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> a bit watery, but did a great job adding moisture to my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for a whole week, and I can confidently say that this product really is improving my skin and adding all the extra nourishment I needed. My favorite thing about this serum is the ingredients; vitamin C, aloe vera, hyaluronic acid and antioxidant among others. This is my first time using a serum of any type on my face and so far I feel it&#x27;s hydrating, and leaves my skin glowing.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or oily at all. Also, there is no smell to it like some people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon Prime shipping. It&#x27;s always nice when products I want to try offer that. This is a very nice bottle and packaging looks perfect. The product feels very nice on the skin and I&#x27;m glad I tried it. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I use it before sleep and my skin condition becomes so good~~~recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product but I feel like it just made my skin dry. I will continue to use it before I moisturize and hope that will make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried out this product for approximately a month now and I am very pleased with the results-- softer skin, my skin tone is greatly improved and even, lines have softened.  I was looking for a product with natural ingredients and Yumi Vitamin C Serum does more than fit the bill.  A little bit goes a long way, another plus!  I will continue to enjoy using this product indefinitely and look forward to continued improvement in the health of my skin... Thank you Yumi!</li>
            <li> I really like this Serum.  It feels like it is firming my skin the moment I put it on!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this serum and uses it often. I can&#x27;t speak to the results yet, but a happy wife &#x3D; a happy life...so I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars all day long.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Use it everyday ! Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> “Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid and 14 Organic Extracts” is one of my most favorite serums I have tried I am not telling you this because of its nice package, I have many reasons to tell you that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it has such great antioxidant ingredients including:&lt;br /&gt;♦Pomegranate&lt;br /&gt;♦Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;♦Blackberry&lt;br /&gt;♦Cranberry&lt;br /&gt;♦Acai Berry&lt;br /&gt;♦Goji Berry&lt;br /&gt;♦Noni&lt;br /&gt;♦Kale&lt;br /&gt;which can fight free radical damage, minimize the effects of environmental stressors on skin, reduce the appearance of aging, hydrate and infuse a wholesome and healthy glow. I started to apply it on my super dry skin 3 weeks ago at nights after removing my make up. It is super light and absorbs into my skin instantly which is very nice. It makes my skin softer, fresher, brighter and smoother. Plus, I feel my skin hydrated and also tighter than before. My skin is super dry and some products make my skin even drier but this one didn’t which is a good point of it. It works very well with my moisturizer in the morning and my BB cream on top of it. I feel that I am 25 again! ;)</li>
            <li> This feels so light and absorbs into my skin instantly. Love that there is no scent too!</li>
            <li> Its nice Doesn&#x27;t burn or anything. Just hasnt done much. need to continue to use</li>
            <li> Have not noticed a difference in my face yet (been using for 3 weeks). But will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> I was always so hesitant to try anything for my skin. But my face is screaming for help. It has uneven skin tones with oily T-zone. My face looks blah, to be honest. So i thought of using this product. Now it looks healthier and I cannot be anymore happy. It just looks so soft and even, healthy and it seems I am glowing! I love it!</li>
            <li> This cream feels nice!  I am currently using it and it makes my face feel good after I apply it.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month!</li>
            <li> This product is fragrance and dye free which is think is great for the skin. It tones and improves the appearance of my skin while moisturizing and keeping it soft.</li>
            <li> i love the yumi.  makes me look better.</li>
            <li> Awaiting good results.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  I have only been using the product for a few days,  so I cant tell if there is any results. Pro: no strong scent Con: feels sticky when first applied</li>
            <li> Best product.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> After using this product a couple of days I can already tell a difference. My skin feels softer and healthier. I was excited to try this out, being 26 I needed to start taking care of my skin and thought this product would be great. I was told by a girl who uses this product already that this one is great to start out with. She was not wrong, it is a really good product. If you are looking to start out with a product to help your skin, this is the one that you want. It is a really great product, I cannot stop raving about this product, you will not be sorry for buying this.</li>
            <li> Oh!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very goooooooooood!</li>
            <li> I love this item and how well that it makes my skin feel. IT also is brightening up my skin which is great!!!</li>
            <li> Surprise wow. good good :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the way my face feels just after a few days of using this product. I can feel my skin righting after I put it on in the morning and night. My skin looks radiant and not dull. Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after weeks of using this product!  I&#x27;m very happy with the results already.</li>
            <li> This is the first face serum I can honestly say I will buy again.  It feels so wonderful when applying and I swear my fine wrinkles have softened.  I am using it morning and night along with a moisterizer and using the two have made a difference I can see.  I waited several weeks before posting this review and yes, it does work.  It does not irritate or dry my face whatsoever.  I will be reordering this again.</li>
            <li> I love the product, makes my face feel wonderful. Once you apply it a few times, you can def. feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this on my skin. My skin is looking brighter and more healthy</li>
            <li> very nice. its good for me!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on your face</li>
            <li> Love this stuff ! My skin looks super! My sister commented that the wrinkles around my eyes are gone! I am 45 and am hooked. I use the youth serum too.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! Made my skin so soft!! Love the product!!</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> I use it at night and in the am, I&#x27;m liking the results</li>
            <li> This is fresh and good.</li>
            <li> So excited to try this and at a great bargain I might add! Received it promptly and have been using it regularly for 3 days now...skin feels so soft after and absorbs into skin very quickly with no sticky residue and no irritation.</li>
            <li> good~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;fast shiped..</li>
            <li> After a short time of use, I cannot speak on whether or not the anti-aging claims of this product are true, however I can confidently say that if you have acne-issues and avoid vitamin C products due to the risk of breakouts, this might be a great product for you to try. The ingredients are fantastic, the lack of fragrances and dyes make this a great option for sensitive skin, and the consistency feels refreshing and hydrating rather than heavy and oily. I even used this serum on the backs of my hands and I&#x27;m genuinely amazed at how soft and smooth they feel immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this serum up to this point, and I will continue to incorporate it into my skincare routine to see it&#x27;s long-term effects!</li>
            <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight serum with a wonderful citrusy scent! I love all of the quality ingredients in this product, and it makes my skin feel youthful! I used this over the past month, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks so bright and youthful... very happy to have received it for review.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, so the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> Smells great, the consistency is nice not sticky. Gives my face a nice glow</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a difference in my skin, but so far it has been a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on my face. I use it every morning under make up and it&#x27;s been good.</li>
            <li> I am totally enjoying my Yumi Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid and 14 Organic Extracts, I especially like adding a little spritz to my hair for extra shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> This totally resurfaced my face - and gently! I didn&#x27;t have any peeling but when I washed my face I was able to &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; the dead skin off, revealing younger skin underneath. I only use natural products, and sometimes the efficacy isn&#x27;t what you would hope for. This product is great b/c it&#x27;s natural AND incredibly effective. My skin&#x27;s tone and pore size has significantly improved. I&#x27;ll buy this again!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, my face is soft and the fragrance is delightful.</li>
            <li> This is first time I use this product. I really like it for now. It makes my skin soft and smooths.  Update: My skin absorbs it well, so from 4 stars to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I expected it to work a lot better</li>
            <li> I liked a lot.  Smaller pores, softer skin, and slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> The product was slightly stickier  than I liked, took a little more rubbing/dryibut other than that I really like it.  My skin feels youthful and more refreshed.  Overall, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this product but it&#x27;s hard for me to give a good review because I have very dry skin. To be honest with you I use a serum from Trader Joes that is only $9.99 and it makes my skin feel much better than the vitamin c serum you sell. I wish I could give a better review but being honest I can&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too oily and suitable for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again next time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I like to wear this under my normal moisturizer.  I alternate this with the anti aging serum morning and night.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, is not sticky.  A+++</li>
            <li> Just received this in the mail and am excited to try this product! Super fast shipping makes this a plus! I have friends that have used this product and said it makes their skin feel so hydrated and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Wonderful deal compared to store prices</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin feel tighten and smooth after use. Will recommend to my family and friend for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I am loving it! My skin feels so smooth and soft! I&#x27;m 45 and although I have been moisturizing for years I can definitely feel a difference using the C serum and it&#x27;s going to continue to be a part of my daily routine.  Thank you Yumi!</li>
            <li> It is sticky and stings the skin a bit when you put it on and it has not seemed to make any real difference to my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! My skin feels so refreshed as soon as it goes on!</li>
            <li> Works amazing well! Love this product</li>
            <li> Received my serum today. First impression, it&#x27;s a bit sticky but once it dries the feeling disappears. No sting on my face. After application my skins feels dry so I am not sure my regular moisturizer will work. I will update after a few more days of use.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am over forty years of age. I have good skin. I do have slight lives around my eyes..I have purchased this product to reduce those fine lines. I just started using it so I haven&#x27;t seen improvements after just a few days. I will do a follow up review after using it for a longer period. However, I love the way this makes my skin feel. It makes my skin very soft. This product has little to no smell. This is good for those with allergies or sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li> This light gel serum goes on smoothly and quickly soaks in and dries to a matte finish. Vitamin C is wonderful for evening skin tone and helping fade scars and dark spots. I can already see an improvement. The additional ingredients in this serum make it a wonderful preparation for your moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Even use around my eyes. Highly recommend for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum that accentuate  youthful skin. I&#x27;m receiving so&lt;br /&gt;Many compliments after using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is best used overnight.  It is not good for use before applying makeup as it tends to sticky, and peel off.</li>
            <li> This is YUMMY stuff for my 50 year old face! love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! I&#x27;m on my second bottle..</li>
            <li> I have only been using for 1 week and can see a difference.  My skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> I have not used this for a long enough time, but I like how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My skin gets smoother and my wife likes it too</li>
            <li> I got this product on the recommendation of a friend. My skin can go from very tight and dry to slightly oily. I can use this product on my face and not have it get too shiny. Feels light and airy.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  Goes on great, no funny smell and absorbs beautifully into the skin.  Why the 4 stars then?  Two words:  the pump.&lt;br /&gt;At times it &amp;#34;spits&amp;#34; out the product causing it to fly into the air...I make sure to wrap my hand around the pump so as not to lose any of the product.  I have noticed a visible difference in my skin  - my dark spots are fading somewhat and my skin looks more radiant to me.  Overall, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I use it in the am since i have a night time serum i use. Gentle on my face and feels good. i wait a good 5 min before i put lotion over it.</li>
            <li> great serum, love the benefits of vitamin C</li>
            <li> I had a allergic reaction to this product. My skin is usually not sensitive to products so I was very suprise. I gave it to my sister to use and she liked it. She had been using it for about 1 month now. She had notice some changes, but nothing drastic. Overall, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This product will truly make your skin feels so supple and you could notice a glow in your face right away.I have been using this product for a short period of time but I can feel and see the difference right away.A lot of  ingredients in this product are organic and surely works. If you have any questions they have a very supportive customer service people.</li>
            <li> Honestly I thought it was not as smooth feeling as I thought it would be and also was a little drying to my skin and kind of like alcohol.  If I hadn&#x27;t thrown the box away, I would have attempted to return it.  I was disappointed.  Sorry :(</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product overall! As others have mentioned it is a little watery and does make skin momentarily sticky. However, it brightens skin and does reduce appearance of small wrinkles! I was amazed at how much better my skin looked after only a few days!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for his Christmas present she is going to love it! Came fast and it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Yumi sent me this serum to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I am already happy with the results.  It&#x27;s a super light weight formula so it absorbs really quickly.  I have been using it all over my face, neck and decollete.  It has made a few of my lines a little less obvious and it has also helped lighten some of the spots I have on my face.  I have made it a part of my morning and evening skin care routines!!</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to do a quick thought on this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I love it, there is no smell and it feels super great on my skin. I have used it twice and feel my skin tone got lighter and is smoother. I am going to continue using this product for a week and then update this as I go along&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xoxo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sia I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> This a great serum for people that suffer from dry flaky skin. My face feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about three days now night and day and I am really liking the product. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, goes on smoothly and leaves the skin feeling very soft and moisturized. I have never tried aloe on my skin before and so far I am really liking it. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, as she is always looking for anti-aging products.  She loves it!  She has been using it for about two weeks now, and can already see and feel a noticeable change in her skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product other than the texture. It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, &amp; seems to help with the dry spots on my face that the cold weather is causing. The texture reminds me a bit of spit though. :/ It just throws me off.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my skin feel firm and I actually felt this product working. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> First time use this product, feel pretty good, easy to apply and absorb to skin.</li>
            <li> I only used it for a few days but so far I have no bad reaction yet, it was light and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I put this on under my regular moisturizer and I can tell the different in my skin. It&#x27;s a lot more supple.</li>
            <li> So far love the way it makes my skin feel. Not fan of make up but still want a glow. Gives me the glow I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I ravished this bottle 2 days ago and used it last night.  My honesty opinion on this product is that it&#x27;s ok.  For a serum is not as thick as I am use to all serums are.  I have super dry skin and it only helped a little bit.  I skin still stayed dry after it soaked into my skin.  I reapplied more and still got the same results.  I will try it a few more times I hope it changes the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels using this product!  I have recommended it to many of my friends</li>
            <li> I like it. It feel nice my skin is very sensitive. I have been using for a week now. I will give more update.</li>
            <li> It is good to have protector in iphone 6 plus. Now, I won&#x27;t have a dirty screen and take time to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;I order this for my grandma and my grandma loves it. My grandma feels comfortable to use it. I recommend Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid and 14 Organic Extracts.</li>
            <li> Love this skin serum! Within a week I can see a difference. The product is so light that you cannot feel any film after the application. I believe it is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Had amazing results! It quickly removed the dark saggy bags under my eyes and replaced it with youthful healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Made a great gift for MIL! I know she will love the quality.</li>
            <li> Yumi has done it again with this super amazing serum!  I immediately felt the benefits on my face.  It was softer, smoother and much more radiant as soon as I applied it!  I will continue to use their amazing line of products...thank you Yumi Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li> I really like that this is a pump, makes for a very easy application.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week, once at night because I have sensitive skin - but so far I haven&#x27;t had any reactions. I love how quickly it absorbs and how soft my skin feels after using it!  Plus the natural ingredients - can&#x27;t beat that! Definitely brings out a nice glow during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;m using right now and I like it! My skin feels soft and refreshed after applying this serum. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky and it&#x27;s not harsh at all. It&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C serum, it is so light and absorbs completely without oily residue. I really like the natural botanical ingredients  I have been using Yumi for a few weeks now and believe that my skin is more hydrated as a result. Caution: try not to get the serum in your eye, it stings!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple days and so far it seems to help. I purchased the products after reading the reviews and it seems to live up to the others reviews. I have noticed my skin is softer and not as dry as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it in my face. My face was too sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week, but I can already see the difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> this product is the best! I use it every night and i ca definitely see results! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product definetly will recommend I love it</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and soft the morning after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin felt after using the serum.  The serum brightened and made my skin looked more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little sticky after I applied it but nothing horrible by any means. I feel like I haven&#x27;t experienced a difference in my skin since using this product; however, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I&#x27;ll be sure to write an updated review. If this product works out like I hope I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is one of my favorite products as I age.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and the benefits of vitamin C naturally correcting the years of damage I have done to my face are wonderful!  Use it after red light therapy for an added punch.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin so soft for the entire day! The only thing I&#x27;m not really feeling about it is it&#x27;s pretty sticky at first so you have to let it dry completely before applying makeup. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! It gives you the nicest glow.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to help my dry face! I love it so far and its only been a few days!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel tighter on first use. Only negative thing I have to say is that it dries too fast.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it&#x27;s been helping my crazy acne break out.  I&#x27;ve been putting this on for the past month now and love it!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The serum comes in a beautiful container and the pump makes it pretty easy that you won&#x27;t use too much of the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;m not a fan. It leaves my skin feeling uncomfortably tight, something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other serums.</li>
            <li> Love this product more than I expected will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This serum is great.  My skin tone looks more even and brighter. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my face either.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love it !! My skin feel more softer .</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use it as a replacement of my moisturizer.  Well, it wasn&#x27;t as nourishing as I was hoping and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my skin is drier in the winter time.  However, it&#x27;s still a good lotion to use as a base to refresh my skin after wash and before moisturizer, and it does serve the purpose well. This is why I&#x27;m giving it a four-star.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I have had it about two weeks now and I&#x27;m pleased. Makes skin super soft. I love the scent and the fact that it dries so fast. Will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Skin gets better</li>
            <li> Excellent product made my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I love the way this made my skin feel</li>
            <li> My skin was dull, dry &amp; flakey. I was skeptical but decided to try this. My skin feels AND looks so much better. I&#x27;m hoping that it helps with my dark spots too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and I have started using serums and so far I have been acne free and I feel that my skin has more elasticity and has been cleared up. I use moisturizer after using this serum.</li>
            <li> This is a good product which makes your face look and feel healthy and revitalized.</li>
            <li> This serum works great without any side effects on sensitive skin.  First off the bottle is attractive enough to set out.  Using it is very easy with just a quick push will put a small amount in your hand.  I use 2 pumps for my face &amp; neck area.  Over the past month I have noticed a smoothness in my skin even though we are in the harsh winter dry months here in PA.  The serum does not have an overbearing smell like some others.  Also a plus due to applying to my face/neck area, my hands nor cuticles have not cracked this winter either.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
            <li> I loved this product!!! Felt good on face and made my skin look good! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product works great so far and even after one application I could tell a small difference already which is incredible. Loving it already. Will be recommending to family and friends for sure. Can&#x27;t beat the price for a serum product like this. Thanks</li>
            <li> This just came and i used it tonight . honestly i am in love it was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t stink. Im so happy !</li>
            <li> I think I bought well at a good price.. : )</li>
            <li> The elasticity of the skin will feel soft handsome face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would like to continue to try.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Not greasy or too thick!  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this with a discount code. I have only used it a few times but, I already notice a small difference in how soft my skin feels and its not really flaky anymore.</li>
            <li> Consistency is clear and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I&#x27;ve only been using this for one night so I can&#x27;t say anything about drastic change, I just love how it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Although I did not use cream yet .&lt;br /&gt;but, so fast shipping and item is very good&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feel. Not an oily product which i was concerned about.</li>
            <li> Face appears brighter and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin easily especially after wearing make up all day then scrubbing my face to get the makeup off. This product leaves my skin really soft, so much so that I had my husband feel how soft it felt. It leaves your skin feeling a little tight after it dries, but it is great for right before bed. Definitely love this product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and gives skin a tight, toned feeling. Definitely need a good moisturizer to go with it. One pump is more than enough to cover entire face.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this as diligently as I should but I actually believe I&#x27;m seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Vitamin C serum is perfect on my face. Thanks Yumi Beautiful~~~!!!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  It&#x27;s a little bit too runny for me,  but at the same time it also absorbs well.</li>
            <li> 5 stars! im 38 years old, this is very good item to me.</li>
            <li> my wife tried this serum for several weeks and she feels her skin is not as dry as before.</li>
            <li> nothing special so far.  kind of sticky.  Feel a little mislead but maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough time.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize</li>
            <li> I was looking for more of a moisturizer. I definitely think this is a good product just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my skin, but some fading of dark spots.  The bottle makes it hard to use just a small amount.</li>
            <li> These are a really great value and a great quality product. You get a ton of then for the price, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about using them sparingly</li>
            <li> Very nourishing.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin. My skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li> Texture is good.&lt;br /&gt;There and whitening. There was no trouble since I using one month.&lt;br /&gt; It has a little whitening effect to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good item.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum! Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this serum a lot. It is perfect for night serum. I feel like my skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive , dry skin and KP. I currently use Ava Anderson Non-Toxic skin care but needed something to add to that. This serum is fantastic! I use two small pumps on my fingertips and apply after/on top of my daily moisturizer. Even with only one application, my skin was softer. I use it 3-5 times per week and within 2 weeks, there is a visible improvement in fine lines and overall tone of my skin. I have been so hesitant to try new products due to sensitivities and allergies. I am so pleased this works so well!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  Can be used on face and neck which is perfect</li>
            <li> This product is good.  It&#x27;s a little running.  I usually put it on before bed and my face is really soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> This run out pretty fast, i cant really tell if i see results</li>
            <li> Finally though, I&#x27;ve found a super fast absorbing serum and that is Yumi Beautiful&#x27;s Signature Antioxidant Skin Care Serum. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick this serum absorbed the first time I used it - it took less than a minute! I could move on with the rest of my routine quite promptly.&lt;br /&gt;This clear lightweight serum contains Vitamin C, Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, as well as a variety of fruit extracts, all to help you get brighter more youthful skin. Two pumps of this serum can cover your whole face so this bottle will last a long time! But really, the distinguishing factor that sets it apart from other serums is its fast absorption rate. Received this product for free to review.</li>
            <li> I have used this item and haven&#x27;t realy seen any major changes.  It feels like a glue substance you are applying to your face.  Does tighten the skin when dry and will be a noticeable shine.  Nothing negative to say.  I had no side effects to the product.  Its packaging was very generic looking.  Plastic container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful thing. My wife is very satisfied and pleased when she got this serum. ~~~So, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> IT PUMPS OUT WAY TOO MUCH! ALMOST !/4 THE BOTTLE EACH PUMP :( Maybe I got a bad pump - Serum is amazing 5 star for it!</li>
            <li> I love Yumi products! This product is worth trying!</li>
            <li> very good essencial serum! no smell or irritating sensation. my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel a little tight but other than that, it feels softer &amp; is glowing!</li>
            <li> I bought several Serum last times and this one is best among the others.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment and Good Quality. 가성비 좋아요 :D</li>
            <li> good, Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. No more dryness in the areas that I had problems with. This is a great product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an anti-aging serum that had plenty of natural ingredients in it and that would re-texture the skin on my face.  This product has done just that.  I have the oily T-zone and very large pores.  This serum has shrunk the size of my pores, giving my skin a very smooth look which looks great under the airbrush makeup I use.  It&#x27;s pretty strong too.  I have sensitive skin and found I could not use this in the morning AND evening as the package instructed.  It dried out my skin too much and irritated my cheeks.  I only use it at night now and it&#x27;s perfect.  I figure it can do it&#x27;s thing during my rejuvenating sleep.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and hope to continue using it for a long time to come.  Also came within a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> LOve this! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month consistently and see some great improvements on my skin!</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter after using this product for a couple of weeks. I will definitely be a repeat customer, and that doesn&#x27;t happen too often.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few weeks. My skin feels super soft and moisturized. Since we are in windy season, I tend to get dry skin on my face but since using this product, my face isn&#x27;t suffering the dry skin it usually does. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love how effective this is, i see results just a week of using it. I have used YUMI products before and i have always liked the products.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. I don&#x27;t know much about these products but she says it works very well!</li>
            <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and actually absorbs well into my skin and dries to make my face smooth and soft.  Been using it for about a week and have nothing bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> Skin feels firm and smooth after application!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling refreshed! :)</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty good. Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great item, just haven&#x27;t used in long enough yo notice a difference</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really love the packaging, it&#x27;s nicely designed. The first thing I noticed was that the pump isn&#x27;t as smooth to press down and once you&#x27;ve pressed it, too much product squirts out so that&#x27;s only main thing I wasn&#x27;t fond of. Other than that, it&#x27;s moisturizing, light and it feels nice to spread on the face because the serum is cold. You don&#x27;t need much product which is great. I recommend this to everyone who just wants to try out a new organic serum.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Light fragrance, not overpowering. I can already see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> By now, it works well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Yumi Beautiful serum product I tried. The first one is ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum. It&#x27;s effective and I love its smell so much. However, it&#x27;s a bit sticky.    The Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera is my 2nd try. It also has nice smell (light and refresh). I have been applying it on my face for a bit over a week. It has made my facial skin brighter and firmer. The best part is the non-sticky feeling. This is why I only gave ASTERIA Anti-Aging Facial Serum 4 stars but give Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera 5. More importantly, the pump/dispenser of this serum works much better. I can easily get the right amount out as I want. Overall I like both products. However, The Vitamin C Serum with Aloe Vera works better for me. I purchased another in case the first one run out. The only complaint is that Amazon shipped the 2nd bottle with my other orders with more protection. Therefore, the paper case of the serum got smashed. Fortunately, the bottle is not damaged.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half. First of all it is a clear gel like serum. A small amount goes a long way so I expect this bottle to last awhile. It has a faint but pleasant smell. Makes your skin feel so soft. Doesnt clog your pores at all. This is not just an anti aging product, this product can be used by people of any age. This will improve your skin. My skin is tighter. My skin is clearer and brighter, and so soft. Another thing I really liked was the packaging. Might not be important to some, but I liked the look of the packaging, bottle logo, etc. I think a basket full of yumi products would make a really great christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Look at those ingredients, whats not to love? Not greasy or overweight like most serums. Absorbs pretty quickly. Love the smoothness of my skin though out the day. Doesnt have an intolerable overpowering smell. Really good product.</li>
            <li> Smells and feel wonderful. So luxurious on my skin .</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used it every morning &amp; every night and could see a difference in a few days. Not only did it take care of dry spots under my eyes from tanning, I had wrinkles that have disappeared! the fine lines in my forehead &amp; around my mouth started going away I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would recommend this product to anyone. it soaks into your skin &amp; makes it soft &amp; glowing plus wearing makeup over it is no problem!&lt;br /&gt;Khris</li>
            <li> I received this serum to try and I am glad I tried it because it is one of the best vitamin c serum I have used it has improved the skin on my face it is so soft and smooth and seems to even be smoothing out wrinkles.The only thing I can say I don&#x27;t like about this is the pump style it squirts out to much product and I wish it had the dropper style.But that will not stop me from future purchase s because it&#x27;s a serum. I will be telling friends and family to try this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin once I started using this serum. My face is soooo soft and my skin seems to glow after I apply. I generally have very dry, coarse skin and I feel like this has definitely helped.</li>
            <li> I love this and the other Yumi products I&#x27;ve purchased. The formula in this treatment is wonderful. It softens and smooths my skin and is easy to apply. This works well with my regular moisturizer in the morning, and at night I use it with the Yumi Rosehip oil for extra moisturizing. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its an Amazing product. the Seller was able to answer all the questions I have. the product does make your skin looks smoother and Younger. I agree with other reviews that it gives an amazing result</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have purchased Vitamin C serums over $75 and this one works just as good if not better! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great quality like all YUMI products I have used.  My skin is softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with Yumi and their amazing products! This serum is no exception. It smells yummy and feels great on. My skin feels wonderful and I have noticed the dull look I hated has disappeared. I am so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> My skin started feeling dry and rough. I was using it in conjunction with moisturizer over it, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to counteract how much it dried out my skin. I liked it at first, because it seemed to firm my skin up, but then it became overly dry. I was only using it once every other day, to get my skin used to it, so I don&#x27;t think I was overdoing it.</li>
            <li> great product! great pricing and great value !</li>
            <li> I love a good skincare product, and liked the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid claims in this product. I added it on to my order and have been very pleased with this product.  It is a very light liquid serum that feels great when you put it on, and you can still feel the softness in the morning when you rinse it off.  After I use it on my face I rub a little on the back of my hands to help lighten a few dark spots. I would definitely recommend this product to fit in your current beauty routine. No tacky application or after feel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I  Have only used this product for week and can already see the difference in my skin.  I have sensitive skin so I am very particular with the products I use.  This product was easy to apply and did not irritate my skin.  My skin now has a heathy glow.  So glad I found this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer after one use! Love it so far :-)</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by skin and leaves skin feeling smooth! It does not have an odor that I&#x27;ve noticed. I apply this serum after I cleanse and tone my face. It dries absorbs fairly quickly before I move onto my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try at first (after I received my product) as I&#x27;m experiencing some facial skin problems due to pregnancy hormones. However, it does not have a negative effect on my problem patches at all, no irritation whatsoever. The only reason that I am not giving it a five star is that I don&#x27;t have visible damage to my facial skin so I cannot comment on whether it worked well as part of an anti-aging routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for four days now, applying once day after cleansing. This product makes my face feel very soft. I do apply a moisturizing cream in addition to the serum in the evening as I live in the northeast and the winter is very drying to my skin. I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel firmer and it has ease of application.</li>
            <li> it is good for my mom&#x27;s gift</li>
            <li> This is very good!! I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
            <li> Very good~&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much~</li>
            <li> Even better skin elasticity without trouble.and Aroma and good stickiness.I LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum! good texture, good effect, no trouble.</li>
            <li> I feel the skin become refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Invest for the skin. Will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and feel of this product on my skin.  Also, it is concentrated, so that a little goes a long way.  I expect that I will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> havent seen much of difference but the price was good</li>
            <li> Great Product. Very Good!!</li>
