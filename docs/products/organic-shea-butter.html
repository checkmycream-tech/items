            <li>I have been looking for a good product for my hair for years.</li>
            <li>I had already purchased from this vendor the ivory shea butfter, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>smell is good</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to mix it with a scented item as well.  </li>
            <li>Really good value.</li>
            <li>is a plastic container with that rich golden-yellow shea butter - the best quality in my book.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so strong!!</li>
            <li>nice and smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li>Great product, was very smooth not chunky</li>
            <li>I really love this product i use it on my hair and skin great product I recommend it</li>
            <li>this shea butter is excellent and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased with the texture and quality also the smell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I think the smell could be better , but it works great as a moisterizer</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller received my feedback and maybe even saw this review and responded in a very respectable way.</li>
            <li>It worked great for what I used it for :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to apply it right  when you get out the shower.</li>
            <li>Very pleased will order more!</li>
            <li>, good price,  smells kind of nutty and nice.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but still worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>

            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I get a great result manageable hair that I can easily detangle while still in the shower.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled it I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but my husband said he really liked it.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer available(I literally have tried them ALL) and its pure, no chemicals no B.S. and exceptionally priced and excellent quality...  5 star highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using shea butter on my lips for about 6 months and the results have been amazing</li>
            <li>I use it as a conditioner and my hair feels amazing after I use it.</li>
            <li>well then this is product is amazing.</li>
            <li>what someone bought this stuff from that was not in fantastic shape but this product from this company was and is in great shape.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing for your face.</li>
            <li>When I found it, it no longer had the amazing smell and texture that I remember.  </li>
            <li>This product does leave my skin smooth and feeling great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>(and it amazingly does not make me break out).</li>
            <li>The shea butter melts nicely when you rub it between the palms of your hands.</li>
            <li>When i am bathing, i dip it in a jar with warm water, by the time i finish bathing, it has softend up and its easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>It is really effective.</li>
            <li>Nice quality product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this</li>
            <li>smell did not like but it is good ... and many quantity ..</li>
            <li>The photo of this Shea Better is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonderful shea butter cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I use this butter for making my own home made Lotions and Balms .</li>
            <li>I wanted to make my own body moisturizer using this combined with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>but it did not work as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li>it feels good on skin and makes skin look healthy</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this product when I was watching some type of fashion video on Youtube with Amber Rose</li>
            <li>I make my own whipped shea butter</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for your skin and at such a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not buy another order with this kind of packaging.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, is creamy and feels nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li>kind of a smokey smell</li>
            <li>What kind of quality and customer service is that?</li>
            <li>All the nice lotions and creams have shea butter in them.  </li>
            <li>plastic food grade container which is nice,</li>
            <li>It feels nice</li>
            <li>But its kind of bleh.</li>
            <li>I liked this Shea butter</li>
            <li>Kind of like conola oil.</li>
            <li>i would mix it with shampoo and baby oil to make my own shaving cream or put it in my hair before bed.</li>
            <li>It is kind of stinky</li>
            <li>take a chunk and warm it in your hands, then apply.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the price.</li>
            <li>Because the  value is so good, I am using it more liberally than before and even my husband started using it as an aftershave cream to soothe his skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this Shea Butter to make my own lotion bars.  </li>
            <li>I find that for me it is superior to most store bought creams and keeps my skin hydrated in the winter.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered  this to make my own home made organic hand lotions and body butters.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotions, body scrub, etc</li>
            <li>stars for any brand or kind of shea butter for repairing chapped and damaged skin.</li>
            <li>it is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try to make my own lotion out of it, and I don&#x27;t want to got through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li>, I made my own hand salve with this</li>
            <li>The product was clean and felt great</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and plan to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I am a very happy customer and I will most certainly buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, not bad, just not anything special.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and makes your skin free great, but I prefer the Ivory Shea butter better.</li>
            <li>Helps prevent wind burn, keeps my hands and feet nice and soft and works great on the baby to prevent diaper rash!</li>
            <li>Good quality and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Great Price and the product was excellent as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Shea before, and it smells light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell of Shea Butter was also very strong and did not fade.</li>
            <li>i love it and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>This product does in fact leave your skin very smooth and hydrated and it does have amazing benefits</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much and it is VERY good as a sun blocker.</li>
            <li>This is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a nice slip, I was able to style with ease.</li>
            <li>massaged into fingernails and buffed, it lends a nice healthy shine if you do not use polish.  </li>
            <li>I liked being able to pick up hunks of it to use.  </li>
            <li>I just keep it in my room at room temperature or on top of a heat source and it warms to a nice manipulative consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all a suitable product though.</li>
            <li>that was cheap and really good.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my face is so bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter for my family&#x27;s skin care needs with great success.</li>
            <li>Used this stuff at night every day during my pregnancy and although I gained more weight than I would have liked (55lbs)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, but I sure won&#x27;t be using this kind again.  </li>
            <li>This method will help your skin absorb the shea butter more effectively without leaving your skin greasy.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for natural hair.</li>
            <li>My Mom liked it better than her blush brand lotion.</li>
            <li>This is much softer--like a bright gold play dough with a pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>We all have eczema, so it&#x27;s great right after showers.</li>
            <li>STRONG!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t lose a lot, and the seller was super nice and said they&#x27;re replace it!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, has a great consistency and arrived quickly and in good form.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shea butter!</li>
            <li>This was priced right and it has a pleasant smell and melted nicely.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter was in good and neat packaging and texture was rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited because it looked like a good product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great cream, really great stuff - but does not work to its potential if you are a hit and miss user...</li>
            <li>This is not the kind of shea that is smooth and supple and reduces between your palms into a warm softening oil....</li>
            <li>it works wonderful, good product also works well with other Ra cosmestics</li>
            <li>This product came exactly as described and I was really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>The best part is no crazy ingredients, 100% pure!</li>
            <li>My hands are also softer and my skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>(it is very smooth once your hands heat it when rubbing together) about twice a day.</li>
            <li>I bought two for the first time,  and now am buying 3 more , this thing is sooo goood AHHMAAZING!!</li>
            <li>I suggest placing it in some warm water if you want to apply it more easily, and also mixing it with a carrier oil (almond, avocado, castor, jojoba) for hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin after applying, its very smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>still using it cause I love the product.</li>
            <li>i love this product, so many reasons to use it.</li>
            <li>i also like the smell, most may not</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>that proved to be the most elusive ingredient in the recipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it with my fave lotion and it makes my sking even better.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>i LOVE SHAE BUTTER..  </li>

            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I can tolerate it, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>some may not like the smell but its okay for me...</li>

            <li>I love the product.</li>

            <li>I love Shea butter, I&#x27;ve used it for years now (hair, skin) and this one is fabolous.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure you can find which way you like to use it the most.</li>
            <li>I wish I had done more research beforehand.</li>
            <li>since I had never ordered it before, I started to do research what essential oils would best mask this smell.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with this purchase and I am using this head to toe.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>My skin was always glowing and my hair always looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m gonna have to order more.</li>
            <li>this one is a thousand times better, easier to mix &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Perfectly sized container for making up some lotions using essential oils.  </li>
            <li>but 1 is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Just love  this  product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my shea butter.</li>
            <li>This shea butter has many uses.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel great, and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference on how much lighter my stretch marks have gotten.</li>
            <li>wish packaging was better though.</li>
            <li>I love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth like butter, and has a warm smoky smell that I could inhale for hours.  </li>
            <li>now ex*- anyway she was asked what was some of her favorite make up and skin care products.</li>
            <li>I was dying to know this because I love this woman</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Today, my skin feels more moisturized and supple without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering every month:)</li>
            <li>I love this product but beware it comes in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>its smell is like peanut butter :)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product to be sold online.</li>
            <li>I use this one of all Shea butter&#x27;s most often</li>
            <li>Love using this in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Oil Coconut Oil (76 Degree) on skin and alone on scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the hydrating feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like overheated cooking oil as most reviewers mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth and creamy shea butter, this is it!  </li>
            <li>so make sure you wait a couple of minutes for your skin to absorb it before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>(although supposedly stretch marks are from hormones and no ointment is supposed to be able to prevent them).</li>
            <li>Great for your whole body, even your face.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not going to  pay more than I paid for the butter to return it.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this product is the smell...</li>
            <li>You can mix it with your favorite creams or use it alone.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it truly works wonders on my face.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the effects of the shea butter, I would buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend going to Coastal Scents and buying their shea butter, it&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li>I guarantee it&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many jars for family and friends.</li>
            <li>I think it works better on stretch marks than cocoa butter or bio oil.</li>
            <li>There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s Shea Butter, then I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to know why it wasn&#x27;t packaged better..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again unless they contact me with an apology and a promise to do a better job with packaging and labeling......</li>
            <li>It would be better as a bar so that you can rub it where needed.</li>
            <li>Is this product safe?</li>
            <li>Customer service was outstanding also when I had questions regarding use.</li>
            <li>This container lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>so I can get a bit more experience</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased both times</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and is working nicely in my balms!</li>
            <li>The african shea butter cream is the best body cream i&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>The most important part is that it moisturizes my skin and soothes my eczema!</li>
            <li>but I should have looked more closely at the reviews.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for most of my body.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that appealing</li>
            <li>I love, love this Shea butter.</li>

            <li>I use it for many of my DIY beauty products.</li>

            <li>I will keep using it though because I am sooo smooth!</li>
            <li>I very much love this shea butter</li>
            <li>The grains sit on top of your skin</li>
            <li>so I am sure it is not hardened shea butter.</li>

            <li>This truly made a difference to me, for most it probably will not.</li>
            <li>the top and moldy @ the bottom..</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the Shea butter, but its more than a nutrient for my hands/skin, its a mind soother as well.</li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more creamy.</li>

            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>and I just love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t pleased with it coming in a plastic bag instead of a container doubt I will purchase again</li>
            <li>using for years love this</li>
            <li>Love to smell it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>it would be Shea butter for sure.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>it will ball up and just glob on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>I use this for face and body and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter</li>
            <li>and though this is definitely not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, it still served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>My boo uses this on their curly hair and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>more.  </li>
            <li>While I may be able to attribute this to her just aging and moving out of that stage I used it on her bottom too.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I ordered 3 more!!</li>
            <li>and this product has provided the right amount of conditioning I needed, absorbs in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I tried this cream for three months and feel this one is pretty good and very comfortable when apply on the face.</li>
            <li>lotions.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very rich, moisturizing, and healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I originally bought shea butter to make my own chapstick.</li>
            <li>The price alone is great for what I received and this is the real thing, it is fresh, smelled so good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is some good stuff and cheap...received very fast.</li>
            <li>This feels so nice on the skin melts right in!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always about gaining big profits but gaining HAPPY &amp; SATISFIED customers!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>So beautiful and Soft like a feather</li>
            <li>This is the best shea butter I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>The shea butter goes on best if it is heated to liquid form, so I warm it with my blow dryer for a few seconds before applying it.</li>
            <li>There are many videos on YouTube that show how easy this is to do.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>But all in all, it came quickly and it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products for my beauty routine and this is a great gateway.</li>
            <li>Another all natural product great for all kind of skin try and see how much your skin will love it!Buy on amazon!</li>
            <li>sellers price is fantastic and I noticed the container right away, This seller has the GOOD STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes the skin very smooth and fantastic looking.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is the best thing ever for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, but I&#x27;m sure it works fine for others.</li>
            <li>(although I think that&#x27;s more due to genetics than this lotion) but it isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff!</li>
            <li>A really good amount of quality pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>He swears it is the best thing for his very dry skin.</li>
            <li>We keep our home very cool</li>
            <li>Not only do you feel more mosturized after using but the results give you a sense of confidence and truly make you feel beautiful.</li>
            <li>This product has been suggested by many as a great product for hair, but I think it helps more to keep the moisture in then actually moisturize.</li>
            <li>They even offered to send me another 4 containers in much better packaging for free....</li>
            <li>A great product for natural hair and body care.</li>
            <li>on smooth, just be sure to emulsify-- rub vigorously in your hands--</li>
            <li>I think this is a really good moisturizer, haven&#x27;t seen much fading yet of some marks I have.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is not unrefined, but it is good quality, and priced very competitively.</li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m loving</li>
            <li>and it was still so easy to use</li>
            <li>and I could easily scoop a bit into my finger and apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>because its so natural u do have to warm it in your hands to soften, but man once it goes on the effect is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>belly feels so good when I put it because It feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>I use it on a surgical scar that I purchased it for &amp; it is healing very quickly &amp; does not appear to be leaving a scar at all.</li>
            <li>It also melts in your hands for easy application.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to work with it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;ll be easy to apply on the skin</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>It came just as packaged and was easy to handle.</li>
            <li>its too strong</li>
            <li>The rancid smell was so strong it permeated all of the lotions I made -</li>
            <li>Good Shea Butter 100% Natural, not the most organic product out there</li>
            <li>Shea butter by itself has a strong scent and may no be appeasing to some.</li>
            <li>but I thought that the smell of this shea butter was a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>and i liked it very much</li>
            <li>It is pure clean and as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in a container with a lid that was VERY secure.</li>
            <li>I immediately experienced an intense burning sensation and then a bright red rash appeared.</li>
            <li>I am not one for lotions and poitions, but I have to say that this stuff is pretty dang amazing.</li>
            <li>When I first used it everything was nice.</li>
            <li>I get kind of \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; in the winter, and this Shea butter is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully for several beauty products I made as gifts.</li>
            <li>Really nice product and exactly as pictured and described.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time i was making my own batch of body butter.</li>
            <li>and it requires more work but its not a bad product.</li>
            <li>say it smells fine.</li>
            <li>smooth and easily applicable</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE EVERY MORNING OR NIGHT TO PROVIDE SMOOTH SKIN THAT GETS COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHERS.</li>
            <li>so i tried it on my face and it worked fine</li>
            <li>Easy, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>ordered It to go in DIY product...seem fine to me.</li>
            <li>cream turned out awesome and healed my eczema quite a bit until I ran out of the cream and been too lazy to cook more of it.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles, fine lines and scars repairing, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory,</li>
            <li>I use it as an eye cream, the fine lines have diminished.</li>
            <li>the Appearance of Acne Scars/Pits, Fine Wrinkles, Softens Skin, and Evens Skin Tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and is definitely authentic shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is super moisturizing at work!</li>
            <li>to which I quickly accepted!</li>
            <li>I received my African Shea Butter Cream very quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li>It smells just fine and does make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Honestly speaking I don&#x27;t like how this smells .I cannot use this product alone on my body unless I add some nice essential oils but its your choice if you can tolerate some strong smell then go for it .</li>
            <li>I do a little massage, the smell is not the best</li>
            <li>you can rub some away or pinch off little bits, and is really awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy this again - awesome for hair when mixed with oils.</li>
            <li>I mix this with a bit of coconut oil and it makes the perfect homemade lotion for super dry skin!!!</li>
            <li>And the size is huge compared to what&#x27;s offered in brick-and-mortars--</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly if you continue rolling it around in your hands.</li>
            <li>This is a golden color, most of the time it has been melted before placed into the jar.</li>
            <li>My primary use of this product is for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and beneficial Thank you and will I deal with you next time</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I heard that it helps to even skin tone, and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic for eczema.</li>
            <li>but i found that rubbing your hands together fast to get it warm and also wetting them w a bit of water to help distribute it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I primarily bought this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>his hair is so smooth, he cant stop running his fingers through his scalp.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Not only was the quality of the product great also the service.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was really hoping that I would be one of those thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin silky smooth and also helped out with a burn on my arm from the oven.</li>
            <li>this stuff is sooo smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I only use this on my body - it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>For my hair I use it to moisturize my edges and it also keeps my skin smooth ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands smooth and cleans up my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>Pull the bag off, wipe off the container and enjoy.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your skin so smooth and not just touch, you can see the smoothness...</li>
            <li>Smooth Shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is best used, I think, as a night cream because it is fairly heavy.</li>
            <li>Its great  for your skin and hair only in the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and chemical free.</li>
            <li>I like using it on my skin, but sometimes there&#x27;s a grainy texture that I really don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>Definitely light.</li>
            <li>Smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li>My skin was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It sort of smells like light scented cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I mix the shea butter with my face cream in the palm of my hand so it slides on smooth.</li>
            <li>It works well with cloth diapers as a light diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li>Kudos to you &amp; many years of success to you</li>
            <li>then you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>They turned out fantastic@@  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth once you take a dap of it.</li>
            <li>A PACK OF 12 FOR 24.77 WITH $25 FREE SHIPPING I BOUGHT A SHOWER COMB</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that this is unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It mixed well with the Coco butter, and turned out great.</li>
            <li>But it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I think it is the store brand copy of  Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing lotion, fragrance free.</li>
            <li>This is such a great moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>It is suppose to be smooth, not grainy.</li>
            <li>Because I have light skin, I have to put this on at night</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>in conclusion, this is GOOD for moisturizing and for fighting eczema, but I recommend you buy African Ivory Shea Butter (Cheaper + Better).</li>
            <li>It is also good for swelling,scars, i also put some on my lips,feet,body and after 1 use everything feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It melted a few seconds after I rub in my palm, moisturized my skin nicely and had very nice smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use before bed rather than applying right before going out.</li>
            <li>My brown spots from old acne marks were SIGNIFICANTLY reduced, I get compliments on my good skin all the time now.</li>
            <li>I really like this Shea butter, its rich, creamy and moisturises my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Okay so I have had eczema since I was 12, this product was awesome at reducing eczema inflammation for the first few weeks</li>
            <li>Great for my girls hair and many other things!</li>
            <li>and i think i&#x27;ll order more,, thank you very much for it</li>
            <li>Liked Shea Butter for moisturizing it high ...</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin super soft which is always good.</li>
            <li>I did later buy Grade A ivory Shea butter from Ghana (via Halal Today) and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>When i decided to try some DIY lip balm and face products the easiest way to buy was from Amazon, but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I love love love the African Shea Butter Cream.</li>
            <li>My fingernails seem stronger and they are not peeling so, for the first time since I was a teenager, I am able to start growing them out.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>i first bought this in nyc and paid more than twice for it.  </li>
            <li>the original container is not fancy and neither is the smell.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure i got rancid butter :</li>
            <li>Just sayin&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;It is almost unbelievable how wonderful Shea Butter is.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter and have gotten it for years, but this was my first time acquiring it online.</li>
            <li>so l get Excited</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gonna be fun!</li>
            <li>You do need to melt and dilute it (it melts in your hand), this I recommend unless you can get over the unique scent.  </li>
            <li>being said, I wanted to melt my shea in the original container.  </li>
            <li>First all, I love the texture.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with this brand/type shea butter and it has been working wonders for both my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>worth getting and using!</li>
            <li>it really really is a great product, and it lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li>but it comes out great and works wonders on dry skin.</li>
            <li>As the butter I received from this vendor is bright yellow, I no longer feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin on the feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>Works great for moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li>100% clean 100% care ,</li>
            <li>Also great for dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li>with the package and the container is nice, definitely reusable :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with this delicious heady natural scent - kinda smokey with some vanilla.</li>
            <li>It might be good to be used for skin which is much easier as rubbing the butter on skin is much easier than on hair.</li>
            <li>I have order four so far and planning on order more!</li>
            <li>It almost smells rancid, does not melt easy, and not from Africa - it says product of China right on the label.</li>
            <li>I know that color doesn&#x27;t matter, but if you are creating something that depends on a certain look and texture, perhaps consider purchasing a better quality ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s completely pure and keeps the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for 100% pure shea butter :)</li>
            <li>Very nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son&#x27;s eczema and our dry skin (we live in CO) and it works great!</li>
            <li>This is a great and a potent cream so necessary for the face to restore all the natural oils and make it look luscious!</li>
            <li>It is a little stinky, but I got over it because of how incredible his skin is.  </li>
            <li>I opened the bright yellow one.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting a &amp;#34;simply lovely&amp;#34; tub of bright yellow butter that smelt like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>It is bright yellow</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for use on my hair to mix with other oils to apply to my hair but it has also worked great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had never used shea butter before and was looking for something as an alternative to &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, which is FULL of chemicals and unnatural things that clog pores.</li>
            <li>DAILY WITH GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping the actual Shea butter is good quality...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and surprisingly, on the lid it gives several uses of the benefits of shea butter.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say for sure if this is Shea butter, as it did not arrive as pictured in the ad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, kind of feels like play doh.</li>
            <li>but you have to rub it in for the full moisterizing to take effect.</li>
            <li>The tub it came in was quite full as well.</li>
            <li>The package was full.</li>
            <li>Warmed, it handled better; but was very granular.</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I apply to my face, and massage in for a full minute or two.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to use too much as will get into your clothes</li>
            <li>True remedy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it full bore</li>
            <li>Works good for my hands, I have a situation in my hands, I tried differents creams but only this helps my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on harsh sunburns and it makes them go away and turn into a tan at an incredible rate, virtually overnight.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price and has e and d in it according the the label-more than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>No bad smell</li>
            <li>I use this from head to toe, I mean from my face to my heels literally and my skin has never been more beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes my skin so soft and the smell is not so strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but it ABSOLUTELY does work!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s STILL pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Very economical way to keep your skin moisturized, healthy and young!</li>
            <li>But other than that I am completly happy.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting super cream 100 % natural ok smeal and my hair just love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>The quickly diminished.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant nutty fragrance and immediately soothed my dry hands.</li>
            <li>It melted quickly.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to review this except to say that if you are looking for natural Shea butter this is a good product to have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the best i have purchased in the last ten years</li>
            <li>I have also used it for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and mild case of eczema.</li>
            <li>I am over 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li>The reason why I rated it at a 3 is because I didn&#x27;t see a tremendous difference in my skin after applying it for a month.</li>
            <li>I loosened and softened up the butter, first of all by running some hot water on top of the tub</li>
            <li>It did not melt quickly as others have stated.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to use on my sons stretch marks, the meds he was put on for his headaches has made him gain weight to quickly</li>
            <li>and I used it to prevent stretch marks while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>:) I really appreciate their response and and quick action to make things better.</li>
            <li>The butter seems to have a grainy texture at first, but as soon as it warms up on your skin it becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, and I would definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li>I have used shea butter before and have pretty much been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and I really hope they don&#x27;t all smell this strong.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with coconut oil, cocoa butter, sweet almond oil to make my own body and face lotion.  </li>
            <li>I normally use neutrogena for sensitive skin but it doesn&#x27;t help as nearly as good as shea butter..</li>
            <li>Ok first of all it arrived fast but it has no smell to it</li>
            <li>the product overall is pretty good.</li>
            <li>i have used shea butter that was processed before but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try since i have had problems w my combination skin which is also very sensitive to most products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for dryness!!!</li>
            <li>And I love that its all natural!</li>
            <li>I run out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>I love using natural products and this Shea butter didn&#x27;t did not disappoint me!</li>
            <li>The gold and ivory shea butters are both shea butter, but the ivory is more creamy and effective against eczema, it&#x27;s also less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the black soap is by far the best soap I have ever used</li>
            <li>It is very greasy and smelly and the color is less than ideal.</li>
            <li>Very nice consistency, unlike one I previously ordered from another seller.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I ordered the product based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Its great products for my hair and stretch marks but smells so bad lol</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my face (apply lightly) and really see an improvement.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the benefits of this Shea Butter, it is real.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is very creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I finished the entire thing in 2 months time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle product, but my skin is indeed more supple and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Nice container, melts smoothly and serves as an excellent base for our DIY shaving cream and lotions.</li>
            <li>Unless you have something else to put it in, it&#x27;s worth paying for the package, in my view.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more manageable, easier to style, and quite soft.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll make sure to read about that part if it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much worth</li>
            <li>Fresh out the box.</li>
            <li>it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>when used regularly, this is extremely effective in softening skin...</li>
            <li>it was in a larger container kind of lumped in there and</li>
            <li>It was golden and in a container like the picture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer, fresher, and it is clearing up nicely which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>More clear..</li>
            <li>Fresh and nutty, smooth, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>No real negatives, good product.</li>
            <li>I love the benefits of this product but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li>my skin is soft and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li>When i used it overnight i liked it the next morning but with my routine i shower in the mornings</li>
            <li>I just started making my own lip balm and such.</li>
            <li>I make my own deep conditioner with avocado, shea butter, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>It make your skin look glowy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the natural feeling on this shea butter.</li>
            <li>The shea butter alone has a nice nutty earthy smell that can be blended well with essential oils.</li>
            <li>For a natural product it sure beats my skin up.</li>
            <li>but instead I got two nice containers of \\&quot;African Shea Butter 100%</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it absorbed faster.</li>
            <li>I got this to go to a more natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I feel it works better than pertroleum jelly at keeping their skin clear.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what keep it fresh, To eliminate the greasy look</li>
            <li>As expected, good quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I mix with a lighter oil such as olive or safflower to make it smooth on better.</li>
            <li>I mean, it works but after purchasing better quality Shea butter (available on Amazon), I realize how inferior this kind is.</li>
            <li>I also put a little dab in my palm and mix it with my liquid foundation with very nice results.  </li>
            <li>and it was full of bacteria ( black spot every where ) l didn&#x27;t expect the Shea butter that way because before l order l reed the comment and at was so good</li>
            <li>This was a great product; shipping package was a plastic container--sealed good; will definitely order again; I use raw shea butter as a moisturizer on my face and my body; very seldom do i wear makeup</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this shea butter because it&#x27;s pure and natural, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the very strong smell.</li>
            <li>It holds in the moisture well and adsorbs into her skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter arrived quickly and is amazing on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought shea butter before from other places and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Not too much  and in a nicely accessible tub.  </li>
            <li>Just be prepared to have slimy skin, other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li>It will melt right away.</li>
            <li>Anyway this helped right away with smoothing my skin, healing my scalp,and once added with rx hydrocortisone</li>
            <li>After trying out some DIY&#x27;s I tried using this right from plastic container it comes</li>
            <li>I use it right after my bath</li>
            <li>This stuff on Amazon isn&#x27;t even the right color.</li>
            <li>but I could not get this to smell right.  </li>
            <li>Decided to go right to the source.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll soften right</li>
            <li>I like the shea butter cream, it works right into the skin not oily</li>
            <li>No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t make it right.  </li>
            <li>It is all right.</li>
            <li>This is pure African shea butter- good for everything from daily lotion to minor burn relief, a mild spf, and even a great replacement for chapstick.</li>
            <li>We live in the Colorado rockies where the weather is very dry and this has been a great find.</li>
            <li>There was/is no need to warm it up, I can easily scoop a little in my hand and spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t melt it down because once you rub it in your hands it starts to smooth out on its own.</li>
            <li>just a little more refined this time but the same great quality.</li>
            <li>You need very little for great results.  </li>
            <li>My better half ordered this magic cream.  </li>
            <li>and I swear if there ever was a true miracle cream that could really multitask it would be Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It does have an unusual scent, but not bad.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t keep this item in a moist and warm area for too long though, because it&#x27;ll start molding.  </li>
            <li>This is a pure, clean shea butter product which can be used for so many different things.  </li>
            <li>You start noticing the difference in your skin right away after the first application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective for dry skin, hair, and blemishes.</li>
            <li>so far I think the actual Shea butter is good.</li>
            <li>It healed a sore super fast that I used it on.</li>
            <li>Quick, I Really Like That.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying this product in the future.</li>
            <li>I believe it contributed to my hair growing super fast</li>
            <li>I loved it and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li>We have tried sensitive creams like Eucerin and Burts Bees, but he gets hives and turns bright red from these creams.  </li>
            <li>I was able to break off some of these chunks, I was able to take a few bits and apply the butter.</li>
            <li>Mine came in a baggie, no container, I personally would have preferred a container especially since that is what the picture shows, otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>It came super fast</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The seller was very fast on</li>
            <li>my husband used this and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>but I actually like in the raw the best.  </li>
            <li>I simply left it out on my kitchen counter for a bit with the lid off and it was super easy to scoop out to measure once at room temp.</li>
            <li>it is not soft and pliable like a cream, so i found a little scrapper is perfect for digging some out and then you emulsify it between your palms before applying.</li>
            <li>I would rate this product a 5 on its conditioning properties -- very much makes one&#x27;s skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We plan on getting a couple of nice smelling essential oils and possibly a little Jojoba oil to mix with this to make a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I use the small 8oz tub that was securely sealed, fresh, &amp; easy-to-use by either a clean foundation brush , q-tip, teaspoon, &amp; super clean fingertip (do not re-dip or that may contaminate &amp; spoil product).</li>
            <li>so I cannot testify for that component but for instant healing of dry skin, it is superior to many  many other oils (coconut, avacado, etc)</li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>If I need to soften it, I just put the container in a sink of hot water.  </li>
            <li>For first time I scooped a portion with spoon</li>
            <li>I had planned to use this in homemade lotion or lip balm, but I want to use this stuff straight out of the tub as is!  </li>
            <li>When the Shea Butter came at first I did not know what to make of it.</li>
            <li>The only product that seems to be able to tackle these bear claws of mine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that it would arrive in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever done for any product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the scent and texture will be better if it&#x27;s used in smaller concentrations.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it never fails.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!sy.</li>
            <li>First of all, it did not weigh in at 8 ounces as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This stuff had more grits in it than a Southern restaurant.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this product</li>
            <li>In reading the mixed reviews, many people commented on the smell.</li>
            <li>and this makes me so smooth an soft.  </li>
            <li>I have received exactly the seller describe.</li>
            <li>It has really been keeping my hair and skin moisturized!</li>
            <li>I am dumping it and going back to brands which are more consistent in quality.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever bought Shea butter, and it has persuaded me to buy it now from my trusted vitamin company where I see they also have it.</li>
            <li>if you find the smell okay, but in need of improvement, you can use an essential oil it</li>
            <li>Threw it out because its too much of hassle to return...lesson learned!</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this that I ordered the larger tub of it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR USING ON A LOT OF THINGS (BODY) &amp; LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves this!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any brand of Shea Butter</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known to come to amazon first.</li>
            <li>It does melt well and it may function better in a different application.  </li>
            <li>Came in fast too!</li>
            <li>so there was definitely room in the container for more than I received.</li>
            <li>This was the first Shea butter I purchased when I began my foray into DIY skincare.</li>
            <li>Authentic shea butter is never this yellow (more like off white) and has a nutty smell, not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product I would apply it all over my face</li>
            <li>I avoid my cheeks since their already pretty oily...</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find something to help my mom with her eczema and this is the first product that has gotten the job done.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I use in the winter and mix it with oils.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product to those looking for real skin care results!</li>
            <li>I first used it at night and noticed by morning</li>
            <li>i will be coming back to buy some more.</li>
            <li>I made the solid lotion bars and lip balm, I realized I am never buying lotion or lip balm again, so I&#x27;ve ordered more shea butter from this seller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great moisturizer, use generously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: There is shea butter in a beige/ivory color commonly known as Ivory Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Before application, I wash my face with cetaphil first.</li>
            <li>It is very beneficial and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It helps to make my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use a bit at the first signs of redness.</li>
            <li>Do your research first.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>A++ thanks again!  </li>
            <li>As your body dries it absorbs the shea butter and water leaving skin much softer for a longer period of time!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be buying it again and from this seller</li>
            <li>I have just ordered 2 more &amp; will continue to order from this same seller(please</li>
            <li>I added coconut oil to this after letting it sit in hot water and it smells like coconut now.  </li>
            <li>I will be interested to see what I can do with this.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li>This arrived in 2 days and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This product workers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>First time ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has kind of a strange, herbal smell, but I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li>AND I SIT THE CONTAINER IN THE BOWL OF HOT WATER</li>
            <li>THE FIRST STEP (HOT  WATER IN BOWL AN</li>
            <li>SIT THE BOTTLE IN HOT WATER</li>
            <li>so if you decide to buy it be aware of it.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li>First time to order shea butter.</li>
            <li>Even in the hot, summer months I use this product and it soaks up into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews, this is my first</li>
            <li>First, I put on coconut oil, followed by magnesium oil, then Shea Butter to seal in these oils.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>This if my first time sharing my opinion about a product</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Shea butter</li>
            <li>I rather have it present as an indicator of the Shea butter being authentic.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t allow it to become too hot.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many different hair lotions and oil</li>
            <li>First time working with Shea butter.</li>
            <li>This was my first try.</li>
            <li>At first, the smell through me off.</li>
            <li>You can never have too much of this stuff around!</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned</li>
            <li>Very nourishing!</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much!</li>
            <li>so you do have to rub it in your hands first to create frictional heat.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first brand of Shea butter</li>
            <li>It does have a funny smell to it</li>
            <li>This shea butter is great especially for dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>It has the typical nutty scent of Shea without it being overpowering and blends/melts well into my lip balms an lotions, as well as being great used direct.</li>
            <li>This brand is very moist and creamy, melts right into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with the sole intention to switch out buying store bought lotions with something more organic, more natural for my ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received my package today (3 days early) and I was really excited.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 100% shea butter from two other sources, but I liked the price on this shea.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of making my own butters, or adding peppermint or some other oils to this.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to see if there was a difference between this shea butter and any other kind.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered other shea butter which was smooth and easy</li>
            <li>The product is good quality and it is raw as advertised.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the yellow color was so bright that it stained my clothes it touched.</li>
            <li>because of the natural vitamin content, i know it will be effective at softening my facial blemishes...</li>
            <li>This does make your skin incredibly soft and healthy, there is no doubt about that, but dont forget that this is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always need a styler in my natural hair after putting in the shea butter, but if I want more curl definition then I just add Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls.</li>
            <li>It really is 100% Shea butter for this LOW price, i would recommend this to all women who are trying to keep their skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really been able to try it on my hair since I have been recently wearing braids</li>
            <li>i just need to warm it up for 30 sec in microwave then its ready to use ..</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll get the 32oz for sure, 100% pure shea butter is a certain staple for all people.</li>
            <li>Pure shea butter is also pretty funky smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to just take a big bowl, hand-held mixer, and these few natural ingredients to make a skin moisturizer that is so much better for your skin, smells better, is cheaper, and without all the parabens, coloring, and \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; that most store bought lotions contain.</li>
            <li>It is bright yellow, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it really is pure shea butter, as it states on the container.  </li>
            <li>At room temperature it&#x27;s pretty solid, but melts easily at skin temperature.</li>
            <li>They gave a positive review for this product.</li>
            <li>I did positive experience with the seller (Nail Polish Supplies).</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING for crows feet,  dark circles and puffys.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy for the first 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>I have used shea butter for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it, and it&#x27;s very versatile too!</li>
            <li>but I wanted to make lotions bars and it did the job perfectly..nothing to compare it to since its the first time I used it, but its got to be the real deal the way it performs</li>
            <li>This really smooths my skin all over and gives me a really pretty glow.</li>
            <li>My elbows, knees, and feet are pretty much sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>After much digging around on amazon to find a good source for raw shea butter, I found this listing.</li>
            <li>It is soft at room temperature, very easy to apply, and leaves no stains since it is an off white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I open the container and it is PACKED full!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any dry skin problem, just love to feel and see my skin hydrated and this works.</li>
            <li>It soaked in quickly and my skin felt soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Oily, yes, slightly smelly, yes, effective, yes.</li>
            <li>bought it because of the great reviews that it could get rid of stretch marks and dark spots, but I havent had such luck.</li>
            <li>It was also relatively easy to mask the smoky scent with some lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li>I throw a bit more in as I&#x27;m putting in the leave in so that it will act as a heat protectant when I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is rather strong but that can be remedied with essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is definitely strong enough to moisturize.</li>
            <li>Only thing is it has a strong Shea smell</li>
            <li>I bought a large container for home and an 8 oz container for travel.</li>
            <li>100% pure.</li>
            <li>Pure shea butter is offWHITE, you should never need to microwave it because it is a butter.</li>
            <li>I could see how the funky smelling pure shea butter would though.</li>
            <li>Its pure luxury.</li>
            <li>but they fade faster with pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever used pure Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Makes it easier to apply to large areas.</li>
            <li>It came and it looked and smelled like  pure Shea Butter</li>
            <li>the kind of stuff you should slather on your hands during a dry winter and sleep with mitts on, you&#x27;d wake up with baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter &amp; here&#x27;s what I thought of this particular \\&quot;brand\\&quot;:&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item comes just as pictured, in a nice little tub.  </li>
            <li>And, it is good to soften it between your hands or in the microwave because it is quite hard in the container.</li>
            <li>It works great for knees, hands, elbows, and other areas that are prone to get dry.</li>
            <li>I put some on and LITERALLY 3 minutes later I had huge acne marks on my face, It legit appeared almost as soon as I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>Instead I whipped this into a fluffy body butter incorporating in coconut and argan oils with amazing moisturizing results.</li>
            <li>The butter if warmed is much easier to apply onto skin.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and during the winter, it really acts out.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter has made my life so much easier, I also like to use it in the place of lotion and suggest it to everyone with a skin problem.</li>
            <li>but it takes effort to make it ready to use on hair.</li>
            <li>I rub this between my hands and sparingly apply, and it really softens my hair without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether it would really cure the issue, but it seems to help soothe the skin.</li>
            <li>since too much shea butter can make one&#x27;s face look greasy.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really moisturizing...</li>
            <li>However, its very versatile in its use</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I would not let the smell keep you from making the purchase if it really bothered you, you could mix it with a fragrant oil.</li>
            <li>the product is very grainy.</li>
            <li>it really works</li>
            <li>so ladies you really need to try this post pics of stomach soon</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very oily so use in moderation.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really describe it.</li>
            <li>this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>but it really does goes on your skin very well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The shipping for this item was fast.</li>
            <li>I have several grand worth of photo equipment but why would I even bother to keep taking a picture of the same thing over and over again my friend.</li>
            <li>Thanks folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li>It makes the whole skin feel supple while it glides</li>
            <li>I am using some of this &#x27;straight&#x27; on my skin and will be blending some with coconut oil to create a somewhat lighter cream.</li>
            <li>Every exposure to water absolutely requires I apply moisturizer immediately after.</li>
            <li>It  looks very grainy and I thought it would leave a residue.</li>
            <li>It is very absorbent, soothing, and non greasy/non oily.</li>
            <li>It really has helped with my arthritis and fibromyalgiaand</li>
            <li>Really helped my heels and my hubby&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>I believe the Tea Tree Oil prevents you from breaking out when using it (from researching so much).</li>
            <li>but you really just still smell the shay butter.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I used this so that may be normal.</li>
            <li>a normal thing of pregnancy (first baby).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have so much of this, it will be awhile.</li>
            <li>The product its self is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I use in on my neck and chest for wrinkles and have really noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my son&#x27;s eczema and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put on too much..</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to deal with damaged merchandise return.</li>
            <li>Really does work for my ashy feet.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s a cheaper fix for moisturizer, but I did get some real ivory shea butter on here</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend you looking into the benefits of magnesium... and this recipe!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Real shea butter should be off-white / beige.</li>
            <li>I melted it in the microwave, section my hair, ran this non greasy gold on my hair, and ready for bed.</li>
            <li>I make it into a homemade body butter or just straight out of the container.</li>
            <li>and I really hope its Shea Butter (It smells and feels like it)...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about it .I</li>
            <li>not getting what you paid for, very misleading....</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my legs and feet feeling really greasey.  </li>
            <li>AN READY TO BE USED.ANOTHER PRODUCT</li>
            <li>This shea butter is the real deal and with that you get some of its stinkiness.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic and will be the only shea butter I use.  </li>
            <li>Very well might be.  </li>
            <li>I would rate it 5 stars, except that it is very tacky in nature</li>
            <li>This product is very grainy.</li>
            <li>I really dont like living in oklahoma city</li>
            <li>The lotion bars turned out very well.</li>
            <li>This was a very creamy butter.</li>
            <li>Don not have a whole lot of experience with Shea Butters.</li>
            <li>I have used a different Shea butter that was smooth when applying.</li>
            <li>but you can feel it absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>The product was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>It took much more to cover the scent than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Prepare for a paste, I keep my hands very damp when using and the moisture blends into a heavenly balm.</li>
            <li>It has absolutely no odor and is just lovely and smoothing on one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>etc etc etc.. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I used it when my boyfriend had stitches in his face and it helped it heal fast.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, and very sparingly on the ends of my hair</li>
            <li>A perfect skin remedy for cold weather.</li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>,it moisturize my hands really well</li>
            <li>, It is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I love natural products I have brought this product several times.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s not really shea butter, it&#x27;s good African butter.</li>
            <li>If it is BRIGHT yellow, it is not pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>What I received was genuine Shea butter that appears to be both raw, pure and very fresh.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>first of all, it&#x27;s supposed to be white, secondly the consistency should be like a chunk but very smooth and lotiony to the touch -</li>
            <li>One arrived bright yellow, the other a moldy greenish gold (think spicy brown mustard).  </li>
            <li>I think someone with super dry skin and super dry hair would love this since it is all natural and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Used it in a recipe for cold and flu chest rub, worked very nicely!</li>
            <li>I tried more things (from other people&#x27;s suggestions) like whipping it with coconut oil and use it ..</li>
            <li>This is why I updated my original review, since I actually tried the product.</li>
            <li>but when I opened it I like products like this to have a sealed cover but it didn&#x27;t but other than that I love it</li>
            <li>It seems to be working and without all the chemicals in other rubs which makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to all-natural plant oil skin care regimen and was excited to try the shea butter, especially after reading all the glowing reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>Of all the shea butter I have purchased, in store or online this one had the most grit and other stuff in it.  </li>
            <li>Love to make personal care products using this rich, emollient shea butter (among other ingredients).</li>
            <li>My other problem is that when i put it on I have a greasy feeling on my skin all day and my face also looks greasy all day, and many people have told me that its not supposed to be that way which means it is refined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s golden yellow and melts down nicely to make body butters.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re buying it for the raw properties, that kind of defeats the purpose, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he has found that used regularly, it keeps the grime from becoming embedded in his skin, keeps his cuticles soft, and otherwise keeps his hands from looking like a mechanics.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my legs and it was a little harder to spread than i thought it would be, but after using some water to rub it in a bit more it felt nice and soft.</li>
            <li>great stuff, though hers was a little dry and crumbly.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter has a nutty, earthy scent which I don&#x27;t find terribly pleasant (smells a little like dirt) but I combined it with cocoa butter and some scented essential oil to make a whipped body butter.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best skin protection I&#x27;ve found for thin, dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li>Soft enough for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Local</li>
            <li>I am VERY new to using this product.</li>
            <li>After one single application of said magic cream, they are already transforming from crusty, chalky, sharp implements of torture to leathery smooth &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dry skin or fine lines who doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical-laden products.</li>
            <li>but I know an organic place that gives a bigger container full of shea butter for 5 dollars</li>
            <li>The one consistent thing was natural Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It smells like... hot crayons and funk or something, but it is forever soft.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is 100% natural, in that it mixes cocoa butter oil to offset that smell and entice you with a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>normal lotion really can&#x27;t repair that.</li>
            <li>so i usually have to scoop some out, warm it up by rubbing it together in my hands and then apply</li>
            <li>but soon I became creative and added scented oil after melting it down.</li>
            <li>I love this Shea butter and use it every day on my face and other parts!</li>
            <li>but there was no reaction, &amp;  the less the better</li>
            <li>There is no real smell and it melts quickly so it is easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>A bit oily but the smooth, soft feeling last for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I am used to shea butter being creamy with a mild scent, but this shea was gritty and smells of rancid fat.</li>
            <li>African American beauty supply stores in my area provide more product for the price.</li>
            <li>I rub it between my hands, creating the heat necessary to make it into a soft, smooth cream consistency</li>
            <li>but ..I absolutely love his product and am a big fan of it not only for my skin but my hair as well</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for any pregnant mamas out there wanting to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Its super oily and has a gritty consistency.  </li>
            <li>When I received it it was very crumbly, I expected it to be smooth and creamy</li>
            <li>It does have that lovely yellow hue which I&#x27;ve been told is an extra nut that has been added when producing Shea butter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly because this one has a stronger nutty smell than the ivory version of the product.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it&#x27;s currently super freezing here on the East Coast</li>
            <li>When mixed with oil, it makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Although the packaging is rather casual (unlabeled, plastic tub), this African shea butter is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li>Was recommended shea butter for my djembe to help moisturize the goat skin, it works great so far, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts forever</li>
            <li>i dont think its real shea butter, so i stop using it on my face, but i notice that it leaves my feet very soft</li>
            <li>It has many benefits, such as it has improved my complexion significantly and has lightened my dark marks from old acne scars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular Shea butter  brand</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reliable source of pure shea butter because now that it&#x27;s getting popular, the price is ridiculous in some places.</li>
            <li>And with high moisturizing</li>
            <li>This is high quality shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>and therefore I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It was rock-hard in the plastic container and needed about a minute of microwaving on high before I could even sort of scoop it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it, it&#x27;s extremely moisturising and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not like it because I was not able to dress up right away after applying it and this butter cream leaves a yellow color on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth - not grainy and dry!</li>
            <li>My heels feel smooth, no longer dry and cracked!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>And I also found out that &#x27;Organic&#x27; does not mean &#x27;No Chemical Extraction&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair, I am an African American woman with natural hair (not chemically straightened) and I use it to seal in moisture after I add all my other hair stuff in lol...</li>
            <li>although kind of hard to get off the plastic jar (I use a plastic spoon to scrape it)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not packaging appropriately , and the shea butter sealing to the other product !!</li>
            <li>and it really helps with moisturizing my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I think I like this product for my hair mostly after I have blow dried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same golden color as in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love this product, clears my sons eczema  up within a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but wanted others to know</li>
            <li>but now I only put it where the skin is the driest like for me.. under eyes and my laugh lines and neck.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the extra work.</li>
            <li>I normally use - but it leaves a greasy residue which I&#x27;m not used to.</li>
            <li>I left good feedback but also told them how the container was cracked (I found out when I 1st heated it MESSY!)</li>
            <li>If you plan on using Shea butter for a face moisturizer, I can see how people with oily skin may not enjoy this product...will probably just make your face more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a week I could visibly see my skin return to normal.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter and have made a few purchases from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just started using this a few days ago and it feels better than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hands looking 10 years younger &amp; helps reduce smile lines.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter and have been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>If you even get a cut from shaving your legs it immediately heals faster than it normally would and the mark will fade as if nothing was there.</li>
            <li>Honestly I would go to my local african market to purchase this product because its just simply cheaper.</li>
            <li>Nice thick texture.</li>
            <li>It is still however usable with a little heat to melt it down and if you are ok with a strong scent of Shea butter</li>
            <li>african shea butter can be used to treat dry skin (eczema/chapped lips etc.) , for darker tanning, softening calluses, and also a great moisturizer for african american hair...</li>
            <li>Definitely apart of my normal hair regimen and will be for awhile!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Use it with the African black soap and your skin will look amazing.</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin is super soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my hair when I&#x27;m deep conditioning and it leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li>and i love it so far it doesn&#x27;t break me out like other natural products</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as of right now.</li>
            <li>If you live in a pretty hot area you probably won&#x27;t reach that point in this &#x27;shea&#x27; butter&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;I, for extra skin benefits and smoothability, ended up just melting the butter down and mixing it with jojoba oil (probably your skin&#x27;s favorite substance), and let it reform back to a butter again.</li>
            <li>You get a pretty decent tube of this stuff - 8 ounces of yellow shea butter.  </li>
            <li>It cuts down on breakage by keeping hair moisturized and strong.</li>
            <li>I only use this product on my face in the winter months, it keeps my face and neck moisturized, but I use it on my 4 yr old son all year long to help heal all of his scraps and scars and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for very dry skinned individuals such as myself, would be overkill for someone without dry skin though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new thing.</li>
            <li>We have been putting on a newly healing tattoo and the healing power of Shea Butter</li>
            <li>My husband found this product at a flea market in New Orleans.</li>
            <li>Raw shea butter has an earthy smell to it, which many people may not realize.</li>
            <li>I have been using raw Shea Butter for YEARS and love what it has done for my skin and scars.</li>
            <li>The vender dealt with me fairly and sent me an extra shea butter for the late shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for more natural and organic products without harsh chemicals for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>After receiving it, I noticed it had an odd, strong smell.</li>
            <li>In two to three weeks her face was very clear.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive &amp; oily face</li>
            <li>Since using it my hair is a lot easier to manage, is very soft and not as tangled after shampooing.</li>
            <li>Your skin is very soft after using expecially after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>When you put it on your skin, it goes into it very naturally.</li>
            <li>Very soft and works well.</li>
            <li>is always very soft whenever I do use it.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the shea butter keeps my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair and skin very soft.</li>
            <li>This is pretty solid as room temperature and holds up well to  fluctuating temperature changes.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 8 oz and one of the first thing I did was weigh it on my digital scale.  </li>
            <li>I love the shea butter, this is about the (overall) 3rd or 4th order, just from different sellers.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with actual Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It is so natural!</li>
            <li>I recommend Shea Butter for anyone, with natural curly hair!</li>
            <li>i surprised!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have stretch marks on the first 8 months of my pregnancy using only lotion and sometimes cocoa butter, and I didn&#x27;t scratch.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not greasy if I use a small amount, and any more is just a waste!</li>
            <li>Whipped up w/some African Hair Oil and it came out very creamy!  </li>
            <li>I had to pay extra shipping on my first order(like</li>
            <li>This shea butter is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using shea butter in lotions or soaps, unrefined shea will generally need to be gently melted and strained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I were to go back in time, I would remove the product from the original container, and perhaps use a double boiler to melt.</li>
            <li>The yellow color, well, this is the only product that I have seen it in yellow, the rest are more vanilla colored.</li>
            <li>It also had a moderate scent unique to Shea, an almost smoky and nutty scent similar to rubbery oud.</li>
            <li>Was amazed at the fact the moisturizing effect lasted for nearly 48 hours--will buy again!</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair, and it keeps it so soft and well moisturized for days!</li>
            <li>I never review items, but i was very pleasantly surprised by this Shea butter!</li>
            <li>Very thick, very crumbly, very easy to just mix into your palms, though.</li>
            <li>I was thoroughly excited to get my pound of 100% pure and unprocessed African Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It hasnt really helped with my hyperpigmentation issues which is the main reason for my purchase, but I still recommend purchasing for a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There is a bar code on top, letters and number under  the bar code and reads, \\&quot;African Shea Butter Cream...0% Pure Raw and Gold</li>
            <li>It is amazing that just a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li>The product stinks to high heaven but is a great way to moisturize extra-dry areas like heels.  </li>
            <li>Really liking this as kind of a leave-in deep conditioner, such as when I know I won&#x27;t be doing anything for a few days</li>
            <li>I found some other shea butter that I love, but it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>I use it often and add my own essential oils to smaller containers and mix it with other oil like oilve, hazelnut and apricot kernel oil.</li>
            <li>This time it is melted smooth in a container half the size</li>
            <li>sinks in fast, it can be a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li>When applied to a sunburn I felt instant relief and my skin healed much faster than normal.</li>
            <li>This batch came in the mail today and it is like no raw shea butter I&#x27;ve used before...</li>
            <li>My 2 year old has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The product has a rich nutty aroma and it&#x27;s not too oily or greasy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>it is easy to break down as it softens right up to mix with hair oils and other products.</li>
            <li>After just a few seconds of rubbing it between the hands, it looses the grainy texture and becomes very creamy and easy enough to spread.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth and soft especially during this dry winter season .</li>
            <li>After a few applications you&#x27;ll notice that fine lines reduce (I&#x27;ve been a fan for about 6 years now).</li>
            <li>Could never find pure shea butter in the stores so I finally checked on here.</li>
            <li>Shea butter should not be yellow if it is pure.</li>
            <li>I scoop up a little bit of product and rub between my palms and it warms quickly to a smooth and creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t mind because it is much better environmentally than a large hard plastic container.</li>
            <li>Pure natural shea butter is an off white color.</li>
            <li>i bought to use for my very very VERY dry skin an it didn&#x27;t really help, i don&#x27;t really like the smokey ashy kinda smell either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to rate a product that needs more time for result.  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because it&#x27;s hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li>I may start using it on my skin too since it&#x27;s soooo cold lately lol.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer during cold weather and also protector from sun.</li>
            <li>hopefully it will clear up those marks as well...</li>
            <li>The packet clearly stated that this brand is not FDA approved.</li>
            <li>The picture clearly shows a container, but it came today in a flimsy plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of things for my extra sensitive face ..as much as i wanted this to work</li>
            <li>The package says 100% shea butter, which is clearly a lie.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wait , clear skin is calling you...</li>
            <li>He said since its a natural product, depending on the season the product texture varies.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I do not put any chemicals on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I apply it to the affected areas and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It is soft and incorporated into the recipe without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought it for mom since she has natural hair.</li>
            <li>so far i like it.  </li>
            <li>I guess you could add some scented essential oils if it really bothers you.</li>
            <li>and wow..</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>Product is grainy unlike natural Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>I was surprised that my skin didn&#x27;t feel greasy after I used it.  </li>
            <li>The combination should help fade my scars completely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is indeed natural.</li>
            <li>I am natural and purchased this for my hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really wish time was take to refigerate so that it didn&#x27;t liquify and then become solid again.</li>
            <li>Plus its natural and doesn’t clog pores.</li>
            <li>So far I have melted it in the microwave</li>
            <li>However, it is in no way 100% natural and never expires like the container claims.</li>
            <li>it is all natural and unscented.  </li>
            <li>but overall I came fast</li>
            <li>As far as my skin is concerned I immediately saw the difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t promise this method will work for everyone trying to solve PIH issues but it will contribute to the natural healing process by \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; things out for you.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re soft and glowing like a god/goddess.</li>
            <li>( I am natural btw)</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>so I have old burn scars.</li>
            <li>I use this all over my body, I also used in a recipe for hair care treatment makes your hair soft</li>
            <li>this is old rancid bacon grease.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% natural form.</li>
            <li>Recommend watching KinkyTresses&#x27; YouTube Channel and Video titled &amp;#34;Tips on Applying Unrefined Shea Butter to Afro-Textured Natural Hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair and skin soft.</li>
            <li>but wow..</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I had to trash it because my skin so sensitive</li>
            <li>I just have so sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m A Natural Chic.</li>
            <li>As far as the package goes i had no&lt;br /&gt;issues</li>
            <li>I use it on both my body and my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a full-on eczema cure, but it does treat it in the early stages.</li>
            <li>I use the smallest amount at night and in the morning my skin is incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have since acquired real shea butter (an acquaintance brought back from Nigeria) and . . .</li>
            <li>I use it frequently...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unscented and in its natural state.</li>
            <li>It is a natural wonder cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li>i went to a health store and bought a chipper one that is soft like butter.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s working just find so far.</li>
            <li>I use it instead if petroleum based products for my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>I use this in my lotion recipes, in my hair, and on my three month old.</li>
            <li>I started using it on my hands and face &amp; WOW</li>
            <li>the seller did not pay complete shipping)I contacted the seller through email &amp; they refunded my shipping completely.</li>
            <li>It is very viscous and you will likely need to microwave it every time you use it just to soften it.</li>
            <li>my hair is shiny n soft.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s natural, so</li>
            <li>:IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT TO THE TOUCH,IT GIVES YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li>VEINS.I THINK IT&#x27;S A NATURAL SKIN</li>
            <li>A must have for natural product lovers.</li>
            <li>It make it feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and when i used this cream  i has sensitive</li>
            <li>Works well in my homemade deodorant and keeps my armpit soft.</li>
            <li>This seems to help so far.</li>
            <li>The eczema is basically gone now and his skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>my sink was so soft</li>
            <li>I feel any inconvenience is merited by avoiding all the additives that most companies place in their products that negatively impact your body.</li>
            <li>By the way, I found by researching that even if Shea Butter is extracted using chemicals, it can still be called &#x27;Natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li>After a time, it is not greasy feeling but soft and natural.</li>
            <li>my skin has a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I decided to reserve it for use on my feet, as far away from my nose as I could get, but I could still smell it and it was unacceptable.</li>
            <li>So much so that I just placed another order with them for a larger quantity and will leave a separate review when that arrives.</li>
            <li>This product works well when it comes to making your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>For soft skin, by it.</li>
            <li>But I like the natural smell of it with the coconut and almond oil</li>
            <li>have natural curly hair so while im swimming, i let the shea butter melt in the sun and put in on my hair when I get out of the pool.</li>
            <li>I have a natural hair (Afro).</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t use much, just worked it into the ends and left it on overnight)</li>
            <li>but once you rub it on your skin the smell completely disappears.</li>
            <li>This butter made my stretch marks completely disappear after using it for three weeks.</li>
            <li>once you use this product you will never go back to using drug store lotions that claim to have real shea butter in them.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at the same time as the Molivera Organics product and I like it much</li>
            <li>Worked well for that use and keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;• Has not dealt with my sensitive skin prone to heat</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s in your hand its soft and creamy..</li>
            <li>But you can also find this at your local (hair store, beauty mart) and its much cheaper ...</li>
            <li>I cut all of my hair off (it was relaxed) to almost a faded hair cut so that I could grow out my natural texture.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure you could add a few drops of essential oils to it.</li>
            <li>My face seems a lot more smoother and it seems like my blemishes are fading slowly from using this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty large amount and will last me a very long time</li>
            <li>I play African drumming and my instructor highly recommend me apply Shea butter after drumming, because my hands can easily get dried and cracked after drumming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell is not over-powering like other 100% pure shea butters are and it works fast.</li>
            <li>This product was much better than the other, more expensive brand,  I will reorder this when she runs out again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very rich, creamy and thick</li>
            <li>I am an AA woman and have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li>have been melting in microwave half a spoon full for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Most shea butters are hard and I find that they have to be mixed with oils or heated a little to spread easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is hard but also very easy to pinch enough off and rub it in your hands.</li>
            <li>Deeply moisturizing, Stimulating for the superficial microcirculation, Skin strengthening, Skin protecting, UV protecting, Skin regenerating,  Collagen production stimulating (makes the skin stronger, more supple and younger), Minor cuts and burns healing, Muscle ache healing, Physical endurance enhancer...</li>
            <li>I researched pure &amp; raw Shea Butter prior to my purchase and found the yellow, nutty fragrant variety to have exceptional properties as compared to some other variations.</li>
            <li>I used this to make lip balm and other then the tint of the product it works AMAZING as a mosturizer added with other products mixed in.</li>
            <li>Now, I normally don&#x27;t mind plant smells at all; in fact, I enjoy them and have quite a few essential oils in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>But smells a bit yucky and has a little greasy film vs hard cocoa butter that goes on with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>As a user of shea butter for years, I&#x27;m aware of good and bad.</li>
            <li>And in a plastic baggie, no less - not even in a container.  </li>
            <li>it is just as pictured same exact canister and same color ....</li>
            <li>This stuff actually works better than any lotion or cream I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>The lid is exactly the same and the sticker, so from the product view I thought I would get the same amount as I did from another seller.</li>
            <li>However, my container was crushed and cracked when I received it (probably more the fault of the post office than the seller) and the shea butter was not packed down in the container</li>
            <li>I bought this shea butter because I wanted a new natural product for my facial regime.</li>
            <li>I use this with African black soap and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Your skin absorbs it quickly so there&#x27;s no greasy residue and the smell is minimal, similar to cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>REAL RAW SHEA BUTTER does wonders:)</li>
            <li>I would use the shea butter to help lock in moisture on my hair and on my older daughter who has very long and thick chunky hair :-).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I notice my rough elbows and feet becoming sooooo soft as well as the dark spots fading.</li>
            <li>I have only been able to get it on him once, the smell is not very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Only draw back is because it is pure Shea</li>
            <li>The only downside is I think the product might have been mixed with palm oil - so it isn&#x27;t actually &#x27;pure&#x27; Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased pure shea butter multiple times from various places and nothing looks like this stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use not so hard</li>
            <li>Natural raw Shea butter in a nice little jar.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a few other ingredients and the results are nice.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the smell, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I really like the result of the mixture on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I put the mixture in her hair and scalp before I blow dry and her hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>The smell is not very strong and to me it is worth dealing with to have a product that works so well.</li>
            <li>this stuff does work very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>If applying this product directly to the skin, I recommend putting it on straight out of the shower WHILE your body is still wet.</li>
            <li>It is very rancid, please double check your shipments and storage before you ship products next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used white shea butter from Whole Foods before, but I wanted to try out this stuff to see if &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; was any different.</li>
            <li>I mix it in with my regular body lotion to give it a little boost and that pretty much takes care of the smell.  </li>
            <li>it help my skin stay soft and irritate less after shaving, it is easy to use, last a long time</li>
            <li>Definitely helped it clear up!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to any other product, because this is the first time I&#x27;ve used shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Product was melted due to hot weather.</li>
            <li>Shea butter has major healing properties.</li>
            <li>and no other lotions were doing the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>an some other products an made a lotion that works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This little tub will last you forever -- definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>The only thing that was a little different is it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but very hard to get out of the container.</li>
            <li>The container arrived full to the max of raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>i was curious how pure this product was going to be...</li>
            <li>I love this 100% pure and raw African Shea butter cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is less dry, my hair is easier to manager and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>This was not as smooth as other Shea&#x27;s I have purchased in the past, this one had a very gritty feeling to it when you first put on.</li>
            <li>I bought pure shea butter from another vendor on Amazon that was white, and the smell was not nearly as overpowering.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s butter its kinda thick but its very soft &amp; melts quickly when you spread it</li>
            <li>and it came out very creamy and smooth but by the second day when it became hard again I put it back in the microwave for 10secs and it turned into oil and took 3 days to become solid again</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet and it really softens any rough spots.  </li>
            <li>However what I received was not the same color as the  all natural shae butter that I buy in stores.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face several times a week near bedtime.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shea butter based on the reviews I&#x27;d read, but apparently I have an allergy to it.</li>
            <li>My husband is currently trying it and has had no adverse reaction thus far.</li>
            <li>BUT if you catch the rash when it is barely forming it can stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I melt tiny amount of it in microwave and mix it with my nivea soft cream and apply on my face every night.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near 8 fluid ounces.</li>
            <li>have mixed skin and overly sensitive, yet this stuff doeasnt make me break out.</li>
            <li>It feels oily initially, but after 5 minutes, it just makes your hands and body feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, instead of being soft int he tub, this brand of shea butter is basically a solid brick in the tub.</li>
            <li>Look for an off white shea butter, and ask the seller ahead of time if the butter is soft and malleable in the tub, or whether you have to apply construction worker tools to it to get it to break up before you can use</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much on or you will be slipping and sliding in yo&#x27; sandals.</li>
            <li>However, the shea butter was soft and I will be using this product again, just not ordering from the same person..</li>
            <li>I have also noticed how soft the back of his hands are now.</li>
            <li>This was no where near white.</li>
            <li>Instead this was an ivory color flecked in places by a light yellowish green with the overall texture of playdough and that telltale sticky/tackiness when pinched between your fingers present.</li>
            <li>However, to describe it, I would say its a lightly greasy, thick &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faint and goes away after you put it on (about 10 min.), then it has a nice nutty smell,</li>
            <li>AND I KNOW MOST PEOPLE MELT THE PRODUCT DOWN BY MICROWAVING IT FOR A FEW MINUTES</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised that the quality was still there, and I received my package quickly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for some pure Shea butter to blend with other oils and make body butter.</li>
            <li>Since I mix it with other products I can&#x27;t say for certain how it works for my hair.</li>
            <li>It was still not soft, so I simply took a knife and broke off some chunks by breaking up the large tub of butter into smaller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich thick and organic..</li>
            <li>It does have a slight nutty smell, which isn&#x27;t really unpleasant, but you can do so much with this product, including adding your own scents, that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>Description says raw and golden with a photo of a container</li>
            <li>After using black raw soap from Africa Ghana, you will defiantly love this after you rinse your face.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is not 100% natural like they claim because it was yellow and therefore had red palm oil added.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extremely soft and it curly my hair up ( i am an african american)</li>
            <li>I ended up just tossing it, because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of sending it back.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to black females who are going natural.</li>
            <li>MELT IT DOWN AND TRANSFER IT TO A LARGE SQUEEZE BOTTLE</li>
            <li>It had a gritty texture, a less than lovely aroma, and the color had changed to that of raw pizza dough.  </li>
            <li>is really soft and my skin no longer feels stretched.</li>
            <li>This product is useful in that just a small pinch of it covers a lot of skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and found it well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Eventually it melted and when I went to look into the pot I saw a fairly large black speck.</li>
            <li>but Hey it is suppose to smell like that this is not That Shea Butter that has added chemicals and perfumes that is the whole point buying RAW Shea Butter in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention I have dark old acne marks on my face as well that have disappeared in two days as well!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, the texture a little gritty- even after being melted down.</li>
            <li>It has almost no smell and the ability of this stuff to moisturize my dry skin (lizard skin) makes any slight off scent worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other shea ∫utter creams that had a decent smell</li>
            <li>this brand in particular, I have not noticed any difference between the other brands of Shea butter I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I make my own (mostly-organic) cosmetics, so I&#x27;ve used a number of different products from a number of different brands, and this has got to be the most disgusting smelling thing I&#x27;ve ever received.</li>
            <li>I got about half of what really suppose to go in my container.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after doing some research on naturally helping my daughter&#x27;s dry hair retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>A must buy for anyone with dry itchy skin, or wanting a natural product to add moisture to their skin.</li>
            <li>Unless I actually scoop it out with a spoon, I can barely get enough on my hand to use.</li>
            <li>The package isn&#x27;t really sealed tight so it leaked out after it melted in transit.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>I bought raw shea butter in hopes of avoiding stretch marks during my first pregnancy, i&#x27;m 38 weeks and have gained 30 pounds and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing the raw form.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that can get very dry.</li>
            <li>It is a little greasy but not so much that it is unreasonable.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very thick and you will have to rub it in your hands to smooth things out before using it.</li>
            <li>Its very thick but rub a chunk in your hand for about 15 seconds to smooth out and then apply.</li>
            <li>creative way of using to it benefit my face and aid in speeding up the healing process for my PIH is a little time consuming but it does work (for me at least).</li>
            <li>The reviews were good, so I guess I got a bad batch.</li>

            <li> but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> (and it amazingly does not make me break out).</li>
            <li> The shea butter melts nicely when you rub it between the palms of your hands.</li>
            <li> When i am bathing, i dip it in a jar with warm water, by the time i finish bathing, it has softend up and its easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>

            <li> Thanks for this wonderful shea butter cream.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I use this butter for making my own home made Lotions and Balms .</li>
            <li> I wanted to make my own body moisturizer using this combined with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> but it did not work as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> it feels good on skin and makes skin look healthy</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product when I was watching some type of fashion video on Youtube with Amber Rose</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for your skin and at such a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not buy another order with this kind of packaging.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, is creamy and feels nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li> kind of a smokey smell</li>
            <li> What kind of quality and customer service is that?</li>
            <li> All the nice lotions and creams have shea butter in them.  </li>
            <li> plastic food grade container which is nice,</li>
            <li> It feels nice</li>
            <li> But its kind of bleh.</li>
            <li> I liked this Shea butter</li>
            <li> Kind of like conola oil.</li>
            <li> i would mix it with shampoo and baby oil to make my own shaving cream or put it in my hair before bed.</li>
            <li> It is kind of stinky</li>
            <li> take a chunk and warm it in your hands, then apply.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the price.</li>
            <li> Because the  value is so good, I am using it more liberally than before and even my husband started using it as an aftershave cream to soothe his skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea Butter to make my own lotion bars.  </li>
            <li> I find that for me it is superior to most store bought creams and keeps my skin hydrated in the winter.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered  this to make my own home made organic hand lotions and body butters.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, body scrub, etc</li>
            <li> stars for any brand or kind of shea butter for repairing chapped and damaged skin.</li>
            <li> it is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try to make my own lotion out of it, and I don&#x27;t want to got through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> , I made my own hand salve with this</li>
            <li> The product was clean and felt great</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and plan to buy more.  </li>
            <li> I am a very happy customer and I will most certainly buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, not bad, just not anything special.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and makes your skin free great, but I prefer the Ivory Shea butter better.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent wind burn, keeps my hands and feet nice and soft and works great on the baby to prevent diaper rash!</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Great Price and the product was excellent as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shea before, and it smells light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell of Shea Butter was also very strong and did not fade.</li>
            <li> i love it and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> This product does in fact leave your skin very smooth and hydrated and it does have amazing benefits</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much and it is VERY good as a sun blocker.</li>
            <li> This is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a nice slip, I was able to style with ease.</li>
            <li> massaged into fingernails and buffed, it lends a nice healthy shine if you do not use polish.  </li>
            <li> I liked being able to pick up hunks of it to use.  </li>
            <li> I just keep it in my room at room temperature or on top of a heat source and it warms to a nice manipulative consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all a suitable product though.</li>
            <li> that was cheap and really good.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my face is so bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter for my family&#x27;s skin care needs with great success.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff at night every day during my pregnancy and although I gained more weight than I would have liked (55lbs)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, but I sure won&#x27;t be using this kind again.  </li>
            <li> This method will help your skin absorb the shea butter more effectively without leaving your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> My Mom liked it better than her blush brand lotion.</li>
            <li> This is much softer--like a bright gold play dough with a pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> We all have eczema, so it&#x27;s great right after showers.</li>
            <li> STRONG!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lose a lot, and the seller was super nice and said they&#x27;re replace it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, has a great consistency and arrived quickly and in good form.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shea butter!</li>
            <li> This was priced right and it has a pleasant smell and melted nicely.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter was in good and neat packaging and texture was rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited because it looked like a good product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great cream, really great stuff - but does not work to its potential if you are a hit and miss user...</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of shea that is smooth and supple and reduces between your palms into a warm softening oil....</li>
            <li> it works wonderful, good product also works well with other Ra cosmestics</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described and I was really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> The best part is no crazy ingredients, 100% pure!</li>
            <li> My hands are also softer and my skin feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> (it is very smooth once your hands heat it when rubbing together) about twice a day.</li>
            <li> I bought two for the first time,  and now am buying 3 more , this thing is sooo goood AHHMAAZING!!</li>
            <li> I suggest placing it in some warm water if you want to apply it more easily, and also mixing it with a carrier oil (almond, avocado, castor, jojoba) for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after applying, its very smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> still using it cause I love the product.</li>
            <li> i love this product, so many reasons to use it.</li>
            <li> i also like the smell, most may not</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> that proved to be the most elusive ingredient in the recipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with my fave lotion and it makes my sking even better.</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>

            <li> I can tolerate it, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>

            <li> I wish I had done more research beforehand.</li>

            <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> My skin was always glowing and my hair always looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m gonna have to order more.</li>
            <li> this one is a thousand times better, easier to mix &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized container for making up some lotions using essential oils.  </li>
            <li> but 1 is ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Just love  this  product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my shea butter.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has many uses.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great, and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference on how much lighter my stretch marks have gotten.</li>
            <li> wish packaging was better though.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth like butter, and has a warm smoky smell that I could inhale for hours.  </li>
            <li> now ex*- anyway she was asked what was some of her favorite make up and skin care products.</li>
            <li> I was dying to know this because I love this woman</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Today, my skin feels more moisturized and supple without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering every month:)</li>
            <li> I love this product but beware it comes in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> its smell is like peanut butter :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product to be sold online.</li>
            <li> I use this one of all Shea butter&#x27;s most often</li>
            <li> Love using this in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Oil Coconut Oil (76 Degree) on skin and alone on scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the hydrating feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like overheated cooking oil as most reviewers mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth and creamy shea butter, this is it!  </li>
            <li> so make sure you wait a couple of minutes for your skin to absorb it before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> (although supposedly stretch marks are from hormones and no ointment is supposed to be able to prevent them).</li>
            <li> Great for your whole body, even your face.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going to  pay more than I paid for the butter to return it.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this product is the smell...</li>
            <li> You can mix it with your favorite creams or use it alone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it truly works wonders on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the effects of the shea butter, I would buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend going to Coastal Scents and buying their shea butter, it&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li> I guarantee it&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many jars for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I think it works better on stretch marks than cocoa butter or bio oil.</li>
            <li> There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s Shea Butter, then I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to know why it wasn&#x27;t packaged better..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again unless they contact me with an apology and a promise to do a better job with packaging and labeling......</li>
            <li> It would be better as a bar so that you can rub it where needed.</li>
            <li> Is this product safe?</li>
            <li> Customer service was outstanding also when I had questions regarding use.</li>
            <li> This container lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> so I can get a bit more experience</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been pleased both times</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and is working nicely in my balms!</li>
            <li> The african shea butter cream is the best body cream i&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> The most important part is that it moisturizes my skin and soothes my eczema!</li>
            <li> but I should have looked more closely at the reviews.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for most of my body.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that appealing</li>
            <li> I love, love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> MANY MANY YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> Review of this product is that is used by my wife, she is well pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure others love it.</li>
            <li> I use it for many of my DIY beauty products.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter Cream is the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it though because I am sooo smooth!</li>
            <li> I very much love this shea butter</li>
            <li> The grains sit on top of your skin</li>
            <li> so I am sure it is not hardened shea butter.</li>
            <li> i am glad i order this</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> now i need to order more..</li>

            <li> Love this nutty scented butter cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne prone and allergic to any sun exposure of more than 15 minutes</li>
            <li> This truly made a difference to me, for most it probably will not.</li>
            <li> the top and moldy @ the bottom..</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the Shea butter, but its more than a nutrient for my hands/skin, its a mind soother as well.</li>
            <li> pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more creamy.</li>
            <li> I love to make whipped shea body with my favorite fragrance and use after showering or bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> I love using Shea Butter for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> and I love the results I get from using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I resumed using a product that contains shea butter that I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
            <li> Really pleased I took a chance purchasing online from Dade.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t really able to add scent to it.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter</li>
            <li> and I am sure that this product would have been wonderful if the canister was not cracked open when I received it.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> and I just love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleased with it coming in a plastic bag instead of a container doubt I will purchase again</li>
            <li> using for years love this</li>
            <li> Love to smell it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> it would be Shea butter for sure.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> it will ball up and just glob on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this for face and body and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter</li>
            <li> and though this is definitely not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, it still served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> My boo uses this on their curly hair and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> more.  </li>
            <li> While I may be able to attribute this to her just aging and moving out of that stage I used it on her bottom too.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I ordered 3 more!!</li>
            <li> and this product has provided the right amount of conditioning I needed, absorbs in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I tried this cream for three months and feel this one is pretty good and very comfortable when apply on the face.</li>
            <li> lotions.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very rich, moisturizing, and healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I originally bought shea butter to make my own chapstick.</li>
            <li> The price alone is great for what I received and this is the real thing, it is fresh, smelled so good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is some good stuff and cheap...received very fast.</li>
            <li> This feels so nice on the skin melts right in!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always about gaining big profits but gaining HAPPY &amp; SATISFIED customers!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> So beautiful and Soft like a feather</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The shea butter goes on best if it is heated to liquid form, so I warm it with my blow dryer for a few seconds before applying it.</li>
            <li> There are many videos on YouTube that show how easy this is to do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> But all in all, it came quickly and it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products for my beauty routine and this is a great gateway.</li>
            <li> Another all natural product great for all kind of skin try and see how much your skin will love it!Buy on amazon!</li>
            <li> sellers price is fantastic and I noticed the container right away, This seller has the GOOD STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes the skin very smooth and fantastic looking.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the best thing ever for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, but I&#x27;m sure it works fine for others.</li>
            <li> (although I think that&#x27;s more due to genetics than this lotion) but it isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff!</li>
            <li> A really good amount of quality pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> He swears it is the best thing for his very dry skin.</li>
            <li> We keep our home very cool</li>
            <li> Not only do you feel more mosturized after using but the results give you a sense of confidence and truly make you feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product has been suggested by many as a great product for hair, but I think it helps more to keep the moisture in then actually moisturize.</li>
            <li> They even offered to send me another 4 containers in much better packaging for free....</li>
            <li> A great product for natural hair and body care.</li>
            <li> on smooth, just be sure to emulsify-- rub vigorously in your hands--</li>
            <li> I think this is a really good moisturizer, haven&#x27;t seen much fading yet of some marks I have.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is not unrefined, but it is good quality, and priced very competitively.</li>
            <li> right now I&#x27;m loving</li>
            <li> and it was still so easy to use</li>
            <li> and I could easily scoop a bit into my finger and apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> because its so natural u do have to warm it in your hands to soften, but man once it goes on the effect is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> belly feels so good when I put it because It feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> I use it on a surgical scar that I purchased it for &amp; it is healing very quickly &amp; does not appear to be leaving a scar at all.</li>
            <li> It also melts in your hands for easy application.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to work with it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll be easy to apply on the skin</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> It came just as packaged and was easy to handle.</li>
            <li> its too strong</li>
            <li> The rancid smell was so strong it permeated all of the lotions I made -</li>
            <li> Good Shea Butter 100% Natural, not the most organic product out there</li>
            <li> Shea butter by itself has a strong scent and may no be appeasing to some.</li>
            <li> but I thought that the smell of this shea butter was a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> and i liked it very much</li>
            <li> It is pure clean and as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in a container with a lid that was VERY secure.</li>
            <li> I immediately experienced an intense burning sensation and then a bright red rash appeared.</li>
            <li> I am not one for lotions and poitions, but I have to say that this stuff is pretty dang amazing.</li>
            <li> When I first used it everything was nice.</li>
            <li> I get kind of \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; in the winter, and this Shea butter is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully for several beauty products I made as gifts.</li>
            <li> Really nice product and exactly as pictured and described.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time i was making my own batch of body butter.</li>
            <li> and it requires more work but its not a bad product.</li>
            <li> say it smells fine.</li>
            <li> smooth and easily applicable</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE EVERY MORNING OR NIGHT TO PROVIDE SMOOTH SKIN THAT GETS COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHERS.</li>
            <li> so i tried it on my face and it worked fine</li>
            <li> Easy, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> ordered It to go in DIY product...seem fine to me.</li>
            <li> cream turned out awesome and healed my eczema quite a bit until I ran out of the cream and been too lazy to cook more of it.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles, fine lines and scars repairing, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory,</li>
            <li> I use it as an eye cream, the fine lines have diminished.</li>
            <li> the Appearance of Acne Scars/Pits, Fine Wrinkles, Softens Skin, and Evens Skin Tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is definitely authentic shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is super moisturizing at work!</li>
            <li> to which I quickly accepted!</li>
            <li> I received my African Shea Butter Cream very quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li> It smells just fine and does make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking I don&#x27;t like how this smells .I cannot use this product alone on my body unless I add some nice essential oils but its your choice if you can tolerate some strong smell then go for it .</li>
            <li> I do a little massage, the smell is not the best</li>
            <li> you can rub some away or pinch off little bits, and is really awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy this again - awesome for hair when mixed with oils.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a bit of coconut oil and it makes the perfect homemade lotion for super dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> And the size is huge compared to what&#x27;s offered in brick-and-mortars--</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly if you continue rolling it around in your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a golden color, most of the time it has been melted before placed into the jar.</li>
            <li> My primary use of this product is for my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and beneficial Thank you and will I deal with you next time</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I heard that it helps to even skin tone, and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic for eczema.</li>
            <li> but i found that rubbing your hands together fast to get it warm and also wetting them w a bit of water to help distribute it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I primarily bought this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> his hair is so smooth, he cant stop running his fingers through his scalp.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> Not only was the quality of the product great also the service.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was really hoping that I would be one of those thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin silky smooth and also helped out with a burn on my arm from the oven.</li>
            <li> this stuff is sooo smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my body - it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> For my hair I use it to moisturize my edges and it also keeps my skin smooth ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands smooth and cleans up my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Pull the bag off, wipe off the container and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your skin so smooth and not just touch, you can see the smoothness...</li>
            <li> Smooth Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is best used, I think, as a night cream because it is fairly heavy.</li>
            <li> Its great  for your skin and hair only in the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and chemical free.</li>
            <li> I like using it on my skin, but sometimes there&#x27;s a grainy texture that I really don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> Definitely light.</li>
            <li> Smooth and not grainy.</li>
            <li> My skin was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It sort of smells like light scented cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I mix the shea butter with my face cream in the palm of my hand so it slides on smooth.</li>
            <li> It works well with cloth diapers as a light diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li> Kudos to you &amp; many years of success to you</li>
            <li> then you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> They turned out fantastic@@  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth once you take a dap of it.</li>
            <li> A PACK OF 12 FOR 24.77 WITH $25 FREE SHIPPING I BOUGHT A SHOWER COMB</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that this is unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It mixed well with the Coco butter, and turned out great.</li>
            <li> But it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I think it is the store brand copy of  Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing lotion, fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to be smooth, not grainy.</li>
            <li> Because I have light skin, I have to put this on at night</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> in conclusion, this is GOOD for moisturizing and for fighting eczema, but I recommend you buy African Ivory Shea Butter (Cheaper + Better).</li>
            <li> It is also good for swelling,scars, i also put some on my lips,feet,body and after 1 use everything feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It melted a few seconds after I rub in my palm, moisturized my skin nicely and had very nice smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use before bed rather than applying right before going out.</li>
            <li> My brown spots from old acne marks were SIGNIFICANTLY reduced, I get compliments on my good skin all the time now.</li>
            <li> I really like this Shea butter, its rich, creamy and moisturises my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Okay so I have had eczema since I was 12, this product was awesome at reducing eczema inflammation for the first few weeks</li>
            <li> Great for my girls hair and many other things!</li>
            <li> and i think i&#x27;ll order more,, thank you very much for it</li>
            <li> Liked Shea Butter for moisturizing it high ...</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin super soft which is always good.</li>
            <li> I did later buy Grade A ivory Shea butter from Ghana (via Halal Today) and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> When i decided to try some DIY lip balm and face products the easiest way to buy was from Amazon, but I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love love love the African Shea Butter Cream.</li>
            <li> My fingernails seem stronger and they are not peeling so, for the first time since I was a teenager, I am able to start growing them out.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> i first bought this in nyc and paid more than twice for it.  </li>
            <li> the original container is not fancy and neither is the smell.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure i got rancid butter :</li>
            <li> Just sayin&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;It is almost unbelievable how wonderful Shea Butter is.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have gotten it for years, but this was my first time acquiring it online.</li>
            <li> so l get Excited</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gonna be fun!</li>
            <li> You do need to melt and dilute it (it melts in your hand), this I recommend unless you can get over the unique scent.  </li>
            <li> being said, I wanted to melt my shea in the original container.  </li>
            <li> First all, I love the texture.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with this brand/type shea butter and it has been working wonders for both my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> worth getting and using!</li>
            <li> it really really is a great product, and it lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li> but it comes out great and works wonders on dry skin.</li>
            <li> As the butter I received from this vendor is bright yellow, I no longer feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin on the feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> Works great for moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li> 100% clean 100% care ,</li>
            <li> Also great for dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> with the package and the container is nice, definitely reusable :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with this delicious heady natural scent - kinda smokey with some vanilla.</li>
            <li> It might be good to be used for skin which is much easier as rubbing the butter on skin is much easier than on hair.</li>
            <li> I have order four so far and planning on order more!</li>
            <li> It almost smells rancid, does not melt easy, and not from Africa - it says product of China right on the label.</li>
            <li> I know that color doesn&#x27;t matter, but if you are creating something that depends on a certain look and texture, perhaps consider purchasing a better quality ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s completely pure and keeps the skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for 100% pure shea butter :)</li>
            <li> Very nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son&#x27;s eczema and our dry skin (we live in CO) and it works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great and a potent cream so necessary for the face to restore all the natural oils and make it look luscious!</li>
            <li> It is a little stinky, but I got over it because of how incredible his skin is.  </li>
            <li> I opened the bright yellow one.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting a &amp;#34;simply lovely&amp;#34; tub of bright yellow butter that smelt like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> It is bright yellow</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it for use on my hair to mix with other oils to apply to my hair but it has also worked great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had never used shea butter before and was looking for something as an alternative to &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, which is FULL of chemicals and unnatural things that clog pores.</li>
            <li> DAILY WITH GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping the actual Shea butter is good quality...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and surprisingly, on the lid it gives several uses of the benefits of shea butter.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say for sure if this is Shea butter, as it did not arrive as pictured in the ad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, kind of feels like play doh.</li>
            <li> but you have to rub it in for the full moisterizing to take effect.</li>
            <li> The tub it came in was quite full as well.</li>
            <li> The package was full.</li>
            <li> Warmed, it handled better; but was very granular.</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I apply to my face, and massage in for a full minute or two.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to use too much as will get into your clothes</li>
            <li> True remedy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it full bore</li>
            <li> Works good for my hands, I have a situation in my hands, I tried differents creams but only this helps my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on harsh sunburns and it makes them go away and turn into a tan at an incredible rate, virtually overnight.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price and has e and d in it according the the label-more than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> No bad smell</li>
            <li> I use this from head to toe, I mean from my face to my heels literally and my skin has never been more beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my skin so soft and the smell is not so strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but it ABSOLUTELY does work!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s STILL pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Very economical way to keep your skin moisturized, healthy and young!</li>
            <li> But other than that I am completly happy.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting super cream 100 % natural ok smeal and my hair just love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> The quickly diminished.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant nutty fragrance and immediately soothed my dry hands.</li>
            <li> It melted quickly.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to review this except to say that if you are looking for natural Shea butter this is a good product to have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the best i have purchased in the last ten years</li>
            <li> I have also used it for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and mild case of eczema.</li>
            <li> I am over 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li> The reason why I rated it at a 3 is because I didn&#x27;t see a tremendous difference in my skin after applying it for a month.</li>
            <li> I loosened and softened up the butter, first of all by running some hot water on top of the tub</li>
            <li> It did not melt quickly as others have stated.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my sons stretch marks, the meds he was put on for his headaches has made him gain weight to quickly</li>
            <li> and I used it to prevent stretch marks while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> :) I really appreciate their response and and quick action to make things better.</li>
            <li> The butter seems to have a grainy texture at first, but as soon as it warms up on your skin it becomes smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, and I would definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter before and have pretty much been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> and I really hope they don&#x27;t all smell this strong.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil, cocoa butter, sweet almond oil to make my own body and face lotion.  </li>
            <li> I normally use neutrogena for sensitive skin but it doesn&#x27;t help as nearly as good as shea butter..</li>
            <li> Ok first of all it arrived fast but it has no smell to it</li>
            <li> the product overall is pretty good.</li>
            <li> i have used shea butter that was processed before but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try since i have had problems w my combination skin which is also very sensitive to most products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for dryness!!!</li>
            <li> And I love that its all natural!</li>
            <li> I run out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I love using natural products and this Shea butter didn&#x27;t did not disappoint me!</li>
            <li> The gold and ivory shea butters are both shea butter, but the ivory is more creamy and effective against eczema, it&#x27;s also less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the black soap is by far the best soap I have ever used</li>
            <li> It is very greasy and smelly and the color is less than ideal.</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency, unlike one I previously ordered from another seller.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered the product based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its great products for my hair and stretch marks but smells so bad lol</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my face (apply lightly) and really see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the benefits of this Shea Butter, it is real.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is very creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much I finished the entire thing in 2 months time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle product, but my skin is indeed more supple and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Nice container, melts smoothly and serves as an excellent base for our DIY shaving cream and lotions.</li>
            <li> Unless you have something else to put it in, it&#x27;s worth paying for the package, in my view.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more manageable, easier to style, and quite soft.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll make sure to read about that part if it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much worth</li>
            <li> Fresh out the box.</li>
            <li> it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> when used regularly, this is extremely effective in softening skin...</li>
            <li> it was in a larger container kind of lumped in there and</li>
            <li> It was golden and in a container like the picture.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, fresher, and it is clearing up nicely which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> More clear..</li>
            <li> Fresh and nutty, smooth, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> No real negatives, good product.</li>
            <li> I love the benefits of this product but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li> my skin is soft and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> When i used it overnight i liked it the next morning but with my routine i shower in the mornings</li>
            <li> I just started making my own lip balm and such.</li>
            <li> I make my own deep conditioner with avocado, shea butter, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> It make your skin look glowy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the natural feeling on this shea butter.</li>
            <li> The shea butter alone has a nice nutty earthy smell that can be blended well with essential oils.</li>
            <li> For a natural product it sure beats my skin up.</li>
            <li> but instead I got two nice containers of \\&quot;African Shea Butter 100%</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it absorbed faster.</li>
            <li> I got this to go to a more natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I feel it works better than pertroleum jelly at keeping their skin clear.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what keep it fresh, To eliminate the greasy look</li>
            <li> As expected, good quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix with a lighter oil such as olive or safflower to make it smooth on better.</li>
            <li> I mean, it works but after purchasing better quality Shea butter (available on Amazon), I realize how inferior this kind is.</li>
            <li> I also put a little dab in my palm and mix it with my liquid foundation with very nice results.  </li>
            <li> and it was full of bacteria ( black spot every where ) l didn&#x27;t expect the Shea butter that way because before l order l reed the comment and at was so good</li>
            <li> This was a great product; shipping package was a plastic container--sealed good; will definitely order again; I use raw shea butter as a moisturizer on my face and my body; very seldom do i wear makeup</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this shea butter because it&#x27;s pure and natural, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the very strong smell.</li>
            <li> It holds in the moisture well and adsorbs into her skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter arrived quickly and is amazing on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought shea butter before from other places and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Not too much  and in a nicely accessible tub.  </li>
            <li> Just be prepared to have slimy skin, other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li> It will melt right away.</li>
            <li> Anyway this helped right away with smoothing my skin, healing my scalp,and once added with rx hydrocortisone</li>
            <li> After trying out some DIY&#x27;s I tried using this right from plastic container it comes</li>
            <li> I use it right after my bath</li>
            <li> This stuff on Amazon isn&#x27;t even the right color.</li>
            <li> but I could not get this to smell right.  </li>
            <li> Decided to go right to the source.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll soften right</li>
            <li> I like the shea butter cream, it works right into the skin not oily</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t make it right.  </li>
            <li> It is all right.</li>
            <li> This is pure African shea butter- good for everything from daily lotion to minor burn relief, a mild spf, and even a great replacement for chapstick.</li>
            <li> We live in the Colorado rockies where the weather is very dry and this has been a great find.</li>
            <li> There was/is no need to warm it up, I can easily scoop a little in my hand and spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t melt it down because once you rub it in your hands it starts to smooth out on its own.</li>
            <li> just a little more refined this time but the same great quality.</li>
            <li> You need very little for great results.  </li>
            <li> My better half ordered this magic cream.  </li>
            <li> and I swear if there ever was a true miracle cream that could really multitask it would be Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It does have an unusual scent, but not bad.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t keep this item in a moist and warm area for too long though, because it&#x27;ll start molding.  </li>
            <li> This is a pure, clean shea butter product which can be used for so many different things.  </li>
            <li> You start noticing the difference in your skin right away after the first application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective for dry skin, hair, and blemishes.</li>
            <li> so far I think the actual Shea butter is good.</li>
            <li> It healed a sore super fast that I used it on.</li>
            <li> Quick, I Really Like That.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I believe it contributed to my hair growing super fast</li>
            <li> I loved it and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li> We have tried sensitive creams like Eucerin and Burts Bees, but he gets hives and turns bright red from these creams.  </li>
            <li> I was able to break off some of these chunks, I was able to take a few bits and apply the butter.</li>
            <li> Mine came in a baggie, no container, I personally would have preferred a container especially since that is what the picture shows, otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> It came super fast</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The seller was very fast on</li>
            <li> my husband used this and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> but I actually like in the raw the best.  </li>
            <li> I simply left it out on my kitchen counter for a bit with the lid off and it was super easy to scoop out to measure once at room temp.</li>
            <li> it is not soft and pliable like a cream, so i found a little scrapper is perfect for digging some out and then you emulsify it between your palms before applying.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product a 5 on its conditioning properties -- very much makes one&#x27;s skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We plan on getting a couple of nice smelling essential oils and possibly a little Jojoba oil to mix with this to make a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I use the small 8oz tub that was securely sealed, fresh, &amp; easy-to-use by either a clean foundation brush , q-tip, teaspoon, &amp; super clean fingertip (do not re-dip or that may contaminate &amp; spoil product).</li>
            <li> so I cannot testify for that component but for instant healing of dry skin, it is superior to many  many other oils (coconut, avacado, etc)</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> If I need to soften it, I just put the container in a sink of hot water.  </li>
            <li> For first time I scooped a portion with spoon</li>
            <li> I had planned to use this in homemade lotion or lip balm, but I want to use this stuff straight out of the tub as is!  </li>
            <li> When the Shea Butter came at first I did not know what to make of it.</li>
            <li> The only product that seems to be able to tackle these bear claws of mine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that it would arrive in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever done for any product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the scent and texture will be better if it&#x27;s used in smaller concentrations.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it never fails.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it!sy.</li>
            <li> First of all, it did not weigh in at 8 ounces as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This stuff had more grits in it than a Southern restaurant.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this product</li>
            <li> In reading the mixed reviews, many people commented on the smell.</li>
            <li> and this makes me so smooth an soft.  </li>
            <li> I have received exactly the seller describe.</li>
            <li> It has really been keeping my hair and skin moisturized!</li>
            <li> I am dumping it and going back to brands which are more consistent in quality.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever bought Shea butter, and it has persuaded me to buy it now from my trusted vitamin company where I see they also have it.</li>
            <li> if you find the smell okay, but in need of improvement, you can use an essential oil it</li>
            <li> Threw it out because its too much of hassle to return...lesson learned!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this that I ordered the larger tub of it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR USING ON A LOT OF THINGS (BODY) &amp; LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves this!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any brand of Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known to come to amazon first.</li>
            <li> It does melt well and it may function better in a different application.  </li>
            <li> Came in fast too!</li>
            <li> so there was definitely room in the container for more than I received.</li>
            <li> This was the first Shea butter I purchased when I began my foray into DIY skincare.</li>
            <li> Authentic shea butter is never this yellow (more like off white) and has a nutty smell, not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I would apply it all over my face</li>
            <li> I avoid my cheeks since their already pretty oily...</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something to help my mom with her eczema and this is the first product that has gotten the job done.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I use in the winter and mix it with oils.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product to those looking for real skin care results!</li>
            <li> I first used it at night and noticed by morning</li>
            <li> i will be coming back to buy some more.</li>
            <li> I made the solid lotion bars and lip balm, I realized I am never buying lotion or lip balm again, so I&#x27;ve ordered more shea butter from this seller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great moisturizer, use generously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: There is shea butter in a beige/ivory color commonly known as Ivory Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Before application, I wash my face with cetaphil first.</li>
            <li> It is very beneficial and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It helps to make my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a bit at the first signs of redness.</li>
            <li> Do your research first.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> A++ thanks again!  </li>
            <li> As your body dries it absorbs the shea butter and water leaving skin much softer for a longer period of time!</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be buying it again and from this seller</li>
            <li> I have just ordered 2 more &amp; will continue to order from this same seller(please</li>
            <li> I added coconut oil to this after letting it sit in hot water and it smells like coconut now.  </li>
            <li> I will be interested to see what I can do with this.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying shea butter</li>
            <li> This arrived in 2 days and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This product workers exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> First time ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has kind of a strange, herbal smell, but I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li> AND I SIT THE CONTAINER IN THE BOWL OF HOT WATER</li>
            <li> THE FIRST STEP (HOT  WATER IN BOWL AN</li>
            <li> SIT THE BOTTLE IN HOT WATER</li>
            <li> so if you decide to buy it be aware of it.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> First time to order shea butter.</li>
            <li> Even in the hot, summer months I use this product and it soaks up into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, this is my first</li>
            <li> First, I put on coconut oil, followed by magnesium oil, then Shea Butter to seal in these oils.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with my hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> This if my first time sharing my opinion about a product</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Shea butter</li>
            <li> I rather have it present as an indicator of the Shea butter being authentic.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t allow it to become too hot.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many different hair lotions and oil</li>
            <li> First time working with Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was my first try.</li>
            <li> At first, the smell through me off.</li>
            <li> You can never have too much of this stuff around!</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned</li>
            <li> Very nourishing!</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much!</li>
            <li> so you do have to rub it in your hands first to create frictional heat.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first brand of Shea butter</li>
            <li> It does have a funny smell to it</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great especially for dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> It has the typical nutty scent of Shea without it being overpowering and blends/melts well into my lip balms an lotions, as well as being great used direct.</li>
            <li> This brand is very moist and creamy, melts right into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with the sole intention to switch out buying store bought lotions with something more organic, more natural for my ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received my package today (3 days early) and I was really excited.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 100% shea butter from two other sources, but I liked the price on this shea.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of making my own butters, or adding peppermint or some other oils to this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to see if there was a difference between this shea butter and any other kind.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered other shea butter which was smooth and easy</li>
            <li> The product is good quality and it is raw as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the yellow color was so bright that it stained my clothes it touched.</li>
            <li> because of the natural vitamin content, i know it will be effective at softening my facial blemishes...</li>
            <li> This does make your skin incredibly soft and healthy, there is no doubt about that, but dont forget that this is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always need a styler in my natural hair after putting in the shea butter, but if I want more curl definition then I just add Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls.</li>
            <li> It really is 100% Shea butter for this LOW price, i would recommend this to all women who are trying to keep their skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really been able to try it on my hair since I have been recently wearing braids</li>
            <li> i just need to warm it up for 30 sec in microwave then its ready to use ..</li>
            <li> next time I&#x27;ll get the 32oz for sure, 100% pure shea butter is a certain staple for all people.</li>
            <li> Pure shea butter is also pretty funky smelling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to just take a big bowl, hand-held mixer, and these few natural ingredients to make a skin moisturizer that is so much better for your skin, smells better, is cheaper, and without all the parabens, coloring, and \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; that most store bought lotions contain.</li>
            <li> It is bright yellow, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it really is pure shea butter, as it states on the container.  </li>
            <li> At room temperature it&#x27;s pretty solid, but melts easily at skin temperature.</li>
            <li> They gave a positive review for this product.</li>
            <li> I did positive experience with the seller (Nail Polish Supplies).</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING for crows feet,  dark circles and puffys.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy for the first 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it, and it&#x27;s very versatile too!</li>
            <li> but I wanted to make lotions bars and it did the job perfectly..nothing to compare it to since its the first time I used it, but its got to be the real deal the way it performs</li>
            <li> This really smooths my skin all over and gives me a really pretty glow.</li>
            <li> My elbows, knees, and feet are pretty much sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> After much digging around on amazon to find a good source for raw shea butter, I found this listing.</li>
            <li> It is soft at room temperature, very easy to apply, and leaves no stains since it is an off white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I open the container and it is PACKED full!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any dry skin problem, just love to feel and see my skin hydrated and this works.</li>
            <li> It soaked in quickly and my skin felt soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Oily, yes, slightly smelly, yes, effective, yes.</li>
            <li> bought it because of the great reviews that it could get rid of stretch marks and dark spots, but I havent had such luck.</li>
            <li> It was also relatively easy to mask the smoky scent with some lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li> I throw a bit more in as I&#x27;m putting in the leave in so that it will act as a heat protectant when I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is rather strong but that can be remedied with essential oils.</li>
            <li> It is definitely strong enough to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it has a strong Shea smell</li>
            <li> I bought a large container for home and an 8 oz container for travel.</li>
            <li> 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Pure shea butter is offWHITE, you should never need to microwave it because it is a butter.</li>
            <li> I could see how the funky smelling pure shea butter would though.</li>
            <li> Its pure luxury.</li>
            <li> but they fade faster with pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever used pure Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to apply to large areas.</li>
            <li> It came and it looked and smelled like  pure Shea Butter</li>
            <li> the kind of stuff you should slather on your hands during a dry winter and sleep with mitts on, you&#x27;d wake up with baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter &amp; here&#x27;s what I thought of this particular \\&quot;brand\\&quot;:&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item comes just as pictured, in a nice little tub.  </li>
            <li> And, it is good to soften it between your hands or in the microwave because it is quite hard in the container.</li>
            <li> It works great for knees, hands, elbows, and other areas that are prone to get dry.</li>
            <li> I put some on and LITERALLY 3 minutes later I had huge acne marks on my face, It legit appeared almost as soon as I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> Instead I whipped this into a fluffy body butter incorporating in coconut and argan oils with amazing moisturizing results.</li>
            <li> The butter if warmed is much easier to apply onto skin.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and during the winter, it really acts out.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter has made my life so much easier, I also like to use it in the place of lotion and suggest it to everyone with a skin problem.</li>
            <li> but it takes effort to make it ready to use on hair.</li>
            <li> I rub this between my hands and sparingly apply, and it really softens my hair without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether it would really cure the issue, but it seems to help soothe the skin.</li>
            <li> since too much shea butter can make one&#x27;s face look greasy.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really moisturizing...</li>
            <li> However, its very versatile in its use</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I would not let the smell keep you from making the purchase if it really bothered you, you could mix it with a fragrant oil.</li>
            <li> the product is very grainy.</li>
            <li> it really works</li>
            <li> so ladies you really need to try this post pics of stomach soon</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very oily so use in moderation.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really describe it.</li>
            <li> this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> but it really does goes on your skin very well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The shipping for this item was fast.</li>
            <li> I have several grand worth of photo equipment but why would I even bother to keep taking a picture of the same thing over and over again my friend.</li>
            <li> Thanks folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> It makes the whole skin feel supple while it glides</li>
            <li> I am using some of this &#x27;straight&#x27; on my skin and will be blending some with coconut oil to create a somewhat lighter cream.</li>
            <li> Every exposure to water absolutely requires I apply moisturizer immediately after.</li>
            <li> It  looks very grainy and I thought it would leave a residue.</li>
            <li> It is very absorbent, soothing, and non greasy/non oily.</li>
            <li> It really has helped with my arthritis and fibromyalgiaand</li>
            <li> Really helped my heels and my hubby&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> I believe the Tea Tree Oil prevents you from breaking out when using it (from researching so much).</li>
            <li> but you really just still smell the shay butter.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I used this so that may be normal.</li>
            <li> a normal thing of pregnancy (first baby).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have so much of this, it will be awhile.</li>
            <li> The product its self is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use in on my neck and chest for wrinkles and have really noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my son&#x27;s eczema and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put on too much..</li>
            <li> Too much hassle to deal with damaged merchandise return.</li>
            <li> Really does work for my ashy feet.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s a cheaper fix for moisturizer, but I did get some real ivory shea butter on here</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend you looking into the benefits of magnesium... and this recipe!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Real shea butter should be off-white / beige.</li>
            <li> I melted it in the microwave, section my hair, ran this non greasy gold on my hair, and ready for bed.</li>
            <li> I make it into a homemade body butter or just straight out of the container.</li>
            <li> and I really hope its Shea Butter (It smells and feels like it)...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about it .I</li>
            <li> not getting what you paid for, very misleading....</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my legs and feet feeling really greasey.  </li>
            <li> AN READY TO BE USED.ANOTHER PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the real deal and with that you get some of its stinkiness.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic and will be the only shea butter I use.  </li>
            <li> Very well might be.  </li>
            <li> I would rate it 5 stars, except that it is very tacky in nature</li>
            <li> This product is very grainy.</li>
            <li> I really dont like living in oklahoma city</li>
            <li> The lotion bars turned out very well.</li>
            <li> This was a very creamy butter.</li>
            <li> Don not have a whole lot of experience with Shea Butters.</li>
            <li> I have used a different Shea butter that was smooth when applying.</li>
            <li> but you can feel it absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> The product was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> It took much more to cover the scent than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Prepare for a paste, I keep my hands very damp when using and the moisture blends into a heavenly balm.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no odor and is just lovely and smoothing on one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> etc etc etc.. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used it when my boyfriend had stitches in his face and it helped it heal fast.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, and very sparingly on the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> A perfect skin remedy for cold weather.</li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> ,it moisturize my hands really well</li>
            <li> , It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love natural products I have brought this product several times.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not really shea butter, it&#x27;s good African butter.</li>
            <li> If it is BRIGHT yellow, it is not pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> What I received was genuine Shea butter that appears to be both raw, pure and very fresh.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> first of all, it&#x27;s supposed to be white, secondly the consistency should be like a chunk but very smooth and lotiony to the touch -</li>
            <li> One arrived bright yellow, the other a moldy greenish gold (think spicy brown mustard).  </li>
            <li> I think someone with super dry skin and super dry hair would love this since it is all natural and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Used it in a recipe for cold and flu chest rub, worked very nicely!</li>
            <li> I tried more things (from other people&#x27;s suggestions) like whipping it with coconut oil and use it ..</li>
            <li> This is why I updated my original review, since I actually tried the product.</li>
            <li> but when I opened it I like products like this to have a sealed cover but it didn&#x27;t but other than that I love it</li>
            <li> It seems to be working and without all the chemicals in other rubs which makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to all-natural plant oil skin care regimen and was excited to try the shea butter, especially after reading all the glowing reviews about it.  </li>
            <li> Of all the shea butter I have purchased, in store or online this one had the most grit and other stuff in it.  </li>
            <li> Love to make personal care products using this rich, emollient shea butter (among other ingredients).</li>
            <li> My other problem is that when i put it on I have a greasy feeling on my skin all day and my face also looks greasy all day, and many people have told me that its not supposed to be that way which means it is refined.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s golden yellow and melts down nicely to make body butters.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re buying it for the raw properties, that kind of defeats the purpose, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he has found that used regularly, it keeps the grime from becoming embedded in his skin, keeps his cuticles soft, and otherwise keeps his hands from looking like a mechanics.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my legs and it was a little harder to spread than i thought it would be, but after using some water to rub it in a bit more it felt nice and soft.</li>
            <li> great stuff, though hers was a little dry and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter has a nutty, earthy scent which I don&#x27;t find terribly pleasant (smells a little like dirt) but I combined it with cocoa butter and some scented essential oil to make a whipped body butter.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin protection I&#x27;ve found for thin, dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li> Soft enough for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Local</li>
            <li> I am VERY new to using this product.</li>
            <li> After one single application of said magic cream, they are already transforming from crusty, chalky, sharp implements of torture to leathery smooth &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dry skin or fine lines who doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical-laden products.</li>
            <li> but I know an organic place that gives a bigger container full of shea butter for 5 dollars</li>
            <li> The one consistent thing was natural Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It smells like... hot crayons and funk or something, but it is forever soft.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is 100% natural, in that it mixes cocoa butter oil to offset that smell and entice you with a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> normal lotion really can&#x27;t repair that.</li>
            <li> so i usually have to scoop some out, warm it up by rubbing it together in my hands and then apply</li>
            <li> but soon I became creative and added scented oil after melting it down.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter and use it every day on my face and other parts!</li>
            <li> but there was no reaction, &amp;  the less the better</li>
            <li> There is no real smell and it melts quickly so it is easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> A bit oily but the smooth, soft feeling last for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I am used to shea butter being creamy with a mild scent, but this shea was gritty and smells of rancid fat.</li>
            <li> African American beauty supply stores in my area provide more product for the price.</li>
            <li> I rub it between my hands, creating the heat necessary to make it into a soft, smooth cream consistency</li>
            <li> but ..I absolutely love his product and am a big fan of it not only for my skin but my hair as well</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for any pregnant mamas out there wanting to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Its super oily and has a gritty consistency.  </li>
            <li> When I received it it was very crumbly, I expected it to be smooth and creamy</li>
            <li> It does have that lovely yellow hue which I&#x27;ve been told is an extra nut that has been added when producing Shea butter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mainly because this one has a stronger nutty smell than the ivory version of the product.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it&#x27;s currently super freezing here on the East Coast</li>
            <li> When mixed with oil, it makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging is rather casual (unlabeled, plastic tub), this African shea butter is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li> Was recommended shea butter for my djembe to help moisturize the goat skin, it works great so far, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts forever</li>
            <li> i dont think its real shea butter, so i stop using it on my face, but i notice that it leaves my feet very soft</li>
            <li> It has many benefits, such as it has improved my complexion significantly and has lightened my dark marks from old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular Shea butter  brand</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reliable source of pure shea butter because now that it&#x27;s getting popular, the price is ridiculous in some places.</li>
            <li> And with high moisturizing</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> and therefore I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It was rock-hard in the plastic container and needed about a minute of microwaving on high before I could even sort of scoop it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it, it&#x27;s extremely moisturising and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not like it because I was not able to dress up right away after applying it and this butter cream leaves a yellow color on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth - not grainy and dry!</li>
            <li> My heels feel smooth, no longer dry and cracked!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> And I also found out that &#x27;Organic&#x27; does not mean &#x27;No Chemical Extraction&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair, I am an African American woman with natural hair (not chemically straightened) and I use it to seal in moisture after I add all my other hair stuff in lol...</li>
            <li> although kind of hard to get off the plastic jar (I use a plastic spoon to scrape it)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not packaging appropriately , and the shea butter sealing to the other product !!</li>
            <li> and it really helps with moisturizing my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I think I like this product for my hair mostly after I have blow dried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same golden color as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love this product, clears my sons eczema  up within a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but wanted others to know</li>
            <li> but now I only put it where the skin is the driest like for me.. under eyes and my laugh lines and neck.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the extra work.</li>
            <li> I normally use - but it leaves a greasy residue which I&#x27;m not used to.</li>
            <li> I left good feedback but also told them how the container was cracked (I found out when I 1st heated it MESSY!)</li>
            <li> If you plan on using Shea butter for a face moisturizer, I can see how people with oily skin may not enjoy this product...will probably just make your face more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a week I could visibly see my skin return to normal.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have made a few purchases from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just started using this a few days ago and it feels better than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hands looking 10 years younger &amp; helps reduce smile lines.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> If you even get a cut from shaving your legs it immediately heals faster than it normally would and the mark will fade as if nothing was there.</li>
            <li> Honestly I would go to my local african market to purchase this product because its just simply cheaper.</li>
            <li> Nice thick texture.</li>
            <li> It is still however usable with a little heat to melt it down and if you are ok with a strong scent of Shea butter</li>
            <li> african shea butter can be used to treat dry skin (eczema/chapped lips etc.) , for darker tanning, softening calluses, and also a great moisturizer for african american hair...</li>
            <li> Definitely apart of my normal hair regimen and will be for awhile!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Use it with the African black soap and your skin will look amazing.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin is super soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hair when I&#x27;m deep conditioning and it leaves it super soft.</li>
            <li> and i love it so far it doesn&#x27;t break me out like other natural products</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as of right now.</li>
            <li> If you live in a pretty hot area you probably won&#x27;t reach that point in this &#x27;shea&#x27; butter&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;I, for extra skin benefits and smoothability, ended up just melting the butter down and mixing it with jojoba oil (probably your skin&#x27;s favorite substance), and let it reform back to a butter again.</li>
            <li> You get a pretty decent tube of this stuff - 8 ounces of yellow shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It cuts down on breakage by keeping hair moisturized and strong.</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my face in the winter months, it keeps my face and neck moisturized, but I use it on my 4 yr old son all year long to help heal all of his scraps and scars and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for very dry skinned individuals such as myself, would be overkill for someone without dry skin though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new thing.</li>
            <li> We have been putting on a newly healing tattoo and the healing power of Shea Butter</li>
            <li> My husband found this product at a flea market in New Orleans.</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter has an earthy smell to it, which many people may not realize.</li>
            <li> I have been using raw Shea Butter for YEARS and love what it has done for my skin and scars.</li>
            <li> The vender dealt with me fairly and sent me an extra shea butter for the late shipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for more natural and organic products without harsh chemicals for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> After receiving it, I noticed it had an odd, strong smell.</li>
            <li> In two to three weeks her face was very clear.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive &amp; oily face</li>
            <li> Since using it my hair is a lot easier to manage, is very soft and not as tangled after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Your skin is very soft after using expecially after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> When you put it on your skin, it goes into it very naturally.</li>
            <li> Very soft and works well.</li>
            <li> is always very soft whenever I do use it.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the shea butter keeps my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair and skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This is pretty solid as room temperature and holds up well to  fluctuating temperature changes.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 8 oz and one of the first thing I did was weigh it on my digital scale.  </li>
            <li> I love the shea butter, this is about the (overall) 3rd or 4th order, just from different sellers.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with actual Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It is so natural!</li>
            <li> I recommend Shea Butter for anyone, with natural curly hair!</li>
            <li> i surprised!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have stretch marks on the first 8 months of my pregnancy using only lotion and sometimes cocoa butter, and I didn&#x27;t scratch.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not greasy if I use a small amount, and any more is just a waste!</li>
            <li> Whipped up w/some African Hair Oil and it came out very creamy!  </li>
            <li> I had to pay extra shipping on my first order(like</li>
            <li> This shea butter is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using shea butter in lotions or soaps, unrefined shea will generally need to be gently melted and strained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I were to go back in time, I would remove the product from the original container, and perhaps use a double boiler to melt.</li>
            <li> The yellow color, well, this is the only product that I have seen it in yellow, the rest are more vanilla colored.</li>
            <li> It also had a moderate scent unique to Shea, an almost smoky and nutty scent similar to rubbery oud.</li>
            <li> Was amazed at the fact the moisturizing effect lasted for nearly 48 hours--will buy again!</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair, and it keeps it so soft and well moisturized for days!</li>
            <li> I never review items, but i was very pleasantly surprised by this Shea butter!</li>
            <li> Very thick, very crumbly, very easy to just mix into your palms, though.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly excited to get my pound of 100% pure and unprocessed African Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It hasnt really helped with my hyperpigmentation issues which is the main reason for my purchase, but I still recommend purchasing for a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There is a bar code on top, letters and number under  the bar code and reads, \\&quot;African Shea Butter Cream...0% Pure Raw and Gold</li>
            <li> It is amazing that just a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> The product stinks to high heaven but is a great way to moisturize extra-dry areas like heels.  </li>
            <li> Really liking this as kind of a leave-in deep conditioner, such as when I know I won&#x27;t be doing anything for a few days</li>
            <li> I found some other shea butter that I love, but it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li> I use it often and add my own essential oils to smaller containers and mix it with other oil like oilve, hazelnut and apricot kernel oil.</li>
            <li> This time it is melted smooth in a container half the size</li>
            <li> sinks in fast, it can be a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li> When applied to a sunburn I felt instant relief and my skin healed much faster than normal.</li>
            <li> This batch came in the mail today and it is like no raw shea butter I&#x27;ve used before...</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The product has a rich nutty aroma and it&#x27;s not too oily or greasy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> it is easy to break down as it softens right up to mix with hair oils and other products.</li>
            <li> After just a few seconds of rubbing it between the hands, it looses the grainy texture and becomes very creamy and easy enough to spread.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really smooth and soft especially during this dry winter season .</li>
            <li> After a few applications you&#x27;ll notice that fine lines reduce (I&#x27;ve been a fan for about 6 years now).</li>
            <li> Could never find pure shea butter in the stores so I finally checked on here.</li>
            <li> Shea butter should not be yellow if it is pure.</li>
            <li> I scoop up a little bit of product and rub between my palms and it warms quickly to a smooth and creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t mind because it is much better environmentally than a large hard plastic container.</li>
            <li> Pure natural shea butter is an off white color.</li>
            <li> i bought to use for my very very VERY dry skin an it didn&#x27;t really help, i don&#x27;t really like the smokey ashy kinda smell either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate a product that needs more time for result.  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because it&#x27;s hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I may start using it on my skin too since it&#x27;s soooo cold lately lol.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer during cold weather and also protector from sun.</li>
            <li> hopefully it will clear up those marks as well...</li>
            <li> The packet clearly stated that this brand is not FDA approved.</li>
            <li> The picture clearly shows a container, but it came today in a flimsy plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of things for my extra sensitive face ..as much as i wanted this to work</li>
            <li> The package says 100% shea butter, which is clearly a lie.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait , clear skin is calling you...</li>
            <li> He said since its a natural product, depending on the season the product texture varies.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I do not put any chemicals on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I apply it to the affected areas and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It is soft and incorporated into the recipe without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought it for mom since she has natural hair.</li>
            <li> so far i like it.  </li>
            <li> I guess you could add some scented essential oils if it really bothers you.</li>
            <li> and wow..</li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> Product is grainy unlike natural Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> I was surprised that my skin didn&#x27;t feel greasy after I used it.  </li>
            <li> The combination should help fade my scars completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is indeed natural.</li>
            <li> I am natural and purchased this for my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I really wish time was take to refigerate so that it didn&#x27;t liquify and then become solid again.</li>
            <li> Plus its natural and doesn’t clog pores.</li>
            <li> So far I have melted it in the microwave</li>
            <li> However, it is in no way 100% natural and never expires like the container claims.</li>
            <li> it is all natural and unscented.  </li>
            <li> but overall I came fast</li>
            <li> As far as my skin is concerned I immediately saw the difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t promise this method will work for everyone trying to solve PIH issues but it will contribute to the natural healing process by \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; things out for you.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re soft and glowing like a god/goddess.</li>
            <li> ( I am natural btw)</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> so I have old burn scars.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my body, I also used in a recipe for hair care treatment makes your hair soft</li>
            <li> this is old rancid bacon grease.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 100% natural form.</li>
            <li> Recommend watching KinkyTresses&#x27; YouTube Channel and Video titled &amp;#34;Tips on Applying Unrefined Shea Butter to Afro-Textured Natural Hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair and skin soft.</li>
            <li> but wow..</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I had to trash it because my skin so sensitive</li>
            <li> I just have so sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m A Natural Chic.</li>
            <li> As far as the package goes i had no&lt;br /&gt;issues</li>
            <li> I use it on both my body and my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a full-on eczema cure, but it does treat it in the early stages.</li>
            <li> I use the smallest amount at night and in the morning my skin is incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have since acquired real shea butter (an acquaintance brought back from Nigeria) and . . .</li>
            <li> I use it frequently...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unscented and in its natural state.</li>
            <li> It is a natural wonder cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li> i went to a health store and bought a chipper one that is soft like butter.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s working just find so far.</li>
            <li> I use it instead if petroleum based products for my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> I use this in my lotion recipes, in my hair, and on my three month old.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my hands and face &amp; WOW</li>
            <li> the seller did not pay complete shipping)I contacted the seller through email &amp; they refunded my shipping completely.</li>
            <li> It is very viscous and you will likely need to microwave it every time you use it just to soften it.</li>
            <li> my hair is shiny n soft.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s natural, so</li>
            <li> :IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT TO THE TOUCH,IT GIVES YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> VEINS.I THINK IT&#x27;S A NATURAL SKIN</li>
            <li> A must have for natural product lovers.</li>
            <li> It make it feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> and when i used this cream  i has sensitive</li>
            <li> Works well in my homemade deodorant and keeps my armpit soft.</li>
            <li> This seems to help so far.</li>
            <li> The eczema is basically gone now and his skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> my sink was so soft</li>
            <li> I feel any inconvenience is merited by avoiding all the additives that most companies place in their products that negatively impact your body.</li>
            <li> By the way, I found by researching that even if Shea Butter is extracted using chemicals, it can still be called &#x27;Natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> After a time, it is not greasy feeling but soft and natural.</li>
            <li> my skin has a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I decided to reserve it for use on my feet, as far away from my nose as I could get, but I could still smell it and it was unacceptable.</li>
            <li> So much so that I just placed another order with them for a larger quantity and will leave a separate review when that arrives.</li>
            <li> This product works well when it comes to making your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> For soft skin, by it.</li>
            <li> But I like the natural smell of it with the coconut and almond oil</li>
            <li> have natural curly hair so while im swimming, i let the shea butter melt in the sun and put in on my hair when I get out of the pool.</li>
            <li> I have a natural hair (Afro).</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t use much, just worked it into the ends and left it on overnight)</li>
            <li> but once you rub it on your skin the smell completely disappears.</li>
            <li> This butter made my stretch marks completely disappear after using it for three weeks.</li>
            <li> once you use this product you will never go back to using drug store lotions that claim to have real shea butter in them.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the same time as the Molivera Organics product and I like it much</li>
            <li> Worked well for that use and keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;• Has not dealt with my sensitive skin prone to heat</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s in your hand its soft and creamy..</li>
            <li> But you can also find this at your local (hair store, beauty mart) and its much cheaper ...</li>
            <li> I cut all of my hair off (it was relaxed) to almost a faded hair cut so that I could grow out my natural texture.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure you could add a few drops of essential oils to it.</li>
            <li> My face seems a lot more smoother and it seems like my blemishes are fading slowly from using this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty large amount and will last me a very long time</li>
            <li> I play African drumming and my instructor highly recommend me apply Shea butter after drumming, because my hands can easily get dried and cracked after drumming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell is not over-powering like other 100% pure shea butters are and it works fast.</li>
            <li> This product was much better than the other, more expensive brand,  I will reorder this when she runs out again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very rich, creamy and thick</li>
            <li> I am an AA woman and have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li> have been melting in microwave half a spoon full for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Most shea butters are hard and I find that they have to be mixed with oils or heated a little to spread easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard but also very easy to pinch enough off and rub it in your hands.</li>
            <li> Deeply moisturizing, Stimulating for the superficial microcirculation, Skin strengthening, Skin protecting, UV protecting, Skin regenerating,  Collagen production stimulating (makes the skin stronger, more supple and younger), Minor cuts and burns healing, Muscle ache healing, Physical endurance enhancer...</li>
            <li> I researched pure &amp; raw Shea Butter prior to my purchase and found the yellow, nutty fragrant variety to have exceptional properties as compared to some other variations.</li>
            <li> I used this to make lip balm and other then the tint of the product it works AMAZING as a mosturizer added with other products mixed in.</li>
            <li> Now, I normally don&#x27;t mind plant smells at all; in fact, I enjoy them and have quite a few essential oils in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> But smells a bit yucky and has a little greasy film vs hard cocoa butter that goes on with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> As a user of shea butter for years, I&#x27;m aware of good and bad.</li>
            <li> And in a plastic baggie, no less - not even in a container.  </li>
            <li> it is just as pictured same exact canister and same color ....</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works better than any lotion or cream I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The lid is exactly the same and the sticker, so from the product view I thought I would get the same amount as I did from another seller.</li>
            <li> However, my container was crushed and cracked when I received it (probably more the fault of the post office than the seller) and the shea butter was not packed down in the container</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because I wanted a new natural product for my facial regime.</li>
            <li> I use this with African black soap and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Your skin absorbs it quickly so there&#x27;s no greasy residue and the smell is minimal, similar to cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> REAL RAW SHEA BUTTER does wonders:)</li>
            <li> I would use the shea butter to help lock in moisture on my hair and on my older daughter who has very long and thick chunky hair :-).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I notice my rough elbows and feet becoming sooooo soft as well as the dark spots fading.</li>
            <li> I have only been able to get it on him once, the smell is not very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Only draw back is because it is pure Shea</li>
            <li> The only downside is I think the product might have been mixed with palm oil - so it isn&#x27;t actually &#x27;pure&#x27; Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased pure shea butter multiple times from various places and nothing looks like this stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use not so hard</li>
            <li> Natural raw Shea butter in a nice little jar.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a few other ingredients and the results are nice.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the smell, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I really like the result of the mixture on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I put the mixture in her hair and scalp before I blow dry and her hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very strong and to me it is worth dealing with to have a product that works so well.</li>
            <li> this stuff does work very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> If applying this product directly to the skin, I recommend putting it on straight out of the shower WHILE your body is still wet.</li>
            <li> It is very rancid, please double check your shipments and storage before you ship products next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used white shea butter from Whole Foods before, but I wanted to try out this stuff to see if &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; was any different.</li>
            <li> I mix it in with my regular body lotion to give it a little boost and that pretty much takes care of the smell.  </li>
            <li> it help my skin stay soft and irritate less after shaving, it is easy to use, last a long time</li>
            <li> Definitely helped it clear up!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to any other product, because this is the first time I&#x27;ve used shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Product was melted due to hot weather.</li>
            <li> Shea butter has major healing properties.</li>
            <li> and no other lotions were doing the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> an some other products an made a lotion that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This little tub will last you forever -- definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a little different is it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but very hard to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> The container arrived full to the max of raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> i was curious how pure this product was going to be...</li>
            <li> I love this 100% pure and raw African Shea butter cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is less dry, my hair is easier to manager and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> This was not as smooth as other Shea&#x27;s I have purchased in the past, this one had a very gritty feeling to it when you first put on.</li>
            <li> I bought pure shea butter from another vendor on Amazon that was white, and the smell was not nearly as overpowering.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s butter its kinda thick but its very soft &amp; melts quickly when you spread it</li>
            <li> and it came out very creamy and smooth but by the second day when it became hard again I put it back in the microwave for 10secs and it turned into oil and took 3 days to become solid again</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet and it really softens any rough spots.  </li>
            <li> However what I received was not the same color as the  all natural shae butter that I buy in stores.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face several times a week near bedtime.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter based on the reviews I&#x27;d read, but apparently I have an allergy to it.</li>
            <li> My husband is currently trying it and has had no adverse reaction thus far.</li>
            <li> BUT if you catch the rash when it is barely forming it can stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I melt tiny amount of it in microwave and mix it with my nivea soft cream and apply on my face every night.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near 8 fluid ounces.</li>
            <li> have mixed skin and overly sensitive, yet this stuff doeasnt make me break out.</li>
            <li> It feels oily initially, but after 5 minutes, it just makes your hands and body feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, instead of being soft int he tub, this brand of shea butter is basically a solid brick in the tub.</li>
            <li> Look for an off white shea butter, and ask the seller ahead of time if the butter is soft and malleable in the tub, or whether you have to apply construction worker tools to it to get it to break up before you can use</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much on or you will be slipping and sliding in yo&#x27; sandals.</li>
            <li> However, the shea butter was soft and I will be using this product again, just not ordering from the same person..</li>
            <li> I have also noticed how soft the back of his hands are now.</li>
            <li> This was no where near white.</li>
            <li> Instead this was an ivory color flecked in places by a light yellowish green with the overall texture of playdough and that telltale sticky/tackiness when pinched between your fingers present.</li>
            <li> However, to describe it, I would say its a lightly greasy, thick &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faint and goes away after you put it on (about 10 min.), then it has a nice nutty smell,</li>
            <li> AND I KNOW MOST PEOPLE MELT THE PRODUCT DOWN BY MICROWAVING IT FOR A FEW MINUTES</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised that the quality was still there, and I received my package quickly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some pure Shea butter to blend with other oils and make body butter.</li>
            <li> Since I mix it with other products I can&#x27;t say for certain how it works for my hair.</li>
            <li> It was still not soft, so I simply took a knife and broke off some chunks by breaking up the large tub of butter into smaller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich thick and organic..</li>
            <li> It does have a slight nutty smell, which isn&#x27;t really unpleasant, but you can do so much with this product, including adding your own scents, that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li> Description says raw and golden with a photo of a container</li>
            <li> After using black raw soap from Africa Ghana, you will defiantly love this after you rinse your face.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is not 100% natural like they claim because it was yellow and therefore had red palm oil added.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely soft and it curly my hair up ( i am an african american)</li>
            <li> I ended up just tossing it, because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of sending it back.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to black females who are going natural.</li>
            <li> MELT IT DOWN AND TRANSFER IT TO A LARGE SQUEEZE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> It had a gritty texture, a less than lovely aroma, and the color had changed to that of raw pizza dough.  </li>
            <li> is really soft and my skin no longer feels stretched.</li>
            <li> This product is useful in that just a small pinch of it covers a lot of skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and found it well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Eventually it melted and when I went to look into the pot I saw a fairly large black speck.</li>
            <li> but Hey it is suppose to smell like that this is not That Shea Butter that has added chemicals and perfumes that is the whole point buying RAW Shea Butter in it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention I have dark old acne marks on my face as well that have disappeared in two days as well!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, the texture a little gritty- even after being melted down.</li>
            <li> It has almost no smell and the ability of this stuff to moisturize my dry skin (lizard skin) makes any slight off scent worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other shea ∫utter creams that had a decent smell</li>
            <li> this brand in particular, I have not noticed any difference between the other brands of Shea butter I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I make my own (mostly-organic) cosmetics, so I&#x27;ve used a number of different products from a number of different brands, and this has got to be the most disgusting smelling thing I&#x27;ve ever received.</li>
            <li> I got about half of what really suppose to go in my container.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after doing some research on naturally helping my daughter&#x27;s dry hair retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> A must buy for anyone with dry itchy skin, or wanting a natural product to add moisture to their skin.</li>
            <li> Unless I actually scoop it out with a spoon, I can barely get enough on my hand to use.</li>
            <li> The package isn&#x27;t really sealed tight so it leaked out after it melted in transit.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I bought raw shea butter in hopes of avoiding stretch marks during my first pregnancy, i&#x27;m 38 weeks and have gained 30 pounds and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing the raw form.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that can get very dry.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy but not so much that it is unreasonable.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very thick and you will have to rub it in your hands to smooth things out before using it.</li>
            <li> Its very thick but rub a chunk in your hand for about 15 seconds to smooth out and then apply.</li>
            <li> creative way of using to it benefit my face and aid in speeding up the healing process for my PIH is a little time consuming but it does work (for me at least).</li>
            <li> The reviews were good, so I guess I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines look as if they are slowly disappearing...</li>
            <li> This product sooths dry skin like no other.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using 100% pure raw African shea butter</li>
            <li> If you are expecting a super smooth consistency you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure &amp; Raw (Gold) 5 oz.]].</li>
            <li> The plastic tub is jam-packed with a very yellow shea butter that is smooth, not at all gritty, and has a very subtle fatty/nutty</li>
            <li> Came in a vacuum sealed bag and delivered undamaged.  </li>
            <li> And it takes a lot to make shea butter workable, mixing it with other natural oils to make it spreadable</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is real shea butter as it is very possible that its just african butter.</li>
            <li> I like what it does for my skin; I want soft skin just like other woman, but at what cost to my nervous system?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Why use products with parabens and other chemicals when you can use all natural?</li>
            <li> It is hard, maybe a little softer than a bar of soap, but melts easily in the palm when you rub your hands together.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought much shea butter in my life, but this one smelled like raw hide when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this African Shea Butter Cream( 100% Pure &amp; Raw, Gold)  for a long time.  </li>
            <li> At the same time I was also looking up natural ways to help my dark eye circles and acne scars.</li>
            <li> My face was so red, dry and itchy last winter that I finally decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shea butter; I plan to use it as a base for homemade skincare.</li>
            <li> It will become a little stiff if you keep it in a cool place</li>
            <li> A small amount covers a large area.  </li>
            <li> So, it was exposed to a murderous hot new england summer, and a freezing cold new england winter.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it solely to moisturize after using African Black Soap, as it was also my first black soap purchase</li>
            <li> and you have to keep it in a just right temperature not too cold and not too hot</li>
            <li> First of all I am African American male that had developed very bad PIH (post inflammatory hyper pigmentation) from a huge environmental change (Los Angeles to Bangladesh).</li>
            <li> I melt it gently to strain and decant it into small glass pots to use, so the sediment isn&#x27;t a worry to me.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit grainy, but that is to be expected with shea butters in general.</li>
            <li> Note: Shea butter can change from gold to ivory if left unused for long periods.</li>
            <li> it can last for a long time and</li>
            <li> Regular creams, oils and lotions didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;good\\&quot;, I was itchy and my skin felt extremely stretched, not the products fault...</li>
            <li> Really last a long time.</li>
            <li> I went to wash my hands after attempting to make lotion with this (major fail) and the water just beads up and slides right off my hands!</li>
            <li> It melts down and melds very well with the other products.</li>
            <li> However, the texture is a little grainy, but once mixed with the coconut oil has a soft wiped texture.</li>
            <li> That purchase must have been a very refined product, as it was white, hard, and odorless.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no other complaints.</li>
            <li> It will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> after cleansing and toning, I take a small dimed sized amount (that&#x27;s all you need trust me!) and rub it into my hands to get it all creamy, I then use 1 drop of Pure Tea Tree Oil and mixed it with the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I have only purchased Shea butter once before, just to rub into my dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter has completely won me over, I have castor oil, Jamaican black castor oil, almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil and nothing</li>
            <li> Additionally, the texture of the shea butter was extremely gritty and dry, with a waxy film scattered throughout.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m susceptible to acne but this Shea butter moisturizer and softened my red, dry and itchy skin without creating zits or clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin especially in winter.</li>
            <li> my hair would dry out shortly after being washed.</li>
            <li> I applied the African Shea Butter to my legs to alleviate severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> but my skin is only slightly dry as well as my hair</li>
            <li> did not come with any information at all just a business card, packaging was less then desirable, it was taped like a 6 year old</li>
            <li> Because Shea butter is so fatty/oil, my dry skin actually feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> my husband had a giant dry skin spot on his leg but after applying this for 5 days it disappeared.</li>
            <li> use it on my rough heels,after washing my hands, mixed with coconut oil for a healing overall body moisturizer-- tons of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is crumbly, but I expected that since it&#x27;s raw and pure.</li>
            <li> LONG LASTING, AND HAS HEALED MY PROBLEM OF DRY SKIN AREAS.</li>
            <li> , if you are using this for other purposes, check out the American Shea Butter Institute&#x27;s article titled &amp;#34;All Shea Butters Are Not Equally Effective&amp;#34; because I had no idea that the grading makes a difference in the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> it was in a plastic back which I had to rip open and then proceed to find some other way of storing it.</li>
            <li> I spooned out a small chunk (it was hard and could not just scoop out with my fingers as other reviewers were able to do) and rubbed my palms together..  </li>
            <li> Not the softest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used which leads me to believe it was a little old.</li>
            <li> My family has super dry skin and winters make it worse.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product my daughters scars have faded n can hardly be noticed.</li>
            <li> Last batch was harder, this one is a little too soft, but I like it anyway</li>
            <li> The first day that I bought this it was lumpy and hard as expected</li>
            <li> so this likely is normal, but makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> It has a slight musky scent, so if you want to use this to make lip balms, you&#x27;ll likely want to add some other scents unless the natural smell is what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> First of all, I must point out that this is REAL, RAW shea butter.</li>
            <li> Now before someone suggests that I should&#x27;ve purchased \\&quot;filtered\\&quot; and/or \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; shea butter if I was looking for less grit, I want to mention that I only use RAW, UNREFINED shea butter because the filtration process destroys much of its vitamins, nutrients, and beneficial properties.  </li>
            <li> The texture is nice and it does not smell badly at all.</li>
            <li> The dry climate has left us looking for a solution to dry elbows, heels, etc, and the shea butter has made a drastic difference!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s shelf life is long &#x3D; per the package.  </li>
            <li> keep it in the water for too long,</li>
            <li> This is just like the picture and didn&#x27;t take long to ship at all.</li>
            <li> After a while it starts to feel a bit gritty, it gets harder to message into your skin, and you basically have to MASH it between your hands to get it to melt and spread.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way</li>
            <li> I could count on my hair either drinking up the moisturizer too quickly or not absorbing the moisturizer at all: the moisturizer simply coated my hair instead of penetrating</li>
            <li> I expected it to come in a container, not a generic plastic bag.</li>
            <li> what conditions you store your shea butter in, or for how long you store it before you sell it - but what I got from you looks and smells like it&#x27;s been abused.  </li>
            <li> My only complain is that I expected the butter to come in a tub as the picture displays however when I received it</li>
            <li> A LONG TIME(OVER</li>
            <li> It is creamy, but not soft coming out of the container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Concerns: Even though this product is sold by several companies, I am curious to whom the manufacture are, their policies, and ethics; none of that is stated anywhere on the packaging or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> This product took way too long to get here.</li>
            <li> I did not want to use any chemicals that could cause discoloration or anything not natural.</li>
            <li> The one thing I realized after receiving this is sometimes price isn&#x27;t worth the decreased quality.  </li>
            <li> I have had this in butter bars and such but never pure shea.  </li>
            <li> and you could actually see flecks of color variation as if it was pushed and mixed in a large bowl as opposed to being melted down to a uniform color or worse dyed yellow.</li>
            <li> Soaks right into the skin and leaves no sticky feeling behind.</li>
            <li> same for my natural hair, i tried using less and less each time</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with coconut oil and tea tree oil and leaves my skin very soft and helps reduce blemishes.</li>
            <li> , I can once again use Vaseline regularly along with other lip products sparingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed some with other oils to make a creamier lotion like texture</li>
            <li> only gave it 4 stars because I have not used other shea butter before</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is exactly what I was expecting, it is a little course and grainy.</li>
            <li> I mixed in a little essential oil (lemon).</li>
            <li> Every other item I&#x27;d ordered on the same day got here like a month before the ETA</li>
            <li> It seemed like every other day I was having to reapply different types of moisturizers and conditioners to my dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> This product also lasts for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a clear difference between \\&quot;raw shea</li>
            <li> I Use this product where ever I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also use it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it when hair is still damp (on the drier side), and when hair is fully dry, it isn&#x27;t as puffy or dry.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out, I have still been using the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there is no peeling, it seems to help dry up acne</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is so dry here.  </li>
            <li> My face still feels really dry</li>
            <li> and if I use their formula for dry skin my skin breaks out for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so helps alot</li>
            <li> My husband is a farmer and struggles with dry, cracked hands in the winter.</li>
            <li> However, it does prevent me from scratching and from having dry skin.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t break your skin out and does wonders for dry hair and cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> well...not dry.</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I have had dry skin problems around my eyebrows and nose and was on hydrocortisone for dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin, marks, and skin even tone.  </li>
            <li> , I just thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I have relatively dry skin otherwise</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my feet (which are no longer dry and cracked.)  </li>
            <li> so they are always dry.</li>
            <li> Getting up in age, keeps that dry skin under wraps.  </li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;•Clears up severely dry</li>
            <li> However, after the 8th month my belly got really big and heavy and red stretch marks started appearing.</li>
            <li> Ill see so far moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> I did a little research and apparently in its unrefined state it has a lot of both vitamin E and vitamin D so that it supposedly has some anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> I got this because i have very sensitive, very pale skin that is prone to discoloration.</li>
            <li> I use it as a hand cream every night which doubles as a cuticle cream, on my dry feet under socks, if I have patches of very dry skin, on a scab or healing blemish, as a soothing balm on shaving rashes, for chapped lips, to prevent stretch marks, on my acne prone face if it gets dry</li>
            <li> The fact that I have to melt it to make it soft it&#x27;s not appealing.</li>
            <li> this African Shea Butter truly helps to minimize the dark marks and eradicate pimples.</li>
            <li> the Shea butter was melted when arrived due to not good package and our hot weather!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is yellow and there is no distinct smell.</li>
            <li> it was so chunky and grainy, but once I figured out to take a small chunk and work it through in my palms and it smooths out completely.</li>
            <li> I slathered on a thick layer of shea butter for 12 hours (went to sleep in gloves), woke up, washed it off, put on normal lotion (bath and body</li>
            <li> Works every time on my very dry skin and dry lips.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the raw Shea butter next time instead of the African</li>
            <li> So for a few days I was applying to my arms and hands 2-3 times daily and noticed the little bumps on the back of my arm were back.  </li>
            <li> (she literally won&#x27;t let me put her down &amp; her claws dig into my upper shoulder neck area if I try!)</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant due to some of the negative reviews; however, the positive reviews far outweighed the negative</li>
            <li> Seriously, when you&#x27;re hot out of the shower, rub some of this down on your body and spread a drop of jojoba across your face</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for bringing these hard to find prducts to us!</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way!</li>
            <li> TO HELP EASE ROUGH OR DRY SKIN .</li>
            <li> I prefer shea on dry hair as opposed to wet.</li>
            <li> Paired with my African black soap ..</li>
            <li> It leaves my very dry skin feeling supple and oh-so-soft.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scald.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry in winter.</li>
            <li> It clears up heat rashes and other minor skin ailments.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s shea butter products out there that are mixed with other stuff, but for me I wanted to try raw Shea butter before purchasing shea butter that was mixed with whatever (ex. retinol cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And like other reviews a little definitely goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> He got the recipe from the book [[ASIN:0760338183 Simple Gifts: 50 Little Luxuries to Craft, Sew, Cook &amp; Knit]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent to speak of, but you could add a little essential oil if you want.</li>
            <li> When rubbing between palms or fingers, it&#x27;s a little gritty.</li>
            <li> It makes skin and hair shine, and you only need a little bit to do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an offensive smell, just a little different.  </li>
            <li> Maybe next winter when I need something a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I should have only bought one little tub and hoped that it arrived in one piece.</li>
            <li> I bought it in the Caribbean at a little rasta shop, not on amazon, but it is the same brand.</li>
            <li> Although I received the shea butter a little later than expected-</li>
            <li> A little bit of it goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that in its natural state it is a hard butter</li>
            <li> Only problem I had is the container cracked and the butter turned white and hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a facial and body moisturizer after washing with raw African black soap.</li>
            <li> Great for hair-growth but hate the smell!</li>
            <li> the whole thing and going to my local MOM&#x27;s Organic Market and pay about 3 times what I paid for this bug infested shea butter (sad face).</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of $ on chapstick.  </li>
            <li> I have put it into an empty carmex container</li>
            <li> The aroma is not very noticeable, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like girls or like boys, so everybody can use it.</li>
            <li> I used to get this shea butter at a store in the mall, then the store closed.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and body and it moisturizes and sinks in.  </li>
            <li> The price when I bought it was also very competitive with Palmer&#x27;s CoCoa Butter (which I quit buying after realizing it was making me itch worse).</li>
            <li> and I received it in a plastic bag and it was white and chunky like dried out bread dough.</li>
            <li> I will purchase another one as soon as the one I have is empty.</li>
            <li> Melts on fingers and sinks into skin after awhile.</li>
            <li> (I have tried jojoba oil and, although it showed improvement it never really cleared it)</li>
            <li> Received quicker then expected</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Microwaves only destroy, changes even to the molecular level whatever is put in it.</li>
            <li> What arrived today is that quality of shea butter that spent a year in my car.  </li>
            <li> but my hair looked wet from being so oily.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, not used yet</li>
            <li> Product was in my mailbox on time and after a few days, I noticed some discoloration are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> Rashy, rough patches, eczema.  </li>
            <li> few days later while cleaning my bathroom</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no grittiness</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> Just what i expected.</li>
            <li> Not real butter.</li>
            <li> This is a  harder waxier consistency than Shea, it takes longer to melt and become pliable and needs work to be melted and rub in otherwise</li>
            <li> Iwill use to put my Shea Butter that I purchased in a bag when my Shea Butter in this container is empty.  </li>
            <li> I will admit, this type of shea is harder to put on than lotion.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, especially those looking for a heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way and it was so moisturizing on face and dry parts of body.</li>
            <li> A small tub (8 oz) will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As, the product seems to be discolored because it is certainly not gold.</li>
            <li> Strong unpleasant smoke smell.</li>
            <li> The container was less than  half the size of the last one I ordered from another seller.</li>
            <li> Raw African Shea Butter is so multi-faceted.</li>
            <li> I went to local PCC market to check the raw unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> it smells HORRIBLE, not like normal shea butter but more chemically.</li>
            <li> I would probably try this product again, since my friend has the exact same container and hers doesn&#x27;t smell like a dog treat, but I was really unhappy with the product I received.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all once you put it on and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, so I anticipate having it for a looong time.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and runs on well.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I swear by this butter and will never use anything else a little goes a long way I&#x27;ve been using it for six months</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Healed my husbands cracked feet after a week and keeps my sons dry, tightly coiled hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Other uses is listed on the container.</li>
            <li> and I added some grapeseed oil (would even use VitE or other carrier oil), and it moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my face, like some of the other users.  </li>
            <li> I will be using it for overnight eye cream as well, just like some other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I used it in body butter that I made along with some other ingredients</li>
            <li> I have read that some of the other reviewers put it in the microwave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working on this same small jar for over 4 months, and like I said I use it for everything, hair, skin, softening heels of feet, lip balm, medicinal remedy etc.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I just received this shea butter the other day.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first opened the container.</li>
            <li> but i suggest you only scent small portions at a time</li>
            <li> Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> If a child gets a small burn 1st or even 2nd degree,  there won&#x27;t be anymore tears when this product is applied as it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; into the skin!</li>
            <li> The uses are endless.</li>
            <li> purchased this shae butter the other day and it was delivered to me just now</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t spread on as easily as other creams.</li>
            <li> I had to wait on the other ingredients to arrive, and started using the shea butter by itself on my driest areas.</li>
            <li> I have ordered shea butter from different sellers, in the past, and none of them ever smelled like cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem with this product, other than the fact that it smells like something it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to go back to the other shea I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter due to findings/research done on the internet.</li>
            <li> I thought i&#x27;d try it on my arm due to it was hurting and the pain subsided.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with ordering something and receiving a completely different item.</li>
            <li> AM USING A SMALL BRUSH SIMILAR TO A TOOTHBRUSH</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy other brands....</li>
            <li> If you have other concerns, well, that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny process to apply (I heat a small amount for about 10 seconds or until it turns liquid)</li>
            <li> This is a little sticky but it has helped with the dry skin and wrinkling of my face.</li>
            <li> My skin had also began to lighten in odd ways not like the normal seasonal changes but like in weird big spots to where my brother asked if I had what Micheal Jackson had.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with very thick hair</li>
            <li> I put it on my elbows and after just a few days, they were no longer dry and cracked, and I don&#x27;t even need to apply it every night anymore to retain the softness.</li>
            <li> and when we apply the raw shea butter at least twice a day, her skin is actually SOFT!</li>
            <li> You can rub it in between your fingers to soften if it&#x27;s too hard due to low temperatures.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was confiscated at airport because I had in large container.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, just take a tiny bit and rub it in your hands.</li>
            <li> it still hard to use on my hair so last thing I did</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter Cream is alright with one exception, it was too hard</li>
            <li> , it is hard but u get a butter knife and scoop a TINY bit in your hand ..</li>
            <li> &quot; I thought, and it smelled pretty badly but eh that&#x27;s what essential oils are for</li>
            <li> so i just use it at night after a shower, it is the only thing that i can put on the delicate skin of my eyes and not get any irritation.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you break out because I use it for dark marks on my face</li>
            <li> I read through a lot of reviews that complained about a foul smell or gritty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth returning...</li>
            <li> And my face breaks out when I put it on, I&#x27;m trying to get rid of dark marks.</li>
            <li> The search continues for a product that gets rid of dark marks and acne.</li>
            <li> so it sticks to your clothes and feels really uncomfortable for the whole day.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great so look to add some natural scented oil (peppermint, lavender) to adjust the smell.  </li>
            <li> Have been using on skin including my sensitive and easily broken out face.</li>
            <li> or if it comes from a safe and reputable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin creams can be highly dangerous and there have been several cases of serious contamination with mercury and other toxins  causing dreadful illnesses.</li>
            <li> Turns out, it spent a little over a year tucked in a hidden spot in my car.  </li>
            <li> I rub it all the way down to my roots.</li>
            <li> ,you can microwave it to break it down</li>
            <li> did apply some to see how it would feel, and a little goes a really long way - just like the raw SB</li>
            <li> It can mean something as simple as &#x27;it came from a tree&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, the smell is strong (almost like coco butter) and some may find this unpleasant if they&#x27;re not familiar w raw shea.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to absorb, but my hands felt the difference after a long day of cleaning/washing hands excessively.  </li>
            <li> but if i were to whip it with a blender to make it lighter &amp; fluffy (maybe add some other oils)</li>
            <li> can we say slightly sketchy).</li>
            <li> Mine weighs a bit less even with the plastic tub, so plan on getting not quite 7oz.</li>
            <li> I kept about a cup and a half to use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but it may be a coincidence or it may be the black soap.</li>
            <li> I had noticed I was waking up in the morning with less pain and swelling in my hands.</li>
            <li> Slight stain to the skin as well</li>
            <li> My skin has evened out in tone, and its all I use to moisturize my skin that previously felt like the sahara desert.</li>
            <li> 30 seconds or less).  </li>
            <li> My hair looks black and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already made half a dozen lotion bars with it</li>
            <li> Also, the black spots which I thought were mold are just unrefined bits.</li>
            <li> I will admit that there is a slight smell that takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> My order was delivered less than a week after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I can see a difference in less than 2 weeks  (softer skin, lessening of wrinkles).</li>
            <li> I use in combo with the black soap</li>
            <li> but it definitely has a weird smell, even when covered with essential oils.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and supple, crazy enough</li>
            <li> I have never purchased shea butter previously; I purchased this to make shea butter.  </li>
            <li> but since i am using this butter my breakouts have become much less.</li>
            <li> Slightly grainy texture.</li>
            <li> However, it has an odd smell.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with the black soap</li>
            <li> previous brand I used (inesscents), is organic, and high quality (and quite expensive as well).</li>
            <li> I have to scrape it out with my fingernail, or a lot of pressure, which was not true of what I had previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was raw and hard but left at room</li>
            <li> I was very a big fan of Shea butter because of its raw hard state</li>
            <li> Eventually it melts into skin but when trying to apply it, bits of the butter fall off and make a mess.</li>
            <li> No more rough patches or rashes.  </li>
            <li> , I forgot to mention it lightened the dark marks on my preschooler from scraped knees and cuts, but that takes a few months (maybe 2) of use.</li>
            <li> this is an all natural product that helps with some skin conditions - it is not a cure for cancer and some other issues that are unrealistic to claim it cures.  </li>
            <li> It probably would have lasted forever if the container was air tight but from opening and closing the lid</li>
            <li> I used to buy small expensive jars of pure shea butter from Sprouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cold where I am now, and filling my sink w a little hot water and placing the tub in while I shower is enough to liquify the shea a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon had everything he needed to make his gifts, including these little [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> All you need is just a little dap</li>
            <li> You can melt a little in the microwave, but it also dissolves if you rub it in you hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not offensive, but it might take a little time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I use it for my skin and a little on my hair as well.  </li>
            <li> It came in a little plastic bag and not in a container as the picture indicated.  </li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower I mix a little in my hand with some  coconut oil</li>
            <li> This came a little gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had i let it absorb a little longer before dressing.</li>
            <li> I thought the product smelled a little like plastic, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The shea butter has a little bit of a grainy texture when you scoop some in  your hand</li>
            <li> (Just a little)</li>
            <li> then add a little coconut oil and scented-argan oil.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> The rip-off is that the containers contained half the amount that I could have purchased at the flea market for almost the same price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really firm in the tub, and you just scoop a little out and rub between your palms.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does have an odor -- subtle at first, but lingering and obnoxious.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair hard and rough</li>
            <li> It is hard, but so thick that just rubbing your fingers over the butter gives you enough to moisturize whatever area you choose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it on my abdominal area as i have a few stretch marks from pregnancy and weight loss....</li>
            <li> I started using it everyday, twice a day about a month ago</li>
            <li> I was told a few years ago to start using it but didn&#x27;t because for some reason.</li>
            <li> Men and women should use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I have bought shea butter from a few sources.</li>
            <li> Not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> and I read that it can leave your skin dried out.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, not greasy and has stopped the itching I&#x27;ve been experiencing around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Even when I scraped some out the container and put it in my hair, it was heavy for a bit until I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> the color was uneven.  </li>
            <li> I am just not comfortable using a product that has no packaging and is sealed with a knot in a bag..  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday on my belly</li>
            <li> so it was all just a bit too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> the lid does not fit and the heat made it melt and leak</li>
            <li> It also fades scars after a few months and reduces the appearances of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but if you zap it in the microwave a few seconds it becomes pliable again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review in a few months to see if anything has changed.</li>
            <li> This is heavy duty moisture...</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> as is it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> It was grainy and lumpy, not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> • Heavy &amp; greasy after application.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I COULD NOT LIVE WITH OUT THIS PRODUCT.!!!!!</li>
            <li> My scar from an incision is less noticeable!</li>
            <li> This would make a super cold weather skin protectant as well!</li>
            <li> Like other shea butter, it starts out rock hard but can be rubbed into creamy, buttery goodness.</li>
            <li> The consistency was little grainy, but that how raw shea butter feels.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not uncommon to find a grainy bit here and there, raw and unrefined shea butter should NOT be gritty and grainy throughout.</li>
            <li> the few times we went out during really cold weather (rather than his usual coconut oil) because this is much thicker.</li>
            <li> and I plainly just shampoo it out.</li>
            <li> He applies hair oil to tame his frizz.</li>
            <li> Heat a small amount in the microwave for a few seconds, rub it on and you will never buy your moisturizers off the shelf in fancy packaging again.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit hard, so i find it difficult to put it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Please note that I&#x27;ve been purchasing raw, unfrefined shea butter for years.  </li>
            <li> This is a raw and unrefined product, so there are bits of plant material in the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> just got through with the raw shea butter</li>
            <li> i wanted the raw shea butter pictured...</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s raw and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> 8 oz of raw gold shea butter</li>
            <li> Because this is raw Shea butter</li>
            <li> I read that raw shea butter is supposed to help with acne</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s raw state</li>
            <li> I like the product and have ordered raw shea butter before.</li>
            <li> During my research, I learned that unrefined Shea butter should be an ivory color to FAINT yellow to faintly green or beige.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, oily, and the smell is a bit unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to use .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> if that was the problem or not, but it is so hard I have trouble dipping it up and spreading on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from street venders in my area for 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> Imagine if you have to take small lumps/ grain size to melt and apply on your skin.</li>
            <li> But not sure if I want to buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a small tub</li>
            <li> I usually put it on at night and by morning I feel a noted difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me :/</li>
            <li> I recently became really obsessed with perfecting my skin and this product has done that for me.</li>
            <li> I began using the shea butter for the small scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to try it this winter on hair &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> no more dryness around my toenails</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small bucket of Shea Butter</li>
            <li> instead I received a small bag of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Will try to find a small container and put some of this Shea butter into it</li>
            <li> My husband uses on his heavy calloused hands &amp; what a difference!</li>
            <li> so i found some small containers to portion it out.  </li>
            <li> , I had read reviews in the past about Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I scoop it out and pack it in small containers so that I can have it in my purse for my lips and hands.</li>
            <li> I also put it into a small container to use for lips or cuticles.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Was not pleased at all and wouldnt give it any stars</li>
            <li> I use a plastic picnic knife with a serrated edge to scrape off a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> She explained that she usually melts it in the microwave to soften it and puts it all over her body as soon as she gets out of the shower...</li>
            <li> I usually put it on in the morning under make up and before bed...</li>
            <li> He uses it every night before bed, and over the past 2 years I continue to see an improvement in his skin.</li>
            <li> SO disgusting that I am not going to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with it though.</li>
            <li> Maybe I mixed it wrong?  </li>
            <li> I usually give products a month to see if it works/ doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is pale/off white and has a vague smell(can&#x27;t explain) but from my findings on the internet by color and smell this appears to be true/pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> and I usually apply oil-based type of lotion or an oil spray on.</li>
            <li> I usually try to do a hair mask with the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> , WTF is this s***!\\&quot; and stared in disbelief at a white rectangular label.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my and my kids hair to lock in our usual moisture products.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of it.</li>
            <li> no more.</li>
            <li> but sadly I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> but I personally find it difficult to use it this way except on the lips.  </li>
            <li> Well ill be sticking to buying them at my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product</li>
            <li> I am gonna find me a small jar</li>
            <li> people please do not use this on your face since this is very heavy butter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this shea on your face,you will feels very heavy on the face.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was in for a rude awakening the next morning, literally.</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product as I immediately put the whole container in a plastic bag to seal it off and cover the cracked container :(</li>
            <li> It was a fast deliver, however I am slightly disappointed on lack of instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> they may have slicker packaging (this is very plain)</li>
            <li> it is not a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Smells unpleasant though so remember to add a few drops of your fav essential oil.</li>
            <li> My elbows were dry and scaly,  and the rest of me was itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Received half of them broken..</li>
            <li> It is very hard, but I put a little bit in my hand, rub with my fingers and it dissolves well.</li>
            <li> I use it in homemade body and face moisturizers and even use a little in my hair during the cold, dry season.</li>
            <li> The shea butter, which is a dark, yellow mustard color, had left nasty stains on my pj&#x27;s on the collar.</li>
            <li> If you want a really great-smelling, girly cream, this isn&#x27;t it, but if you want to take care of miserable, dry skin at a bargain price, this is how to do</li>
            <li> and you think it will be hard</li>
            <li> but I found it is hard to use on my hair</li>
            <li> it is hard and doesn&#x27;t melt in my palms</li>
            <li> It was not rock hard</li>
            <li> It does not come in a hard plastic container.</li>
            <li> so it was quite hard when I opened it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i know the Shea butter texture is hard bu</li>
            <li> It made my hair hard and dull.</li>
            <li> but this brand has given me a hard time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spread.</li>
            <li> caused my skin to break.  extremely hard.  </li>
            <li> After it sits it becomes hard</li>
            <li> If it becomes too hard, you can microwave it for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> This product is hard as a brick...no way to use it.</li>
            <li> Mine says, \\&quot;Made in Ghana\\&quot; not Africa, and is hard as a rock, and smells like used fryer oil.</li>
            <li> This product while not as hard as some block-type shea butter is still fairly hard and needs some manipulation in the hands to melt the product.</li>
            <li> Have added lots of sweat almond oil, but still it is hard and almost grainy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stocking up on a lot of my little luxuries since I know our economy is just getting worse and inflation is increasing.</li>
            <li> But at least I know there isn&#x27;t going to be bugs in it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was a day late</li>
            <li> At least not to me.</li>
            <li> Some of the negative aspects...</li>
            <li> It smells kinda icky but the smell subsides after application.</li>
            <li> The product looks like a big blob of unidentifiable gunk; therefore, I am afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> I am clumsy in a kitchen</li>
            <li> If your eczema turns into a rash that itches A LOT, and sometimes leaks anti-bodies THIS will not repair it (at least for me).</li>
            <li> or at least put in a snug box so that it couldn&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li> so my hair freezes when I go outside since the Shea Butter hardens again in the cold</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s too thick for me to use every day</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb at all</li>
            <li> but it is thick and cream.</li>
            <li> Thick, but creamy.</li>
            <li> A bit thick</li>
            <li> I was shocked when she said raw african shea butter.</li>
            <li> I mean I do not know from who or</li>
            <li> yes the next diaper change (Anywhere from 2-3 hours), the redness and broken skin were healed!!</li>
            <li> I cannot use a lot of products on my face as they usually make it much worse than what it was however</li>
            <li> With it being a long and bitterly cold winter, this product has gotten a lot of use in my family.</li>
            <li> After a while, the color turn from yellow to white, and it now has TERRIBLE smell.</li>
            <li> After that, I splash cold water on my face for a couple of seconds and then pat dry to rid of the excess</li>
            <li> Seriously doubt I will purchase again...</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little difficult to work with</li>
            <li> It has a little weird smell, but after a couple of minutes will disappear.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t all that bad though different.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this decision turned out to be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW- I&#x27;m guessing I got a rancid batch since not many have complained about the horrible scent!!  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to see that it only weighed 7 oz including the plastic container</li>
            <li> Very hard and too oily</li>
            <li> The butter did come in a plastic container, but was very hard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just very hard.</li>
            <li> Does the job on my tough heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> I used on my elbows, knees, &amp; feet (tough areas) and on my face before &amp; after sunning .</li>
            <li> I was very disappointment because it looked off white in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, puffy hair, and this helps it look moisturized without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> When temperatures are below 65 degrees F it becomes hard to remove from the container and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and its not very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too thin and would help moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken or spilled.</li>
            <li> Worse Shea Butter ever</li>
            <li> Not happy with this deceptive ad.</li>
            <li> However, I notice the container was broken.  </li>
            <li> every where, NOT HAPPY NOT AT ALL</li>
            <li> Tired of using steroids, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> seller has been frustrating to work with as well regarding the issues.</li>
            <li> The plastic container i got it in is broken and i&#x27;m going to assume i can attribute that to the dryness of this.</li>
            <li> and I am an Amazon addicted shopper......</li>
            <li> I am already addicted to this cream.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> The plastic tub it came in also was broken.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious and this isn&#x27;t a fake endorsement to sell the product.</li>
            <li> it seriously!</li>
            <li> it smells terrible, I&#x27;ve used a lot of shea butter in the past and this smells like used fry oil that was forgotten in the back of the fridge for a couple of months...</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are still visible but they changed from an ugly dark purple to a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This also  helped me with my cold hives that I usually get in Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it a very hard butter that can be difficult to spread</li>
            <li> a little shocked it just came in a plastic bag with a tie, no container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff went bad or</li>
            <li> Normal shea butter stinks, but this is just a horrible non-natural smell.</li>
            <li> I had my very ugly, scaly, dry, peeling, red/pink version of the butterfly rash.</li>
            <li> My one disappointment is that it is very thick and difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> How about this, the one my husband bought me must have been a bad batch with too much dye in it and what a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the expensive retail stuff on my nails for years.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive and also store bought lotions and this one lasts longer and a lot</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but the price made me try for it.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical.</li>
            <li> One star sorry ...</li>
            <li> Once it hardened again it is grainy and difficult to blend in.  </li>
            <li> *Kanye West&#x27;s infamous girlfriend *</li>
            <li> That tells me that something is wrong with this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received my order with pieces of what I hope is Shea Butter scattered all over the box.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product arrived in a ripped packaging - with no labels on the container.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> THIS IN MY HAIR.YOU JUST CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT.OOH,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a weird smell to it</li>
            <li> It does everything they say it does (research it online) and don&#x27;t bother with those expensive over-the-counter lotions anymore.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is a fake version</li>
            <li> I would not order this again because it was too expensive for the amount.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> Purchased based on ratings and quite disappointed in the funky smelling hard shoe polish in a plastic tub that I received.</li>
            <li> I hated this Shea butter it was hard, and very hard to mix.</li>
            <li> even the worst cracked and dry heels and elbows</li>
            <li> I rubbed some in real hard on the painful area.</li>
            <li> Therefore, since it is naturally hard and not modified, I give it 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> It was cold the day it arrived</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it because it just didn&#x27;t look like something I would put on my face or hair when I seen it sitting on the counter at the store.</li>
            <li> my disappointment is in the picture versus what you get...</li>
            <li> When I received my LATE, i was terribly disappointed because the plastic container it came is was bent out of shape, and I dont even believe that it&#x27;s holding 8 oz of shea butter as described!</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne , Rosacea (redness around mouth area) and bad black pores ....</li>
            <li> Fail!</li>
            <li> so angry and Disappointed..</li>
            <li> Im forty with genetically challenged bad eye area</li>
            <li> It smells just as bad.</li>
            <li> Kinda grainy, but not so bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff never goes bad and you can use it as a lotion too.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Purchased for skin care but the cream had and bad texture and a rancid smell.</li>
            <li> Also cracked @the bottomwith a bad smell..</li>
            <li> when buying any product or thing online, you run the risk of getting a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I got a vary bad batch.</li>
            <li> This product was so bad, that i had to trow it out..</li>
            <li> It was really really bad.</li>
            <li> They emailed me and apologized for the box of scattered and disastrous Shea butter.</li>
            <li> and  l was shocked because it was like it melted  </li>
            <li> Anyone who purchase this will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am not at all disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just got into using Shea butter. Think it&#x27;s working well and I&#x27;m not sure but I think 5 bucks is a good price for 8 ounces. It&#x27;s rich thick and organic..</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it as a moisturizer for my face. I have a very sensitive &amp; oily face but there was no reaction, &amp;  the less the better so you won&#x27;t look greasy.  It goes on smoothly if you continue rolling it around in your hands. It&#x27;s a small container but it&#x27;ll last for a while I can already tell &amp; I just got it. I gave it four stars because the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but still worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from street venders in my area for 5 dollars. This is a golden color, most of the time it has been melted before placed into the jar. The butter if warmed is much easier to apply onto skin. This is pretty solid as room temperature and holds up well to  fluctuating temperature changes.  Shea butter is good for skin and hair. Its a good oil to use on eczema. Other uses is listed on the container. Note: Shea butter can change from gold to ivory if left unused for long periods. I had a jar on my dresser for over six months that went from gold to ivory.</li>
            <li> As a product meant to moisturize, it does a great job however there are some cons.&lt;br /&gt;First time when I ordered it came in a box as a homogenised product, meaning it could be scooped and used on your skin. I loved it. I used it as a prenatal belly cream to avoid stretch marks. I loved it so much I finished the entire thing in 2 months time. I ordered again, this time I got a pathetic product. Meaning, it was grainy, powdered not convenient to use. Imagine if you have to take small lumps/ grain size to melt and apply on your skin. Was very disappointed, so called the retailer. He said since its a natural product, depending on the season the product texture varies.&lt;br /&gt;Im still using it cause I love the product. But not sure if I want to buy again.</li>
            <li> i love this product, so many reasons to use it. for hair or skin just love it!! i also like the smell, most may not but i do!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels. Best moisturizer. I cant say if it has changed my skin but it feels good.</li>
            <li> This has proven to exceed my expectations. I have spent lots of $ on chapstick.  This is a small tub and it&#x27;s shelf life is long &#x3D; per the package.  I have put it into an empty carmex container and I added some grapeseed oil (would even use VitE or other carrier oil), and it moisturizes well.  That is what I plan to use it for, I have made creams and such, but I may just keep this for my lips.  Came in a vacuum sealed bag and delivered undamaged.  Would purchase from Plant Guru again.  Try this stuff out!!!</li>
            <li> The quality of this product was terrible.  It was gritty and there was a reddish-brown sediment at the bottom of the container.  I returned it and got a refund.  I&#x27;ve bought shea butter before from other places and loved it.  I won&#x27;t buy anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I Use this product where ever I have dry skin. It&#x27;s smell is not over-powering like other 100% pure shea butters are and it works fast. I usually put it on at night and by morning I feel a noted difference. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> My primary use of this product is for my hair. The shea butter melts nicely when you rub it between the palms of your hands. I apply it throughout my hair and on my scalp. My hair is natural and I do not put any chemicals on my hair. This product leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. I also use it on dry skin. I apply it to the affected areas and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I am a man, age 40.  I have used půre shea butter since i was 25.  Nobody believes me when i say i am 40.  I COULD NOT LIVE WITH OUT THIS PRODUCT.!!!!!</li>
            <li> When you open it up it looks like wax and you think it will be hard but it comes out great and works wonders on dry skin. This product also lasts for a VERY long time. Definitely ordering it again and again.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and beneficial Thank you and will I deal with you next time I have won the satisfaction</li>
            <li> This butter is great and i liked it very much and i think i&#x27;ll order more,, thank you very much for it</li>
            <li> Our teenage son made lip balm as holiday gifts this year. He got the recipe from the book [[ASIN:0760338183 Simple Gifts: 50 Little Luxuries to Craft, Sew, Cook &amp; Knit]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had everything he needed to make his gifts, including these little [[ASIN:B000VHTU6C Fantasea Acrylic Jars 3/8 oz (Pack of 12)]] that proved to be the most elusive ingredient in the recipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipe Andrew used called for Shea butter, and he chose this African Shea Butter Cream product [[ASIN:B0009MHJS0 African Shea Butter Cream 100% Pure &amp; Raw (Gold) 5 oz.]]. It was an excellent choice for lip balm. It is soft and incorporated into the recipe without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there was a shipping fee, using Amazon to round-up all the ingredients was a great time and gas saver!</li>
            <li> I received my package today (3 days early) and I was really excited. I ripped open the packaging and opened the tub (unmarked except for \\&quot;8 oz.\\&quot; written in permanent marker can we say slightly sketchy). \\&quot;Eh I can get over that\\&quot; I thought, and it smelled pretty badly but eh that&#x27;s what essential oils are for (lavender is amazing).I spooned some out into a double boiler to melt. Eventually it melted and when I went to look into the pot I saw a fairly large black speck. Upon closer inspection I realized it was a BUG. ugh sooooo I&#x27;m throwing it away ... the whole thing and going to my local MOM&#x27;s Organic Market and pay about 3 times what I paid for this bug infested shea butter (sad face). But at least I know there isn&#x27;t going to be bugs in it. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this in charleston, SC on vacation.  I use it before I get out of the shower.  I have eczema and during the winter, it really acts out.  Since using this, my eczema has not been a problem.  I notice that if I quit using the shea butter for a few days, the intense itching on my legs comes back.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people mention putting it in the microwave, but the guy I bought it from said not to do that, because it kills some of the enzymes in the butter, which makes sense.  If I need to soften it, I just put the container in a sink of hot water.  I bought this size container in August, and am just now replacing it.  I love this stuff!  I haven&#x27;t used it on my face, like some of the other users.  It seems so \\&quot;oily\\&quot; for face use, but I just may try it now!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I started to have allergic reactions to different lip products including Chapstick, lipgloss, lipstick, ect. It soon got to the point that I could no longer use Vaseline because my lips would break out. I&#x27;ve been using shea butter on my lips for about 6 months and the results have been amazing, I can once again use Vaseline regularly along with other lip products sparingly. Shea butter has made my life so much easier, I also like to use it in the place of lotion and suggest it to everyone with a skin problem.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great especially for dry skin in the winter.Its a bit hard, so i find it difficult to put it directly on the skin.When i am bathing, i dip it in a jar with warm water, by the time i finish bathing, it has softend up and its easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Dont keep it in the water for too long, cos it will become runny!</li>
            <li> This is great, makes your skin so lovable! It&#x27;s hard, just take a tiny bit and rub it in your hands. It will melt right away. I mix it with my fave lotion and it makes my sking even better. It&#x27;s great on your feet, everywhere. I don&#x27;t have any dry skin problem, just love to feel and see my skin hydrated and this works. Your skin absorbs it quickly so there&#x27;s no greasy residue and the smell is minimal, similar to cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try in my hair then found out I could use it on my skin. I have lupus and at the time my order arrived I had my very ugly, scaly, dry, peeling, red/pink version of the butterfly rash. My skin had also began to lighten in odd ways not like the normal seasonal changes but like in weird big spots to where my brother asked if I had what Micheal Jackson had. Anyway this helped right away with smoothing my skin, healing my scalp,and once added with rx hydrocortisone my color had returned. It makes my hair feel great too. I have mixed this with different oils and conditioner to use for washing my hair and I get a great result manageable hair that I can easily detangle while still in the shower. I am going to buy the big container now and bought some Ziploc containers to keep different mixtures of it in.</li>
            <li> Was recommended shea butter for my djembe to help moisturize the goat skin, it works great so far, and a little goes a long way, so it lasts forever</li>
            <li> (African Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about this product. I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too thin and would help moisturize my skin. The Shea butter did both.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much and it is VERY good as a sun blocker. A small tub (8 oz) will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 10 on a scale from 1 to 10. I&#x27;m serious and this isn&#x27;t a fake endorsement to sell the product. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. I use it as a conditioner and my hair feels amazing after I use it. I love it so much I ordered 3 more!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for three months.  I am an african american woman with a medium brown complexion.  I purchased this product because I heard that it helps to even skin tone, and smooth skin.  It is not a miracle product, but my skin is indeed more supple and soft to the touch.  It hasnt really helped with my hyperpigmentation issues which is the main reason for my purchase, but I still recommend purchasing for a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard alot about shea butter and how it is good for hair. I bought this item to try it out. When I recieved the butter it was in container (melted in!!). For first time I scooped a portion with spoon but I found it is hard to use on my hair becuase it is hard and doesn&#x27;t melt in my palms so I thought of mixing it with jojoba oil and it got melted easier. I used it on hair ends. I tried more things (from other people&#x27;s suggestions) like whipping it with coconut oil and use it .. it still hard to use on my hair so last thing I did was using it as in-shower conditioner which I mixed (the whipped shea butter and coconut oil)with my choice of in-shower conditioner and it felt extemly good on my hair (only thing I have to metion is that never use it on scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product but it takes effort to make it ready to use on hair. It might be good to be used for skin which is much easier as rubbing the butter on skin is much easier than on hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT shea butter.  Nice container, melts smoothly and serves as an excellent base for our DIY shaving cream and lotions.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, recommended.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and creamy, perfect for creating the peppermint lip balm i will be making from scratch!!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic for eczema.</li>
            <li> The first day that I bought this it was lumpy and hard as expected so I put it in the microwave for 30secs and it came out very creamy and smooth but by the second day when it became hard again I put it back in the microwave for 10secs and it turned into oil and took 3 days to become solid again</li>
            <li> I have only purchased Shea butter once before, just to rub into my dry, cracked heels.  That purchase must have been a very refined product, as it was white, hard, and odorless.  This is much softer--like a bright gold play dough with a pleasant aroma.  I had planned to use this in homemade lotion or lip balm, but I want to use this stuff straight out of the tub as is!  My only concern is the amount--NOT 8 oz.  Mine weighs a bit less even with the plastic tub, so plan on getting not quite 7oz. of actual product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I had never used shea butter before and was looking for something as an alternative to &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, which is FULL of chemicals and unnatural things that clog pores. It&#x27;s nice, it is an excellent moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a great smell so I add a tiny bit of coconut oil, and that makes it WONDERFUL.​</li>
            <li> i LOVE SHAE BUTTER..  i USE IT ON MY FEET AND LEGS TWICE DAILY WITH GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li> perfect, and it lasts forever fir medium use. i just realized i can use it for diaper ointment as well, yay!</li>
            <li> I just got my order three days ago and already I am hooked! This stuff is AMAZING for crows feet,  dark circles and puffys. I had been trying so many eye creams all year.  Im forty with genetically challenged bad eye area lol I apply this in the pm all around my eye area and look soooo much better than I used to in the am. Also a dab under the eyes before ur Concealer and boom! No wrinkle settle.</li>
            <li> When the Shea Butter came at first I did not know what to make of it. I thought it looked like a lump of butter. I could not smell anything but soon I became creative and added scented oil after melting it down. It is amazing that just a little will go a long way. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. The oil added did not take away from what the Shea Butter was ment to do.I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the scent as my last batch but it works. Delivery was a day late but I blame that on usps</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has dry skin. This product is useful in that just a small pinch of it covers a lot of skin. The aroma is not very noticeable, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like girls or like boys, so everybody can use it. If you want a really great-smelling, girly cream, this isn&#x27;t it, but if you want to take care of miserable, dry skin at a bargain price, this is how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I bought was sent in two plastic bags instead of a tub like is shown here. The plastic bag is a pain, since I don&#x27;t know if shea butter dries out when exposed to air, I keep making everyone tape it shut after using. Unless you have something else to put it in, it&#x27;s worth paying for the package, in my view.</li>
            <li> I used to get this shea butter at a store in the mall, then the store closed.  I found some other shea butter that I love, but it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  Imagine my delight when I stumbled upon this on Amazon.  I use it on my face and body and it moisturizes and sinks in.  It&#x27;s awesome. Love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Natural raw Shea butter in a nice little jar. Bought it for mom since she has natural hair. She loves it but has some difficulty scooping it out. Works great on skin too</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple of weeks ago to use as a hair conditioner. I have also been using it on my body. I think I like this product for my hair mostly after I have blow dried it. I have naturally curly hair that can get very dry. I rub this between my hands and sparingly apply, and it really softens my hair without making it greasy. It&#x27;s much more manageable, easier to style, and quite soft. It works great on skin as well. My friend has been using it as well for exzema issues. I can&#x27;t say whether it would really cure the issue, but it seems to help soothe the skin. Also, I use it around my eyes and on my face before going to bed as a moisturizer. It is really effective. And, it&#x27;s great for massages. I had someone use it as part of a scalp massage - wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it smells fine. I can tolerate it, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. And, it is good to soften it between your hands or in the microwave because it is quite hard in the container.</li>
            <li> When i decided to try some DIY lip balm and face products the easiest way to buy was from Amazon, but I was not disappointed. This is really awesome stuff, the melting point is also in so accurate. After trying out some DIY&#x27;s I tried using this right from plastic container it comes and it was still so easy to use just take a tiny amount in hand and applied on face, a little goes a long way and it was so moisturizing on face and dry parts of body. It is excellent to use in winters and since it comes in a plastic container it is easy to store and use. I will repurchase once am done with this box</li>
            <li> The only product that seems to be able to tackle these bear claws of mine.</li>
            <li> I ordered 8 oz and one of the first thing I did was weigh it on my digital scale.  So disappointed to see that it only weighed 7 oz including the plastic container it came in with!  Yes it&#x27;s just an oz but that is a lot of shea butter I could have used.</li>
            <li> The shea butter comes in a plastic container. It was not rock hard and I could easily scoop a bit into my finger and apply it to my face. I didn&#x27;t have to microwave it. A little goes a long way... since too much shea butter can make one&#x27;s face look greasy. Overall, I would definitely purchase this brand of shea butter again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant and I use this lotion on my belly whenever it starts to get itchy. It works really well and I have no stretch marks (although I think that&#x27;s more due to genetics than this lotion) but it isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff! At least not to me. I also don&#x27;t like how oily it leaves my hands after I rub it in. But if you&#x27;re looking for something that works well then this is product is amazing. The price when I bought it was also very competitive with Palmer&#x27;s CoCoa Butter (which I quit buying after realizing it was making me itch worse).</li>
            <li> I bought the shea butter on recommendation as a regular hair care regimen. I mix it with my choice of essential oils and use it as a moisturizer on my hair.  Since using it my hair is a lot easier to manage, is very soft and not as tangled after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, loved it</li>
            <li> This was a great product; shipping package was a plastic container--sealed good; will definitely order again; I use raw shea butter as a moisturizer on my face and my body; very seldom do i wear makeup but people ask me often what type of makeup do i wear--REAL RAW SHEA BUTTER does wonders:)</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter before and have pretty much been satisfied with the results. I took a chance and ordered some online and was kinda scared as the texture was different than what i was use to. OMG! this is the best shea butter.... i use it on my face as a moisturizer...i dont even need makeup!!!! my skin is flawless! it seems to help with my Tzone shine as well.... i use it on my feet ...I love it the results! I&#x27;ve started using it on my abdominal area as i have a few stretch marks from pregnancy and weight loss.... hopefully it will clear up those marks as well... I will DEFINETLY order this again...</li>
            <li> Do not purchase. Description says raw and golden with a photo of a container and I received it in a plastic bag and it was white and chunky like dried out bread dough.</li>
            <li> My mom and sisters told me about this, so i decided to get one and so far i like it.  I use for my son who has eczema and my self for the stretch marks. some may not like the smell but its okay for me...looking forward to the results for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I heard it was great for the skin. I make my own lotion and this butter is the best to use!!</li>
            <li> i have used shea butter that was processed before but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try since i have had problems w my combination skin which is also very sensitive to most products.&lt;br /&gt;i can not say enough about this shea butter, the consistency means you have to work it in but i found that rubbing your hands together fast to get it warm and also wetting them w a bit of water to help distribute it works great.&lt;br /&gt;it sinks in fast, it can be a bit greasy at first so i just use it at night after a shower, it is the only thing that i can put on the delicate skin of my eyes and not get any irritation.</li>
            <li> I love the shea butter, this is about the (overall) 3rd or 4th order, just from different sellers.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that it would arrive in a plastic bag.  Next time I&#x27;ll make sure to read about that part if it&#x27;s available.  It did arrive in great time (a couple of days).</li>
            <li> I got about half of what really suppose to go in my container. Maybe it was just me :/ but I know an organic place that gives a bigger container full of shea butter for 5 dollars and it&#x27;s so much worth it then this. not ordering shea butter online anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this from head to toe, I mean from my face to my heels literally and my skin has never been more beautiful.</li>
            <li> Forget using regular lotion.  I&#x27;m so over it.  I just received this and was measuring some out for a mixture, the leftover on my skin I rubbed on my elbows and they feel like silk.  I will be ordering the 5LB package next.  If your thinking about buying this, add to cart.  I will be using it for overnight eye cream as well, just like some other reviewers have mentioned.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and its not very noticeable.  I guess you could add some scented essential oils if it really bothers you.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 containers.  One arrived bright yellow, the other a moldy greenish gold (think spicy brown mustard).  I opened the bright yellow one.  IT STINKS!!!  I&#x27;ve never smelled shea butter that has ever come close to this \\&quot;scent\\&quot;.  I gave it one star because they will not allow a review to be rated no stars.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This is my first review I&#x27;ve ever done for any product. This is probably the best best product I&#x27;ve purchased. I started using it everyday, twice a day about a month ago and wow..just wow. Glowing and radiant skin. My brown spots from old acne marks were SIGNIFICANTLY reduced, I get compliments on my good skin all the time now. I heat it up in he microwave for 30 seconds and put it all over my body and face. Not only do you feel more mosturized after using but the results give you a sense of confidence and truly make you feel beautiful. I was told a few years ago to start using it but didn&#x27;t because for some reason. I recently became really obsessed with perfecting my skin and this product has done that for me. Men and women should use this everyday. And so cheap too!</li>
            <li> I love the product. All you need is just a little dap and it&#x27;s really moisturizing... it can last for a long time and plus Theres is no smell to it! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely without a doubt purchase it again. The seller was very fast on It&#x27;s shipping. It&#x27;s just a great experience on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it seriously!</li>
            <li> Nice quality product. I used it to make body lotion bars, and the result was great!</li>
            <li> Have used this product many times and know that it is wonderful; thank you for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Works great in my lip balm and butters</li>
            <li> I love Shea butter, I&#x27;ve used it for years now (hair, skin) and this one is fabolous. I will purchase another one as soon as the one I have is empty.</li>
            <li> This product does in fact leave your skin very smooth and hydrated and it does have amazing benefits however it smells very unpleasant and I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought a large container for home and an 8 oz container for travel. This works as moisturizer, sunblock, healing product for skin glycation and abrasions.  This is the best skin protection I&#x27;ve found for thin, dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love love love the African Shea Butter Cream. It&#x27;s so moisturizing and made by skin feel absolutely delightful. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order it in a 16 Oz. container.  Anyone who purchase this will not be disappointed.  However, its very versatile in its use so I&#x27;m sure you can find which way you like to use it the most.</li>
            <li> Omg, I initially bought this shea butter to mix with jamaican castor oil and emu oil to make sort of like a pomade for my hair. I kept about a cup and a half to use as a moisturizer. Well one Satirday as O was cooking breakfast, some grease popped on my arm from the pan. I began using the shea butter for the small scars. The quickly diminished. It works wayyyyy quixker tgqn cocoa butter. I love it!</li>
            <li> It is the only cream I use on my face and body.  It is great!</li>
            <li> it works wonderful, good product also works well with other Ra cosmestics good better best i ddint use it my sis did</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet and it really softens any rough spots.  It&#x27;s a solid but if you rub it between your hands it softens to an oil.</li>
            <li> I have bought shea butter from a few sources. This is the best one so far. It&#x27;s smooth - not grainy and dry!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea Butter to use in whipped body cream. I wish I had done more research beforehand. After receiving it, I noticed it had an odd, strong smell. Assuming this was how Shea butter smelled, since I had never ordered it before, I started to do research what essential oils would best mask this smell. During my research, I learned that unrefined Shea butter should be an ivory color to FAINT yellow to faintly green or beige. If it is BRIGHT yellow, it is not pure shea butter. It either is another sort of butter called river butter, or it has had yellow added to it to mask adulteration. As the butter I received from this vendor is bright yellow, I no longer feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is the bomb! Does the job on my tough heels and elbows. This is my first experience with actual Shea butter. Will not be my last.</li>
            <li> I would give this ten stars if I could.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  Yes, it is a little difficult to work with and once you smear it on, you&#x27;ll have to sit there for an hour like a buttered muffin but man...once it&#x27;s soaked into your skin you&#x27;ll feel like a million bucks.  We just order it by the tub now.</li>
            <li> I primarily bought this product for my hair. I decided to stop using gels, products with alcohol, etc. and have been using this for about a year. My hair has grown so much, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the shampoo (I use Shea Moisture Shampoo), or because of this, but something has definitely contributed to it&#x27;s growth. I have VERY thick, puffy hair, and this helps it look moisturized without looking greasy. I apply it when hair is still damp (on the drier side), and when hair is fully dry, it isn&#x27;t as puffy or dry. You can melt a little in the microwave, but it also dissolves if you rub it in you hands. It works great for knees, hands, elbows, and other areas that are prone to get dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, the texture a little gritty- even after being melted down. I&#x27;m using this to experiment with making body lotions and creams. Perhaps the scent and texture will be better if it&#x27;s used in smaller concentrations.Product is as described though and it does work well.</li>
            <li> What i had received is not like the posted one</li>
            <li> Product is grainy unlike natural Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I used this in solid massage bars for the holidays. They turned out great, and I still had some shea leftover. The extras have been used in bath bombs, whipped body butter, and solid lotion bars. I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> A very good product  The rip-off is that the containers contained half the amount that I could have purchased at the flea market for almost the same price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The container arrived full to the max of raw shea butter.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this purchase and I am using this head to toe. In my hair on my hands and elbows at night on my face and even on my lips. Only draw back is because it is pure Shea it smells like cooking oil. I would not let the smell keep you from making the purchase if it really bothered you, you could mix it with a fragrant oil.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for the skin. It&#x27;s a great use for moisturizer! It is also so good for stretch marks!!! It is so natural! I don&#x27;t even need to use a lotion anymore.</li>
            <li> Delivers as the product said it would.</li>
            <li> This is just like the picture and didn&#x27;t take long to ship at all. I used it for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great price but the product is very grainy. Not smooth at all. Eventually it melts into skin but when trying to apply it, bits of the butter fall off and make a mess.</li>
            <li> I chose this based on the thing I heard and it is an excellent product for me. It has removed a mark I had on my arm in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> worked wonders. it really works</li>
            <li> Great customer service;this company answered all my questions regarding the packaging of the product and every promise made was fullfilled. Great quality Shea butter excellent for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> This  product is not at all refined.  It is lumpy, and it is such a pungent yellow that&lt;br /&gt;it stained my clothes.  I have ordered other shea butter which was smooth and easy&lt;br /&gt;to apply--not so this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of the smell.  First time purchasing Shea butter.  I&#x27;ll use it with some essential oils to mask the odor.  I used it in body butter that I made along with some other ingredients and it was heavenly.</li>
            <li> Awesome works wonders I really love this product i use it on my hair and skin great product I recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s golden yellow and melts down nicely to make body butters. The scent is rather strong but that can be remedied with essential oils. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am now a believer of Shea Butter&#x27;s moisturizing benefit. Go with the unrefined, its said to be better in that quality. I&#x27;ve been using the expensive retail stuff on my nails for years. I&#x27;m anxious to try it this winter on hair &amp; skin. Great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered two tubs of shea butter, its the best moisturizer to use in winter! Helps prevent wind burn, keeps my hands and feet nice and soft and works great on the baby to prevent diaper rash! two thumbs up! Buy this stuff its great!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for price!! Melts on fingers and sinks into skin after awhile. Like description on lid also GREAT PRICE &amp; will reorder!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. But the image is misleading. It does not come in a hard plastic container. It comes in a plastic bag. I personally don&#x27;t mind because it is much better environmentally than a large hard plastic container. But they should reflect the item being sent out in the images shown.</li>
            <li> Great product. My daughter was bit by a dog and had nasty scratches on her face. Thanks to this product my daughters scars have faded n can hardly be noticed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this she&#x27;s butter its kinda thick but its very soft &amp; melts quickly when you spread it I&#x27;m using this for my hair &amp; my stretch marks so ladies you really need to try this post pics of stomach soon</li>
            <li> Raw African Shea Butter is so multi-faceted. You can use it on your hair and body, and you&#x27;ll notice radiant-looking skin and hair shortly after using. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it never fails. However, it&#x27;s very oily so use in moderation. It&#x27;s better to use before bed rather than applying right before going out. It&#x27;s effective for dry skin, hair, and blemishes.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of raw shea butter. I was hesitant due to some of the negative reviews; however, the positive reviews far outweighed the negative so I purchased it regardless. I am so happy I did! I purchased it solely to moisturize after using African Black Soap, as it was also my first black soap purchase and I read that it can leave your skin dried out. Although the black soap is by far the best soap I have ever used and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out, I have still been using the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This stuff is hard but also very easy to pinch enough off and rub it in your hands. After just a few seconds of rubbing it between the hands, it looses the grainy texture and becomes very creamy and easy enough to spread. I have read that some of the other reviewers put it in the microwave but if you&#x27;re buying it for the raw properties, that kind of defeats the purpose, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Here are some of the benefits I have noticed in the week since I received it: My feet have gone from normal-dry to ahh-mazing...no more dryness around my toenails, it&#x27;s better than castor oil! My rosacea is GONE (I have tried jojoba oil and, although it showed improvement it never really cleared it), it healed a sunburn I got two days ago and there is no peeling, it seems to help dry up acne but it may be a coincidence or it may be the black soap. It does keep me from picking at my face though. My fingernails seem stronger and they are not peeling so, for the first time since I was a teenager, I am able to start growing them out. My combination skin seems to have evened out and my nose doesn&#x27;t get too shiny during the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Some of the negative aspects...it smells different than anything I have ever smelled before and I can&#x27;t really describe it. It smells kinda icky but the smell subsides after application. It is very greasy for the first 10-15 minutes but it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. It&#x27;s perfect for allover the body but it leaves the face a bit too greasy. If you apply it to your face sparingly and then blot it with a towel after, it leaves the perfect finish though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, I love it!sy. If you apply it to your face sparingly and then blot it with a towel after, it leaves the perfect finish though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small bucket of Shea Butter instead I received a small bag of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Shea butter has completely won me over, I have castor oil, Jamaican black castor oil, almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil and nothing has quite done what shea butter can do... I put in on my lips, my hair, my skin, I even used it to get rid of a rash on my nose from a piercing allergy... it really really is a great product, and it lasts a very very long time. I&#x27;ve been working on this same small jar for over 4 months, and like I said I use it for everything, hair, skin, softening heels of feet, lip balm, medicinal remedy etc. next time I&#x27;ll get the 32oz for sure, 100% pure shea butter is a certain staple for all people.</li>
            <li> This is pure African shea butter- good for everything from daily lotion to minor burn relief, a mild spf, and even a great replacement for chapstick.</li>
            <li> use for my face to keep it moist and for  looking younger.  this shea butter is excellent and well worth the money.  this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I like it so far but it smells like clay to me but it really does goes on your skin very well. I will consider buying this product again but I just don&#x27;t like the clay smell...it gives me a headache</li>
            <li> Awesome for making soap and really makes a great sunscreen or great to lather on when it&#x27;s windy!  The only difference I would make is I would order a bigger amount next time!</li>
            <li> its too strong i dont know how to ues it</li>
            <li> I was rather displeased with this product. First of all, it did not weigh in at 8 ounces as advertised.  Additionally, the texture of the shea butter was extremely gritty and dry, with a waxy film scattered throughout.  Now before someone suggests that I should&#x27;ve purchased \\&quot;filtered\\&quot; and/or \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; shea butter if I was looking for less grit, I want to mention that I only use RAW, UNREFINED shea butter because the filtration process destroys much of its vitamins, nutrients, and beneficial properties.  Please note that I&#x27;ve been purchasing raw, unfrefined shea butter for years.  There&#x27;s a clear difference between \\&quot;raw shea butter\\&quot; and poor-quality shea butter.  While it&#x27;s not uncommon to find a grainy bit here and there, raw and unrefined shea butter should NOT be gritty and grainy throughout. I even tried adding oils to it, hoping to salvage my purchase by using it in a hair dressing-- but nope.  This stuff had more grits in it than a Southern restaurant.  I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and plan to buy more.  It has a pleasant nutty fragrance and immediately soothed my dry hands.</li>
            <li> love my shea butter. nice and smooth and smells great! came on time and all i can say is that i love it and will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Love this product and would recommend it to friends.  It goes on smoothly, not greasy and has stopped the itching I&#x27;ve been experiencing around my eyes.  Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> My package arrived today with this Shea butter product. This is my first time ordering this product and I was so excited...then I saw there was a good size slice out of the container which exposes the product instead of it keeping it well contained and sealed. It seemed to be shipped in a good box and surrounded with protection so my guess is the container was cracked prior to packing and shipping. I hope it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product as I immediately put the whole container in a plastic bag to seal it off and cover the cracked container :( I don&#x27;t have time to be shipping it back as I plan to use it in the homemade sunscreen I am making for myself this month. I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this again. Here&#x27;s hoping the actual Shea butter is good quality...so far I think the actual Shea butter is good.</li>
            <li> The smell and texture was off.</li>
            <li> Liked Shea Butter for moisturizing it high ... smell did not like but it is good ... and many quantity ..And with high moisturizing</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Great results as well as great service.  This should be sold to the masses at any drug store nationwide.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine as a Prime item, sold by Nature and Herbs. It arrived quickly and in a container with a lid that was VERY secure. This is my second purchase of shea butter and I think I prefer this one over the [[ASIN:B00GWTXF82 Tangerine Lime Shea Butter]] , because it smells almost identical and it&#x27;s much cheaper. In reading the mixed reviews, many people commented on the smell. Raw shea butter has an earthy smell to it, which many people may not realize. It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s not offensive, but it might take a little time to get used to it. When I first smelled it I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but my husband said he really liked it. This is a great value for a wonderful product. It leaves my very dry skin feeling supple and oh-so-soft. It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s not like a lotion, it&#x27;s just quite different and I love it. It&#x27;s really firm in the tub, and you just scoop a little out and rub between your palms. This friction transforms the shea butter into a creamy, almost like oil, but not quite, consistency. I plan on taking some of my shea butter and making a whipped body butter with coconut oil and essential oils. It&#x27;s so easy to just take a big bowl, hand-held mixer, and these few natural ingredients to make a skin moisturizer that is so much better for your skin, smells better, is cheaper, and without all the parabens, coloring, and \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; that most store bought lotions contain. There are many videos on YouTube that show how easy this is to do. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and surprisingly, on the lid it gives several uses of the benefits of shea butter. One of those is that it helps relieve arthritis. Well, I&#x27;ve got arthritis throughout my body, and after using the Nature&#x27;s Shea Butter (meaning BEFORE I even saw the reference that it would help relieve arthritis symptoms) I had noticed I was waking up in the morning with less pain and swelling in my hands. So, there may be something to this. And whether it helps arthritis or not, it is an excellent moisturizer.cellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it for my skin and a little on my hair as well.  Its very thick and rich.  You only need a dime size and then soften it by rubbing it between your hands.  Only problem I had is the container cracked and the butter turned white and hard as a rock.  It probably would have lasted forever if the container was air tight but from opening and closing the lid I guess it ripped.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reliable source of pure shea butter because now that it&#x27;s getting popular, the price is ridiculous in some places. This stuff is wonderful for dry skin. I use it on my face as well with no problem. It&#x27;s the same golden color as in the picture. There&#x27;s no scent to speak of, but you could add a little essential oil if you want. Use it with the African black soap and your skin will look amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself.  I have problems with dry skin.  I was surprised that my skin didn&#x27;t feel greasy after I used it.  It soaked in quickly and my skin felt soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you break out because I use it for dark marks on my face and I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of fading. I use this with African black soap and my skin feels smooth. The combination should help fade my scars completely.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this shea butter because it&#x27;s pure and natural, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive and also store bought lotions and this one lasts longer and a lot less!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have what I call alligator skin and this makes me so smooth an soft.  Only wish I could find a way to carry it in my purse. Will try to find a small container and put some of this Shea butter into it so I can carry it in planes etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son&#x27;s eczema and our dry skin (we live in CO) and it works great! Not greasy at all once you put it on and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve mixed some with other oils to make a creamier lotion like texture but I actually like in the raw the best.  Would highly recommend for smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I have received exactly the seller describe. It has a little weird smell, but after a couple of minutes will disappear. I recommend you compound with something else like coconut milk, avocado, or vitamin E.</li>
            <li> It actually came before the delivery time. from the reviews i seen many seem to not like the smell...I LOVE IT. it has a cocoa buttery type smell to it and it&#x27;s easy to apply. i may just end up buying another one soon.</li>
            <li> The shipping for this item was fast. I was skeptical about this product, but the price made me try for it. I brought 5 boxes of these and they were shipped on time. My husband and i have curly  hair, and his hair is unmanageable. He applies hair oil to tame his frizz. I mixed a scoop of shea butter to his hair oil, viola!! his hair is so smooth, he cant stop running his fingers through his scalp.So , i tried out and had same results. I use it on my body after a night shower as its greasy so cant think of applying in day time. I sent three boxes to my family in India.They gave a positive review for this product. Looking forward to buy more from this Seller.(Keep the prices the same.. )</li>
            <li> The photo of this Shea Better is as good as it gets. I have several grand worth of photo equipment but why would I even bother to keep taking a picture of the same thing over and over again my friend. We are not on the EVE of DESTRUCTION!! I mean I do not know from who or what someone bought this stuff from that was not in fantastic shape but this product from this company was and is in great shape. It is pure clean and as good as it gets. Thanks folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> Fresh out the box. Shipped overnight. Yes I weighed the package, wanted to make sure I received 8 oz. Can&#x27;t really say for sure if this is Shea butter, as it did not arrive as pictured in the ad. No ingredients listed, no plastic container.  Just a barcode label.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is from Africa or China. I don&#x27;t know if it is indeed natural. It&#x27;s soft, kind of feels like play doh. There is a brown speck on the butter. No idea what the speck is, where it came from or why its there.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I will use it. I am natural and purchased this for my hair. The item isn&#x27;t eligible for return. So $5.25 possibly wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I melted the butter &amp; applied it to damp hair. It melted quickly. I also applied the butter to damp hair, after applying a leave in conditioner, &amp; applied the butter to the ends. When rubbing between palms or fingers, it&#x27;s a little gritty. It gave my hair a nice slip, I was able to style with ease. So far so good. This is why I updated my original review, since I actually tried the product.</li>
            <li> Always a good purchase!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  Your skin is very soft after using expecially after a bath or shower.  A bit oily but the smooth, soft feeling last for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This product is a great moisturizer! It has really been keeping my hair and skin moisturized! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> coming from another brand (AAA) I was somewhat skeptical. I only took off one star for the scent. STRONG! The scent is strong but it ABSOLUTELY does work! I notice my rough elbows and feet becoming sooooo soft as well as the dark spots fading. A little goes a long way. I will be back. Thanks Amazon for bringing these hard to find prducts to us! Superfast shipment too.</li>
            <li> This product has been suggested by many as a great product for hair, but I think it helps more to keep the moisture in then actually moisturize.</li>
            <li> Nice thick texture. Smelly smoky but that&#x27;s nothing essential oils can&#x27;t fix. Keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I use it for eczema and lord knows it work!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisterization cream used for the body as well as the hair and face. It makes the whole skin feel supple while it glides but you have to rub it in for the full moisterizing to take effect. I love it during the day for aid with my sunscreen. Thanks for this wonderful shea butter cream.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but smells HORRIBLE! Get the ivory shea. Slight stain to the skin as well</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first. But I have been using this product on my hair for about three weeks and I absolutely love it. It keeps my edges moisturized and healthy. The only downside is I think the product might have been mixed with palm oil - so it isn&#x27;t actually &#x27;pure&#x27; Shea Butter.Nonetheless palm oil in itself is a moisturizer so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li> I reviewed shea butter on youtube and finally decided to purchase. After searching I finally came accross this and purchased and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The only problem I had was when it came in the mail it was in liquid form. I really wish time was take to refigerate so that it didn&#x27;t liquify and then become solid again. But other than that I am completly happy.</li>
            <li> Very hard and too oily don&#x27;t recommend try better Shea butter instead it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I recives a white shea butter, I was expecting the yellow one.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Im happy I bought the African Shea butter! I use it for my hair as a moisturizing mixture along with coconut oil and my hair loves it. I think i&#x27;ll try to make something for my skin soon! Great product!</li>
            <li> Although I received the shea butter a little later than expected- it was well worth the wait. Not only was the quality of the product great also the service. The vender dealt with me fairly and sent me an extra shea butter for the late shipment. I will only be purchasing this product from this vender. More on the product itself: It has multi uses and smells great!</li>
            <li> Shea butter is great for skin and hair. The product seems it would be enough to split and make separate body butters. I recommend Shea Butter for anyone, with natural curly hair!</li>
            <li> I bought Shea butter once before and fell in love with it. It is great for your hair, face, hands, nails, everything. The tub it came in was quite full as well.</li>
            <li> This is the moisturizer I was looking for. 100% pure. It can be used to hydrate all parts of your body. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 100% shea butter from two other sources, but I liked the price on this shea. The reviews were good, so I guess I got a bad batch. I am used to shea butter being creamy with a mild scent, but this shea was gritty and smells of rancid fat. It smells so nasty that I cannot even use it on my heels, let alone on my lips.  I am dumping it and going back to brands which are more consistent in quality.</li>
            <li> This is quite good shea butter. The package was full. The consistency is tiny grains which &#x27;melt&#x27; into the skin when rubbed in. If you are expecting a super smooth consistency you may be disappointed. Keep in mind the consistency may vary depending on the nut harvesting, preparation, etc. I am using some of this &#x27;straight&#x27; on my skin and will be blending some with coconut oil to create a somewhat lighter cream.</li>
            <li> Love the product still using it</li>
            <li> Product arrived in what looks like plastic cling wrap and inside a ziplock bag--no tub; no container. The bag has a sticker (similar to a mailing label) attached. The product looks like a big blob of unidentifiable gunk; therefore, I am afraid to use it. I&#x27;ve purchased pure shea butter multiple times from various places and nothing looks like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am an AA woman and have pretty dry skin. Every exposure to water absolutely requires I apply moisturizer immediately after. Wearing this product I finally feel like everyone else because it gives a layer or moisture that remains on the skin for over 12 hours...Plus its natural and doesn’t clog pores. It&#x27;s my new thing. Advise you to buy the 4 pack.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter and this is not like any I have ever received.  It almost smells rancid, does not melt easy, and not from Africa - it says product of China right on the label.</li>
            <li> Works very great in all my applications.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because it&#x27;s hard as a rock.  I brought it out into the AZ sun &amp; it hasn&#x27;t softened any.  I might try microwaving it as others have suggested, but I don&#x27;t want to nuke the entire tub.  I think I&#x27;ll just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am disappointed. The butter did come in a plastic container, but was very hard. Since people had mentioned putting in a microwave, I cut some out and did so. Warmed, it handled better; but was very granular. Once I did get these pieces spread, it did soften the skin.  After reading the reviews, I was really hoping that I would be one of those thrilled with the product. This is the first time I have ever bought Shea butter, and it has persuaded me to buy it now from my trusted vitamin company where I see they also have it. Next order, this will be in it.</li>
            <li> I just received this shea butter the other day. I am very well pleased with my purchase. The price alone is great for what I received and this is the real thing, it is fresh, smelled so good and easy to use. I am not at all disappointed. I will be buying from this seller again for two reasons the price and  the fresheness of the shea butter. I will be stocking up. We have a winner here, thank you.</li>
            <li> I loooooveee Shea butter!! I use it as a moisturizer every night before bed and I love the way my skin looks and feels in the morning. I also use it as a all over body moisturizer as well. It has many benefits, such as it has improved my complexion significantly and has lightened my dark marks from old acne scars. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first opened the container. It  looks very grainy and I thought it would leave a residue. To my surprise, it smooths into skin without leaving any residue. It did leave my skin silky smooth and also helped out with a burn on my arm from the oven. I wouldn&#x27;t use this in my hair, because I don&#x27;t think it would absorb as well, but it&#x27;s great for skin.</li>
            <li> I open the container and it is PACKED full!  I love this - value for my dollar.  I have not had it for a month yet and one is almost gone. Time to reorder.  There are just so many uses.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting super cream 100 % natural ok smeal and my hair just love it</li>
            <li> I ordered two tubs of this Shea butter. It is hard, but so thick that just rubbing your fingers over the butter gives you enough to moisturize whatever area you choose. I look forward to using in some lotion bars.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m looking for more natural and organic products without harsh chemicals for my hair and skin. So far I have melted it in the microwave applied it to my skin and hair and I&#x27;m loving it. The product has a rich nutty aroma and it&#x27;s not too oily or greasy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. Even when I scraped some out the container and put it in my hair, it was heavy for a bit until I rubbed it in. I really don&#x27;t know how to review this except to say that if you are looking for natural Shea butter this is a good product to have. I would love to make a bar of soap out of this!</li>
            <li> I went to local PCC market to check the raw unrefined shea butter. It smells just as bad. So I went home and melt the shea butter with coconut butter and added some peppermint oil. It smells much better. I can actually use it without being bothered by the smell. I really like the result of the mixture on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought from a seller named Plant Guru. When I first used it everything was nice. It melted a few seconds after I rub in my palm, moisturized my skin nicely and had very nice smell. However, it is in no way 100% natural and never expires like the container claims. After a while, the color turn from yellow to white, and it now has TERRIBLE smell. like bad chemical smell!!!</li>
            <li> This is one heck of a multi-purpose product! I used on my elbows, knees, &amp; feet (tough areas) and on my face before &amp; after sunning . My husband uses on his heavy calloused hands &amp; what a difference! this African Shea Butter is a miracle worker! My scar from an incision is less noticeable! And I used it on my cat scratches (she literally won&#x27;t let me put her down &amp; her claws dig into my upper shoulder neck area if I try!) It is very absorbent, soothing, and non greasy/non oily. I use the small 8oz tub that was securely sealed, fresh, &amp; easy-to-use by either a clean foundation brush , q-tip, teaspoon, &amp; super clean fingertip (do not re-dip or that may contaminate &amp; spoil product). This would make a super cold weather skin protectant as well! I read about the feautures and benefits of African Shea Butter and I truly love it and such a great value $!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell but it&#x27;s tolerable. The fact that I have to melt it to make it soft it&#x27;s not appealing.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great buy. Before I sent for this product, I checked some local stores and found that the stores were offering a much smaller container for double the price. The product itself is very thick and you will have to rub it in your hands to smooth things out before using it. But, I don&#x27;t mind this. When you put it on your skin, it goes into it very naturally. It doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all. Your skin just looks a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> I absoluty love it. It really has helped with my arthritis and fibromyalgiaand my back pain has eased up quite a bit I will keep buying it I recommend it for others......</li>
            <li> The picture shows that it is in a container but I received  it in a bag! Misleading image very unhappy</li>
            <li> i first bought this in nyc and paid more than twice for it.  i have read rave reviews and awful reviews.  look - this is an all natural product that helps with some skin conditions - it is not a cure for cancer and some other issues that are unrealistic to claim it cures.  if you bought some and the smell made you gag - it was rancid - it can spoil if kept improperly.  once you order from a reputable source; use them again.  a little goes a long way so i found some small containers to portion it out.  the original container is not fancy and neither is the smell.  it is not soft and pliable like a cream, so i found a little scrapper is perfect for digging some out and then you emulsify it between your palms before applying. it is all natural and unscented.  if you find the smell okay, but in need of improvement, you can use an essential oil it but i suggest you only scent small portions at a time so it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;go bad.&amp;#34;  i use this all over, except my face.  i use it as a lip balm as well.  massaged into fingernails and buffed, it lends a nice healthy shine if you do not use polish.  my son works with his hands, but wearing gloves, as a picker.  he has found that used regularly, it keeps the grime from becoming embedded in his skin, keeps his cuticles soft, and otherwise keeps his hands from looking like a mechanics.  my husband used this and likes it very much.  when used regularly, this is extremely effective in softening skin...even the worst cracked and dry heels and elbows BUT you do need to use this regularly.  it&#x27;s great cream, really great stuff - but does not work to its potential if you are a hit and miss user...as with many things.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure i got rancid butter :(...ruined body butter...no way to hide smell! Threw it out because its too much of hassle to return...lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my skin so soft and the smell is not so strong.</li>
            <li> i was curious how pure this product was going to be...man was i surprised! this stuff is sooo smooth and creamy. because its so natural u do have to warm it in your hands to soften, but man once it goes on the effect is absolutely amazing. my skin just melted into softness after applying. because of the natural vitamin content, i know it will be effective at softening my facial blemishes...however will update.</li>
            <li> This product is nice! Really helped my heels and my hubby&#x27;s eczema. The smell is tolerable. Great product! Highly recommend for dryness!!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> I just received my butter and right now I&#x27;m loving it can&#x27;t wait to use it but I love the way it smells I&#x27;m not big on all types of smells in my head but overall I came fast got it the next day after it was shipped but when I opened it I like products like this to have a sealed cover but it didn&#x27;t but other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this after doing some research on naturally helping my daughter&#x27;s dry hair retain moisture.  At the same time I was also looking up natural ways to help my dark eye circles and acne scars. The one consistent thing was natural Shea Butter. From the minute I opened this, I loved it! A little goes a long way with this. I was able to mix together a hair moisturizer from a quarter of this, coconut oil, and others. I put the mixture in her hair and scalp before I blow dry and her hair looks so much healthier. I only need to apply it to her hair once a week and it&#x27;s been a big difference. As far as my skin is concerned I immediately saw the difference under my eyes. To say its disappearing would be fantasy but it is considerably different. My hands are also softer and my skin feels very smooth. I also had a burn from hair removal cream and I put some on it and got instant relief. I am so satisfied with this that I ordered the larger tub of it.</li>
            <li> I received the butter cream after it had set out beside my garage.  I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;know if that was the problem or not, but it is so hard I have trouble dipping it up and spreading on.</li>
            <li> I was at the Taste of Colorado in Denver for the Labor day weekend food fest. There were some guys from Africa there selling this Shea butter in a 16oz container. I got it for $15 (they were asking $20) I see it is way cheaper on line. So any way, I put some on my hands and they stayed moist :-) all day. When I got home my hip hurt from walking around for 2 days at this fair. The salesman told me it was good for pain. I rubbed some in real hard on the painful area. In about 10-20 minutes the pain was gone. So far so good. I like it..9-4-2012</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 months ago and here&#x27;s my take on it. First of all I am African American male that had developed very bad PIH (post inflammatory hyper pigmentation) from a huge environmental change (Los Angeles to Bangladesh). Using it on the face alone without strategy will probably leave your face greasy and eventually break you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My creative way of using to it benefit my face and aid in speeding up the healing process for my PIH is a little time consuming but it does work (for me at least). Here it is, (AT NIGHT TIME ONLY) after cleansing and toning, I take a small dimed sized amount (that&#x27;s all you need trust me!) and rub it into my hands to get it all creamy, I then use 1 drop of Pure Tea Tree Oil and mixed it with the Shea Butter. I apply to my face, and massage in for a full minute or two. After that, I splash cold water on my face for a couple of seconds and then pat dry to rid of the excess and so I don&#x27;t get that greasy look.  Then I use my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t promise this method will work for everyone trying to solve PIH issues but it will contribute to the natural healing process by \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; things out for you. I believe the Tea Tree Oil prevents you from breaking out when using it (from researching so much).</li>
            <li> Pure shea butter is offWHITE, you should never need to microwave it because it is a butter. Pure shea butter is also pretty funky smelling. It smells like... hot crayons and funk or something, but it is forever soft. Yes, this is 100% natural, in that it mixes cocoa butter oil to offset that smell and entice you with a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still like this stuff. After a while it starts to feel a bit gritty, it gets harder to message into your skin, and you basically have to MASH it between your hands to get it to melt and spread. If you live in a pretty hot area you probably won&#x27;t reach that point in this &#x27;shea&#x27; butter&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;I, for extra skin benefits and smoothability, ended up just melting the butter down and mixing it with jojoba oil (probably your skin&#x27;s favorite substance), and let it reform back to a butter again. I love it. My skin has evened out in tone, and its all I use to moisturize my skin that previously felt like the sahara desert. Seriously, when you&#x27;re hot out of the shower, rub some of this down on your body and spread a drop of jojoba across your face and you&#x27;re soft and glowing like a god/goddess. It keeps me moisturized all day too.&lt;br /&gt;All those benefits of easing pain and whatnot that&#x27;s printed on the label- I don&#x27;t see how that works, nor have I really experienced those pain easing benefits, but hey maybe someone has. Or maybe I just don&#x27;t pay attention. I could see how the funky smelling pure shea butter would though. I have to try that out.</li>
            <li> This is a raw and unrefined product, so there are bits of plant material in the bottom of the container. I melt it gently to strain and decant it into small glass pots to use, so the sediment isn&#x27;t a worry to me. It lasts forever, makes an excellent eye cream on its own, and combines beautifully with virgin coconut oil and organic cocoa butter for a silky skin emollient. I&#x27;m very pleased. This was a repeat order for me. I&#x27;m stocking up on a lot of my little luxuries since I know our economy is just getting worse and inflation is increasing. Shea butter was at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I used this as an ingredient in some lotion bars. It worked well &amp; I like how the bars turned out. The only thing that was a little different is it has a strong smell. I used orange essential oil but you really just still smell the shay butter. --It doesn&#x27;t stink though &amp; this is the first time I used this so that may be normal. I will still use them &amp; plan on gifting them as well.</li>
            <li> Update: 12/08/2013:&lt;br /&gt;I have been melting in microwave half a spoon full for 1 minute. Turns to oil lasts more, feels better!&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have stretch marks on the first 8 months of my pregnancy using only lotion and sometimes cocoa butter, and I didn&#x27;t scratch. However, after the 8th month my belly got really big and heavy and red stretch marks started appearing. Regular creams, oils and lotions didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;good\\&quot;, I was itchy and my skin felt extremely stretched, not the products fault...a normal thing of pregnancy (first baby).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I had read reviews in the past about Shea Butter. I have been using it and I feel so much better. This stuff although kind of hard to get off the plastic jar (I use a plastic spoon to scrape it) is really soft and my skin no longer feels stretched. My stretch marks are still visible but they changed from an ugly dark purple to a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My belly feels so good when I put it because It feels healthy and soft. I do a little massage, the smell is not the best BUT THIS STUFF is AWSOME!</li>
            <li> This product saved my complextion last winter.  My face was so red, dry and itchy last winter that I finally decided to try this product.  I&#x27;m susceptible to acne but this Shea butter moisturizer and softened my red, dry and itchy skin without creating zits or clogging my pores.  It goes a long way so one ctn will last awhile.  The shea butter does harden but I scrape some out of the ctn and rub it in my palm before spreading it on my face and neck.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this butter for making my own home made Lotions and Balms . Since this is all organic,it has that nutty smell which is the biggest turn off for me but never the less,I add some scent to  make my lotion smell good . Oily skin people please do not use this on your face since this is very heavy butter. This also  helped me with my cold hives that I usually get in Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an honest review by me after using this product !!!</li>
            <li> product as described, arrived on time</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I scoop it out and pack it in small containers so that I can have it in my purse for my lips and hands. It has almost no smell and the ability of this stuff to moisturize my dry skin (lizard skin) makes any slight off scent worth it. Last time I bought it it was in a larger container kind of lumped in there and the color was uneven.  I liked being able to pick up hunks of it to use.  I just had to let it melt a bit in my hand (30 seconds or less).  This time it is melted smooth in a container half the size and I had to scoop it out- just a little more refined this time but the same great quality.</li>
            <li> Too grainy. I&#x27;m used to a thicker and smoother shea butter from the market.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too grainy. Made whipped She butter with it and it worked perfectly and stores great. The product can perfectly packaged. Nothing was broken or spilled.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my body - it&#x27;s been great. Winter comes and I forget to use lotion. ONce you get those cracked skin... normal lotion really can&#x27;t repair that. I thought I was basically screwed. I slathered on a thick layer of shea butter for 12 hours (went to sleep in gloves), woke up, washed it off, put on normal lotion (bath and body work&#x27;s noel&#x27;s hand cream) and boom,... my hand it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too thick for me to use every day so I use it when needed. I also put it into a small container to use for lips or cuticles. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because I have not used other shea butter before so I cannot testify for that component but for instant healing of dry skin, it is superior to many  many other oils (coconut, avacado, etc)</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR USING ON A LOT OF THINGS (BODY) &amp; LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> smooth and easily applicable</li>
            <li> The product itself is as described.  However, to describe it, I would say its a lightly greasy, thick &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;.  We have been putting on a newly healing tattoo and the healing power of Shea Butter is incredible. I have never seen a tattoo heal better! (Props to the artist and how he treated it once completed too, that does make a big difference)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan on getting a couple of nice smelling essential oils and possibly a little Jojoba oil to mix with this to make a nice lotion. I will be buying more as I use up this container.</li>
            <li> Great product! Everything I expected! Delivered on time. Great service! Will certainly buy this again - awesome for hair when mixed with oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff and I must say I have gotten MULTIPLE uses out of it from a hair aid, to skin and scar cream to skin softener.  I love this stuff.  You get a pretty decent tube of this stuff - 8 ounces of yellow shea butter.  I don&#x27;t melt mine I just keep it in my room at room temperature or on top of a heat source and it warms to a nice manipulative consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
            <li> This product was delivered in a baggie. It did not come packaged  like the picture. I have used shea butter for a long time, and love it. However what I received was not the same color as the  all natural shae butter that I buy in stores. I am just not comfortable using a product that has no packaging and is sealed with a knot in a bag..  I returned my product.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves this! It moisturizes it well but I wish that it was shipped in a container not a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Love this product, clears my sons eczema  up within a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;Was a little shocked it just came in a plastic bag with a tie, no container. But the product is great!</li>
            <li> Use this on my entire body every night. Great Great Great. Its very thick but rub a chunk in your hand for about 15 seconds to smooth out and then apply.</li>
            <li> Pure natural shea butter is an off white color. Yellow shea butter has an added ingredient known as red palm oil. This shea butter is not 100% natural like they claim because it was yellow and therefore had red palm oil added. I was very disappointment because it looked off white in the picture. I will not be repurchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> It is what it says. I love it. I use it on my hair and skin. Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I wanted to make my own body moisturizer using this combined with coconut oil.  The scent of this is too overwhelming.  I don&#x27;t like this smell at all, it smells kind of dirty.  This is my first time using any brand of Shea Butter and I really hope they don&#x27;t all smell this strong.</li>
            <li> I hated this Shea butter it was hard, and very hard to mix. I will be purchasing the raw Shea butter next time instead of the African she&#x27;s butter</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair on my face and all over my body and it just does something to your skin &amp; hair that&#x27;s unbelievable. My skin was always glowing and my hair always looked so healthy. I ran out and can&#x27;t find it anywhere so I&#x27;m gonna have to order more.</li>
            <li> worked great used to make homemade lotion. will order again when needed. Received quicker then expected</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on my skin and hair. For my hair I use it to moisturize my edges and it also keeps my skin smooth ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> I ordered this once and loved it! It was golden and in a container like the picture. Smells amazing. So I ordered it again, and it was gray and in a plastic bag and all grainy. What the heck??</li>
            <li> just got through with the raw shea butter i  had and this one is a thousand times better, easier to mix &amp;&lt;br /&gt;just a dab will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the best i have purchased in the last ten years</li>
            <li> the result after using this product, did exceed my expectation. It makes the skin very smooth and fantastic looking. The skin becomes like children skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Product as expected. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make organic deodorant.  I chose this rating because of the price.  I can&#x27;t compare it to any other product, because this is the first time I&#x27;ve used shea butter.  I would buy this product again.  I have so much of this, it will be awhile.</li>
            <li> Could never find pure shea butter in the stores so I finally checked on here. I should&#x27;ve known to come to amazon first. A really good amount of quality pure shea butter. Great for my girls hair and many other things!</li>
            <li> One star sorry ...it smells terrible, I&#x27;ve used a lot of shea butter in the past and this smells like used fry oil that was forgotten in the back of the fridge for a couple of months...It is very rancid, please double check your shipments and storage before you ship products next time. Maybe the Amazon warehouse is too warm?please consider packaging it differently plastic bag allows air to get in</li>
            <li> So good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub it in and it lasts through numerous hand washes. It makes skin and hair shine, and you only need a little bit to do the job.</li>
            <li> this is some good stuff and cheap...received very fast. Will order again when I run out. It healed a sore super fast that I used it on.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin on the feet and elbows. Not greasy at all. I use it at night just before I do to bed for the maximum benefit.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 3 stars because it smells like an ashtray.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is exactly what I was expecting, it is a little course and grainy. I ordered it to make shaving cream for my husband but it did not work as well as I would have liked. It does melt well and it may function better in a different application.  The product its self is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really last a long time. I mixed it with coconut oil, cocoa butter, sweet almond oil to make my own body and face lotion.  Shea butter was in good and neat packaging and texture was rich and creamy.  I love shea butter!</li>
            <li> Product was melted due to hot weather. It came in a little plastic bag and not in a container as the picture indicated.  I had to place it in a container I already had.  Once it hardened again it is grainy and difficult to blend in.  I have to hear a daub of it in the microwave to use it.  It works that way quite good.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the best thing ever for dry skin! I don&#x27;t care if it has color in it or it has been filtered or whatever. My elbows were dry and scaly,  and the rest of me was itchy and uncomfortable. I made an olive oil and Shea butter lotion, and hooray! My skin is all better!</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin and in my hair occaionally. its is very good. I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied!  I does wonders!  I purchased it to make home made body creams and I am very,very pleased!  Not to mention the price was great as well.  Will purchase again!  Keep providing great products.  It&#x27;s not always about gaining big profits but gaining HAPPY &amp; SATISFIED customers!</li>
            <li> Works great for moisturizing dry skin.  The smell is not great so look to add some natural scented oil (peppermint, lavender) to adjust the smell.  Be sure not to use too much as will get into your clothes</li>
            <li> Soft enough for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Local African American beauty supply stores in my area provide more product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for African-textured hair. Before I started using 100% pure raw African shea butter my hair would dry out shortly after being washed. It seemed like every other day I was having to reapply different types of moisturizers and conditioners to my dry and brittle hair. I could count on my hair either drinking up the moisturizer too quickly or not absorbing the moisturizer at all: the moisturizer simply coated my hair instead of penetrating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 100% shea butter I can wash my hair, apply the shea butter, untangle it, braid it and not have to worry about my hair drying out for 2 weeks! So shea butter and African-textured hair is a perfect marriage, in my opinion. My hair absorbs the butter so well. I rub it between my hands, creating the heat necessary to make it into a soft, smooth cream consistency so I don&#x27;t have clumps of yellow product in my hair. I rub it all the way down to my roots. My hair loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to black females who are going natural. It cuts down on breakage by keeping hair moisturized and strong. And keeping the hair braided helps to lock in the cream. My hair looks black and shiny.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized container for making up some lotions using essential oils.  Not too much  and in a nicely accessible tub.  Came in fast too!</li>
            <li> Was not pleased at all and wouldnt give it any stars but 1 is ok. I did not want organic i wanted the raw shea butter pictured...its even a different color that the norm and the one shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin instead of lotion and it works wonders on my skin. It might not be for everybody but it works for me!! I purchased it for my hair ( I am natural btw) I ended up using it on my skin instead. My skin feels softer, fresher, and it is clearing up nicely which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I order this stuff every 3 months. Everyone in home uses this. Its amazing for your face. Will always continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The product is good quality and it is raw as advertised. However, my container was crushed and cracked when I received it (probably more the fault of the post office than the seller) and the shea butter was not packed down in the container so there was definitely room in the container for more than I received. All in all a suitable product though. I&#x27;ve already made half a dozen lotion bars with it and I still have plenty left over.</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for many uses.  It clears up heat rashes and other minor skin ailments.  I use in on my neck and chest for wrinkles and have really noticed the difference.  It makes my hands smooth and cleans up my cuticles.  It has also faded some brown spots on my hands.  I suggested it to a friend who is using it for chafing after exercise.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This was the first Shea butter I purchased when I began my foray into DIY skincare. It&#x27;s ok. I mean, it works but after purchasing better quality Shea butter (available on Amazon), I realize how inferior this kind is. It is very greasy and smelly and the color is less than ideal. I know that color doesn&#x27;t matter, but if you are creating something that depends on a certain look and texture, perhaps consider purchasing a better quality ivory Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Even makes my hair grow.  Need it in Arizona.  It is so dry here.  Just love  this  product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some pure Shea butter to blend with other oils and make body butter. This was perfect.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, very satisfied.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> You can use this Shea Butter for a lots of things. This is the best buy and the best for you health needs.</li>
            <li> Wow. I bin making body butter for a while. 6 months lol. But this is the smoothest stuff ever. Its pure luxury. I am using this from now on. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li> I originally bought shea butter to make my own chapstick. After reading reviews I decided to use the reset as a moisturizer as well. I love it! When I get out of the shower I mix a little in my hand with some  coconut oil and omg my skin feels like butter. Love it! And I love that its all natural!</li>
            <li> I make my own (mostly-organic) cosmetics, so I&#x27;ve used a number of different products from a number of different brands, and this has got to be the most disgusting smelling thing I&#x27;ve ever received. The rancid smell was so strong it permeated all of the lotions I made - none of my essential oils could mask it. Not only that, but the yellow color was so bright that it stained my clothes it touched. I ended up just tossing it, because it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of sending it back. I did later buy Grade A ivory Shea butter from Ghana (via Halal Today) and it was amazing! It has the typical nutty scent of Shea without it being overpowering and blends/melts well into my lip balms an lotions, as well as being great used direct. Buy that instead.</li>
            <li> Works really great for things like stretch marks but it&#x27;s so greasy.  Just be prepared to have slimy skin, other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff! I use it for my hair and skin, BUT I found it cheaper at a local farmers market so i get it from there now. If i can no longer find it in stores than I would definitely purchase it from here again. No problems with delivery or packaging.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my shea butter. I have used it as a skin moisturizer for the summer and the winter.  I have also used it for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and mild case of eczema. It cleared the diaper rash and eczema and I never saw it again. This shea butter has many uses.  I will be ordering more once I run out!</li>
            <li> I really like this shea butter. It makes my skin feel really smooth and soft especially during this dry winter season .</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter dryness!  I also use this on my son&#x27;s eczema and it really helps.  I used it on my hands each night to moisturize.  it is a solid and requires you to work it a bit in your hands to soften it to apply.</li>
            <li> This product sooths dry skin like no other.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  My husband loves it on his feet.</li>
            <li> As a user of shea butter for years, I&#x27;m aware of good and bad. As delivered, this produce was rancid. Will not pruchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my hair and on my skin. Started using it on my daughter as well. A must buy for anyone with dry itchy skin, or wanting a natural product to add moisture to their skin.</li>
            <li> I started using African Shea Butter about 6 yrs ago, ordering from another seller. I am clumsy in a kitchen so I have old burn scars. I didn&#x27;t know about Shea Butter back then.&lt;br /&gt;This sellers price is fantastic and I noticed the container right away, This seller has the GOOD STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews and one mentioned not having to use a \\&quot;microwave\\&quot;? Please don&#x27;t ruin a good thing. Microwaves only destroy, changes even to the molecular level whatever is put in it. Do your research. Just sayin&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;It is almost unbelievable how wonderful Shea Butter is. If a child gets a small burn 1st or even 2nd degree,  there won&#x27;t be anymore tears when this product is applied as it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; into the skin!</li>
            <li> I had never used this but was told it was great for skin. I have had 2 carpal surgeries and needed some for rubbing in the scar area. It seems to be working and without all the chemicals in other rubs which makes me feel better. There is no real smell and it melts quickly so it is easy to rub in. Like it lots.</li>
            <li> I expected it to come in a container, not a generic plastic bag.</li>
            <li> If you are truly looking for a great body moisturizer this product will be great. I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as the reviewers said, but it was. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but wanted others to know, this is really a great product.</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter.  I use this as a facial and body moisturizer after washing with raw African black soap. My skin is clear and healthy looking. The shea butter goes on best if it is heated to liquid form, so I warm it with my blow dryer for a few seconds before applying it. A small amount covers a large area.  I gave this four stars instead of five because the shea butter takes time to absorb into the skin, and it is too greasy to use in the morning, but it is a perfect overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great, and there&#x27;s a noticeable difference on how much lighter my stretch marks have gotten.</li>
            <li> Heated in the microwave a bit before using.  Works well, good price,  smells kind of nutty and nice.</li>
            <li> Does wonders to the skin and hair. wish packaging was better though. Mine came in , in a plastic bag</li>
            <li> Awesome on skin and hair. Healed my husbands cracked feet after a week and keeps my sons dry, tightly coiled hair moisturized. These reviews on how it comes in an oily plastic bag are so petty lol. Pull the bag off, wipe off the container and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very soft and works well. I bought this to make lip balms and I also use this on my skin. it&#x27;s a pretty large amount and will last me a very long time</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s raw and unrefined.  Very good consistency and my skin drinks this stuff.  It takes a little bit to absorb, but my hands felt the difference after a long day of cleaning/washing hands excessively.  I&#x27;m going to try this stuff for a crayon lipstick experiment and see how it works!</li>
            <li> currently in the process of using it . i received it today and i love it so far it doesn&#x27;t break me out like other natural products do. It makes my hair extremely soft and it curly my hair up ( i am an african american) I would definitely recommend this as of right now. if i have different thoughts about it i will update .</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my skin gets irritated during the wintertime and a combination of Shea Butter and Cerave is the only thing that helps to soothe it. It came quickly and is definitely authentic shea butter. A little definitely goes a long way!</li>
            <li> so great shop 100% no damage 100% clean 100% care ,&lt;br /&gt;and so good price trust me this is good shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i make deal 3 time with them 100% price and stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works. I use this all over my body, I also used in a recipe for hair care treatment makes your hair soft</li>
            <li> very good product for the price ,my rating will be 10+++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this produce to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I use it as a skin cream. Nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> This came a little gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like that. But all in all, it came quickly and it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I use it on my face several times a week near bedtime. It takes a while for it to soak in to your skin, so apply it an hour or two before bed. When temperatures are below 65 degrees F it becomes hard to remove from the container and difficult to apply. I use a plastic picnic knife with a serrated edge to scrape off a small amount at a time. You can rub it in between your fingers to soften if it&#x27;s too hard due to low temperatures.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a &amp;#34;simply lovely&amp;#34; tub of bright yellow butter that smelt like petroleum jelly. The packet clearly stated that this brand is not FDA approved. Authentic shea butter is never this yellow (more like off white) and has a nutty smell, not a chemical smell. But after melting it I got a pleasant smell. Also, the black spots which I thought were mold are just unrefined bits. Not a bad purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. I am African American and I use it as a hair moisturizer and my hair is always very soft whenever I do use it. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to have soft/moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> This smelled TERRIBLE. I couldn&#x27;t use it in any of my recipe&#x27;s. Do not buy unless you want to have terrible smelling shea butter. In this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Received half of them broken..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I&#x27;ve switched to all-natural plant oil skin care regimen and was excited to try the shea butter, especially after reading all the glowing reviews about it.  However, after I got it and tried using it (several times), I just gave up because of the smell.  The smell is downright awful!  It smells like rancid bacon grease.  Now, I normally don&#x27;t mind plant smells at all; in fact, I enjoy them and have quite a few essential oils in my medicine cabinet. I use dragon oil, which is quite pungent and I don&#x27;t mind that at all.  But this ... this ... this is old rancid bacon grease.  Bleh.</li>
            <li> it feels good on skin and makes skin look healthy</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described and I was really happy with it. Shea butter has a nutty, earthy scent which I don&#x27;t find terribly pleasant (smells a little like dirt) but I combined it with cocoa butter and some scented essential oil to make a whipped body butter. I&#x27;m very happy with it, it&#x27;s extremely moisturising and a little goes a long way. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your skin so smooth and not just touch, you can see the smoothness... A must have for me now</li>
            <li> It is very hard, but I put a little bit in my hand, rub with my fingers and it dissolves well. I have just started using it so I cannot comment on my benefits yet, but I&#x27;ve read a lot about Shea Butter and I&#x27;m happy to find this in it&#x27;s 100% natural form.</li>
            <li> Never used before now.  Purchased for my hair.  No directions for how to use on hair.  Recommend watching KinkyTresses&#x27; YouTube Channel and Video titled &amp;#34;Tips on Applying Unrefined Shea Butter to Afro-Textured Natural Hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are using this for other purposes, check out the American Shea Butter Institute&#x27;s article titled &amp;#34;All Shea Butters Are Not Equally Effective&amp;#34; because I had no idea that the grading makes a difference in the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Last batch was harder, this one is a little too soft, but I like it anyway</li>
            <li> Love this. I bought this product last year and I still have some left. It keeps my hair and skin soft.</li>
            <li> Great product, was very smooth not chunky</li>
            <li> Good Shea Butter 100% Natural, not the most organic product out there but this is a great value for the price! I usually mix it with coconut oil and tea tree oil and leaves my skin very soft and helps reduce blemishes.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is amazing, best stuff on earth.  Finding a reliable source to buy it, however, seems to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the picture is a plastic container with that rich golden-yellow shea butter - the best quality in my book.  The texture is smooth like butter, and has a warm smoky smell that I could inhale for hours.  Once, I lost a container of the awesome quality shea butter.  Turns out, it spent a little over a year tucked in a hidden spot in my car.  So, it was exposed to a murderous hot new england summer, and a freezing cold new england winter.  When I found it, it no longer had the amazing smell and texture that I remember.  It had a gritty texture, a less than lovely aroma, and the color had changed to that of raw pizza dough.  I threw it out.  What arrived today is that quality of shea butter that spent a year in my car.  And in a plastic baggie, no less - not even in a container.  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Plant Guru, I have no idea what conditions you store your shea butter in, or for how long you store it before you sell it - but what I got from you looks and smells like it&#x27;s been abused.  I purchased from you because you posted a picture of the quality product that I was looking for, and I feel that you pulled a bait-and-switch. I will not shop with you again, nor will I recommend you to others.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister to help with her stretch marks since she had a kid over a year ago and it seems to have helped a lot. I also like how you can melt this stuff and put it into separate containers if you want and then it goes back to being a solid.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and do not order from this seller. Worse Shea Butter ever</li>
            <li> Smooth Shea butter. Excellent texture. Great price. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product when I was watching some type of fashion video on Youtube with Amber Rose *Kanye West&#x27;s infamous girlfriend *now ex*- anyway she was asked what was some of her favorite make up and skin care products. I was dying to know this because I love this woman and I find her skin to be absolutely flawless... I was shocked when she said raw african shea butter. She explained that she usually melts it in the microwave to soften it and puts it all over her body as soon as she gets out of the shower... Her face and everywhere else.. So, I just had to try it. I&#x27;ve always heard of using shea butter how it is a good moisturizer..but wow.. I noticed a difference in my face within two days... My skinned looked brighter... More clear..My complexion looks healthier.. My laugh lines look as if they are slowly disappearing... I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer for the winter..I normally use neutrogena for sensitive skin but it doesn&#x27;t help as nearly as good as shea butter.. My face still feels really dry and if I use their formula for dry skin my skin breaks out for some reason. It&#x27;s good for a all over moisturizer... I put it everywhere... I don&#x27;t put on too much.. A little goes a long way... I usually put it on in the morning under make up and before bed... When I first purchased this product I would apply it all over my face but now I only put it where the skin is the driest like for me.. under eyes and my laugh lines and neck. I avoid my cheeks since their already pretty oily... This stuff is great for problem areas and discolorations.. I love it...BUY IT</li>
            <li> After much digging around on amazon to find a good source for raw shea butter, I found this listing. I read through a lot of reviews that complained about a foul smell or gritty texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8 oz of raw gold shea butter I received are great. The plastic tub is jam-packed with a very yellow shea butter that is smooth, not at all gritty, and has a very subtle fatty/nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shea butter; I plan to use it as a base for homemade skincare. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dry skin or fine lines who doesn&#x27;t want to use chemical-laden products. This is best used, I think, as a night cream because it is fairly heavy. Today, my skin feels more moisturized and supple without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something to help my mom with her eczema and this is the first product that has gotten the job done. Even prescription lotions haven&#x27;t worked this well.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all it arrived fast but it has no smell to it and you have to microwave it and it made my skin break out but I have sensitive skin so yeahhh and you have to keep it in a just right temperature not too cold and not too hot ,you can microwave it to break it down but I had to trash it because my skin so sensitive but hey it might work for you it is just as pictured same exact canister and same color ....and it is 100% as says so that&#x27;s why I gave 5 stars I just have so sensitive skin but once I find my product that works on my skin I&#x27;ll be ordering every month:)</li>
            <li> This cream is the BOM! it works wonders for me.  I use it e-v-e-r-y day.</li>
            <li> I love this product but beware it comes in a plastic bag. Not the container as shown.</li>
            <li> I love it !&lt;br /&gt;Its make my skin soft&lt;br /&gt;But its smell is like peanut butter :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re order it again</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF TO HELP EASE ROUGH OR DRY SKIN . EASY TO USE EVERY MORNING OR NIGHT TO PROVIDE SMOOTH SKIN THAT GETS COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHERS.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I use in the winter and mix it with oils.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product to be sold online.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders!!! i love it! I use it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to those looking for real skin care results!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular Shea butter  brand I use this one of all Shea butter&#x27;s most often I use it for my skin my hair I use it right after my bath I use it for the soul of my feet Shea butter is great if you have dreads twist your dreads with Shea butter</li>
            <li> This shea butter is sumptuous. Fresh and nutty, smooth, and very moisturizing. I use it as a moisturizer for the entire family, including my 8-month-old. I also mix it with jojoba or coconut oil as a hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works miracles. I will definitely purchase this brand over what I used to buy (NOW brand).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good. But smells a bit yucky and has a little greasy film vs hard cocoa butter that goes on with a pleasant smell. Not bad for the price and has e and d in it according the the label-more than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter so I am often looking for shea butter at great prices.  The one thing I realized after receiving this is sometimes price isn&#x27;t worth the decreased quality.  Of all the shea butter I have purchased, in store or online this one had the most grit and other stuff in it.  I won&#x27;t purchase she butter from them again.</li>
            <li> I will admit that there is a slight smell that takes some getting used to.  It&#x27;s not an offensive smell, just a little different.  The smell goes away after the shea butter &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34;.  Overall, I really like this lotion - it&#x27;s great for my hands, my feet, and my face.</li>
            <li> Love to make personal care products using this rich, emollient shea butter (among other ingredients).</li>
            <li> Love using this in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Oil Coconut Oil (76 Degree) on skin and alone on scalp.</li>
            <li> This arrived today but not as advertised. The picture clearly shows a container, but it came today in a flimsy plastic bag. Now I have to buy a storage container for it. Not happy with this deceptive ad.</li>
            <li> I love the hydrating feeling afterwards. I have dry skin so helps alot</li>
            <li> Great Product! The Shea is an excellent quality and the price is a good value. I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is a wonderful product for your skin and at such a great bargain.  I use it to make lotion bars, sunblock and soon deodorant.  The uses are endless.</li>
            <li> You start noticing the difference in your skin right away after the first application. I first used it at night and noticed by morning my face was alot smoother and I didn&#x27;t need primer on my face that day!</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have gotten it for years, but this was my first time acquiring it online. I was a bit skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised that the quality was still there, and I received my package quickly. Will definitely purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I applied the African Shea Butter to my legs to alleviate severe dry skin. I immediately experienced an intense burning sensation and then a bright red rash appeared. I tried removing the shea butter with liquid soap, but that wouldn&#x27;t cut it. I then applied some dish soap with vigorous scrubbing. The burning persisted. I spread some vinegar on my legs to cut the soap and then some Shikai borage oil lotion to soothe the area. I purchased this shea butter based on the reviews I&#x27;d read, but apparently I have an allergy to it. My husband is currently trying it and has had no adverse reaction thus far. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again, but I&#x27;m sure it works fine for others. This is just a warning that even \\&quot;pure\\&quot; products won&#x27;t work for everybody.</li>
            <li> purchased this shae butter the other day and it was delivered to me just now and i was just dieing to use it on my hair and skin. i have been hearing tons of rave about how good it is. so i had to try it.  i am very pleased with the texture and quality also the smell. i will be coming back to buy some more. great stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this African Shea butter to treat burns, scratches and sun burns. I have noticed incredible results with this product. When applied to a sunburn I felt instant relief and my skin healed much faster than normal. I also use this as a deep moisturizer on my skin. Because this is raw Shea butter it is not a very pleasant smell. Besides the musty smell, it is a must.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer available(I literally have tried them ALL) and its pure, no chemicals no B.S. and exceptionally priced and excellent quality...  5 star highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> My order was delivered less than a week after I ordered it.  However, I notice the container was broken.  Will have to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like overheated cooking oil as most reviewers mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another order with this kind of packaging.  Too much hassle to deal with damaged merchandise return.</li>
            <li> The order was made on a Thrusday and I recieved it on a saturday. Quick, I Really Like That. I&#x27;m A Natural Chic. So I use it for my hair and it works just great. It keeps a shine to my hair and it continues to grow.</li>
            <li> I used this to make homemade skin cream.  It smells nice, is creamy and feels nice on my skin.  No real negatives, good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its great  for your skin and hair only in the winter. In the summer it might be oily and sticky.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for us as both as a skin and hair moisturizer! The dry climate has left us looking for a solution to dry elbows, heels, etc, and the shea butter has made a drastic difference!</li>
            <li> This shea butter left a lot of yellow stain on my white sheets. It also gave  my kids a rash. I had to thro it out.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth and creamy shea butter, this is it!  I have order four so far and planning on order more!</li>
            <li> I bought raw shea butter in hopes of avoiding stretch marks during my first pregnancy, i&#x27;m 38 weeks and have gained 30 pounds and no stretch marks. I love the benefits of this product but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a natural product so it won&#x27;t spread on as easily as other creams. We keep our home very cool so i usually have to scoop some out, warm it up by rubbing it together in my hands and then apply, it&#x27;s worth the extra work. I have also used it on my face (apply lightly) and really see an improvement. We live in the Colorado rockies where the weather is very dry and this has been a great find. I apply this every night to my belly and over time it has stained my shirts BUT i think this could have been avoided had i let it absorb a little longer before dressing. Also great for dry, cracked feet. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter as an ingredient to make solid lotion bars and lip balm. I had to wait on the other ingredients to arrive, and started using the shea butter by itself on my driest areas. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. At room temperature it&#x27;s pretty solid, but melts easily at skin temperature. It liquefied when I stored the container too close to my laptop, so it melts at fairly low temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I made the solid lotion bars and lip balm, I realized I am never buying lotion or lip balm again, so I&#x27;ve ordered more shea butter from this seller. I love it!</li>
            <li> My husband is a farmer and struggles with dry, cracked hands in the winter. When we started dating I ordered him a tub of this stuff for Christmas. He uses it every night before bed, and over the past 2 years I continue to see an improvement in his skin.</li>
            <li> after using this on my skin , it started blotching( changing to a lighter color). This product seems to contain bleach .</li>
            <li> I think this is a really good moisturizer, haven&#x27;t seen much fading yet of some marks I have. Haven&#x27;t used it but a couple weeks now. I use it with ambi fading cream. After using black raw soap from Africa Ghana, you will defiantly love this after you rinse your face.</li>
            <li> Works every time on my very dry skin and dry lips. My whole family loves it, and it&#x27;s very versatile too!</li>
            <li> Really does work for my ashy feet. THANKS</li>
            <li> never bought this before but I wanted to make lotions bars and it did the job perfectly..nothing to compare it to since its the first time I used it, but its got to be the real deal the way it performs</li>
            <li> This is super moisturizing at work! It isn&#x27;t like a cream or lotion-more like a paste so it takes longer to apply. It is bright yellow so make sure you wait a couple of minutes for your skin to absorb it before getting dressed. It does have an unusual scent, but not bad. I am over 8 months pregnant and I use it everyday on my belly and I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet (although supposedly stretch marks are from hormones and no ointment is supposed to be able to prevent them). However, it does prevent me from scratching and from having dry skin.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail today applied it to my hair Ill see so far moisturizes very well keeps my hair hydrated .But -------the smell is like ran-sit lard .Ill order from a different company to compare .I wont order this product from this company anymore I will try to mix this with Coconut oil to hide the Oder  till its used up since I paid for this I dont wanna toss it .Maybe this is how it smells ,and I&#x27;ve just gotten so use to the over perfumed products from the Beauty stores</li>
            <li> Not the softest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used which leads me to believe it was a little old. The smell of Shea Butter was also very strong and did not fade. It is still however usable with a little heat to melt it down and if you are ok with a strong scent of Shea butter I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
            <li> Purchased to make lip balm.  Worked great!!!</li>
            <li> I love natural products I have brought this product several times. This product does leave my skin smooth and feeling great. It is fragrance free and chemical free.</li>
            <li> I like using it on my skin, but sometimes there&#x27;s a grainy texture that I really don&#x27;t enjoy. And it takes a lot to make shea butter workable, mixing it with other natural oils to make it spreadable, it was just a lot of work. Don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll be ordering again any time soon. Maybe next winter when I need something a little thicker. to get by.</li>
            <li> The best skin moisturizer Ive ever used!..my skin is soft and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> I have been using raw Shea Butter for YEARS and love what it has done for my skin and scars. It&#x27;s amazing. This batch came in the mail today and it is like no raw shea butter I&#x27;ve used before... it smells HORRIBLE, not like normal shea butter but more chemically. Normal shea butter stinks, but this is just a horrible non-natural smell. When I ordered this product it was $6, now - only 1 week later - it&#x27;s only $3ish. That tells me that something is wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did apply some to see how it would feel, and a little goes a really long way - just like the raw SB I normally use - but it leaves a greasy residue which I&#x27;m not used to. I haven&#x27;t decided if I will continue to use it or return it, but I will update if I do continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This does make your skin incredibly soft and healthy, there is no doubt about that, but dont forget that this is 100% natural. This makes it a very hard butter that can be difficult to spread and it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, I put some body spray on after im done applying it.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible!!!! I don&#x27;t know what this is but it is not Shea Butter. I threw it away it was so nastyfofore you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, read this before you buy [...]</li>
            <li> I was so eager to try shea butter for both my hair and my skinbut i dont think this prouct will work for me. I read that raw shea butter is supposed to help with acne so i tried it on my face and it worked fine but it was just sooo greasy :( same for my natural hair, i tried using less and less each time but my hair looked wet from being so oily. I then tried it as a body moisturizer but it took all day to soak into my skin and i looked sweaty from being so oily. When i used it overnight i liked it the next morning but with my routine i shower in the mornings so it seemed like i just washed it all off and then i would have to re apply and look oily again so that didnt work out too well for me.  I think someone with super dry skin and super dry hair would love this since it is all natural and very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;:) but my skin is only slightly dry as well as my hair so it was all just a bit too heavy for me. Since i have so much left of it im going to try to use it for deep conditioning treatments on my hair.  As far as the package goes i had no&lt;br /&gt;issues with the package and the container is nice, definitely reusable :)</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not really shea butter, it&#x27;s good African butter. Kinda grainy, but not so bad. I did positive experience with the seller (Nail Polish Supplies). I left good feedback but also told them how the container was cracked (I found out when I 1st heated it MESSY!) Didn&#x27;t lose a lot, and the seller was super nice and said they&#x27;re replace it! Wow! Anyway, it&#x27;s a cheaper fix for moisturizer, but I did get some real ivory shea butter on here that was cheap and really good. In my opinion, use this for hair treatments, but not for skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered shea butter from different sellers, in the past, and none of them ever smelled like cocoa butter.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love cocoa butter, but I ordered shea butter.  It is bright yellow, and I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it really is pure shea butter, as it states on the container.  I have no problem with this product, other than the fact that it smells like something it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  I would give it a five, but...</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, Still Using it. Skin So beautiful and Soft like a feather</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful coat to seal in the moisture once I&#x27;ve shampooed, conditioned, and placed leave-in conditioner in my hair. I don&#x27;t always need a styler in my natural hair after putting in the shea butter, but if I want more curl definition then I just add Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls. Nonetheless, the shea butter keeps my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Great for your whole body, even your face.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter Cream is a mainstay in my daily and nightly beauty regimen.  I use it on both my body and my natural hair.  It brightens my complexion and is a great moisture sealant for my hair.  For me, this product is a must have!</li>
            <li> WOW- I&#x27;m guessing I got a rancid batch since not many have complained about the horrible scent!!  I put it on my one arm and it literally smelled like sweaty feet dipped in french fries.  SO disgusting that I am not going to be able to use it.  It was cheap so I&#x27;m not going to  pay more than I paid for the butter to return it.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> african shea butter can be used to treat dry skin (eczema/chapped lips etc.) , for darker tanning, softening calluses, and also a great moisturizer for african american hair... for easier use, put into the microwave for about 30secs or until softened...</li>
            <li> Okay so I have had eczema since I was 12, this product was awesome at reducing eczema inflammation for the first few weeks but then it&#x27;s as if my body got used to it and I had to resort to steroids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a full-on eczema cure, but it does treat it in the early stages. If your eczema turns into a rash that itches A LOT, and sometimes leaks anti-bodies THIS will not repair it (at least for me). BUT if you catch the rash when it is barely forming it can stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great moisturizer, use generously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: There is shea butter in a beige/ivory color commonly known as Ivory Shea Butter. The gold and ivory shea butters are both shea butter, but the ivory is more creamy and effective against eczema, it&#x27;s also less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, this is GOOD for moisturizing and for fighting eczema, but I recommend you buy African Ivory Shea Butter (Cheaper + Better).</li>
            <li> I ordered this shea butter to use as an ingredient in some home made whipped body butter. I was really excited because it looked like a good product and it was inexpensive. I was pretty disappointed with it though. The smell is so strong!! And it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell, in my opinion. I had to use a LOT of essential oil to compete with the smell of this shea butter and it&#x27;s STILL pretty strong. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again. I guess I&#x27;ll have to go back to the other shea I have used in the past. It&#x27;s more expensive but it doesn&#x27;t stink like this stuff does.</li>
            <li> Mine came in the tub shown in the product page, almost overflowing! It didn&#x27;t leak at all even though it was left out for two days in 100 degree weather! I use the smallest amount at night and in the morning my skin is incredibly soft and moisturized. I put it on my elbows and after just a few days, they were no longer dry and cracked, and I don&#x27;t even need to apply it every night anymore to retain the softness. It has a slight musky scent, so if you want to use this to make lip balms, you&#x27;ll likely want to add some other scents unless the natural smell is what you&#x27;re going for. The butter seems to have a grainy texture at first, but as soon as it warms up on your skin it becomes smooth. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy if I use a small amount, and any more is just a waste! I have a feeling this stuff is going to last me years. When (If!) I run out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I get kind of \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; in the winter, and this Shea butter is very moisturizing! Soaks right in and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Like it but don&#x27;t care for the smell...kind of a smokey smell</li>
            <li> I always  have skin problems and stretch marks i will use it after i finish my period and massage it ...wish me luck</li>
            <li> This is a great and a potent cream so necessary for the face to restore all the natural oils and make it look luscious! I melt tiny amount of it in microwave and mix it with my nivea soft cream and apply on my face every night. Before application, I wash my face with cetaphil first. This is the best and the most hassle-free beauty regime I have come across in years!</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter, great price, great service.  I am happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying this product in the future.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is the smell...I slather it all over my face and body and go to sleep.  The next morning my skin is super soft.  It won&#x27;t break your skin out and does wonders for dry hair and cracked heels.  You can mix it with your favorite creams or use it alone.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as I expected it to.  I used it to make homemade lotion and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The package isn&#x27;t really sealed tight so it leaked out after it melted in transit. Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Good body moisturizer</li>
            <li> Great product, will reorder!</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the package does it say anything about weight or volume. The product I received weighed 7.25oz. Definitely light. Nowhere near 8 fluid ounces. Product was somewhat processed for the container. Smooth and not grainy. Iffy whether I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter and use it every day on my face and other parts!</li>
            <li> did not come with any information at all just a business card, packaging was less then desirable, it was taped like a 6 year old did it- the lid does not fit and the heat made it melt and leak every where, NOT HAPPY NOT AT ALL........OH AND THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT A STAR IS CAUSE I HAD TO.. :(</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel flawless.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it truly works wonders on my face. I cannot use a lot of products on my face as they usually make it much worse than what it was however this African Shea Butter truly helps to minimize the dark marks and eradicate pimples. My only complain is that I expected the butter to come in a tub as the picture displays however when I received it it was in a plastic back which I had to rip open and then proceed to find some other way of storing it. All in all it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Purchased based on ratings and quite disappointed in the funky smelling hard shoe polish in a plastic tub that I received. I have since acquired real shea butter (an acquaintance brought back from Nigeria) and . . . first of all, it&#x27;s supposed to be white, secondly the consistency should be like a chunk but very smooth and lotiony to the touch - you can rub some away or pinch off little bits, and is really awesome stuff. Not so this yellow shoe polish. Fail!</li>
            <li> I use it frequently... True remedy.</li>
            <li> Great Product. My skin was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this in a Magnesium Body Butter recipe found on wellnessmama website, to increase my families magnesium levels. Very moisturizing. Would highly recommend you looking into the benefits of magnesium... and this recipe! It is very beneficial and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I love this 100% pure and raw African Shea butter cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell.  It sort of smells like light scented cocoa butter. I scoop up a little bit of product and rub between my palms and it warms quickly to a smooth and creamy texture. I use the Shea butter on my body, as well as on my face before going to sleep.  When I wake up in the morning my face is so bright and smooth. This really smooths my skin all over and gives me a really pretty glow. I love it! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days and I must say I&#x27;m already joining the shea bandwagon! I love the feel of my skin after applying, its very smooth and hydrated. I suggest placing it in some warm water if you want to apply it more easily, and also mixing it with a carrier oil (almond, avocado, castor, jojoba) for hair and skin. Eager to experiment with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update soon!</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s skin. She has moderate/severe eczema and when we apply the raw shea butter at least twice a day, her skin is actually SOFT! Easy, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Shea butter! I mix this with a bit of coconut oil and it makes the perfect homemade lotion for super dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> i like this prodct 1st its smoothe and creamy ..the fact that it had no sand in it .. i was amazed .. and yes i will recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> My better half ordered this magic cream.  I am not one for lotions and poitions, but I have to say that this stuff is pretty dang amazing. My elbows, knees, and feet are pretty much sandpaper.  After one single application of said magic cream, they are already transforming from crusty, chalky, sharp implements of torture to leathery smooth &amp;#34;normal skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Use it. Love it.</li>
            <li> What an amazing price for this tub!! It&#x27;s very cold where I am now, and filling my sink w a little hot water and placing the tub in while I shower is enough to liquify the shea a little. I mixed in a little essential oil (lemon). Buyer beware, the smell is strong (almost like coco butter) and some may find this unpleasant if they&#x27;re not familiar w raw shea. I&#x27;ll be buying this again and again!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I must point out that this is REAL, RAW shea butter. It&#x27;s not going to smell like any bath and body works product...it&#x27;s unscented and in its natural state. The product comes in a deli type container...you know the you get if get potato salad for the deli container? I thought the product smelled a little like plastic, but that&#x27;s just me. There&#x27;s shea butter products out there that are mixed with other stuff, but for me I wanted to try raw Shea butter before purchasing shea butter that was mixed with whatever (ex. retinol cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a moisturizer that was inexpensive and actually kept my face...well...not dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one week and already feel and see a difference. Because Shea butter is so fatty/oil, my dry skin actually feels moisturized. I have yet to use it on the rest of my body, but think I will probably be amazed since it works so well on my face. If you plan on using Shea butter for a face moisturizer, I can see how people with oily skin may not enjoy this product...will probably just make your face more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is crumbly, but I expected that since it&#x27;s raw and pure. There was/is no need to warm it up, I can easily scoop a little in my hand and spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this African Shea Butter Cream( 100% Pure &amp; Raw, Gold)  for a long time.  Thank you for bringing these things to us,</li>
            <li> I love the effects of the shea butter, I would buy more. I think the smell could be better , but it works great as a moisterizer</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I originally purchased it for use on my hair to mix with other oils to apply to my hair but it has also worked great on my skin. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I am VERY new to using this product. I just started making my own lip balm and such. The product arrived quickly, has a great consistency and arrived quickly and in good form. Would buy purchase again! It was cold the day it arrived so it was quite hard when I opened it. I simply left it out on my kitchen counter for a bit with the lid off and it was super easy to scoop out to measure once at room temp.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works better than any lotion or cream I have used in the past. What I received was not yellow like the photo but an off white or beige color. The smell might be off putting for some people. It smells like wood smoke, like a campfire. I watched a video on YouTube of women making this in Africa and they cook it over an open wood fire, so that explains it. The smell is not very strong and to me it is worth dealing with to have a product that works so well. I can see a difference in less than 2 weeks  (softer skin, lessening of wrinkles). I did a little research and apparently in its unrefined state it has a lot of both vitamin E and vitamin D so that it supposedly has some anti-inflammatory properties. It&#x27;s not greasy and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle butter. It cures almost any dermo issues. I used it during pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark. It clears up eczema. It&#x27;s great for feet, knees and elbows. I&#x27;ve use it on my child for rashes, cuts and scrapes. A little bit of it goes a long long way. Take a dime size portion and heat it up between two hands, that will be enough for both hands, arms and chest.</li>
            <li> the Shea butter was melted when arrived due to not good package and our hot weather!&lt;br /&gt;i know the Shea butter texture is hard bu since mine melted and frozen again the texture changed&lt;br /&gt;AND the logo is different from the picture here  had it with a white sticker !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff does work very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Yes.....I put this on my face (and massage it for 5-8n minutes till it gets into my skin) and altho it still feels greasy a bit when I go to bed...when I wake up I have baby skin. I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed skin and overly sensitive, yet this stuff doeasnt make me break out.</li>
            <li> Now this is what I am talking about. I bought this product a couple of months ago and planned to use it someday. For the longest time, I have had dry skin problems around my eyebrows and nose and was on hydrocortisone for dermatitis.Two weeks ago my skin rash flared up again. Tired of using steroids, I decided to give this product a try. What a surprise. Within a week I could visibly see my skin return to normal. I am so so so happy with this product. I use it twice a day. It is absolutely amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff on Amazon isn&#x27;t even the right color. It&#x27;s yellow. Real shea butter should be off-white / beige. I&#x27;d recommend going to Coastal Scents and buying their shea butter, it&#x27;s a lot better. I guarantee it&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li> I have been using African Shea Butter Cream for years and I just love it.  It is a natural wonder cream.  I use it for dry skin, marks, and skin even tone.  I have purchased many jars for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff went bad or what. I threw it away because of the smell. Buy with caution.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She had run out of another brand she had been using.  This product was much better than the other, more expensive brand,  I will reorder this when she runs out again.</li>
            <li> I used this to make lip balm and other then the tint of the product it works AMAZING as a mosturizer added with other products mixed in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 2 years now. I make my own deep conditioner with avocado, shea butter, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar. This stuff never goes bad and you can use it as a lotion too. It makes your hair and skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this African shea .. it is the worst shea butter in the world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very very very very Bad smell</li>
            <li> I had no problem with this shea butter. I melted the butter with jojoba, coconut ,monoi and jbco for the hair.  I prefer shea on dry hair as opposed to wet.</li>
            <li> I tried the white shea butter. It made my hair hard and dull. This stuff is liquid gold. I melted it in the microwave, section my hair, ran this non greasy gold on my hair, and ready for bed. When I arose my hair was non greasy but shinning..I thought I was the s***...laughs. Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this brand and another brand and with the same results. Piu!  I bought it to use in my hair and so even after adding some essential oils....I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out.  Maybe I mixed it wrong?  I&#x27;ve had other shea ∫utter creams that had a decent smell but I could not get this to smell right.  No matter what I did to it... It smelled of rancid chemicals?  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have made a few purchases from Amazon. This shea butter is too lumpy. I know that shea butter is supposed to be a bit lumpy but this brand has given me a hard time. It&#x27;s hard to spread. Other than that, I have no other complaints.</li>
            <li> caused my skin to break.  extremely hard.  i went to a health store and bought a chipper one that is soft like butter.  this should not be sold.</li>
            <li> it help my skin stay soft and irritate less after shaving, it is easy to use, last a long time</li>
            <li> I mix the shea butter with my face cream in the palm of my hand so it slides on smooth.It make your skin look glowy and fresh. After a few applications you&#x27;ll notice that fine lines reduce (I&#x27;ve been a fan for about 6 years now). The texture is a bit grainy, but that is to be expected with shea butters in general.</li>
            <li> I love the natural feeling on this shea butter. It helps to make my skin feel smooth and soft. Recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate a product that needs more time for result.  I guess it&#x27;s working just find so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter for my family&#x27;s skin care needs with great success. I make it into a homemade body butter or just straight out of the container. The shea butter alone has a nice nutty earthy smell that can be blended well with essential oils. I use it instead if petroleum based products for my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema. It holds in the moisture well and adsorbs into her skin pretty quickly. It works well with cloth diapers as a light diaper rash cream. I&#x27;ll use a bit at the first signs of redness. It also fades scars after a few months and reduces the appearances of stretch marks. I think it works better on stretch marks than cocoa butter or bio oil. It does take a while but they fade faster with pure shea butter. My husband uses it for his hands instead of lotion and it works well for him. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I kick myself for not doing my research before buying this. Shea butter should not be yellow if it is pure. If it&#x27;s yellow that means palm oil had been added. It&#x27;s so yellow it stained my clothing. The smell is horrendous. I bought pure shea butter from another vendor on Amazon that was white, and the smell was not nearly as overpowering. Do your research first. There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li> Thank you! The shea butter is exactly as described. I would shop from this supplier again. A++ thanks again!  The shea butter has a little bit of a grainy texture when you scoop some in  your hand but once you start to rub it on, it becomes oily. Works great!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s Shea Butter, then I guess it&#x27;s okay. Unfortunately, I received my order with pieces of what I hope is Shea Butter scattered all over the box. I paid for this, so I should have gotten the product in tact. I tried to bypass some of the reviews about the seller, but perhaps I should have listened and not bought this item. I took a picture of how my order arrived - one of the tubs opened and was literally splattered all over the box. My guess is because it wasn&#x27;t packaged correctly and in shipping it got tossed around? I&#x27;d like to know why it wasn&#x27;t packaged better.. or at least put in a snug box so that it couldn&#x27;t move around. Or maybe I should have only bought one little tub and hoped that it arrived in one piece. There aren&#x27;t even labels on the containers as shown in the picture. What kind of quality and customer service is that? I&#x27;m very disappointed. It&#x27;s not worth returning...and I really hope its Shea Butter (It smells and feels like it)...so I&#x27;m gonna use it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again unless they contact me with an apology and a promise to do a better job with packaging and labeling......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, update....&lt;br /&gt;The seller received my feedback and maybe even saw this review and responded in a very respectable way. They emailed me and apologized for the box of scattered and disastrous Shea butter. They even offered to send me another 4 containers in much better packaging for free.... to which I quickly accepted! I just received them and haven&#x27;t opened the box, but I know there&#x27;s no room for it to spill. :) I really appreciate their response and and quick action to make things better. Now, I would definitely consider buying from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I use in combo with the black soap so it replenishes the oil the soap takes away. However, you have to wait about 5 to 10 minutes before putting clothes on or the oil will get everywhere</li>
            <li> product is great on skin.  After it sits it becomes hard but if you zap it in the microwave a few seconds it becomes pliable again.  Caution, its oily and can possible stain white clothing.  Best if used at night or sparingly during the day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about it .I ordered It to go in DIY product...seem fine to me.</li>
            <li> So-so...it came in a jar &amp; some parts of the shea butter is gritty/grainy.</li>
            <li> First time using this&lt;br /&gt;I find it delightful in my homemade lotions.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very rich, moisturizing, and healing.&lt;br /&gt;Received it promptly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but very hard to get out of the container. Unless I actually scoop it out with a spoon, I can barely get enough on my hand to use. It would be better as a bar so that you can rub it where needed.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago. I usually give products a month to see if it works/ doesn&#x27;t work. I got it for my hair and face. Since I mix it with other products I can&#x27;t say for certain how it works for my hair. And my face breaks out when I put it on, I&#x27;m trying to get rid of dark marks. I put some on and LITERALLY 3 minutes later I had huge acne marks on my face, It legit appeared almost as soon as I put it on my face. For a natural product it sure beats my skin up. The search continues for a product that gets rid of dark marks and acne. I&#x27;ll review in a few months to see if anything has changed.</li>
            <li> Whipped up w/some African Hair Oil and it came out very creamy!  Get a lot for the money!  Unfortunately it was confiscated at airport because I had in large container.  Will be re-ordering for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered the product based on the positive reviews.  Unfortunately the product arrived in a ripped packaging - with no labels on the container.  It looked like someone put \\&quot;something\\&quot; into a Tupperware container from their kitchen cabinet.  I will not even try this product nor order from this seller (NPS) again.</li>
            <li> Is this product safe? It has no content list, no country of origin, no manufacturer&#x27;s name and address. I have no idea what&#x27;s in it or if it comes from a safe and reputable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin creams can be highly dangerous and there have been several cases of serious contamination with mercury and other toxins  causing dreadful illnesses. Some problems occur immediately; some take months or longer to emerge. Was this cream made from vetted ingredients in a hygienic facility, or was it concocted in someone&#x27;s kitchen? I have no idea and the lack of product data rings alarm bells. I&#x27;m sending it back and taking no chances.</li>
            <li> This is a little sticky but it has helped with the dry skin and wrinkling of my face. Just started using this a few days ago and it feels better than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> l receive my one package l order 5 of 8 oz of Shea butter  and  l was shocked because it was like it melted  and  Leaked outside packaging  and it was full of bacteria ( black spot every where ) l didn&#x27;t expect the Shea butter that way because before l order l reed the comment and at was so good so l get Excited but now lam so angry and Disappointed.. l took a pics of the Shea butter but l don&#x27;t now how to shear it..i well find way</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using shea butter, and it is wonderful stuff. It is naturally yellow and waxy in texture. I use it to make homemade lip balm, and it is wonderful. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!! If applying this product directly to the skin, I recommend putting it on straight out of the shower WHILE your body is still wet. As your body dries it absorbs the shea butter and water leaving skin much softer for a longer period of time! I use this in my lotion recipes, in my hair, and on my three month old. I used this on his skin the few times we went out during really cold weather (rather than his usual coconut oil) because this is much thicker. I use this for his cradle cap after a shampoo and during diaper changes if he appears to be developing a rash. We are both two happy, glowing peas in a pod!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy. This Shea Butter arrived quickly and is amazing on my dry skin.  Customer service was outstanding also when I had questions regarding use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Use it after lotion to help keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li> All the nice lotions and creams have shea butter in them.  Decided to go right to the source. This container lasts more than a year. Don&#x27;t recommend applying to your face before bedtime as you are likely to stain pillow case.</li>
            <li> I have use Shea Butter before,so this review is not only about the product but also about the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I received my product well before the promised date. No complaints here. I love it. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it isn&#x27;t too greasy. I will most definitely be buying it again and from this seller</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of things for my extra sensitive face ..as much as i wanted this to work it didnt. Within a day or two my skin was irritated and itchy. It worked great on the rest of my body but i preferred to quit using it altogether</li>
            <li> Sorry but this stuff is just wayyy to greasy. It goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t absorb at all so it sticks to your clothes and feels really uncomfortable for the whole day. Not to mention it smells really bad. These things basically make it unusable for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter due to findings/research done on the internet. Shea butter has major healing properties. Also said it helps with stretch marks. After receiving my order (ordered 2) I use it on a surgical scar that I purchased it for &amp; it is healing very quickly &amp; does not appear to be leaving a scar at all. I started using it on my hands and face &amp; WOW it leaves your hands looking 10 years younger &amp; helps reduce smile lines. I have just ordered 2 more &amp; will continue to order from this same seller(please don&#x27;t stop selling this or discontinue lol). The shea butter is pale/off white and has a vague smell(can&#x27;t explain) but from my findings on the internet by color and smell this appears to be true/pure shea butter. I had to pay extra shipping on my first order(like the seller did not pay complete shipping)I contacted the seller through email &amp; they refunded my shipping completely. Great communication from seller &amp; great product. Kudos to you &amp; many years of success to you, you have made a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I know some people do not like the smell and yes it does smell like clay or a smoky nut but Hey it is suppose to smell like that this is not That Shea Butter that has added chemicals and perfumes that is the whole point buying RAW Shea Butter in it&#x27;s natural state. I added coconut oil to this after letting it sit in hot water and it smells like coconut now.  It is also good for swelling,scars, i also put some on my lips,feet,body and after 1 use everything feels so soft and smooth. Also since it is known to be use for joint pain I thought i&#x27;d try it on my arm due to it was hurting and the pain subsided.</li>
            <li> I have had this in butter bars and such but never pure shea.  I am quite pleased with the product.  It melts on contact. I will be interested to see what I can do with this. I am thinking of making my own butters, or adding peppermint or some other oils to this.  It&#x27;s gonna be fun!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have it arrived on time and I have used it and it does the work as it states.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly excited to get my pound of 100% pure and unprocessed African Shea butter. I was expecting something like a lump of butter in a bag like the pictures show but instead I got two nice containers of \\&quot;African Shea Butter 100% Natural\\&quot;. I know what your thinking \\&quot;oh this person is just an idiot\\&quot;, hear me out. This is no lump, it is in a 8 oz. plastic food grade container which is nice, BUT I have no idea if this product has been refined or not. My other problem is that when i put it on I have a greasy feeling on my skin all day and my face also looks greasy all day, and many people have told me that its not supposed to be that way which means it is refined. It does have a nutty/smoky smell that is actually quite pleasing to me. This is my first time buying shea butter so I have no idea how it should smell, look, or whether or not it should be greasy. I am going to buy Shea butter from a different seller on Amazon so I can get a bit more experience so I can update my review.</li>
            <li> I got this to make lotions. It feels nice but it definitely has a weird smell, even when covered with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great for hair-growth but hate the smell! I believe it contributed to my hair growing super fast but unless you figure out how to take off the smell, if you have a SO stay away lol...</li>
            <li> Love it. This is my second order and I&#x27;ve been pleased both times</li>
            <li> This arrived in 2 days and was exactly what I ordered. Would recommend to all my friends. Awesome product. My girl friend loves it!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is great.  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and is working nicely in my balms!</li>
            <li> Used this butter to the very last scrap! It worked beautifully for several beauty products I made as gifts. I loved it and will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter worked well on my skin. It&#x27;s pretty thick, oily, and the smell is a bit unpleasant. But if you&#x27;re not bothered by that then you will enjoy this. I wasn&#x27;t bothered by it and I usually apply oil-based type of lotion or an oil spray on. The reason why I rated it at a 3 is because I didn&#x27;t see a tremendous difference in my skin after applying it for a month.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell, returned, without hassle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and found it well worth the purchase.  Its great for the skin and hair and its 100% butter! And a little goes a long way, so I anticipate having it for a looong time.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the smell, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> This product workers exactly as promised. It is Very good value for the price. I would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> It is very viscous and you will likely need to microwave it every time you use it just to soften it. It smells just fine and does make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> First time ordering this product.  Was making homemade lotion bars.  They turned out fantastic@@  Gonna be great stocking stuffers!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> The african shea butter cream is the best body cream i&#x27;ve ever used!! It beats L&#x27;occitane, crabtree&amp;evelyn and all those fancy brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this one from now on hope they will keep offering it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used white shea butter from Whole Foods before, but I wanted to try out this stuff to see if &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; was any different. Like other shea butter, it starts out rock hard but can be rubbed into creamy, buttery goodness. It&#x27;s greasy and leaves a yellow tint before your skin absorbs it. Also, it has kind of a strange, herbal smell, but I don&#x27;t really mind that. The most important part is that it moisturizes my skin and soothes my eczema! Put it on at night if you don&#x27;t want to be greased up for the day.</li>
            <li> it was raw and hard but left at room tempt it softens up and you can use it on your skin hair and face. i love it and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I just received my shea butter order and I was expecting the same container and consistency pictured nonetheless I received to bottles of shae butter oil supposedly. I like getting what I order I am not satisfied with ordering something and receiving a completely different item. It doesn&#x27;t even smell nutty like shae butter. I don&#x27;t know what they sent me but I&#x27;m kinda pissed but I should have looked more closely at the reviews. I am going to look for another seller because this is horrible not getting what you paid for, very misleading....</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I used it to make a homemade Shea Butter n Coconut Oil mixture n my hair is shiny n soft. However, the texture is a little grainy, but once mixed with the coconut oil has a soft wiped texture. It also melts in your hands for easy application. I&#x27;m always being asked what do I use in my hair and told that my hair looks healthy!!! Definitely apart of my normal hair regimen and will be for awhile!!!</li>
            <li> It is so good , thank u</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, not used yet</li>
            <li> A friend recommended that I use this African shea butter and and I LOVE it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my legs and feet feeling really greasey.  A.M.</li>
            <li> Product was in my mailbox on time and after a few days, I noticed some discoloration are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> different from what was ordered------i ordered white shea butter lable was the same as when i bought it and it was white</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has very sensitive skin.  Rashy, rough patches, eczema.  We have tried sensitive creams like Eucerin and Burts Bees, but he gets hives and turns bright red from these creams.  An earthy friend of mine recommended this product and ordered it for me.  We take a chunk of the shea butter into our hands, rub, rub, rub until it turns creamy, and apply it all over my sons body after he gets out of the shower.  His skin is transformed!  No more rough patches or rashes.  It feels oily initially, but after 5 minutes, it just makes your hands and body feel soft and silky.  It is a little stinky, but I got over it because of how incredible his skin is.  I just wish it came in a bigger container!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for most of my body. I usually try to do a hair mask with the Shea butter. I heat it up to use the oil. My hair is abit frizzy, so this product actually helps your hair.  The product is easy to work with it. It&#x27;s smooth once you take a dap of it. The smell isn&#x27;t that appealing but it&#x27;s natural, so it&#x27;s something you have to  get used to. The product also has been doing wonders to my skin after a couple of weeks of using it. My face seems a lot more smoother and it seems like my blemishes are fading slowly from using this product. Overall, this product is 10/10 from what I&#x27;ve seen with my results of it.</li>
            <li> Ok So this stuff is the best ever! I was afraid to try it because it just didn&#x27;t look like something I would put on my face or hair when I seen it sitting on the counter at the store. Well I decided to try it and I do not regret it one bit. I love, love this Shea butter. If you are having a problem with stretch marks, please try this for it. I had a lot after my son was born in September. I started to see them fading away after a week of using this stuff. I use it on my face also. (Just a little) and everyone compliments me on my skin. I use it on my hair as well and it really helps with moisturizing my natural hair. I don&#x27;t melt it down because once you rub it in your hands it starts to smooth out on its own. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but it isn&#x27;t bad either. I ordered my second batch here on amazon and I will be ordering it from here from now on.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize shea butter was so greasy! I went to wash my hands after attempting to make lotion with this (major fail) and the water just beads up and slides right off my hands!</li>
            <li> Works miracles!!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS CREAM IS THE BEST:IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT TO THE TOUCH,IT GIVES YOUR SKIN THAT GLOW EVERY WOMEN LOVES,IT SMOOTHS AWAY STRETCH MARKS,IT SOOTHES ACHY MUSCLES/ARTHRITIS PAIN,IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR TREATING SPIDER VEINS.I THINK IT&#x27;S A NATURAL SKIN BRIGHTENER.IT KEEPS YOUR SKIN MOISTURIZED ALL DAY AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED MUCH.I LOVE THIS IN MY HAIR.YOU JUST CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT.OOH,AND I KNOW MOST PEOPLE MELT THE PRODUCT DOWN BY MICROWAVING IT FOR A FEW MINUTES,I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THAT TAKES AWAY FROM IT.BUT TRY THIS INSTED,I BOIL WATER IN A PLASTIC BOWL IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES AND I SIT THE CONTAINER IN THE BOWL OF HOT WATER MELT IT DOWN AND TRANSFER IT TO A LARGE SQUEEZE BOTTLE SO WHEN IT STIFFENS UP I WOULD REPET THE FIRST STEP (HOT  WATER IN BOWL AN SIT THE BOTTLE IN HOT WATER WHILE IN THE SHOWER AN IT&#x27;S MELTED AN READY TO BE USED.ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT&#x27;S A MULTIPURPOSE REMEDY IS NATURE&#x27;S PLUS TEA TREE OIL SOAP.WOMEN WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YEAST INFECTION OR SMELLY FEET OR DISCOLORED TOE NAILS.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand of shea butter (organic) from another company. I thought I would try this brand as a lower cost alternative. Unfortunately, this decision turned out to be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous brand I used (inesscents), is organic, and high quality (and quite expensive as well). It is soft at room temperature, very easy to apply, and leaves no stains since it is an off white color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, instead of being soft int he tub, this brand of shea butter is basically a solid brick in the tub. I loosened and softened up the butter, first of all by running some hot water on top of the tub (the container does not seal against water, so try to limit the time you run the container in or under water). It was still not soft, so I simply took a knife and broke off some chunks by breaking up the large tub of butter into smaller chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was able to break off some of these chunks, I was able to take a few bits and apply the butter. Unfortunately, I was in for a rude awakening the next morning, literally. The shea butter, which is a dark, yellow mustard color, had left nasty stains on my pj&#x27;s on the collar. After work today, I washed them, but the stains remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller has been frustrating to work with as well regarding the issues. I regret this purchase. I urge you to use caution before purchasing. Look for an off white shea butter, and ask the seller ahead of time if the butter is soft and malleable in the tub, or whether you have to apply construction worker tools to it to get it to break up before you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will dispose of this item as it is of no use to me.</li>
            <li> This a great product but I gave 4 stars because it was sent in a zipper bag instead of a container like the picture.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the real deal and with that you get some of its stinkiness.  You do need to melt and dilute it (it melts in your hand), this I recommend unless you can get over the unique scent.  Don&#x27;t use it full bore like I did.</li>
            <li> Review of this product is that is used by my wife, she is well pleased and therefore I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like it.It is butter...so if you decide to buy it be aware of it.It is not a cream. I am using it for the stretch marks of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to see if there was a difference between this shea butter and any other kind.  It is fantastic and will be the only shea butter I use.  It work well for skin and hair and is not overly greasy and gross but leaves a silky sheen.  A must have for natural product lovers.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for three months and feel this one is pretty good and very comfortable when apply on the face.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair, I am an African American woman with natural hair (not chemically straightened) and I use it to seal in moisture after I add all my other hair stuff in lol...I like it and it doesn&#x27;t add any sort of smell to it so I also like that as well. I may start using it on my skin too since it&#x27;s soooo cold lately lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. She said it works really good for her face. I might try as well.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 star rating because I have never used shea butter cream before so I don&#x27;t know what its supposed to smell like, feel like and look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I decided to order this.  When it arrived I opened it (without looking at the label).  I spooned out a small chunk (it was hard and could not just scoop out with my fingers as other reviewers were able to do) and rubbed my palms together..  It did not melt quickly as others have stated.  From what I read in the reviews I thought it would melt at very low temperature (as coconut oil does). So for a few days I was applying to my arms and hands 2-3 times daily and noticed the little bumps on the back of my arm were back.  So then I thought to myself, \\&quot;Self, this stuff is not moisturizing\\&quot;.  Even though my arms and hands felt waxy for a couple hours after applying I still used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later while cleaning my bathroom I finally looked at the lid of the container.  I was thinking to myself, \\&quot;Self, WTF is this s***!\\&quot; and stared in disbelief at a white rectangular label.  There is a bar code on top, letters and number under  the bar code and reads, \\&quot;African Shea Butter Cream...0% Pure Raw and Gold New\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff reminds me of bees wax.  Very well might be.  The label on my container looks nothing like the one pictured here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know if there is no shea butter in this container what have I been putting on my skin?  Smells feels and looks very similar  to bees wax in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Well, a friend of mine had purchased a tub of African Shea Butter (for three times the price, I might add) and she let me try it...great stuff, though hers was a little dry and crumbly.  This brand is very moist and creamy, melts right into your skin.  This is heavy duty moisture...the kind of stuff you should slather on your hands during a dry winter and sleep with mitts on, you&#x27;d wake up with baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> The smell it not that great but it is thick and cream. To mask the smell I just add some essential oils. I use it on my face and body daily. It make it feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t feel change in my skin&lt;br /&gt;it same any cream and when i used this cream  i has sensitive</li>
            <li> The smell only last about maybe if that 5 minutes and I am stretching it. It&#x27;s worth the purchase.  The product isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure others love it. That&#x27;s why I got it, the reviews were good. But its kind of bleh. Oily, yes, slightly smelly, yes, effective, yes. Just wish it absorbed faster. But it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I got this to go to a more natural moisturizer.  The product stinks to high heaven but is a great way to moisturize extra-dry areas like heels.  Don&#x27;t put too much on or you will be slipping and sliding in yo&#x27; sandals.</li>
            <li> I was very a big fan of Shea butter because of its raw hard state but ..I absolutely love his product and am a big fan of it not only for my skin but my hair as well</li>
            <li> This is great for your skin! It really is 100% Shea butter for this LOW price, i would recommend this to all women who are trying to keep their skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Really liking this as kind of a leave-in deep conditioner, such as when I know I won&#x27;t be doing anything for a few days I&#x27;ll put the mixture I made using this (with added oils and some glycerin) in my hair, and just let that sit until the next time I leave my house and I plainly just shampoo it out. Makes my hair all nice and luscious!</li>
            <li> Great product to have around the house! I use it for many of my DIY beauty products. The quality is excellent and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Have been using on skin including my sensitive and easily broken out face. Works great. My sons, who both have eczema rotate between this and their prescription steroidal cream. I feel it works better than pertroleum jelly at keeping their skin clear. Haven&#x27;t really been able to try it on my hair since I have been recently wearing braids but I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. We also use it on our lips.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected!! I love using natural products and this Shea butter didn&#x27;t did not disappoint me! Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> When I received my LATE, i was terribly disappointed because the plastic container it came is was bent out of shape, and I dont even believe that it&#x27;s holding 8 oz of shea butter as described! However, the shea butter was soft and I will be using this product again, just not ordering from the same person..</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SKIN PROTECTANT AND  REJUVENATER/ AM USING A SMALL BRUSH SIMILAR TO A TOOTHBRUSH TO WORK IT INTO HEELS,FEET &amp; KNEES. LONG LASTING, AND HAS HEALED MY PROBLEM OF DRY SKIN AREAS. AM PURCHASING FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS,FANTASTIC PRODUCT !</li>
            <li> I liked this Shea butter it&#x27;s easy to use not so hard and I almost use it for all skin problems</li>
            <li> I am in Love with Shea butter! I use it in my and my kids hair to lock in our usual moisture products. We all have eczema, so it&#x27;s great right after showers. I also use it on my feet at night. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got this because i have very sensitive, very pale skin that is prone to discoloration. The plastic container i got it in is broken and i&#x27;m going to assume i can attribute that to the dryness of this. It is a little greasy but not so much that it is unreasonable. The smell isn&#x27;t all that bad though different. Kind of like conola oil. I used it on my legs and it was a little harder to spread than i thought it would be, but after using some water to rub it in a bit more it felt nice and soft. And like other reviews a little definitely goes a long way with this product. I would suggest not to use this on your face though if you are prone to acne just because of how greasy it can feel.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter Cream is the best moisturizer I have ever used. The best part is no crazy ingredients, 100% pure! Immediately you feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this Shea butter, its rich, creamy and moisturises my skin nicely.I using only at night because I find it a bit to greasy for my skin.It keeps my skin soft and supple, crazy enough my skin feels firmer to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because of the great reviews that it could get rid of stretch marks and dark spots, but I havent had such luck. I will keep using it though because I am sooo smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of days now. Very nice consistency, unlike one I previously ordered from another seller. I use this on my skin, face, and hair. The only downfall (reason it didn&#x27;t receive 5 out of 5 stars) is that it came in a plastic bag, instead of the container like shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I bought two for the first time,  and now am buying 3 more , this thing is sooo goood AHHMAAZING!! I mix it with Wheat germ oil so it&#x27;ll be easy to apply on the skin</li>
            <li> First time to order shea butter. I like the texture. Works well in my homemade deodorant and keeps my armpit soft. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Works well for my families skin and hair care needs.  It&#x27;s gritty until melted, but from what I have heard all Shea butters are.  I also don&#x27;t enjoy the smell but I&#x27;m sure you could add a few drops of essential oils to it.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff at night every day during my pregnancy and although I gained more weight than I would have liked (55lbs) I didn&#x27;t have ONE stretch mark.  I would rate it 5 stars, except that it is very tacky in nature and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting this one in the AM under your clothes as they will stick to it!  It also doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, not bad, just not anything special.  Love that it&#x27;s completely pure and keeps the skin moisturized.  Would definitely recommend for any pregnant mamas out there wanting to prevent stretch marks. Use every night!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought much shea butter in my life, but this one smelled like raw hide when I opened it. I would probably try this product again, since my friend has the exact same container and hers doesn&#x27;t smell like a dog treat, but I was really unhappy with the product I received.</li>
            <li> I just receive my product and it does what it say 5 dollars and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Really nice product and exactly as pictured and described.  Works great in my lip balms!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before, but I sure won&#x27;t be using this kind again.  The odor alone is not even remotely pleasant.  It was rock-hard in the plastic container and needed about a minute of microwaving on high before I could even sort of scoop it out.  I tried to make a body butter with it and the smell is just overpowering, even with essential oils added.</li>
            <li> It was alright not the best that I had !</li>
            <li> It arrived one day before the initial ETA. I got the right product, excellent quality, very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone to shop from this seller</li>
            <li> I very much love this shea butter but it does not come in the tub it comes in a bag. Other than that, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is very grainy. Not at all like cream. The grains sit on top of your skin so I am sure it is not hardened shea butter. I will not order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and have been using it for a few years now.  I&#x27;m away from home for the summer and just haven&#x27;t had time to go the nearest natural/african store and pick up some shea so I figured I&#x27;d just order from amazon.  This stuff is disgusting. Its super oily and has a gritty consistency.  The package says 100% shea butter, which is clearly a lie.  This is not the kind of shea that is smooth and supple and reduces between your palms into a warm softening oil.... it&#x27;s something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use in homemade lotion. My family has super dry skin and winters make it worse. This seems to help so far. I mixed it with a few other ingredients and the results are nice. Smells unpleasant though so remember to add a few drops of your fav essential oil.</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis Pilaris on my upper arms and backs of legs. This product has wiped out all traces on my legs and has minimized the bumpy skin on my arms. The keratosis is definitely still there, but it has substantially improved. I wasn&#x27;t even expecting this to happen, I just thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I have relatively dry skin otherwise and no other lotions were doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. It has an earthy scent to me, but once applied, I don&#x27;t smell it on my skin. Even in the hot, summer months I use this product and it soaks up into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my infant son for months.  He had eczema when he was born and the prescription creams just weren&#x27;t clearing it up.  So I began using this on his skin after each bath. The eczema is basically gone now and his skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is real shea butter as it is very possible that its just african butter. (Yes there is a difference.) Strong unpleasant smoke smell. Seriously doubt I will purchase again...</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my sons stretch marks, the meds he was put on for his headaches has made him gain weight to quickly and he now has stretch marks.  I have only been able to get it on him once, the smell is not very pleasant.  But I have used it on rashes it helps that.  My husbands hands get swollen after carring out 40lb tom turkeys from the turkey house and we used it on the back of his hands from his middle joint in his fingers all the way back to his wrist.  He said it made a big difference has me keep putting it on.  I have also noticed how soft the back of his hands are now.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter &amp; here&#x27;s what I thought of this particular \\&quot;brand\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is DISGUSTING, but it still works on my skin &amp; the smell goes away after a while. Maybe 20 minutes. Also it was yellow. Like extremely yellow. So I&#x27;m doubting this is 100% shea butter as it claims on the packaging. My African friends tell me shea butter is naturally white with maybe a bit of yellow. This was no where near white. I will not be purchasing this again. Instead I will just buy another batch from some place else. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really dont like living in oklahoma city i could find this in any store in saint louis mo. but not out here so i have to order everything online i am glad i order this i love it my sink was so soft im out now i need to order more.. i would mix it with shampoo and baby oil to make my own shaving cream or put it in my hair before bed. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Would give 0 stars if I could.  Too gritty and greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it for my hair and I used it to prevent stretch marks while I was pregnant. It is kind of stinky but it works!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, this is my first and I am an Amazon addicted shopper......but this stuff is amazing. I have extremely dry skin and have tried everything.  I use this for night cream on my face. I use it on my feet (which are no longer dry and cracked.)  It is somewhat solid.....take a chunk and warm it in your hands, then apply.  My skin looks ten years younger.....my doctor and my hair dresser wanted to know what I am using...it is that noticeable. Don&#x27;t buy other brands....they may have slicker packaging (this is very plain) but they stink and don&#x27;t absorb. Buy it. You will love it</li>
            <li> I used to buy small expensive jars of pure shea butter from Sprouts. This shea butter is exactly the same. The color is yellow and there is no distinct smell. I am thrilled with the price. Because the  value is so good, I am using it more liberally than before and even my husband started using it as an aftershave cream to soothe his skin.</li>
            <li> Works good for my hands, I have a situation in my hands, I tried differents creams but only this helps my skin</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s just very hard. It leaves my skin glowing</li>
            <li> I bought this Shea Butter to make my own lotion bars.  This was priced right and it has a pleasant smell and melted nicely.  The lotion bars turned out very well.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with the Shea Butter I received.  I especially like the fact that it is unrefined.  I use it on my hands.  First, I put on coconut oil, followed by magnesium oil, then Shea Butter to seal in these oils.  I feel any inconvenience is merited by avoiding all the additives that most companies place in their products that negatively impact your body.</li>
            <li> Love this nutty scented butter cream. My heels feel smooth, no longer dry and cracked! Gave as gifts too and also well received!</li>
            <li> This was a very creamy butter. Most shea butters are hard and I find that they have to be mixed with oils or heated a little to spread easily. Not this one. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is great for hair and skin. I mix it with my hot oil treatments. Leaves my hair shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that this is unrefined shea butter.  If you plan on using shea butter in lotions or soaps, unrefined shea will generally need to be gently melted and strained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I wanted to melt my shea in the original container.  I popped it in the microwave on low power, and once it started to melt, I noticed I also had melted shea butter leaking onto my microwave plate.  Something to keep in mind!  If I were to go back in time, I would remove the product from the original container, and perhaps use a double boiler to melt.</li>
            <li> A great product for natural hair and body care. Another staple in my hair and  body care used daily. Great for mixing with Mango and Cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for very dry skinned individuals such as myself, would be overkill for someone without dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I use it often and add my own essential oils to smaller containers and mix it with other oil like oilve, hazelnut and apricot kernel oil. Shea butter by itself has a strong scent and may no be appeasing to some. I however, do not mind. It works great on my hair also.</li>
            <li> Don not have a whole lot of experience with Shea Butters. I bought because of the Add-On item, it had a price I could afford.&lt;br /&gt;1st) It&#x27;s yellow which suprised me. I have bought this before and it was almost white.&lt;br /&gt;2nd) It has a bit of a petroleum smell, so I re-researched Shea Butters. It&#x27;s faint and goes away after you put it on (about 10 min.), then it has a nice nutty smell, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;3rd) It is creamy, but not soft coming out of the container. I have to scrape it out with my fingernail, or a lot of pressure, which was not true of what I had previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? I don&#x27;t think so. The petroleum smell turns me off. By the way, I found by researching that even if Shea Butter is extracted using chemicals, it can still be called &#x27;Natural&#x27;. The yellow color, well, this is the only product that I have seen it in yellow, the rest are more vanilla colored. I&#x27;m not an expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns: Even though this product is sold by several companies, I am curious to whom the manufacture are, their policies, and ethics; none of that is stated anywhere on the packaging or anywhere else. Because of this, I gave them two stars. The product itself should get three stars. I like what it does for my skin; I want soft skin just like other woman, but at what cost to my nervous system? And I also found out that &#x27;Organic&#x27; does not mean &#x27;No Chemical Extraction&#x27;. It can mean something as simple as &#x27;it came from a tree&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you like what works well, then by all means, purchase it. If you have other concerns, well, that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my pregnancy to avoid stretch marks. A little goes a long way and runs on well. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Flaky texture. I have used a different Shea butter that was smooth when applying.</li>
            <li> Purchased for skin care but the cream had and bad texture and a rancid smell. I threw it out. YUCK. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I made a body cream from this.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a weird smell to it but boy, does it work!&lt;br /&gt;The cream turned out awesome and healed my eczema quite a bit until I ran out of the cream and been too lazy to cook more of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome love it Very good service!THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter.  I use it for my hair and skin and it works wonders for both.  I especially love using this Shea butter to make homemade hair conditioner because it adds thickness to the mixture and moisture needed for the hair.  Even though the product arrives as a solid it is easy to break down as it softens right up to mix with hair oils and other products.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the sole intention to switch out buying store bought lotions with something more organic, more natural for my ultra sensitive skin. I&#x27;m acne prone and allergic to any sun exposure of more than 15 minutes and this product has provided the right amount of conditioning I needed, absorbs in a good amount of time. It&#x27;s a tiny process to apply (I heat a small amount for about 10 seconds or until it turns liquid) then add a little coconut oil and scented-argan oil. After just a week, I have a deep conditioned feel in my arms and legs. I&#x27;ve avoided acne-prone areas only because I already use jojoba oil for those areas and it works like a charm (why fix what&#x27;s not broken?).&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a natual alternative, this is probably your best bet.</li>
            <li> Excellent with medicinal properties!!!</li>
            <li> Although the packaging is rather casual (unlabeled, plastic tub), this African shea butter is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin. Best price too. I only write reviews for things that have astounded me. It does everything they say it does (research it online) and don&#x27;t bother with those expensive over-the-counter lotions anymore. It&#x27;s even good on the face, don&#x27;t be fooled- it&#x27;s very rich, creamy and thick but you can feel it absorbing into your skin. After a time, it is not greasy feeling but soft and natural. Take it from someone who has alligator scales...no more. My skin looks great and even. Very happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I received my African Shea Butter Cream very quickly and in great condition. The product was everything I expected and more. I researched pure &amp; raw Shea Butter prior to my purchase and found the yellow, nutty fragrant variety to have exceptional properties as compared to some other variations. I am a very happy customer and I will most certainly buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I combined this shea butter cream with essential oils to create a cream which I use on my face and hands. I find that for me it is superior to most store bought creams and keeps my skin hydrated in the winter.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great...my disappointment is in the picture versus what you get... Mine came in a baggie, no container, I personally would have preferred a container especially since that is what the picture shows, otherwise great product. This truly made a difference to me, for most it probably will not.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Low odor.  Whip it with coconut oil, essential oil and it makes a wonderful face and body cream.</li>
            <li> It is definitely strong enough to moisturize. With it being a long and bitterly cold winter, this product has gotten a lot of use in my family. My one disappointment is that it is very thick and difficult to spread. I haven&#x27;t ever used pure Shea Butter so this likely is normal, but makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is a fake version</li>
            <li> this is great for the body. when using it for the face use the tinest amount b/c it can make your face oily. as is it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair but if i were to whip it with a blender to make it lighter &amp; fluffy (maybe add some other oils) it would be awesome...but sadly I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> This product was priced great.  I have never purchased shea butter previously; I purchased this to make shea butter.  The product was clean and felt great but I thought that the smell of this shea butter was a bit strong.  It took much more to cover the scent than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer during cold weather and also protector from sun. Very economical way to keep your skin moisturized, healthy and young!</li>
            <li> I bought  African shea butter from Amazon  just last week .It  was my,first time. It was yellow @ the top and moldy @ the bottom.. Also cracked @the bottomwith a bad smell.. I shipped it back the next day on 5/10/2013. The African Shea Butter was sold by( Lorem Ipsum LLC) the seller. That&#x27;s why I rated this a one star!!!</li>
            <li> this is awesome. i touch my face,its a habit and i cant seem to stop it a lot so i get a lot of breakouts but since i am using this butter my breakouts have become much less. my skin has a natural glow. my husband had a giant dry skin spot on his leg but after applying this for 5 days it disappeared. its better than expensive brands i used.</li>
            <li> I see trying another shea butter was not the option, because I am coming back to repurschase this shea butter again.</li>
            <li> oooooo yes. BF used a bit on his tired worked hands, and they immediately felt smooth. relaxed. Maybe it&#x27;s the Shea butter, but its more than a nutrient for my hands/skin, its a mind soother as well. This wonderful product comes in a lil tub, and I nip away at it every day after my shower. Hands, elbows, thighs, knees, hands hands hands. Very thick, very crumbly, very easy to just mix into your palms, though. Prepare for a paste, I keep my hands very damp when using and the moisture blends into a heavenly balm. Enjoy the benefits of this Shea Butter, it is real. My skin tells me so.</li>
            <li> This is the best shea butter I have purchased in a long time. The texture is nice and it does not smell badly at all.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shea butter! And the size is huge compared to what&#x27;s offered in brick-and-mortars-- it&#x27;ll last me for months as you only need a tiny bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my rough heels,after washing my hands, mixed with coconut oil for a healing overall body moisturizer-- tons of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth, just be sure to emulsify-- rub vigorously in your hands-- and it&#x27;ll soften right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> did not expect it to come in a plastic bag.. otherwise i like it</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter Cream is alright with one exception, it was too hard I wish it was more creamy.</li>
            <li> This product was as described. This was the first time i was making my own batch of body butter. The consistency was little grainy, but that how raw shea butter feels. It mixed well with the Coco butter, and turned out great. I would definitely buy this again, for my next batch.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is raw shea butter. But it goes on smoothly. Slightly grainy texture. Im usung it to treat the eczema scars on my legs</li>
            <li> This is a pure, clean shea butter product which can be used for so many different things.  I love to make whipped shea body with my favorite fragrance and use after showering or bubble bath.  Soaks right into the skin and leaves no sticky feeling behind. It is great also to use for sun screen or after sun burns.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not packaging appropriately , and the shea butter sealing to the other product !!</li>
            <li> This if my first time sharing my opinion about a product and I felt consumers should know that this product smells terrible. This is my first experience with Shea butter and I purchased to make whipped body butter for Xmas gifts. As I melted the product it looked like used cooking oil and it still had that awful smell.</li>
            <li> Does the trick. My hair and skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I love using Shea Butter for my hair and skin. I am an African American with very thick hair and I love the results I get from using Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> When I received it it was very crumbly, I expected it to be smooth and creamy but it wasn&#x27;t. I melted it together and waited for it to solidify, Still don&#x27;t like the consistency. Definitely gonna shop around for this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on-line because I didn&#x27;t want to spend all day driving around to look for it. It worked great for what I used it for :) I would recommend this to anyone looking for 100% pure shea butter :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking I was going to get item in the photo. Instead I was sent a plastic bottle of greasy Shea oil. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Yes, it comes in a plastic bag.  No, it isn&#x27;t the most aesthetically pleasing packing but who cares!  Heat a small amount in the microwave for a few seconds, rub it on and you will never buy your moisturizers off the shelf in fancy packaging again.  This shea butter does an incredible job keeping my skin moisturized and glowing.  Forget the overpriced, chemically enhanced lotions.  This is all I need.</li>
            <li> It was a fast deliver, however I am slightly disappointed on lack of instructions on how to use it. will need to ask nail salon folks who use it on myself</li>
            <li> My husband found this product at a flea market in New Orleans. He swears it is the best thing for his very dry skin. I thought I would have to go back to NO to find. I was amazed when I stumbled acrossed it on Amazon. It is great. A must try!!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff!! a little goes a long way so the tub lasts a while. i was my hands several times a day and wear gloves for work so they are always dry. i put this on at night and my hands feel great in the morning! love it!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great Price and the product was excellent as I expected it to be. Very pleased will order more!</li>
            <li> This was not as smooth as other Shea&#x27;s I have purchased in the past, this one had a very gritty feeling to it when you first put on.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product a 5 on its conditioning properties -- very much makes one&#x27;s skin soft and smooth.  Unfortunately, it does have an odor -- subtle at first, but lingering and obnoxious. On that score, I would rate it a 1. I decided to reserve it for use on my feet, as far away from my nose as I could get, but I could still smell it and it was unacceptable. I tossed it after three applications.  I resumed using a product that contains shea butter that I absolutely love.  That one is a CVS brand of lotion called &amp;#34;daily ultra moisture lotion.&amp;#34;  It has absolutely no odor and is just lovely and smoothing on one&#x27;s skin.  I think it is the store brand copy of  Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing lotion, fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Everything about my Shea butter order from DADE PHARMA turned out to be perfect. So much so that I just placed another order with them for a larger quantity and will leave a separate review when that arrives. What I received was genuine Shea butter that appears to be both raw, pure and very fresh. There was absolutely no grittiness and you could actually see flecks of color variation as if it was pushed and mixed in a large bowl as opposed to being melted down to a uniform color or worse dyed yellow. Instead this was an ivory color flecked in places by a light yellowish green with the overall texture of playdough and that telltale sticky/tackiness when pinched between your fingers present. It also had a moderate scent unique to Shea, an almost smoky and nutty scent similar to rubbery oud. While it&#x27;s not my favorite I rather have it present as an indicator of the Shea butter being authentic. Mine came in a simple plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it&#x27;s raw state Shea does turn into a oil when warmed between your hands but I personally find it difficult to use it this way except on the lips.  Instead I whipped this into a fluffy body butter incorporating in coconut and argan oils with amazing moisturizing results. It was also relatively easy to mask the smoky scent with some lemon essential oil. This has made such a difference in how my skin feels. Really pleased I took a chance purchasing online from Dade.</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter because I wanted a new natural product for my facial regime. First all, I love the texture. It&#x27;s very creamy and a little goes a long way. It will become a little stiff if you keep it in a cool place but that&#x27;s what keep it fresh, To eliminate the greasy look, all you need to do is to rub it into your skin vigorously in a circular motion. This method will help your skin absorb the shea butter more effectively without leaving your skin greasy. If it becomes too hard, you can microwave it for about 15 seconds. Just don&#x27;t allow it to become too hot. Overall, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Another all natural product great for all kind of skin try and see how much your skin will love it!Buy on amazon!</li>
            <li> This product works well when it comes to making your skin soft.  However, it has an odd smell.  Good for overnight use, but I would not recommend it if I were going out on a date.  The smell is not romantic at all.  For soft skin, by it.</li>
            <li> This feels so nice on the skin melts right in! I used it in a coconut oil body butter mix! Only thing is it has a strong Shea smell so I wasn&#x27;t really able to add scent to it. But I like the natural smell of it with the coconut and almond oil so no problem!</li>
            <li> This is a good one, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Was amazed at the fact the moisturizing effect lasted for nearly 48 hours--will buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this along with coconut oil for an excellent shaving cream</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as pictured. Awesome moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is hard as a brick...no way to use it.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was excellent. Thick, but creamy. I could warm it up in my hands and it worked perfectly. Will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Worked excellent for homemade lip balm.</li>
            <li> it is very good for use...</li>
            <li> purchased this for use in my hair in the summertime. have natural curly hair so while im swimming, i let the shea butter melt in the sun and put in on my hair when I get out of the pool.</li>
            <li> I have a natural hair (Afro). It&#x27;s excellent for hair and scalp! I have a very dry scald. I have been looking for a good product for my hair for years. OMG! I had tried so many different hair lotions and oil nothing compares to Africa Shea Butter cream and  Organic Extra Virgin Coconut oil . In this short time, I could tell the difference. My scalp is less dry, my hair is easier to manager and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> when buying any product or thing online, you run the risk of getting a bad batch. I got a vary bad batch. It was grainy and lumpy, not smooth at all. I&#x27;ve been using shay butter in my hair for three years now, and it has never looked like what i got. Well ill be sticking to buying them at my local beauty supply store. This product was so bad, that i had to trow it out.. Never Ordering Shea butter online again.</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizing product. I use it in homemade body and face moisturizers and even use a little in my hair during the cold, dry season.</li>
            <li> First time working with Shea butter. Used it in a recipe for cold and flu chest rub, worked very nicely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products for my beauty routine and this is a great gateway. I love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered  this to make my own home made organic hand lotions and body butters. This was my first try. Honestly speaking I don&#x27;t like how this smells .I cannot use this product alone on my body unless I add some nice essential oils but its your choice if you can tolerate some strong smell then go for it . The next time I would order ivory shea to see the difference.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea. My skin laps it up and I&#x27;m left with this delicious heady natural scent - kinda smokey with some vanilla. My friend had some Eczema around his eyes and I had a mix of this Shea with Argan oil sitting around. He was dabbing it on occasionally and his rash was gone in three days! I also like to work it into my hair on occasions. Love love love.</li>
            <li> Very nice for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like the shea butter cream, it works right into the skin not oily also i like the smell great</li>
            <li> At first, the smell through me off. I almost returned it.  I was not used to that nutty aroma. It helps leave your skin moisturized. I would apply it at night if you do not like the smell of it.  I like it.</li>
            <li> There must be products coming from different places, but all advertised in one place. Mine says, \\&quot;Made in Ghana\\&quot; not Africa, and is hard as a rock, and smells like used fryer oil. It&#x27;s going back ASAP. I&#x27;ve used Shea before, and it smells light and pleasant. GROSS!</li>
            <li> I like the product and have ordered raw shea butter before. But what I thought was a great deal was not. The container was less than  half the size of the last one I ordered from another seller. The lid is exactly the same and the sticker, so from the product view I thought I would get the same amount as I did from another seller. I would not order this again because it was too expensive for the amount. My fault for not looking at the ounces!!!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is very creamy and smooth.  It has a beautiful golden color and feels wonderful on the skin.</li>
            <li> You can never have too much of this stuff around! Your hair and skin will love you forever and ever! Wrinkles, fine lines and scars repairing, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, Deeply moisturizing, Stimulating for the superficial microcirculation, Skin strengthening, Skin protecting, UV protecting, Skin regenerating,  Collagen production stimulating (makes the skin stronger, more supple and younger), Minor cuts and burns healing, Muscle ache healing, Physical endurance enhancer...etc etc etc.. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am already addicted to this cream. At first I was concerned Bc it was so chunky and grainy, but once I figured out to take a small chunk and work it through in my palms and it smooths out completely. Very nourishing!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> I love Shea Butter and I am sure that this product would have been wonderful if the canister was not cracked open when I received it. I cannot attest to the quality of this product because I did not use it for the reason stated above.</li>
            <li> Just what i expected. I make my own lotions, body scrub, etc and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> How about this, the one my husband bought me must have been a bad batch with too much dye in it and what a horrible smell. Not real butter.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and my skin just drinks it in. No bad smell and I just love the way it feels. A bit thick but thats what I like! Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is not unrefined, but it is good quality, and priced very competitively. I am very pleased with this purchase, and I would definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleased with it coming in a plastic bag instead of a container doubt I will purchase again it does stink also</li>
            <li> using for years love this</li>
            <li> Meh, didn&#x27;t like at all</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for natural hair. It seals in moisture in your hair!! Haven&#x27;t tried it fir anything else</li>
            <li> Love to smell it on my skin. My skin is very dry in winter. Can&#x27;t wait to  use it then. My skin has improved so much!</li>
            <li> As expected, good quality shea butter. I am familiar with this brand/type shea butter and it has been working wonders for both my hair and skin.I only wish I had ordered the whipped shea butter version which is just a lot easier to use. This product while not as hard as some block-type shea butter is still fairly hard and needs some manipulation in the hands to melt the product.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing the raw form. I used it after a shower and my skin stayed moisturized. Consider mixing it with olive oil and using a mixer to blend. Makes it easier to apply to large areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in making homemade cuticle cream. It works for what I needed it for. It didn&#x27;t arrive in a container though, it was bagged in plastic. It will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and dry skin. Absorbs easily and is not sticky. Will keep you hydrated all day. Favorable price. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Used once for face cream. Worked great</li>
            <li> Its great products for my hair and stretch marks but smells so bad lol</li>
            <li> It makes my hair hard and rough</li>
            <li> Great product, used it to make lip  balm</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I use it for my hair, and it keeps it so soft and well moisturized for days! It also smells pretty good. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s not spreadable so you do have to rub it in your hands first to create frictional heat. My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first brand of Shea butter I ever purchased. I bought it in the Caribbean at a little rasta shop, not on amazon, but it is the same brand. I used it when my boyfriend had stitches in his face and it helped it heal fast. I&#x27;ve used it on harsh sunburns and it makes them go away and turn into a tan at an incredible rate, virtually overnight. I use it as an eye cream, the fine lines have diminished. I use it as a hand cream every night which doubles as a cuticle cream, on my dry feet under socks, if I have patches of very dry skin, on a scab or healing blemish, as a soothing balm on shaving rashes, for chapped lips, to prevent stretch marks, on my acne prone face if it gets dry (and it amazingly does not make me break out). I&#x27;ve used it in my hair as a moisturizing mask (I didn&#x27;t use much, just worked it into the ends and left it on overnight) and I swear if there ever was a true miracle cream that could really multitask it would be Shea butter. If I could only buy one lotion or face cream it would be Shea butter for sure. I will never be without it ever again.&lt;br /&gt;For this brand in particular, I have not noticed any difference between the other brands of Shea butter I have purchased. It does have that lovely yellow hue which I&#x27;ve been told is an extra nut that has been added when producing Shea butter but I have never been to Africa to see them making it so I can&#x27;t validate this claim. Whatever they do to make it works.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.After this purchase, I bought from a different seller organic Shea and is nothing compared to this trash (Bulk Shea Butter from Vermont Soap). It is suppose to be smooth, not grainy. Save yourselves the money and get something else! Very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product but I bought it for my sister and she doesn&#x27;t seem to be too happy with it</li>
            <li> I never review items, but i was very pleasantly surprised by this Shea butter! I used it in homemade lotion and lip balm. It came just as packaged and was easy to handle. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Shea butter has to be one of the best things i&#x27;ve ever used on my skin. It does have a funny smell to it but once you rub it on your skin the smell completely disappears. This butter made my stretch marks completely disappear after using it for three weeks. If you even get a cut from shaving your legs it immediately heals faster than it normally would and the mark will fade as if nothing was there. I swear by this butter and will never use anything else a little goes a long way I&#x27;ve been using it for six months and I just finished my second 16 oz jar so it lasts a really long time and I always get stopped by people asking me what i use on my skin. Honestly I would go to my local african market to purchase this product because its just simply cheaper. I LOVE THIS STUFF! once you use this product you will never go back to using drug store lotions that claim to have real shea butter in them.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great for my face, and i bought it for all the great reviews i saw here&lt;br /&gt;but i dont think its real shea butter, so i stop using it on my face, but i notice that it leaves my feet very soft&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it for your face, it won&#x27;t do nothing&lt;br /&gt; :(</li>
            <li> i bought to use for my very very VERY dry skin an it didn&#x27;t really help, i don&#x27;t really like the smokey ashy kinda smell either. But i mixed it with cocoa butter, olive oil, castor oil, coconut oil an some other products an made a lotion that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my face in the winter months, it keeps my face and neck moisturized, but I use it on my 4 yr old son all year long to help heal all of his scraps and scars and I love this product. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This item comes just as pictured, in a nice little tub.  It is hard, maybe a little softer than a bar of soap, but melts easily in the palm when you rub your hands together.  I use it on my face, and very sparingly on the ends of my hair and I love it.  You need very little for great results.  It does have a slight nutty smell, which isn&#x27;t really unpleasant, but you can do so much with this product, including adding your own scents, that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  I mix it in with my regular body lotion to give it a little boost and that pretty much takes care of the smell.  I also put a little dab in my palm and mix it with my liquid foundation with very nice results.  This little tub will last you forever -- definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Does the job and makes your skin free great, but I prefer the Ivory Shea butter better. It&#x27;s mainly because this one has a stronger nutty smell than the ivory version of the product. I bought this product at the same time as the Molivera Organics product and I like it much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for any brand or kind of shea butter for repairing chapped and damaged skin. I just prefer Ivory over the mustard yellow stuff.</li>
            <li> A perfect skin remedy for cold weather.</li>
            <li> This is not Shea Butter. Is this a nut butter? Yes, but its not shea. It is not the ivory, creamy consistency. This yellow product is actually African butter and not Shea. Please do your research on this product before buying it, and I would like it if the company changed their information. This is a  harder waxier consistency than Shea, it takes longer to melt and become pliable and needs work to be melted and rub in otherwise it will ball up and just glob on top of the skin. Again, this is a nut butter, but its not shea and it requires more work but its not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I had already purchased from this vendor the ivory shea butfter, and loved it.  I wanted to try the  yellow variety.  No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t make it right.  Have added lots of sweat almond oil, but still it is hard and almost grainy.  The plastic tub it came in also was broken.  Maybe it is just not fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again.  .</li>
            <li> This  is the container Iwill use to put my Shea Butter that I purchased in a bag when my Shea Butter in this container is empty.  My house will never go without this Shea Butter. I use it for my whole body.  Getting up in age, keeps that dry skin under wraps.  My husband uses it for his back when it hurts.  It rubs on excellent.  I am gonna find me a small jar so I can carry it in my purse.  Never thought about that..........</li>
            <li> I use this for face and body and love it. Sometimes I mix with a lighter oil such as olive or safflower to make it smooth on better. Why use products with parabens and other chemicals when you can use all natural? You can mix essential oils in if you like fragrance.</li>
            <li> It came and it looked and smelled like  pure Shea Butter I use it on my hair and skin it is really nice.  It arrived on time and I would it buy again.</li>
            <li> I play African drumming and my instructor highly recommend me apply Shea butter after drumming, because my hands can easily get dried and cracked after drumming. I love this shea butter,it moisturize my hands really well</li>
            <li> This product took way too long to get here. Like two weeks longer than I was told it would. Every other item I&#x27;d ordered on the same day got here like a month before the ETA so this was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product overall is pretty good. My family is Ghanian so I have experience using Shea Butter and though this is definitely not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, it still served it&#x27;s purpose. I use it on my hair when I&#x27;m deep conditioning and it leaves it super soft. I throw a bit more in as I&#x27;m putting in the leave in so that it will act as a heat protectant when I blow dry my hair. It also leaves my skin super soft which is always good. Only thing is that it&#x27;s currently super freezing here on the East Coast so my hair freezes when I go outside since the Shea Butter hardens again in the cold but if anything that just keeps the 15 mph winds from ruining my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> its smoothie i just need to warm it up for 30 sec in microwave then its ready to use .. smell is good</li>
            <li> My boo uses this on their curly hair and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to moisturize after a shower, and I also put it on bug bites whenever I get them. Stops the itching and helps it heal faster!</li>
            <li> When i received my package it did not look like the picture at all, it was in a bottle and labeled Shea Oil. I am going to try to make my own lotion out of it, and I don&#x27;t want to got through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> i have been using this a month now and i see no result.&lt;br /&gt;It still smells smoky n feels horrible in my hair&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t reccommend it</li>
            <li> I will admit, this type of shea is harder to put on than lotion.  I found that it was easiest to put this on when mixing it with a liquid oil like almond or olive.  It does have a nutty smell so it&#x27;s good to mix it with a scented item as well.  Because I have light skin, I have to put this on at night or else I&#x27;ll look like I have jaundice.  You can&#x27;t keep this item in a moist and warm area for too long though, because it&#x27;ll start molding.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially those looking for a heavy moisturizer.  When mixed with oil, it makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make a shea butter mix for my hair. Worked well for that use and keeps my hair soft and moisturized. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it!, It is the real thing. Really good value. A little goes along way. Looks different from any commercial body butter I have ever brought , that&#x27;s because this has not been processed and diluted</li>
            <li> It arrived just as it is seen in the photo, everything is intact and I can&#x27;t wait to mix it up.</li>
            <li> My Mom liked it better than her blush brand lotion. She has psoriasis. Definitely helped it clear up!</li>
            <li> It is all right. Doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the same as others I have used.</li>
            <li> This product delivers! Very nice smell, I made my own hand salve with this and I love it. worth getting and using!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;•Clears up severely dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;•Reduces the Appearance of Acne Scars/Pits, Fine Wrinkles, Softens Skin, and Evens Skin Tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• The smell is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;• It&#x27;s a little hard to use .&lt;br /&gt; • Heavy &amp; greasy after application.&lt;br /&gt;• Don&#x27;t use this shea on your face,you will feels very heavy on the face.&lt;br /&gt;• if you get some one your clothes, even when washed creates a faded mark.&lt;br /&gt;• Has not dealt with my sensitive skin prone to heat rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product work for every body.</li>
            <li> I received my product in a plastic ziplock bag. It would not be a problem it I had known it was going to be in a bag opposed to a container. As, the product seems to be discolored because it is certainly not gold. I just received it today and at the moment cannot speak for the quality of use as of yet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It came super fast and I put it on almost everything! My daughter was suffering from dey skin to the point where it would peel and this stopped it in about three uses. It keeps my skin moisturized. It&#x27;s best to apply it right  when you get out the shower. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a very good product - though it is a challenge to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; out of the container. I use it in my body lotion making. It melts down and melds very well with the other products.</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne , Rosacea (redness around mouth area) and bad black pores .... I have been using this for TWO days and I already see the difference ... Paired with my African black soap .. I wash my face with the black soap followed but this Shea butter ... Heads up!!! It does have a smell but it goes away , it is hard but u get a butter knife and scoop a TINY bit in your hand .. A little goes a long way.. Once it&#x27;s in your hand its soft and creamy.. Do this twice a day!!! I forgot to mention I have dark old acne marks on my face as well that have disappeared in two days as well!!! But you can also find this at your local (hair store, beauty mart) and its much cheaper ... Don&#x27;t wait , clear skin is calling you...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not like it because I was not able to dress up right away after applying it and this butter cream leaves a yellow color on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;No more.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very good just what I wanted. I added some EVO , and coconut oil to it and it works great  on my body and hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this butter when my infant was going through infant acne. It was really really bad. I did not want to use any chemicals that could cause discoloration or anything not natural. I started applying it to her cheeks (it is very smooth once your hands heat it when rubbing together) about twice a day. In two to three weeks her face was very clear. While I may be able to attribute this to her just aging and moving out of that stage I used it on her bottom too. She was breastfed and you know breastfed babies have very fluid like bowel movements almost after every feeding. Well all of the wiping and changing irritated her bottom, it looked like diaper rash. Whenever I would see her bottom like this I would coat it with the shea butter and at the next diaper change...yes the next diaper change (Anywhere from 2-3 hours), the redness and broken skin were healed!! I was amazed. I continued to use it on every member of the home and even in our hair. I cut all of my hair off (it was relaxed) to almost a faded hair cut so that I could grow out my natural texture. I would use the shea butter to help lock in moisture on my hair and on my older daughter who has very long and thick chunky hair :-). It works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t realize that in its natural state it is a hard butter I would give it a 4 because you have to \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; it out, but once you rub it in your hands it turns into a cream. Therefore, since it is naturally hard and not modified, I give it 5 stars!!! I recommend it to everyone with skin problems!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention it lightened the dark marks on my preschooler from scraped knees and cuts, but that takes a few months (maybe 2) of use.</li>
