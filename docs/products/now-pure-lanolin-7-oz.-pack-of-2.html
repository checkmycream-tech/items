            <li>I love my lanolin.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of creams to cure it but nothing worked well and most options have chemical or unfavorable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>As many reviewers have mentioned the lanolin does have a bit of a gamey scent.  </li>
            <li>We were using lanolin nipple cream, but this is much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Goopy, pure lanolin!!!</li>
            <li>I  now mix it with one of the liquid emollient body  oils available on Amazon or elsewhere e.g. sweet almond oil, liquid lanolin, castor oil,  jojoba, argan, etc.</li>
            <li>This is used to clean, soften and condition leather to help make it water resistant.</li>
            <li>Overall: OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully for his little bottom!</li>
            <li>This softens this product  to a creamy enough consistency that  it becomes an effective skin softening product.</li>
            <li>That said it&#x27;s understandable that many people may not share this same sentiment, like my family members for instance.  </li>
            <li>Love this item have brought this item several times in the pass and now.</li>
            <li>The product is good for multiple skin related purposes and is something I have used for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>I have used several different brands of lanolin and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for pure lanolin that is least sticky, this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li>Amazing for winter skin, but I use it year round.</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to this fabulous deal.</li>
            <li>It heals up so fast.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t got to use this much so far,but it seems to be all that it was promised to be,fast delivery</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t touched this particular jar in 15 years,&amp;#34; he told me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend lanolin.</li>
            <li>Lanolin is still the best thing you can use for really dry, cracked skin, especially the thick skin on feet and knees.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a natural feature of pure lanolin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>does not soften it enough to be readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Keep it in a tight-fitting jar, in a cool, dry place.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not a far-fetched, or even new idea.</li>
            <li>It is a new staple product in our home.</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several family members who all agree that it works very well but won&#x27;t use it because of the scent.  </li>
            <li>a jar to my sister who works with patients and washes her hands frequently</li>
            <li>the creamy and soft texture of the product and how it glides on my skin.</li>
            <li>first product that has helped my extra dry, split skin on my hands and fingers&lt;</li>
            <li>first time I used it was the half jar my Dad gave me.</li>
            <li>I opened it to see dried a little on top, just a couple cracks on it.</li>
            <li>This particular product has very little of the natural aroma of lanolin, which is a plus.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve known lanolin as a healing salve. I&#x27;ve gotten dried-up knuckles and wrists from my work with hand-washing and heavy duty cleaners. Mixing lanolin with my lotion not only moisturized my hands, but healed the damage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some facts: Lanolin is an ingredient in saddle soap. This is used to clean, soften and condition leather to help make it water resistant. Without proper maintenance, leather will become brittle and crack. So if this stuff can keep a dead cow supple, imagine what if can do for your living hide! And it&#x27;s not a far-fetched, or even new idea. Cowboys used it for their hands to help against cracking and splitting from a hard day&#x27;s work.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t care what people might say, lanolin doesn&#x27;t expire! Keep it in a tight-fitting jar, in a cool, dry place. That stuff lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it was the half jar my Dad gave me. He had it stuck away because he used to use it on leather gun holsters. &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t touched this particular jar in 15 years,&amp;#34; he told me. I opened it to see dried a little on top, just a couple cracks on it. I touched it, and the heat from my fingers soften it into the gooeyness below. The jar was still perfectly good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these two jars of lanolin because it&#x27;d set me up for life. All I need is enough to coat my fingertip to mix with a spot of lotion, and that&#x27;s enough to moisturize my hands. The only reason I mix it is that it makes spreading easier. Lanolin is thick and sticky on it&#x27;s own. By itself I&#x27;ll work wondrously if one doesn&#x27;t mind taking the time to massage it into the skin with the heat from their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful stuff, this is! I can&#x27;t believe I ever lived without it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product for her skin. Highly recommend lanolin.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps my lips from cracking and bleeding during the Colorado winter.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It works well, but definitely has a barn yard smell. I think I will use it to make cold process soap instead of putting it directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Real nice, smooth texture and clearish color.  I bought one to prevent stretchmarks, and one for dry winter skin.  If you are looking for pure lanolin that is least sticky, this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love my lanolin. I have used several different brands of lanolin and this one is my favorite! Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin. I tried a lot of creams to cure it but nothing worked well and most options have chemical or unfavorable ingredients.  A friend suggested lanolin so I bought this. It worked beautifully for his little bottom! It also works well on his face that gets chapped from drooling while sleeping. It is a new staple product in our home.</li>
            <li> Goopy, pure lanolin!!! Heavy duty goodness!!! Perfect for lip treatment, cuticles, feet, etc. The ONLY thing to put on hands before the white cotton gloves go on... anything else will soak into the gloves. I tried other brands that disappointed--I keep coming back to this fabulous deal. The fragrance is a natural feature of pure lanolin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Overall: OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well for healing and protecting chapped and cracked hands and feet at any price. As many reviewers have mentioned the lanolin does have a bit of a gamey scent.  I have recommended it to several family members who all agree that it works very well but won&#x27;t use it because of the scent.  Since lanolin is extracted from sheep wool the closest thing I can describe the smell to is a damp sweater.  I am a veterinarian and like the scent as it reminds me of my time working in the outdoors on farms and ranches.  That said it&#x27;s understandable that many people may not share this same sentiment, like my family members for instance.  In short, it works very well, but does have a scent that may be disliked by some people.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go without this. Amazing for winter skin, but I use it year round.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and  effective product if you modify it.  It comes so almost hard in its jar that even rubbing it into the skin --where it is exposed to body warmth-- does not soften it enough to be readily absorbed. I  now mix it with one of the liquid emollient body  oils available on Amazon or elsewhere e.g. sweet almond oil, liquid lanolin, castor oil,  jojoba, argan, etc. This softens this product  to a creamy enough consistency that  it becomes an effective skin softening product.</li>
            <li> first product that has helped my extra dry, split skin on my hands and fingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suggested to by a volunteer fireman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gave a jar to my sister who works with patients and washes her hands frequently</li>
            <li> great product! We have ordered a couple times now. We use this for our sons extreme bottom rashes. He has very sensitive skin and every time he has a messy diaper he gets sore. Several messy diapers in one day results in a skin peeling rash.  The thick lanolin was the only thing that would work and the only thing that doesn&#x27;t sting when applied to the broken skin. It heals up so fast. We were using lanolin nipple cream, but this is much more affordable.</li>
            <li> The product was as advertised and appears to be very good quality. However, for me, it was too thick. Would have preferred a thinner cream that would rub into skin easier.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got to use this much so far,but it seems to be all that it was promised to be,fast delivery</li>
            <li> Lanolin is still the best thing you can use for really dry, cracked skin, especially the thick skin on feet and knees.  This particular product has very little of the natural aroma of lanolin, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Good product, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have that &#x27;sheep&#x27; smell. I put it on my face at night before bed, or on my hands whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> Love this item have brought this item several times in the pass and now.Just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the creamy and soft texture of the product and how it glides on my skin.</li>
            <li> excellent service,great product.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and in good condition. The product is good for multiple skin related purposes and is something I have used for over 30 years.</li>
