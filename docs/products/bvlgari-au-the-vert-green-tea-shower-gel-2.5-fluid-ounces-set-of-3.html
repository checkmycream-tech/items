            <li>After a week of using it, we really liked it.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell of this shower gel.</li>
            <li>I have used it, it does smell nice - gives you a spa-like smell.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, just as good as the perfume.</li>
            <li>so I would have it available for vacation, what better time to have an enhanced sense of feeling good.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a more memorable and stronger fragrance although it is pleasant and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Would buy from this seller again:)</li>
            <li>So upon our return to the States, we ordered more.</li>
            <li>Although most Macy&#x27;s in Houston did not carry item</li>
            <li>- glad it was not damaged or part stolen.  </li>
            <li>Okay - I did read about this shower gel in the Janet Evanovich books...</li>
            <li>I now use the shower gel and cologne and love both.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>But I really love the scent</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more to have on hand.</li>
            <li>When I use it before going to be, my BF is really pleased with the sent.</li>
            <li>Although I LOVE the omnia perfume, I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I have been dying to smell this after reading all the Stephanie Plum books and I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>i really liked to use this with the Lotion, i get  alot of compliments on how fresh it smells.</li>
            <li>A unique scent that women love.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh clean scent!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan</li>
            <li>My man still smells amazing after the whole day.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and the scents lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>Love the product, the price was ok and the delivery very prompt.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh fragrance....</li>
            <li>While it would be nice to have a full size product, the set of 3 2.5 oz shower gels is a better deal than a full size from a department store, which only sells I believe a 6 oz for more than what this set costs.</li>
            <li>THIS would be a fantastic gift to let someone know how special they are (</li>
            <li>Fragrance nice but very light, doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Just right!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I returned home I searched for the product on Amazon (my absolute favorite place to shop--obviously).</li>
            <li>Fresh light scent - lathers well.</li>
            <li>, you get the same ones at some of the hotel rooms in Vegas which is why i came looking for it considering these hotels must have spent some time researching as far as whats good for a good price!</li>
            <li>When it wear it, I get compliments from folks who say I smell fresh but that the fragrance does not overpower.</li>
            <li>I am scent sensitive (most things trigger my asthma)</li>
            <li>it lost the fresh scent when using it on the skin after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>Nice product but grossly overpriced.  </li>
            <li>A great product, and not easy to get.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel clean and it had no lingering scent.</li>
            <li>Great size for travel, guest rooms, and everyday!</li>
            <li>It is a great smelling body wash the only draw back</li>
            <li>This was a special purchase for me and something I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy (pricey).  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that the scent was so light</li>
            <li>Love this product, I wish it cam in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly as the perfume and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love the product but wish for bigger sizes.</li>
            <li>Ummm, it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s certainly not an OMG.</li>
            <li>Both are available on eBay for about half of the cost shown here and with free shipping!</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase again but as a more of a special occasion purchase rather than everyday use</li>
            <li>I felt the price was reasonable, given that it was Bulgari, and it lasted me a while.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>would have expected it to be better packaged</li>
            <li>Very manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the scent and the bottle</li>
            <li>The very same product I paid more than double for at a National department store.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it without the high cost.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This set of 3 little shower gels was included in a Christmas gift and the recipient seemed pleased.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but not overwhelming or overly feminine or masculine.</li>
            <li>Maybe on the right person - maybe one of those mysterious men.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is my new fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not sure how Stephanie Plum can smell it on Ranger throughout the day, but it is refreshing as you use it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product but expensive and small bottles.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to other Evanovich fans (Bvlgari is what Ranger uses) and their response was measured but positive.  </li>
            <li>Not much bitter than those you get in a hotel.  </li>
            <li>It is thick, rich and sinful with a lather that just doesn&#x27;t quit.  </li>
            <li>In true Bvlgari form it only takes a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I love the green tea extreme perfume of Bvlgari, so when I found this I was already half sold.</li>

            <li> It is not highly scented and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but just makes me crazy for him.</li>
            <li> These are small sample sizes, but a little goes far!</li>
            <li> [this has been my regular gel for over 5 years, I like to buy small bottles to take when I travel]</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little expensive for a fictional Ranger 2-bath experience.</li>
            <li> The small size of these bottles are convenient to drop in a suitcase or put in the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> arrived rather slowly, almost too late.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed overall with this product.</li>
            <li> The gel has a very odd fragerance and very expensive for the amount of product received.  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird, but its scent is divine to me.</li>
            <li> is how expensive the product is.</li>
            <li> , the product was bad.</li>
            <li> However I was disappointed in how it was packaged and send through mail --</li>
            <li> If you are buying this because of Janet Evanovich&#x27;s Ranger and Stephanie Plum evocative write ups you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed !</li>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading the Janet Evanovich books, I had to try Ranger&#x27;s body wash.  It does smell great and the scent does linger.</li>
            <li> A unique scent that women love. Bought these for my son and son-in-law for stocking stuffers.......BIG HIT!</li>
            <li> Love the product, the price was ok and the delivery very prompt.  Would buy from this seller again:)</li>
            <li> Very fresh fragrance....good lather</li>
            <li> This was in our Marriott Hotel in Paris. After a week of using it, we really liked it. So upon our return to the States, we ordered more. It is expensive (a ton more than Axe), but for the moment, I&#x27;ll continue using it. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Price was great compared to Macy&#x27;s, they wanted like $50 for a 7 oz  bottle. I wanted to try it without the high cost. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell of this shower gel. I bought it after reading about how Ranger always smelled like it in the Stephanie Plum series. It didn&#x27;t disappoint. I felt the price was reasonable, given that it was Bulgari, and it lasted me a while.</li>
            <li> arrived rather slowly, almost too late.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I bought this for my husband after reading the Janet Evanovich books.  I had to see if the scent was as good as Stephanie Plum and her friends say it is on Ranger.  It is!  It&#x27;s hard to describe.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too light.  Just right!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> After reading the Stephanie Plumb series, I had to research to see if item exsists.  Although most Macy&#x27;s in Houston did not carry item so I could smell before purchasing - I found online. I purchased this with the soap bars.  Great scent - could smell as I openned mail box.  However I was disappointed in how it was packaged and send through mail -- would have expected it to be better packaged - glad it was not damaged or part stolen.  I have used it, it does smell nice - gives you a spa-like smell.</li>
            <li> The small size of these bottles are convenient to drop in a suitcase or put in the guest bathroom.  I was surprised that the scent was so light but it&#x27;s fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> This is the best scented shower gel I have ever used.  It boosts my spirits just to smell it.  I purchased it in travel size bottles so I would have it available for vacation, what better time to have an enhanced sense of feeling good.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Novelty &amp; Gift becasue of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich.  One of the characters, Ranger, used this product!  I was happy with the transaction and would recommend seller.</li>
            <li> This shower gel is unisex and the fragrance will banish cobwebs from the night before and fills me with joy when I use it. I know, I know that sounds weird, but its scent is divine to me.</li>
            <li> Very manly fragrance.  It lasts all morning.  I bought this for my husband to try.  These are small sample sizes, but a little goes far!</li>
            <li> This scent was great! Will abso buy again! Gave these to my nephew who loved them. Good for men or women.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happpened. My shipment smelled like chlorine or bleach was in the shower gel. Waiting for a refund.Can;t fault the seller for this, the bottles were unopened. But I am waiting for a refund. [this has been my regular gel for over 5 years, I like to buy small bottles to take when I travel] Also, I had to pay for return shipping. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right, the product was bad.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, just as good as the perfume.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and what a great deal!!  The very same product I paid more than double for at a National department store.  Love it!!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Thought the scent would be stronger--would not rebuy--would not recommend--for the money, I can buy something off a shelf in the store</li>
            <li> Love this product, I wish it cam in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel!  I just wish that it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t produce the foaming lather I was hoping for. Didn&#x27;t really feel clean and it had no lingering scent. Disappointed !</li>
            <li> Okay - I did read about this shower gel in the Janet Evanovich books... Stephanie Plum borrowed it at Ranger&#x27;s house. I now use the shower gel and cologne and love both. When it wear it, I get compliments from folks who say I smell fresh but that the fragrance does not overpower.This set of 3 little shower gels was included in a Christmas gift and the recipient seemed pleased.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhhhhhhh, THE SCENT!  I love it!  There is nothing that I don&#x27;t love about this shower gel (except the price, of course!).  It is thick, rich and sinful with a lather that just doesn&#x27;t quit.  THIS would be a fantastic gift to let someone know how special they are (but, YES, I kept it for myself!).  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got turned onto this by reading the Janet Evanovich &#x27;Stephanie Plumb&#x27; series of books.  Fan of the books, and fan of &#x27;Rangers&#x27; Shower Gel&#x27;.  I am scent sensitive (most things trigger my asthma) and this is one that works beautifully for me.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells. My man still smells amazing after the whole day. Not too strong but just makes me crazy for him.</li>
            <li> My wife got me this because of the Stephanie Plum books. It is the shower gel used by the character Ranger. She (my wife and Stephanie) loves it so I do too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful fragrance. I had never read the novels that some reviewers mention and only learned of the fragrance recently while staying at a bed and breakfast inn that stocked only these shower gels and conditioners. As soon as I returned home I searched for the product on Amazon (my absolute favorite place to shop--obviously). While it would be nice to have a full size product, the set of 3 2.5 oz shower gels is a better deal than a full size from a department store, which only sells I believe a 6 oz for more than what this set costs. Anyway, this is my new fragrance. I absolutely love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan so I had to try this. In true Bvlgari form it only takes a small amount to get the job done. The scent is nice but it goes away quickly. If you are a Bvlgari fan, try the Avqa. It smells amazing and the scents lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and skin! Fragrance is wonderful and lasts all day! Great size for travel, guest rooms, and everyday!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to other Evanovich fans (Bvlgari is what Ranger uses) and their response was measured but positive.  I had hoped for a more memorable and stronger fragrance although it is pleasant and fresh.  I thought it was a little expensive for a fictional Ranger 2-bath experience.</li>
            <li> Itty bitty bottles.  Not much bitter than those you get in a hotel.  Wonderful product but expensive and small bottles.</li>
            <li> i really liked to use this with the Lotion, i get  alot of compliments on how fresh it smells. also i got a good price on it.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably nice fragrance and the gel does a good job as a body wash in the shower.  Not sure how Stephanie Plum can smell it on Ranger throughout the day, but it is refreshing as you use it...</li>
            <li> If you are buying this because of Janet Evanovich&#x27;s Ranger and Stephanie Plum evocative write ups you&#x27;ll be disappointed. It is not highly scented and long lasting. Do not pay a lot of money for this. If you want to try it use Amazon and get it at a deep discount.</li>
            <li> A great product, and not easy to get.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great shower gel, you get the same ones at some of the hotel rooms in Vegas which is why i came looking for it considering these hotels must have spent some time researching as far as whats good for a good price!</li>
            <li> OMG!  It smells as good as Stephanie Plum says. My husband likes it too. A definite buy for your man.</li>
            <li> This was a special purchase for me and something I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy (pricey).  But I really love the scent and I will be buying more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> it lost the fresh scent when using it on the skin after rinsing it off. would not recommend it from&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li> i read steph plum books and got this shower gel reading the novels  lol what a way to market products</li>
            <li> It is a great smelling body wash the only draw back is how expensive the product is. I will probably purchase again but as a more of a special occasion purchase rather than everyday use</li>
            <li> I love the green tea extreme perfume of Bvlgari, so when I found this I was already half sold. It smells exactly as the perfume and is not overpowering. When I use it before going to be, my BF is really pleased with the sent. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is anything BUT green-tea-ish! Although I LOVE the omnia perfume, I would not buy this product again. Gave it one star only for the name bulgari.</li>
            <li> The gel has a very odd fragerance and very expensive for the amount of product received.  I was disappointed overall with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been dying to smell this after reading all the Stephanie Plum books and I&#x27;m not disappointed! I really like the scent and the bottle is very elegant. I like the smaller sizes as I can take them with me when I travel. The scent is nice, but not overwhelming or overly feminine or masculine.</li>
            <li> Fragrance nice but very light, doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Fragrance does not linger.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. Lingers a bit, but if not enough, try the lotion which does linger and is not greasy. Both are available on eBay for about half of the cost shown here and with free shipping!</li>
            <li> Smells great but again the scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Nothing is wrong with this product; it&#x27;s just not my favorite scent. I bought this because Stephanie Plum in Janet Evanovich&#x27;s novels always talks about Ranger&#x27;s Bvlgari shower gel as if it were an aphrodisiac. Ummm, it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s certainly not an OMG. Maybe on the right person - maybe one of those mysterious men. Hmmmm.</li>
            <li> Nice product but grossly overpriced.  Bought it because of the Stephanie Plum novels.  Probably would not buy it again; too costly.</li>
            <li> I used this item as did my family.  I was very pleased with this product.i would buy and use it again.</li>
            <li> Love the product but wish for bigger sizes.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh clean scent!</li>
            <li> Fresh light scent - lathers well.</li>
