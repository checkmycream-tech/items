            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had more shine than what this product provides!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The smell is AMAZING, it&#x27;s a citrus scent.</li>
            <li>product is amazing...</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to know I can count on Amazon to provide the necessary products to keep the house happy and his bushy mane shiny and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Good price and delivered safely</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do much to be completely honest.  </li>
            <li>Spray/spritz works nicely</li>
            <li>Liked the scent and it gave my hair a nice glossy shine.</li>
            <li>For that reason I think this product would be best for people who wear their hair straight and who wash it every day.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does have a beautiful name that&#x27;s worthy of two stars.</li>
            <li>It works great for me, gives my hair a good shine, seems to fight frizz pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Also has a pleasant light smell, but anyone with scent allergies might want to test before using.</li>
            <li>I love this product, after a nice hair blowout, just spritz some on a brush and comb through ends.</li>
            <li>I eventually found another kind which I prefer better.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It really gave my hair a beautiful shine..</li>
            <li>The best part about this purchase was that it arrived quickly and that it was reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than anything ever recommended to me at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Better  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t apply it to your roots, it needs to go more towards your ends.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with the Garnier Fructis Shine Spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments after using this spray.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This is a must have :)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to work it all in your hair, just the top side and the ends.  </li>
            <li>Have always enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing I have found works better.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look shinny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>For the purpose and price this is great, makes your hair really shiny.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, not too oily and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on the ends of my hair where it is the driest and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 years, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too, like papaya.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I get stopped all the time with someone telling me &amp;#34;I love your hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product to me is just okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh smell and makes my hair look nice and shiny, but not over the top or fakey.</li>
            <li>The shine doesn&#x27;t last hours and hours but looks great for a while!</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 different shine sprays, and like this one the best.</li>
            <li>More so than the pricey salon brands.  </li>
            <li>but I was always searching for something better.  </li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>and I had to use too many sprays to see a noticeable difference anyway.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff .. makes hair shiny and more easy to manage.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells good.</li>
            <li>It does have a fairly strong citrus scent, but doubt most people find citrus offensive.  </li>
            <li>Good but still looking for a very glossing shine.  </li>
            <li>nice, fresh scent)&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was invested in other things that work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This shine glossing spray is pretty stinking amazing.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair..</li>
            <li>If you hold it about 8 inches from your hair and spray once in each area, you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I am not blaming the product, I have fine hair and these products always give me hope</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really think that this product made my hair look any shinier.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my straightener for shiny frizz free ends.  </li>
            <li>does what it says, apply lightly, I try to stick with the lower ends....</li>
            <li>When I am finished I spray another light mist of this product on my hair again.</li>
            <li>Although it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t add as much shine as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s important for healthy-looking hair.</li>
            <li>this glossing spray makes my hair shiny, soft and has a great fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I wont even use it due to the smell i prefer spending $1 more for pantene it protects from heat smells great and makes your hair shine</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell the difference in my hair when I use this, and it gives a very nice sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li>protects and adds sheen while using flat iron, and bottle is great size for travel too.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I have think hair and this provides a great shine after a flat iron session as well as a touch up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Works great for use before using a flat iron - leaves hair shiny and non-frizzy!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle, as a recommendation of a friend, and fell in love with it...</li>
            <li>B quality product but not horrible ;)</li>
            <li>The shine was okay, but if applied after using hot rollers (which I did), it makes the curls droop.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair very shiny without feeling oily, love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of alcohol and doesn&#x27; t leave any gloss or shine in your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to burn through 3 oz pretty quick.</li>
            <li>The product is great, just be careful on the packaging of the product, dude in the warehouse!</li>
            <li>I love the original product, as shown here, but they sent the NEW version...</li>
            <li>Gives super shine with no heaviness.</li>
            <li>I still like the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny or the Garnier Fructis Serum or the Organix Keratin Serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shine sprays/serums and this one always comes out on top.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m done, I spray this sometimes in my hands and other times directly on my hair and it smooths the fuzziness away and adds some great shine!  </li>
            <li>It really does work, and it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li>It adds great shine and softness without making my hair heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important not to put too much</li>
            <li>but it is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell as well.</li>
            <li>They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!!</li>
            <li>The solution is to spray it on your palms, I use two spritzs of it, rub your palms together and then just lightly smooth it over the top side of your hair with flat palms.  </li>
            <li>Provides just the right amount of shine.  </li>
            <li>I spray it all over my hair while it is still damp, right out the shower and comb it through.</li>
            <li>just spray it out in front of you and walk through it, or hold it away from your hair about 8 to 10 inches (shake bottle first) and spray one section at a time just lightly, and it really brings on the shine.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need this product as long as I use a good shampoo and conditioner separate.  </li>
            <li>This spray gloss is great, it really makes your hair shiny, and it doesnt weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive products (Matrix, Paul Mitchell...) and achieved great results, but why pay more when you can get the same great results for less.  </li>
            <li>it is natural, fairly easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the first time I used this I sprayed it directly on my hair</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to purchase, as Garnier is one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li>you will become a avid user.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products that left hair feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>I paid amost $40 for a similar product at Sephora and this one works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, daily, and love it.</li>
            <li>The first bottle came with the straw stuck in the lid and it was melted from the heat during shipment.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very shiny!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many frizz calming products but finally found this.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>I purposely went white with my hair and love the way this makes it look.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>#34;under control&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>(and you could add one drop of your favorite essential oil in the bottle if you want.  </li>
            <li>First of all there is alcohol in this product</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a small, portable, affordable shine spray by a well-known brand that&#x27;s easy to find at any grocery or drugstore.</li>
            <li>I work where I must wear my hair in a bun every single day, and this shine helps my hair look even more professional and clean.</li>
            <li>This product gives your hair a nice glossy luster without making it look weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to apply this to dry hair after a shower, which I can.</li>
            <li>and you can smell the alcohol it almost smells like straight alcohol when you spray with a little bit of a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I am scared to put too much</li>
            <li>But again thanks to Amazon..</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really adding &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li>or you spray too much of it on you</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found that it makes my hair that much shinier than without it.</li>
            <li>I really do like this.</li>
            <li>People constantly remark how smooth and shiny my hair is when I use.  </li>
            <li>Really helpful with feistiness and leaves your hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap  hair care product called White Rain.</li>
            <li>But really, I think it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>(I have long hair, gets oily easily)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;am glad that I got it and didn&#x27;t have to wait so long!!!!</li>
            <li>Unlike many other shine products, it has never made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Pretty but not unbelievable, doll hair-type shine.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>OKAY I USED TO USE OTHER GLOSSES</li>
            <li>There are many other produ t you can use that aren&#x27;t e pensive</li>
            <li>Although like most products of this type you&#x27;ll have to be careful not to overdue which leads to greasiness, I&#x27;ve found this spray to give more shine with less of a greasy feel than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>horribleness thought tha it might in part be because of the flat because I was using a new flat iron that I never used before, but then when I did my hair again not using this product my hair came out amazing likei just stepped out of a hair salon so the flat iron was fine</li>
            <li>THAT WHERE HIGHLY IRRITATING, MY SCALP WAS LIKE ON PAIN, AND MY HAIR WAS LOOKING LIKE A GREASE BALL, LUCKILY I CAME ACROSS ANOTHER GARNIER AMAZING PRODUCT</li>
            <li>This product works better and costs less than other more pricey ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>leaves a gross matte texture and makes my hair look super oily.</li>
            <li>Hoped for a little more shine.</li>
            <li>Love this product...if your hair needs a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; this is the one to buy-</li>
            <li>The packaging is a little different, but it is the same great product.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I love this glossing spray and have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>I am glad it works for everyone else,  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it limp.  </li>
            <li>just like normal sprays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used shine sprays before, and this is the least effective of those I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>I use as a finishing spray for my straight, coarse hair that tends to frizz with high humidity.  </li>
            <li>however, to be safe I apply beginning about mid way down.......</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>, IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINY, SOFT AND</li>
            <li>this makes my hair so soft and shiny without making it oily-</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soo soft</li>
            <li>I guess if you have straight hair or especially greasy hair, it could grease you up.</li>
            <li>Gives hair the shine that looks good outdoors in natural lighting as well as indoors in artificial lighting.</li>
            <li>That is disgusting, but what&#x27;s not disgusting is how good it can make your hair look when used correctly.</li>
            <li>It smells like fruit, and lemon, and oranges and just citrus in general.</li>
            <li>but on the day I shampoo, it generally lacks shine.  </li>
            <li>It CAN make your hair look greasy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>But I sprayed it from as far away as I could hold the bottle and still aim it at my head, and just 2-3 sprays, not a boatload of product, and it kept my hair shiny and relatively under control (to the extent my hair can ever be called &amp;</li>
            <li>You get barely any reflectivity (is that not a word?)</li>
            <li>While I usually use TGI products, I found that this one offers more shine for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>(I have fairly thick, short, fine hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products by other companies that made my hair look much shinier than this did.  </li>
            <li>Since I have fine hair I only use a small amount and step into it or it will make my hair oily and flat.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair and spray it on my hands which I then use to calm down any fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful not to apply too much to the roots of you hair or it can make it seem flat and greasy.</li>
            <li>If I use it on hair that I&#x27;m not flat ironing</li>
            <li>Whenever my hair looks a little dull, I just spray this all over and it works magic.</li>

            <li> This stuff worked great.  </li>
            <li> I think Garnier is a Great Company, but all the promises didn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  </li>

            <li> AND IT SMELLS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Love their product, great quality and will buy again!!</li>
            <li> This just wasn&#x27;t a good product.</li>
            <li> good product line</li>
            <li> A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This product works really good without making your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> works really good for scrunching my hair and making it wavy.</li>
            <li> good price too...</li>
            <li> Just as good as Aquage.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay shipping!</li>
            <li> so I found this in the store and now I can have healthy shinny hair and use my gel!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had more shine than what this product provides!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING, it&#x27;s a citrus scent.</li>
            <li> product is amazing...</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to know I can count on Amazon to provide the necessary products to keep the house happy and his bushy mane shiny and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Good price and delivered safely</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do much to be completely honest.  </li>
            <li> Spray/spritz works nicely</li>
            <li> Liked the scent and it gave my hair a nice glossy shine.</li>
            <li> For that reason I think this product would be best for people who wear their hair straight and who wash it every day.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does have a beautiful name that&#x27;s worthy of two stars.</li>
            <li> It works great for me, gives my hair a good shine, seems to fight frizz pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Also has a pleasant light smell, but anyone with scent allergies might want to test before using.</li>
            <li> I love this product, after a nice hair blowout, just spritz some on a brush and comb through ends.</li>
            <li> I eventually found another kind which I prefer better.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It really gave my hair a beautiful shine..</li>
            <li> The best part about this purchase was that it arrived quickly and that it was reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than anything ever recommended to me at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Better  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply it to your roots, it needs to go more towards your ends.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the Garnier Fructis Shine Spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments after using this spray.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This is a must have :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to work it all in your hair, just the top side and the ends.  </li>
            <li> Have always enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I have found works better.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look shinny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li> For the purpose and price this is great, makes your hair really shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, not too oily and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on the ends of my hair where it is the driest and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too, like papaya.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I get stopped all the time with someone telling me &amp;#34;I love your hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product to me is just okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, fresh smell and makes my hair look nice and shiny, but not over the top or fakey.</li>
            <li> The shine doesn&#x27;t last hours and hours but looks great for a while!</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 different shine sprays, and like this one the best.</li>
            <li> More so than the pricey salon brands.  </li>
            <li> but I was always searching for something better.  </li>
            <li> its ok</li>
            <li> and I had to use too many sprays to see a noticeable difference anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff .. makes hair shiny and more easy to manage.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells good.</li>
            <li> It does have a fairly strong citrus scent, but doubt most people find citrus offensive.  </li>
            <li> Good but still looking for a very glossing shine.  </li>
            <li> nice, fresh scent)&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was invested in other things that work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This shine glossing spray is pretty stinking amazing.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair..</li>
            <li> If you hold it about 8 inches from your hair and spray once in each area, you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I am not blaming the product, I have fine hair and these products always give me hope</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really think that this product made my hair look any shinier.  </li>
            <li> I use this with my straightener for shiny frizz free ends.  </li>
            <li> does what it says, apply lightly, I try to stick with the lower ends....</li>
            <li> When I am finished I spray another light mist of this product on my hair again.</li>
            <li> Although it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t add as much shine as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s important for healthy-looking hair.</li>
            <li> this glossing spray makes my hair shiny, soft and has a great fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I wont even use it due to the smell i prefer spending $1 more for pantene it protects from heat smells great and makes your hair shine</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference in my hair when I use this, and it gives a very nice sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li> protects and adds sheen while using flat iron, and bottle is great size for travel too.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have think hair and this provides a great shine after a flat iron session as well as a touch up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Works great for use before using a flat iron - leaves hair shiny and non-frizzy!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle, as a recommendation of a friend, and fell in love with it...</li>
            <li> B quality product but not horrible ;)</li>
            <li> The shine was okay, but if applied after using hot rollers (which I did), it makes the curls droop.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair very shiny without feeling oily, love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full of alcohol and doesn&#x27; t leave any gloss or shine in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to burn through 3 oz pretty quick.</li>
            <li> The product is great, just be careful on the packaging of the product, dude in the warehouse!</li>
            <li> I love the original product, as shown here, but they sent the NEW version...</li>
            <li> Gives super shine with no heaviness.</li>
            <li> I still like the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny or the Garnier Fructis Serum or the Organix Keratin Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shine sprays/serums and this one always comes out on top.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m done, I spray this sometimes in my hands and other times directly on my hair and it smooths the fuzziness away and adds some great shine!  </li>
            <li> It really does work, and it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li> It adds great shine and softness without making my hair heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important not to put too much</li>
            <li> but it is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell as well.</li>
            <li> They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!!</li>
            <li> The solution is to spray it on your palms, I use two spritzs of it, rub your palms together and then just lightly smooth it over the top side of your hair with flat palms.  </li>
            <li> Provides just the right amount of shine.  </li>
            <li> I spray it all over my hair while it is still damp, right out the shower and comb it through.</li>
            <li> just spray it out in front of you and walk through it, or hold it away from your hair about 8 to 10 inches (shake bottle first) and spray one section at a time just lightly, and it really brings on the shine.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need this product as long as I use a good shampoo and conditioner separate.  </li>
            <li> This spray gloss is great, it really makes your hair shiny, and it doesnt weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive products (Matrix, Paul Mitchell...) and achieved great results, but why pay more when you can get the same great results for less.  </li>
            <li> it is natural, fairly easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the first time I used this I sprayed it directly on my hair</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to purchase, as Garnier is one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> you will become a avid user.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that left hair feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> I paid amost $40 for a similar product at Sephora and this one works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, daily, and love it.</li>
            <li> The first bottle came with the straw stuck in the lid and it was melted from the heat during shipment.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very shiny!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many frizz calming products but finally found this.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> I purposely went white with my hair and love the way this makes it look.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> #34;under control&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> (and you could add one drop of your favorite essential oil in the bottle if you want.  </li>
            <li> First of all there is alcohol in this product</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a small, portable, affordable shine spray by a well-known brand that&#x27;s easy to find at any grocery or drugstore.</li>
            <li> I work where I must wear my hair in a bun every single day, and this shine helps my hair look even more professional and clean.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair a nice glossy luster without making it look weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to apply this to dry hair after a shower, which I can.</li>
            <li> and you can smell the alcohol it almost smells like straight alcohol when you spray with a little bit of a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I am scared to put too much</li>
            <li> But again thanks to Amazon..</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really adding &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li> or you spray too much of it on you</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that it makes my hair that much shinier than without it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this.</li>
            <li> People constantly remark how smooth and shiny my hair is when I use.  </li>
            <li> Really helpful with feistiness and leaves your hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> It smells like a cheap  hair care product called White Rain.</li>
            <li> But really, I think it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> (I have long hair, gets oily easily)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;am glad that I got it and didn&#x27;t have to wait so long!!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike many other shine products, it has never made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not unbelievable, doll hair-type shine.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> OKAY I USED TO USE OTHER GLOSSES</li>
            <li> There are many other produ t you can use that aren&#x27;t e pensive</li>
            <li> Although like most products of this type you&#x27;ll have to be careful not to overdue which leads to greasiness, I&#x27;ve found this spray to give more shine with less of a greasy feel than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> horribleness thought tha it might in part be because of the flat because I was using a new flat iron that I never used before, but then when I did my hair again not using this product my hair came out amazing likei just stepped out of a hair salon so the flat iron was fine</li>
            <li> THAT WHERE HIGHLY IRRITATING, MY SCALP WAS LIKE ON PAIN, AND MY HAIR WAS LOOKING LIKE A GREASE BALL, LUCKILY I CAME ACROSS ANOTHER GARNIER AMAZING PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This product works better and costs less than other more pricey ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> leaves a gross matte texture and makes my hair look super oily.</li>
            <li> Hoped for a little more shine.</li>
            <li> Love this product...if your hair needs a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; this is the one to buy-</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little different, but it is the same great product.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I love this glossing spray and have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I am glad it works for everyone else,  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it limp.  </li>
            <li> just like normal sprays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shine sprays before, and this is the least effective of those I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I use as a finishing spray for my straight, coarse hair that tends to frizz with high humidity.  </li>
            <li> however, to be safe I apply beginning about mid way down.......</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> , IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINY, SOFT AND</li>
            <li> this makes my hair so soft and shiny without making it oily-</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soo soft</li>
            <li> I guess if you have straight hair or especially greasy hair, it could grease you up.</li>
            <li> Gives hair the shine that looks good outdoors in natural lighting as well as indoors in artificial lighting.</li>
            <li> That is disgusting, but what&#x27;s not disgusting is how good it can make your hair look when used correctly.</li>
            <li> It smells like fruit, and lemon, and oranges and just citrus in general.</li>
            <li> but on the day I shampoo, it generally lacks shine.  </li>
            <li> It CAN make your hair look greasy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> But I sprayed it from as far away as I could hold the bottle and still aim it at my head, and just 2-3 sprays, not a boatload of product, and it kept my hair shiny and relatively under control (to the extent my hair can ever be called &amp;</li>
            <li> You get barely any reflectivity (is that not a word?)</li>
            <li> While I usually use TGI products, I found that this one offers more shine for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly thick, short, fine hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products by other companies that made my hair look much shinier than this did.  </li>
            <li> Since I have fine hair I only use a small amount and step into it or it will make my hair oily and flat.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and spray it on my hands which I then use to calm down any fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to apply too much to the roots of you hair or it can make it seem flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> If I use it on hair that I&#x27;m not flat ironing</li>
            <li> Whenever my hair looks a little dull, I just spray this all over and it works magic.</li>
            <li> It really works to tame frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly blonde hair, and I only shampoo once a week,</li>
            <li> I spray this on just flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li> I put oil in my hair before flat ironing and even with this added after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair shiny and not bogged down</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will make dull hair shine or if you just want to add something to make your hair really \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> The only downfall about the product is the bottle is small so you will have to re-up frequently</li>
            <li> This is a product that I keep coming back to even when I try other products</li>
            <li> I used other products after and did not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> The only way I can get this thing to add shine that doesn&#x27;t look greasy is when I spray it ON MY FLAT IRON and take half inch sections and keep doing that.</li>
            <li> I use it after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and it definitely weighed it down,</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it comes in such a small quantity.</li>
            <li> Just not enough shine for me and based on previous reviews</li>
            <li> I got it the other day I can&#x27;t believe it took that long to get here</li>
            <li> After trying a number of times, I poured the rest down the toilet.</li>
            <li> and when I got home a few hours later my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two days!</li>
            <li> My hair has lost all luster, this product has brought back shine - all in a few sprays.</li>
            <li> I have seen no real benefits of a shine as it claims on the bottle..</li>
            <li> But you gotta be careful.</li>
            <li> It will make it look like your hair is mega wet</li>
            <li> I do like this spray as it does add shine to my hair, but you do have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Will never buy again and it made me never want to use any of garner fruits products again because if this is so horrible then maybe the other products aren&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li> This is the only product that will give anyone&#x27;s dull, drab, or dry hair</li>
            <li> It beats those other $30+ products that you could spend a fortune on.</li>
            <li> , it will make your hair look extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> Then I add other products like gel, and style my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have the money for the other product...</li>
            <li> I like the OGX spray dry oils but saw this retail so decided to switch things up a little.  </li>
            <li> In the morning I style my hair with gel and it always make my soft shinny hair look dull and dried out</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the box had wet stains and the bottle of glossing spray was half empty!  </li>
            <li> Small bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It calms down my hair frizz quite a bit ( after I use my hair straightener) and gives my hair a glossy shine.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down one bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;It WILL weigh hair down and give it a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Gives you the shine you need without the greasy mess.</li>
            <li> However, I have since been unable to pruchase it anywhere in the area that I live...</li>
            <li> I always have at least two bottles of this on hand, and during the dry summer months I sometimes carry one in my bag for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because it seems to get my a little damp and with my curls it will frizz if I get it too damp...</li>
            <li> well - sometimes a little too well.</li>
            <li> So you might want to pick up a few bottles.</li>
            <li> (I have salt/pepper hair - heavy on the salt.)</li>
            <li> This product does not leave an oily or heavy residue in my hair.  </li>
            <li> After a few sprays, I could not use the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now and it does give shine to hair that has been blow dried and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I used it to tame it a little bit</li>
            <li> (spray on directly or spray on my hands and work in), it makes my hair look dirty greasy and separates the hair in to lumps (like its been combed with a very wide tooth comb).  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> They quickly (not so easy though) replaced the order for me.</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m going out or something, I like to put something on to tame the frizz and up the shine a bit.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this gives you all the oil benefits without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> it just looked oily and slick.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought some from Amazon, and the formula I received was different, and had a foul, awful odor.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not completely sure of its heat-protective capabilities, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> Way to heavy and oily for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> When I sprayed this product on my hair, it looked dull.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and dry hair</li>
            <li> At least this one isn&#x27;t oily feeling like others I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> As we age, hair loses some of it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> When I wake up late and don&#x27;t have time for a shampoo</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use the product but was very disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> seriously....</li>
            <li> It looked pretty nasty.  </li>
            <li> My hair is over-processed, so I may be too tough of a customer!</li>
            <li> This is a product i would recommend to anyone who is just bored with their lackluster hair, or needs a boost with their shine.  </li>
            <li> This awful rating is actually for the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> so when I flat iron it, the ends look terrible.  </li>
            <li> the shine it so desperately needs.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it leaked all over my order and the straw was melted into two!</li>
            <li> materials, so be wary when ordering this spray through them!</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> it was just the product that made my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and we hate running out</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> If this spray is applied too closely, hair goes from pleasingly shiny to disgustingly greasy.</li>
            <li> This is awful product if you don&#x27;t want dryer hair</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product to carry around in your bag for touchups on the go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for years... It adds great shine and softness without making my hair heavy or oily.  Best hair product ever!!</li>
            <li> Has a great smell!  Provides just the right amount of shine.  Will definitely continue to purchase, as Garnier is one of my favorite brands.</li>
            <li> The only way I can get this thing to add shine that doesn&#x27;t look greasy is when I spray it ON MY FLAT IRON and take half inch sections and keep doing that. If I use it on hair that I&#x27;m not flat ironing it looks way too greasy!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago and I didn&#x27;t use it because I sprayed it on my hair and it made it greasy looking, I finally decided to try it again and sprayed it in my hands and worked it though my hair and let me say it is an amaze balls product and I do not do my hair without it.  Sometimes you read products and they are over hyped but this is totally under hyped once you use it and get used to applying it properly you will become a avid user.  The only downfall about the product is the bottle is small so you will have to re-up frequently but it is completely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target &amp; returned it.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay shipping! It&#x27;s ok.  I have fine hair.. I used it to tame it a little bit and when I got home a few hours later my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two days! It looked pretty nasty.  It didn&#x27;t look shiny it just looked oily and slick.  Maybe it&#x27;s for girls with curly hair..</li>
            <li> Good but still looking for a very glossing shine.  At least this one isn&#x27;t oily feeling like others I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> This is the only product that will give anyone&#x27;s dull, drab, or dry hair the shine it so desperately needs.  My hair has lost all luster, this product has brought back shine - all in a few sprays.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really think that this product made my hair look any shinier.  I&#x27;ve used products by other companies that made my hair look much shinier than this did.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> been using for years.  great product: lightweight mist spray. protects and adds sheen while using flat iron, and bottle is great size for travel too.</li>
            <li> This products great! In the morning I style my hair with gel and it always make my soft shinny hair look dull and dried out but I like using gel so I found this in the store and now I can have healthy shinny hair and use my gel!</li>
            <li> Gives super shine with no heaviness.</li>
            <li> This is the best inexpensive shine spray I have come across.  It&#x27;s even better than anything ever recommended to me at the salon.  It beats those other $30+ products that you could spend a fortune on. This product gives your hair a nice glossy luster without making it look weighed down or greasy. I found it one time at the grocery store and haven&#x27;t seen it since. Had to order it online.  Only downside is that it comes in such a small quantity. Wish it came in a larger size.  It&#x27;s easy to burn through 3 oz pretty quick. So you might want to pick up a few bottles.</li>
            <li> Works like nothing else we&#x27;ve found yet! My daughters and I have think hair and this provides a great shine after a flat iron session as well as a touch up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very good product just don&#x27;t over do it or you will look greasy.</li>
            <li> * I still like the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny or the Garnier Fructis Serum or the Organix Keratin Serum Better  * Try something else and I think you will be happier you did</li>
            <li> This glossed is great!  I have very thin and dry hair so when I flat iron it, the ends look terrible.  I do my routine with my hair and straighten it and when I&#x27;m done, I spray this sometimes in my hands and other times directly on my hair and it smooths the fuzziness away and adds some great shine!  Just don&#x27;t apply it to your roots, it needs to go more towards your ends.</li>
            <li> Great shine. As we age, hair loses some of it&#x27;s shine. I&#x27;ve tried many products that left hair feeling oily.  This product leaves hair shiny and not bogged down</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the Garnier Fructis Shine Spray. It&#x27;s one of my \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; hair products that I have been using for years and will continue to use. I&#x27;ve tried many different shine sprays/serums and this one always comes out on top. The smell is AMAZING, it&#x27;s a citrus scent. If you are looking for a product that will make dull hair shine or if you just want to add something to make your hair really \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, this is the product for you. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments after using this spray. Unlike many other shine products, it has never made my hair greasy. This is one of the best shine products out there, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product. Whenever my hair looks a little dull, I just spray this all over and it works magic. I get compliments on how shiny my hair gets! A word of advice: DON&#x27;T  overuse the shine spray! It CAN make your hair look greasy if you&#x27;re not careful. This is a must have :)</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the first time I used this I sprayed it directly on my hair and it definitely weighed it down, made it look/feel greasy.  The solution is to spray it on your palms, I use two spritzs of it, rub your palms together and then just lightly smooth it over the top side of your hair with flat palms.  You don&#x27;t need to work it all in your hair, just the top side and the ends.  It works great for me, gives my hair a good shine, seems to fight frizz pretty well.  I paid amost $40 for a similar product at Sephora and this one works better.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and we hate running out so it&#x27;s nice to know I can count on Amazon to provide the necessary products to keep the house happy and his bushy mane shiny and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Gives hair the shine that looks good outdoors in natural lighting as well as indoors in artificial lighting.</li>
            <li> Oh no! I hate the smell of this product. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with anything else by Garnier. This just wasn&#x27;t a good product.</li>
            <li> Good price and delivered safely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shine spray for several years and recently my local Target stopped carrying it so I found it on Amazon.  Works great for use before using a flat iron - leaves hair shiny and non-frizzy!</li>
            <li> Does what it says without damage. Doesn&#x27;t affect color.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very shiny without feeling oily, love it</li>
            <li> Have always enjoyed this product.  It does the job without leaving any stickiness on your hair.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this bu I have seen no real benefits of a shine as it claims on the bottle.. I will not be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
            <li> Just not enough shine for me and based on previous reviews I am scared to put too much and it end up looking greasy. Hoped for a little more shine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well on African American hair.</li>
            <li> I use this with my straightener for shiny frizz free ends.  Nothing I have found works better.  Inexpensive product for awesome results.</li>
            <li> Did not see any shine.</li>
            <li> Smells bad. I wont even use it due to the smell i prefer spending $1 more for pantene it protects from heat smells great and makes your hair shine</li>
            <li> I use it after I blow dry my hair. It makes my hair look shinny and healthy.  It has a fresh smell as well.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It took the shine out of your hair,&amp;#34; said my nephew when I asked him how my hair looked. Maybe we aren&#x27;t compatible. I can understand that. When I sprayed this product on my hair, it looked dull. It was even easier to comb. It just didn&#x27;t reflect any light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have a beautiful name that&#x27;s worthy of two stars.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing...It really gave my hair a beautiful shine..I purchased my first bottle, as a recommendation of a friend, and fell in love with it...However, I have since been unable to pruchase it anywhere in the area that I live...But again thanks to Amazon..</li>
            <li> Garnier&#x27;s Brilliantine Shine Glossing Spray is a winner. Everytime I use it I get compliments on my &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hair. (I have salt/pepper hair - heavy on the salt.)</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not love at first sight but I am still deciding.  This product does not leave an oily or heavy residue in my hair.  I just can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really adding &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.  The fact that I can&#x27;t tell might say it all but I am going to keep at it and see if it convinces me.  For the price you might as well give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray. It truly makes my hair shine. It seemed to be out of stock everywhere I looked. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because it seems to get my a little damp and with my curls it will frizz if I get it too damp...I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This spray gloss is great, it really makes your hair shiny, and it doesnt weigh it down or make it look greasy. EVERY time I use this product I get compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do much to be completely honest.  doesn&#x27;t make my hair all that shiny.  leaves a gross matte texture and makes my hair look super oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, daily, and love it. This is the first time I bought some from Amazon, and the formula I received was different, and had a foul, awful odor. After a few sprays, I could not use the product. Buy elsewhere!</li>
            <li> The spray seems to do the job of adding shine, and smells wonderful. Although I&#x27;m not completely sure of its heat-protective capabilities, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> For the purpose and price this is great, makes your hair really shiny. I just don&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li> This shine glossing spray is pretty stinking amazing. First of all, it smells good. It smells like the inside of a Jamba Juice. It smells like fruit, and lemon, and oranges and just citrus in general. It smells amazing. Secondly, it works. But you gotta be careful. If you spray this too close to your head or you spray too much of it on you, it will make your hair look extremely greasy. It will make it look like your hair is mega wet or like you haven&#x27;t washed it in a couple days. That is disgusting, but what&#x27;s not disgusting is how good it can make your hair look when used correctly. If you hold it about 8 inches from your hair and spray once in each area, you will be fine. I also always go ahead and comb or brush through it after that so it is evenly spread out and all of my hair looks shiny not just the parts I sprayed. This is a product i would recommend to anyone who is just bored with their lackluster hair, or needs a boost with their shine.  It really does work, and it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not unbelievable, doll hair-type shine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so I had to order it here. Small bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff .. makes hair shiny and more easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Great shine product. Goes on light, not too oily and you can&#x27;t beat the price! And it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I love this product, after a nice hair blowout, just spritz some on a brush and comb through ends. after using this product, i can run my fingers through my hair and it protects my hair from all kinds of weather conditions</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need this product as long as I use a good shampoo and conditioner separate.  I will probably give it to someone who use a product like this,</li>
            <li> For the price, it gets it done.</li>
            <li> does what it says, apply lightly, I try to stick with the lower ends....(I have long hair, gets oily easily)....this doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily.......however, to be safe I apply beginning about mid way down.......good product line</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  I have been using it for a few years now and it does give shine to hair that has been blow dried and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Makes hair shiny and you will receive compliments!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The first bottle came with the straw stuck in the lid and it was melted from the heat during shipment. Needless to say, it leaked all over my order and the straw was melted into two! They quickly (not so easy though) replaced the order for me. The product is great, just be careful on the packaging of the product, dude in the warehouse! LOL</li>
            <li> Gives you the shine you need without the greasy mess.</li>
            <li> B quality product but not horrible ;)</li>
            <li> I love this glossing spray and have used it for a few years now.  I have very long hair and spray it on my hands which I then use to calm down any fly-aways.  It makes my hair very shiny!  This awful rating is actually for the packaging.  When the package arrived, the box had wet stains and the bottle of glossing spray was half empty!  Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow returns of what they deem &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; materials, so be wary when ordering this spray through them!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! I thought I would be able to apply this to dry hair after a shower, which I can. I can also spritz some on my completed hair-do to give it extra pizazz. I work where I must wear my hair in a bun every single day, and this shine helps my hair look even more professional and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I spray it all over my hair while it is still damp, right out the shower and comb it through. It works well to help detangle your hair and make it easier to work with. Then I add other products like gel, and style my hair. When I am finished I spray another light mist of this product on my hair again. Just be careful not to apply too much to the roots of you hair or it can make it seem flat and greasy. I use it mostly on the ends of my hair where it is the driest and it works like a charm. It really works to tame frizz and flyaways. I always have at least two bottles of this on hand, and during the dry summer months I sometimes carry one in my bag for touch ups. This product works better and costs less than other more pricey ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important not to put too much (spary from a bit afar).&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s great to finsih off straighneting the hair</li>
            <li> So far I really like it. It was the same price here as at my local target.  Just don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li> They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!! Love their product, great quality and will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years, and absolutely love it. I have tried many frizz calming products but finally found this. It calms down my hair frizz quite a bit ( after I use my hair straightener) and gives my hair a glossy shine. I love the smell too, like papaya.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I have very fine hair.  No matter how I use this product (spray on directly or spray on my hands and work in), it makes my hair look dirty greasy and separates the hair in to lumps (like its been combed with a very wide tooth comb).  After trying a number of times, I poured the rest down the toilet.</li>
            <li> OKAY I USED TO USE OTHER GLOSSES THAT WHERE HIGHLY IRRITATING, MY SCALP WAS LIKE ON PAIN, AND MY HAIR WAS LOOKING LIKE A GREASE BALL, LUCKILY I CAME ACROSS ANOTHER GARNIER AMAZING PRODUCT, IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINY, SOFT AND IS SO LIHT IT LOOKS LIKE WATER... AT FIRST I WAS LIKE REALLY, THIS IS WATER?! BUT I WAS IMPRESSED BY WHAT A GOOD PRODUCT THIS IS AND IT SMELLS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> When I wake up late and don&#x27;t have time for a shampoo this glossing spray makes my hair shiny, soft and has a great fresh scent.  Since I have fine hair I only use a small amount and step into it or it will make my hair oily and flat.  Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I purposely went white with my hair and love the way this makes it look.  I get stopped all the time with someone telling me &amp;#34;I love your hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product to me is just okay. I haven&#x27;t found that it makes my hair that much shinier than without it. Plus it just smells like alcohol. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I really do like this. It has a nice, fresh smell and makes my hair look nice and shiny, but not over the top or fakey.</li>
            <li> came on time and just what i wanted</li>
            <li> This product does give your hair a shine after styling.  Spray/spritz works nicely and I like the finishing touch.  The shine doesn&#x27;t last hours and hours but looks great for a while!</li>
            <li> The best part about this purchase was that it arrived quickly and that it was reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray itself didn&#x27;t impress me. Although it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t add as much shine as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> this makes my hair so soft and shiny without making it oily- I only use it on my ends though so that it wont make my hair look greasy- I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product works really good without making your hair greasy. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;it works really good for scrunching my hair and making it wavy.</li>
            <li> I love this! I used it as a straightening spray instead of just a shine spray and it works wonders. It makes my hair soo soft&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Very tiny bottle. I could not see any noticeable difference in the shine either. Very tiny bottle. Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Love this product...if your hair needs a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; this is the one to buy- good price too...</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Creates a sparkling shine. It arrived well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> Seriously this gives you all the oil benefits without weighing your hair down. I spray this on just flat ironed hair. I put oil in my hair before flat ironing and even with this added after I&#x27;m done it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down one bit</li>
            <li> I love the original product, as shown here, but they sent the NEW version...the one I was trying to avoid!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they quit carrying this product at Target and  CVS at the time of purchase.  CVS now carries again.  The packaging is a little different, but it is the same great product.  I use as a finishing spray for my straight, coarse hair that tends to frizz with high humidity.  People constantly remark how smooth and shiny my hair is when I use.  I have used more expensive products (Matrix, Paul Mitchell...) and achieved great results, but why pay more when you can get the same great results for less.  Also has a pleasant light smell, but anyone with scent allergies might want to test before using.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is a product that I keep coming back to even when I try other products this one is one of the best ones and cheapest as well. Really helpful with feistiness and leaves your hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 different shine sprays, and like this one the best. Although like most products of this type you&#x27;ll have to be careful not to overdue which leads to greasiness, I&#x27;ve found this spray to give more shine with less of a greasy feel than the others I&#x27;ve tried. I can definitely tell the difference in my hair when I use this, and it gives a very nice sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great shine spray. While I usually use TGI products, I found that this one offers more shine for a lot less money. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I got it the other day I can&#x27;t believe it took that long to get here I don&#x27;t know what happen but I&#x27;am glad that I got it and didn&#x27;t have to wait so long!!!! But thank u again</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. No need to spend the big bucks for Fekkai products when you get the same result with this one.  If you have the money for the other product...well, buy this one and donate the difference of $20+ to charity!...lol...seriously....</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a small, portable, affordable shine spray by a well-known brand that&#x27;s easy to find at any grocery or drugstore. This fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly and seems to work well - sometimes a little too well. On three separate (non-consecutive!) days, I&#x27;ve ruined my hairstyle by accidentally spraying this too close to my hair. If this spray is applied too closely, hair goes from pleasingly shiny to disgustingly greasy. When this happened, I had to wash my hair and start over. I&#x27;m still feeling out what distance to spray at: close enough to work, but not so close that my hair looks greasy. Overall, though, I like this product and would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend a trial run when you&#x27;re at home before applying for a night out, day at work, etc.</li>
            <li> This spray has no glossing agent or fruit wax like it claims.  It smells like a cheap  hair care product called White Rain. It&#x27;s full of alcohol and doesn&#x27; t leave any gloss or shine in your hair. It feels like liquid hair spray. It makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Love it!!</li>
            <li> What a steal for the price!  I have long, curly blonde hair, and I only shampoo once a week, but on the day I shampoo, it generally lacks shine.  So if I&#x27;m going out or something, I like to put something on to tame the frizz and up the shine a bit.  This stuff worked great.  I guess if you have straight hair or especially greasy hair, it could grease you up. But I sprayed it from as far away as I could hold the bottle and still aim it at my head, and just 2-3 sprays, not a boatload of product, and it kept my hair shiny and relatively under control (to the extent my hair can ever be called &amp;#34;under control&amp;#34;) all night.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Way to heavy and oily for me! (I have fairly thick, short, fine hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but this particular item has an odd smell and doesnt seem to work as well as the ones I purchase in stores. .Maybe its an expired product? I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Liked the scent and it gave my hair a nice glossy shine. Just as good as Aquage.I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of Endust, the product you use for dusting furniture.  This is essentially a spray oil.  I didn&#x27;t like the oily feel on my hair after I used it.  The shine was okay, but if applied after using hot rollers (which I did), it makes the curls droop.  For that reason I think this product would be best for people who wear their hair straight and who wash it every day.</li>
            <li> I am glad it works for everyone else,  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it limp.  I am not blaming the product, I have fine hair and these products always give me hope then I realize they don&#x27;t work with my hair.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I think Garnier is a Great Company, but all the promises didn&#x27;t work on my hair. My hair is over-processed, so I may be too tough of a customer!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen this product in a while.  I like the OGX spray dry oils but saw this retail so decided to switch things up a little.  THIS spray provides A M A Z I N G shine.  Beautiful lustre!  It does have a fairly strong citrus scent, but doubt most people find citrus offensive.  And it dissipates some throughout the day.  (and you could add one drop of your favorite essential oil in the bottle if you want.  But really, I think it&#x27;s a nice, fresh scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It WILL weigh hair down and give it a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look if you spray liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just spray it out in front of you and walk through it, or hold it away from your hair about 8 to 10 inches (shake bottle first) and spray one section at a time just lightly, and it really brings on the shine.  More so than the pricey salon brands.  LOVE this!  I&#x27;ve never had more shine than what this product provides!</li>
            <li> This is awful product if you don&#x27;t want dryer hair I wouldn&#x27;t go with this I have never used a product that acted like this one. First of all there is alcohol in this product it&#x27;s suposed to be used as a heat protectant so when I used it, I t just fired my hair, one sprits in a section of my hair and you can hear it frying and you can smell the alcohol it almost smells like straight alcohol when you spray with a little bit of a nice smell. I only used it once and never again hair came out horribleness thought tha it might in part be because of the flat because I was using a new flat iron that I never used before, but then when I did my hair again not using this product my hair came out amazing likei just stepped out of a hair salon so the flat iron was fine it was just the product that made my hair look bad. I have curly mixed race hair that is shoulder length it is natural, fairly easy to manage. I used other products after and did not have the same problem. I was really excited to use the product but was very disappointed in its performance. Will never buy again and it made me never want to use any of garner fruits products again because if this is so horrible then maybe the other products aren&#x27;t so great so I was invested in other things that work wonderfully. There are many other produ t you can use that aren&#x27;t e pensive that won&#x27;t do this to your hair so beware.</li>
            <li> I do like this spray as it does add shine to my hair, but you do have to be careful.  If you spray too close your hair will look oily so I spray in the air and walk thru it. Or I extend my arm and spray from a distance.  I also like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I used this shine spray for a while but I was always searching for something better.  It works but not the greatest.  I eventually found another kind which I prefer better.  Its part of the Generic Brands line at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Adds shine, but not a greasy feel! I haven&#x27;t found another that works as well!</li>
            <li> just like normal sprays. its ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shine sprays before, and this is the least effective of those I&#x27;ve come across. You get barely any reflectivity (is that not a word?) from it, and I had to use too many sprays to see a noticeable difference anyway. That noticeable difference came at the cost of volume and bounce, as my hair was coated in product and lost that \\&quot;lightness\\&quot; and \\&quot;touchability\\&quot; that&#x27;s important for healthy-looking hair. It does smell nice.</li>
