            <li>Nice tingly feel!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>(Yes, it&#x27;s that good as to use capitals).</li>
            <li>The soap itself is good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It sounded so good, but in the end it&#x27;s just soap that smells like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>It is really good at making all fungal infections visible so you can treat them as for treating them it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just good stuff for my skin&#x27;s health.  </li>

            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>(The cap&#x27;s just gonna get clogged again fairly soon.</li>
            <li>Great love it.</li>
            <li>Five stars because the product does what its supposed to do but as a girl, I wish it smelled more attractive.</li>
            <li>that being said, if others have found it to be effective then that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Very good too, but more like a hand soap more than a shower soup</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and very strong scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a better soap than this!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but he says it makes his skin feel amazing and</li>
            <li>Plus, my bottle just smelled kind old/oxidized.</li>
            <li>I have found Defense Shower Gel to be effective.  </li>
            <li>lathers very well and smells the best.</li>
            <li>This is really the best soap.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t plan on re-ordering this product, I&#x27;ll just make my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product itself is an effective shower gel, but I cannot recommend it until they solve the cap-clogging issue.</li>
            <li>The best part is the ingredients are all natural!</li>
            <li>rinses off easily!</li>
            <li>good rich lather, does not get caked if you let if &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; on skin.  </li>
            <li>You have your own anti-fungal soap an one you can make more potent than this Defense one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and because I thought it was a great idea at first.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is also good for face washing and is refreshing, with a clean smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, and has a nice smell -- it&#x27;s not overbearing in this regard!  </li>
            <li>i use this in shower after rides all the time now, and have not had any more skin problems in the saddle contact areas.</li>
            <li>Defense soap is one of my favorite discoveries.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel better and cleaner after my work outs.</li>
            <li>It does seem to do what it claimed to do, but I wish it had a better smell.  </li>
            <li>Im glad it works for others, just didnt work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt, does not strip your skin, smells ok..</li>
            <li>They asked for me to order more bottles please.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I love the tea tree oil scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for the relief and for a antifungal wash for the whole body</li>
            <li>I just love this product .</li>
            <li>/&gt;After showering, there is a lingering fragrance of eucalyptus, which we kind of enjoy.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the better my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>All of the lovely skin issues you get with wrestling,ringworm,staph...</li>
            <li>If you remove it as soon as you applied it, it will be nothing better than soap.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It does smell like turpentine in the shower, but the smell does not linger (have asked friends to be sure), have had no problems with perspiration causing those &amp;#34;warm moist area&amp;#34; body issues.  </li>
            <li>Just reordered three more bottles.</li>
            <li>After reading tons of reviews I was sold on this product (Defense soap) especially with the impressive all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>this soap is everything is claims to be and more.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok</li>
            <li>I believe this product is more intended to prevent staph if you go to a gym where it is known to spread.</li>
            <li>A skin condition that my daughter has been plagued with most of her life is now under control.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t for sure say if it does what it claims to do</li>
            <li>sure.</li>
            <li>Mostly tea tree and moisturizers...</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve still ordered a two-bottle set just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out any time soon; I never want to shower without it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to fully eradicate it, but Defense soap and body wipes help me to keep it under control when it flares up.</li>
            <li>I will order more before this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been problematic, but since i&#x27;ve started to exercise more, its become a bit more</li>
            <li>The bar is probably more bang for your buck, but this serves it&#x27;s purpose as well.</li>
            <li>Love it, and I find the smell rather refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that my wife and others think it smells nice, the scent was kind of bothersome at first.  </li>
            <li>but when you smell it you know your going to get clean very clean!</li>
            <li>It does not have a good smell, but it is EXACTLY what they advertise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>he prefers the gel soap because it lathers more easily than the bar.</li>
            <li>leaves you feeling very clean very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is great for anyone with eczema or psoriasis - all natural - no perfumes.</li>
            <li>its best soap i ever had and has a nice smell to a little strong when your washing but after wards its not bad at all</li>
            <li>If you ever get one of these fungas growing on your body you will find that they dont go away easily.</li>
            <li>sometimes if there&#x27;s a ringworm breakout among the animals, it can easily get transmitted to humans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had a strong, medicinal fragrance.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, but not too offensive.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasent smell that is not too strong.</li>
            <li>Its not a replacement for anything medical grade, but it does do a good job of keeping away any kind of fungal (athlete&#x27;s foot/etc.)</li>
            <li>I love it and am ordering more right now.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I used this exclusively and in full amounts it would have a more noticeable impact, but at that rate it would have me going through almost a bottle per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, keeps me smelling fresh, great after a workout, and its not as drying to the skin as expected.</li>
            <li>but if i had the sniffles and took a shower with this stuff I would be fine inthe morning.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much! :)</li>
            <li>This works great on any fungus or germ related break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shower gel is great when used daily to get rid of fungus and used with the ther Defense products.</li>
            <li>SO yes this is great for finding infected areas but in my case it just made the infected areas larger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bizarrely prone to cystic skin infections</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does the same job (I think) as the bar.</li>
            <li>Old spice body wash smells good</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the directions and shower right after whatever sport you do.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased because I freaked out when I found something that looked like &#x27;ringworm&#x27; on my ankle</li>
            <li>love this product because it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>If you live in a warm and humid climate and jock itch fungus in your nether regions is a problem</li>
            <li>My Skin Feels So Clean</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Rinses off and leaves you squeaky clean, no oily residue, but you must moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li>I like this soap a lot i feel really clean when i use it</li>
            <li>wish they sold this in larger, more cost effective sizes.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get clean but not have the effects you were looking for.</li>
            <li>This stuff gets rid of any smell I may have going on as well as leaves my skin feeling clean without drying me out.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it does clean the hair somewhat.</li>
            <li>And the price is right!  </li>
            <li>skin (you have to spend even more to get their whole line)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps my skin feeling super clean after showers.  </li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t as nice and they removed the jojoba oil, a natural fungicide and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I still have another full bottle</li>
            <li>am pleasantly surprised at how effective it is&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that it does a good job with curbing jock itch if used daily.  </li>
            <li>honey in it makes her extra sweet!!!</li>
            <li>great for wrestling and other full contact sports.</li>
            <li>as a cyclist, you sometimes need more than regular soap or body washes made for non-athletes - especially in hot humid conditions.</li>
            <li>It lathers mildly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;- was very happy because I expected it to get the point of a complete recovery...</li>
            <li>Nothing is a quick fix.</li>
            <li>had a mild case of jock itch</li>
            <li>has a mild smell that smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It also makes him smell really good for a quite awhile, and I appreciate that the smell is more natural than his current cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They and others are gonna say, just twist off the cap and run it under very hot water until the clog is cleared.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d feel about using a soap bar that has come into contact in other places besides my own home shower!</li>
            <li>I use everyday when I shower , a great product</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li>areas fresh including under the breasts during the summer (and if you are over weight in between the folds of skin).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>and I feel the size is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and eye opening natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has no artificial ingredients, so no cutesy smell.</li>
            <li>I hit up Defense and they generously replaced my bottle and gave me a complimentary one.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much, I bought extra bottles and some for my father in law.</li>
            <li>but surprisingly my skin was super soft and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, and it has a nice, gentle tingle, thanks to the tea tree oil and eucalyptus!  </li>
            <li>Doctors don&#x27;t even seem to have any good advise other than OTC antibiotics, alcohol and bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Fungus will diminish right away.</li>
            <li>, this cleared it up right away.</li>
            <li>:  Not quite strong enough to clear up any existing fungal issues on its own in my case.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty much like tea tree oil, and not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I used this MOST RECENTLY from June 2011-October 2011 as my nightly shower soap.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It really works&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product to anyone who wrestles!!</li>
            <li>I grew to like the herbal smell after the first two uses.</li>
            <li>I love that this product uses essential oils</li>
            <li>Thanks Defense!  </li>
            <li>Plus my wife likes the smell better then the selson blue that I used to use.</li>
            <li>the formula has changed since i first bought this shower gel in may.  </li>
            <li>Since adding this to my daily shower routine I&#x27;ve not had any more problems.</li>
            <li>My HMO couldn&#x27;t help (or wasn&#x27;t interested in helping).</li>
            <li>The body wash smells like tree bark and its not clean-rinsing (leaves that sticky feel you get from many bar soaps), but it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to help.</li>
            <li>I was slkeptical at first, but after a month of using the Body Wash</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of tea tree oil, and it gives me peace of mind, after rolling on sweaty mats, or ill use it on my feet after running barefoot ect, good stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell same as last bottle, as good.  </li>
            <li>maybe I messed up but not sure its as good as people say</li>
            <li>It works fine, as far as I can tell, but I prefer the scent and exfoliating bits of The Original Potion from the Armbar Soap Company, which retails for the same price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you dry and gives you a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>You actually feel super clean when you rinse off, unlike most other soaps.  </li>
            <li>worked well for the feet, still have discoloration though in certain areas that this soap didn&#x27;t remove</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely with just a little bit.  </li>
            <li>very well&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li>I dont think that others would really notice the aroma from this soap.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really linger on your skin too much after a shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I bought the bar soap to take on trips (to avoid the whole liquid restriction hassle in the carry on bag).</li>
            <li>This Really Upset Me, No Where In The Add or Description On Amazon</li>
            <li>- I tried another brand, but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>This really does nothing to prevent or help it at all.  </li>
            <li>At all really.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn and tends to soothe however is just really for showing the infection.</li>
            <li>I had a whole body rash when I moved to Africa.</li>
            <li>Staph is very had to get rid of</li>
            <li>and it works really well on my problem itchy areas</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much in the way of being antifungal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It creates pimples on your skin that are really itchy</li>
            <li>do not see much improvement.</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks i followed with 3x daily treatments of De-colorized Iodine (you can fine any pharmacy) which has done more to heal this inflection in 10 days than any of the other products have.</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite, but I use it in conjunction with my other shower gel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been several months since my original review.</li>
            <li>I feel clean after a shower, whereas brand name soaps sometimes haven&#x27;t left me feeling that way.</li>
            <li>got this because of being active and not always able to take a shower immediately.  </li>
            <li>I wonder why this product is not more popular.  </li>
            <li>The soap goes a long ways, also good for other parts of body.</li>
            <li>I had to let it, more or less, gravitate.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based mainly on the reviews that I had read.  </li>
            <li>It seems as we get older</li>
            <li>Not sure if it helps or the staph got a little better on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It Says WARNING: Not For High Blood Pressure or Epilepsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly for that.</li>
            <li>In the item description on the website ad it does not make a statement about a (WARNING) label on the product, which states not for high blood pressure or epilepsy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is highly contagious&lt;br</li>
            <li>my son wrestles year around and had previously been getting ringworm frequently to the point of being a real hindrance to his being able to compete in tournaments and meets.</li>
            <li>Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many similar products with minimal success, not to mention I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of the ingredients in most of the other similar products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I  was surprised to see how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li>it leaves you smelling clean and refreshed and if you have dry and itchy skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>perspire a lot here since the humidity stays over 60% year round, and that leads to itching sometimes for most people here.  </li>
            <li>put it aside as I had pretty much eradicated the last episode</li>
            <li>I would love to carry my Defense Soap bar around, but I don&#x27;t want it to get messy.</li>
            <li>We also enjoy the fact that, in spite of numerous hand washings, the skin on our hands is not dry.</li>
            <li>A newly procurred allergy that even two dermatologists with their skin biopsies cannot even determine the cause</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one, but in the time it took to get here, I got ringworm.  </li>
            <li>Personally for the money invested, I would just rather purchase a bottle of Dr Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castille Peppermint soap and and in some Tea Tree and Eucalyptus Oils and Voila!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for me and based off the scent I would venture to say because the amount of essential oils it has in it appears to be very small.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>bottle would last long, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than a dab to create plenty of lather, so that first bottle&#x27;s lasted almost two months so far and should last another two or three months, even showering eleven or twelve times a week.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this product prevents irritation when I use it after exercising and sweating.  </li>
            <li>This product helped clear it up completely!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap since I started training (in about 1999 or so) and haven&#x27;t had any sort of ringworm or skin problem - I&#x27;m not sure if the Defense Soap is 100% to thank, but I&#x27;m sure it has helped.  </li>
            <li>I use the Defense first on select areas, then use my regular body wash.</li>
            <li>You actually feel clean when using this soap, not greasy from the chemicals in standard body washes.</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing so far that relieves symptoms at first temporary then as time goes by clears them all together.</li>
            <li>My son dropped my last bottle and most of it ran down the drain.  </li>
            <li>by chance I picked up a bottle of &#x27;Dr. Bonners Pure Castile Soap&#x27; at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I bought this shower gel because I wanted something that&#x27;s as close to natural as possible (i.e., without sodium lauryl sulfate and the other chemical stuff), and is not so strong that it irritates the skin.  </li>
            <li>Son&#x27;s say it helps keep them clear of acne.</li>
            <li>This product encourages the natural bacteria to stay.</li>
            <li>The liquid soap gives me peace of mind as I use natural ingredients to combat germs after the gym.  </li>
            <li>I like how it is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>i like the fact that it is natural instead of putting a bunch of chemicals on his body.</li>
            <li>only reason I took a star off is because it really really dries out his skin.</li>
            <li>Working so far.  </li>
            <li>Nearly ever scrape</li>
            <li>tried this on the back of  my scalp and it is very sticky and makes my hair feel like it has gunk in it.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, I either use it by itself a few times per week, or add some of it to my regular body wash, at about a 1:3 ratio (I try to use stuff that is free of potentially harmful chemicals, for what that&#x27;s worth).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old son who wrestles.</li>
            <li>this stuff work great a little bit and iam clean as can be if you feel dirty at all</li>
            <li>It suds up easily with very little soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived in really humid, tropical areas (Florida, Hawaii, and New Orleans) and really dry areas (Flagstaff, AZ).</li>
            <li>have used many other extremely cheaper liquid soaps where their caps did not get clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about changing your cap style so it doesn&#x27;t get clogged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is very condensed and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Sometimes these ship in plastic baggies, sometimes they don&#x27;t, not really a fault of the product, but something to be aware of when buying.</li>
            <li>It was far more harsh on my skin than bleach products that I use, and even harder on my skin than Hibicleanse.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an athlete nor do I have much high-risk activity that would typically put someone at high risk of skin infections.</li>
            <li>Mainly wrestlers and others that have bodily contact with dunge and such.</li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s obviously improved his athlete&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li>(Because it is harder to control how much comes out that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to stay clean wearing those.</li>
            <li>For that reason your not likely to get recurrant infections or such so frequently.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil is not safe for young boys and can cause breast tissue growth and hormonal issues, so please be aware of this.</li>
            <li>Skin did not dry out either.</li>
            <li>Dies not irritate ir dry my very sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li>The smell can be a little off putting at first, bit it does not stick with you.</li>
            <li>The only real complaint I have is that bottle top clogs up sometimes.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, after this last bottle, I may resort to trying something else or possibly buying the pure essential oil version of Defense (or some other essential oils) to add to my body wash.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest criticisms about both of these soaps is that a sport-specific soap is unnecessary and tea tree oil-based products will do just fine.</li>
            <li>The natural oils kill the bad bacteria and any fungus that could lead to athletes foot or ringworm without affecting your skin&#x27;s natural flora which is very important to maintain.</li>
            <li>It has a little weird smell, and lathers up really good.  </li>

            <li> (Yes, it&#x27;s that good as to use capitals).</li>
            <li> The soap itself is good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sounded so good, but in the end it&#x27;s just soap that smells like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> It is really good at making all fungal infections visible so you can treat them as for treating them it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just good stuff for my skin&#x27;s health.  </li>

            <li> Great love it.</li>
            <li> Five stars because the product does what its supposed to do but as a girl, I wish it smelled more attractive.</li>
            <li> that being said, if others have found it to be effective then that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Very good too, but more like a hand soap more than a shower soup</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and very strong scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better soap than this!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but he says it makes his skin feel amazing and</li>
            <li> Plus, my bottle just smelled kind old/oxidized.</li>
            <li> I have found Defense Shower Gel to be effective.  </li>
            <li> lathers very well and smells the best.</li>
            <li> This is really the best soap.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t plan on re-ordering this product, I&#x27;ll just make my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product itself is an effective shower gel, but I cannot recommend it until they solve the cap-clogging issue.</li>
            <li> The best part is the ingredients are all natural!</li>
            <li> rinses off easily!</li>
            <li> good rich lather, does not get caked if you let if &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; on skin.  </li>
            <li> You have your own anti-fungal soap an one you can make more potent than this Defense one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and because I thought it was a great idea at first.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is also good for face washing and is refreshing, with a clean smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, and has a nice smell -- it&#x27;s not overbearing in this regard!  </li>
            <li> i use this in shower after rides all the time now, and have not had any more skin problems in the saddle contact areas.</li>
            <li> Defense soap is one of my favorite discoveries.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel better and cleaner after my work outs.</li>
            <li> It does seem to do what it claimed to do, but I wish it had a better smell.  </li>
            <li> Im glad it works for others, just didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt, does not strip your skin, smells ok..</li>
            <li> They asked for me to order more bottles please.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I love the tea tree oil scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s refreshing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for the relief and for a antifungal wash for the whole body</li>
            <li> I just love this product .</li>
            <li> /&gt;After showering, there is a lingering fragrance of eucalyptus, which we kind of enjoy.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the better my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> All of the lovely skin issues you get with wrestling,ringworm,staph...</li>
            <li> If you remove it as soon as you applied it, it will be nothing better than soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It does smell like turpentine in the shower, but the smell does not linger (have asked friends to be sure), have had no problems with perspiration causing those &amp;#34;warm moist area&amp;#34; body issues.  </li>
            <li> Just reordered three more bottles.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews I was sold on this product (Defense soap) especially with the impressive all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> this soap is everything is claims to be and more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok</li>
            <li> I believe this product is more intended to prevent staph if you go to a gym where it is known to spread.</li>
            <li> A skin condition that my daughter has been plagued with most of her life is now under control.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t for sure say if it does what it claims to do</li>
            <li> sure.</li>
            <li> Mostly tea tree and moisturizers...</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still ordered a two-bottle set just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out any time soon; I never want to shower without it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to fully eradicate it, but Defense soap and body wipes help me to keep it under control when it flares up.</li>
            <li> I will order more before this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been problematic, but since i&#x27;ve started to exercise more, its become a bit more</li>
            <li> The bar is probably more bang for your buck, but this serves it&#x27;s purpose as well.</li>
            <li> Love it, and I find the smell rather refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my wife and others think it smells nice, the scent was kind of bothersome at first.  </li>
            <li> but when you smell it you know your going to get clean very clean!</li>
            <li> It does not have a good smell, but it is EXACTLY what they advertise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> he prefers the gel soap because it lathers more easily than the bar.</li>
            <li> leaves you feeling very clean very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is great for anyone with eczema or psoriasis - all natural - no perfumes.</li>
            <li> its best soap i ever had and has a nice smell to a little strong when your washing but after wards its not bad at all</li>
            <li> If you ever get one of these fungas growing on your body you will find that they dont go away easily.</li>
            <li> sometimes if there&#x27;s a ringworm breakout among the animals, it can easily get transmitted to humans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had a strong, medicinal fragrance.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, but not too offensive.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasent smell that is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Its not a replacement for anything medical grade, but it does do a good job of keeping away any kind of fungal (athlete&#x27;s foot/etc.)</li>
            <li> I love it and am ordering more right now.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I used this exclusively and in full amounts it would have a more noticeable impact, but at that rate it would have me going through almost a bottle per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, keeps me smelling fresh, great after a workout, and its not as drying to the skin as expected.</li>
            <li> but if i had the sniffles and took a shower with this stuff I would be fine inthe morning.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much! :)</li>
            <li> This works great on any fungus or germ related break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shower gel is great when used daily to get rid of fungus and used with the ther Defense products.</li>
            <li> SO yes this is great for finding infected areas but in my case it just made the infected areas larger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bizarrely prone to cystic skin infections</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does the same job (I think) as the bar.</li>
            <li> Old spice body wash smells good</li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the directions and shower right after whatever sport you do.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased because I freaked out when I found something that looked like &#x27;ringworm&#x27; on my ankle</li>
            <li> love this product because it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you live in a warm and humid climate and jock itch fungus in your nether regions is a problem</li>
            <li> My Skin Feels So Clean</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Rinses off and leaves you squeaky clean, no oily residue, but you must moisturize afterward.</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot i feel really clean when i use it</li>
            <li> wish they sold this in larger, more cost effective sizes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get clean but not have the effects you were looking for.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets rid of any smell I may have going on as well as leaves my skin feeling clean without drying me out.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it does clean the hair somewhat.</li>
            <li> And the price is right!  </li>
            <li> skin (you have to spend even more to get their whole line)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps my skin feeling super clean after showers.  </li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t as nice and they removed the jojoba oil, a natural fungicide and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I still have another full bottle</li>
            <li> am pleasantly surprised at how effective it is&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that it does a good job with curbing jock itch if used daily.  </li>
            <li> honey in it makes her extra sweet!!!</li>
            <li> great for wrestling and other full contact sports.</li>
            <li> as a cyclist, you sometimes need more than regular soap or body washes made for non-athletes - especially in hot humid conditions.</li>
            <li> It lathers mildly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> /&gt;- was very happy because I expected it to get the point of a complete recovery...</li>
            <li> Nothing is a quick fix.</li>
            <li> had a mild case of jock itch</li>
            <li> has a mild smell that smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It also makes him smell really good for a quite awhile, and I appreciate that the smell is more natural than his current cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They and others are gonna say, just twist off the cap and run it under very hot water until the clog is cleared.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d feel about using a soap bar that has come into contact in other places besides my own home shower!</li>
            <li> I use everyday when I shower , a great product</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li> areas fresh including under the breasts during the summer (and if you are over weight in between the folds of skin).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> and I feel the size is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and eye opening natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has no artificial ingredients, so no cutesy smell.</li>
            <li> I hit up Defense and they generously replaced my bottle and gave me a complimentary one.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much, I bought extra bottles and some for my father in law.</li>
            <li> but surprisingly my skin was super soft and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft, and it has a nice, gentle tingle, thanks to the tea tree oil and eucalyptus!  </li>
            <li> Doctors don&#x27;t even seem to have any good advise other than OTC antibiotics, alcohol and bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Fungus will diminish right away.</li>
            <li> , this cleared it up right away.</li>
            <li> :  Not quite strong enough to clear up any existing fungal issues on its own in my case.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty much like tea tree oil, and not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I used this MOST RECENTLY from June 2011-October 2011 as my nightly shower soap.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It really works&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product to anyone who wrestles!!</li>
            <li> I grew to like the herbal smell after the first two uses.</li>
            <li> I love that this product uses essential oils</li>
            <li> Thanks Defense!  </li>
            <li> Plus my wife likes the smell better then the selson blue that I used to use.</li>
            <li> the formula has changed since i first bought this shower gel in may.  </li>
            <li> Since adding this to my daily shower routine I&#x27;ve not had any more problems.</li>
            <li> My HMO couldn&#x27;t help (or wasn&#x27;t interested in helping).</li>
            <li> The body wash smells like tree bark and its not clean-rinsing (leaves that sticky feel you get from many bar soaps), but it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I was slkeptical at first, but after a month of using the Body Wash</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of tea tree oil, and it gives me peace of mind, after rolling on sweaty mats, or ill use it on my feet after running barefoot ect, good stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell same as last bottle, as good.  </li>
            <li> maybe I messed up but not sure its as good as people say</li>
            <li> It works fine, as far as I can tell, but I prefer the scent and exfoliating bits of The Original Potion from the Armbar Soap Company, which retails for the same price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you dry and gives you a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> You actually feel super clean when you rinse off, unlike most other soaps.  </li>
            <li> worked well for the feet, still have discoloration though in certain areas that this soap didn&#x27;t remove</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely with just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> very well&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li> I dont think that others would really notice the aroma from this soap.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really linger on your skin too much after a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought the bar soap to take on trips (to avoid the whole liquid restriction hassle in the carry on bag).</li>
            <li> This Really Upset Me, No Where In The Add or Description On Amazon</li>
            <li> - I tried another brand, but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as this one.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> This really does nothing to prevent or help it at all.  </li>
            <li> At all really.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t burn and tends to soothe however is just really for showing the infection.</li>
            <li> I had a whole body rash when I moved to Africa.</li>
            <li> Staph is very had to get rid of</li>
            <li> and it works really well on my problem itchy areas</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much in the way of being antifungal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It creates pimples on your skin that are really itchy</li>
            <li> do not see much improvement.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks i followed with 3x daily treatments of De-colorized Iodine (you can fine any pharmacy) which has done more to heal this inflection in 10 days than any of the other products have.</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite, but I use it in conjunction with my other shower gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several months since my original review.</li>
            <li> I feel clean after a shower, whereas brand name soaps sometimes haven&#x27;t left me feeling that way.</li>
            <li> got this because of being active and not always able to take a shower immediately.  </li>
            <li> I wonder why this product is not more popular.  </li>
            <li> The soap goes a long ways, also good for other parts of body.</li>
            <li> I had to let it, more or less, gravitate.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based mainly on the reviews that I had read.  </li>
            <li> It seems as we get older</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps or the staph got a little better on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It Says WARNING: Not For High Blood Pressure or Epilepsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly for that.</li>
            <li> In the item description on the website ad it does not make a statement about a (WARNING) label on the product, which states not for high blood pressure or epilepsy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is highly contagious&lt;br</li>
            <li> my son wrestles year around and had previously been getting ringworm frequently to the point of being a real hindrance to his being able to compete in tournaments and meets.</li>
            <li> Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products with minimal success, not to mention I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of the ingredients in most of the other similar products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I  was surprised to see how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li> it leaves you smelling clean and refreshed and if you have dry and itchy skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> perspire a lot here since the humidity stays over 60% year round, and that leads to itching sometimes for most people here.  </li>
            <li> put it aside as I had pretty much eradicated the last episode</li>
            <li> I would love to carry my Defense Soap bar around, but I don&#x27;t want it to get messy.</li>
            <li> We also enjoy the fact that, in spite of numerous hand washings, the skin on our hands is not dry.</li>
            <li> A newly procurred allergy that even two dermatologists with their skin biopsies cannot even determine the cause</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one, but in the time it took to get here, I got ringworm.  </li>
            <li> Personally for the money invested, I would just rather purchase a bottle of Dr Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castille Peppermint soap and and in some Tea Tree and Eucalyptus Oils and Voila!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me and based off the scent I would venture to say because the amount of essential oils it has in it appears to be very small.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> bottle would last long, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than a dab to create plenty of lather, so that first bottle&#x27;s lasted almost two months so far and should last another two or three months, even showering eleven or twelve times a week.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this product prevents irritation when I use it after exercising and sweating.  </li>
            <li> This product helped clear it up completely!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since I started training (in about 1999 or so) and haven&#x27;t had any sort of ringworm or skin problem - I&#x27;m not sure if the Defense Soap is 100% to thank, but I&#x27;m sure it has helped.  </li>
            <li> I use the Defense first on select areas, then use my regular body wash.</li>
            <li> You actually feel clean when using this soap, not greasy from the chemicals in standard body washes.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing so far that relieves symptoms at first temporary then as time goes by clears them all together.</li>
            <li> My son dropped my last bottle and most of it ran down the drain.  </li>
            <li> by chance I picked up a bottle of &#x27;Dr. Bonners Pure Castile Soap&#x27; at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I bought this shower gel because I wanted something that&#x27;s as close to natural as possible (i.e., without sodium lauryl sulfate and the other chemical stuff), and is not so strong that it irritates the skin.  </li>
            <li> Son&#x27;s say it helps keep them clear of acne.</li>
            <li> This product encourages the natural bacteria to stay.</li>
            <li> The liquid soap gives me peace of mind as I use natural ingredients to combat germs after the gym.  </li>
            <li> I like how it is a natural product.  </li>
            <li> i like the fact that it is natural instead of putting a bunch of chemicals on his body.</li>
            <li> only reason I took a star off is because it really really dries out his skin.</li>
            <li> Working so far.  </li>
            <li> Nearly ever scrape</li>
            <li> tried this on the back of  my scalp and it is very sticky and makes my hair feel like it has gunk in it.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, I either use it by itself a few times per week, or add some of it to my regular body wash, at about a 1:3 ratio (I try to use stuff that is free of potentially harmful chemicals, for what that&#x27;s worth).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old son who wrestles.</li>
            <li> this stuff work great a little bit and iam clean as can be if you feel dirty at all</li>
            <li> It suds up easily with very little soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in really humid, tropical areas (Florida, Hawaii, and New Orleans) and really dry areas (Flagstaff, AZ).</li>
            <li> have used many other extremely cheaper liquid soaps where their caps did not get clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about changing your cap style so it doesn&#x27;t get clogged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is very condensed and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sometimes these ship in plastic baggies, sometimes they don&#x27;t, not really a fault of the product, but something to be aware of when buying.</li>
            <li> It was far more harsh on my skin than bleach products that I use, and even harder on my skin than Hibicleanse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an athlete nor do I have much high-risk activity that would typically put someone at high risk of skin infections.</li>
            <li> Mainly wrestlers and others that have bodily contact with dunge and such.</li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s obviously improved his athlete&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li> (Because it is harder to control how much comes out that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to stay clean wearing those.</li>
            <li> For that reason your not likely to get recurrant infections or such so frequently.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil is not safe for young boys and can cause breast tissue growth and hormonal issues, so please be aware of this.</li>
            <li> Skin did not dry out either.</li>
            <li> Dies not irritate ir dry my very sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li> The smell can be a little off putting at first, bit it does not stick with you.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is that bottle top clogs up sometimes.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, after this last bottle, I may resort to trying something else or possibly buying the pure essential oil version of Defense (or some other essential oils) to add to my body wash.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest criticisms about both of these soaps is that a sport-specific soap is unnecessary and tea tree oil-based products will do just fine.</li>
            <li> The natural oils kill the bad bacteria and any fungus that could lead to athletes foot or ringworm without affecting your skin&#x27;s natural flora which is very important to maintain.</li>
            <li> It has a little weird smell, and lathers up really good.  </li>
            <li> It rinses completely clean, and the first time I used it I was afraid it would dry my skin out since it had rinsed off so well,</li>
            <li> key is to leave it on your skin for as long as possible&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin issue -- large and small circular patches of flakey dry skin on back and shoulders for two years...</li>
            <li> All wrestling season long.</li>
            <li> To me the oil smells strange but it seems to wash off when you rinse.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up what daily use of anti-fungal sprays never really get rid of.</li>
            <li> If you need to shower at gyms or facilities not near your house, this product is the way to go if you prefer the Defense Soap product line.</li>
            <li> After a few days (2-3), my skin infection is almost gone, and with the added bonus that this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notes: I&#x27;ve ordered several of these and about half the time the soap has leaked in transit, leaving a rather gross looking box.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with my other body wash, since using Defense as my only body wash would become cost prohibitive at $10 for 8oz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over priced body wash with no added benefit than other products at a third of the price.</li>
            <li> This has a very strange smell.</li>
            <li> Skin feels dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> the soap is grat and does not irritate or dry out his skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter, so the dry air doesn&#x27;t help, but in the year I&#x27;ve been with him</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it does help with my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this for my dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I deal with dry skin and psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> and its even helps with ingrown hairs and dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cleaning ability; how far so little goes; it&#x27;s anti-fungal qualities!</li>
            <li> :  The smell bothered me for awhile, however any comments about the smell i&#x27;ve received have been positive, the worst comment about it i&#x27;ve received in public was that the smell was &#x27;interesting&#x27;, and that person went on to buy some for after gym workouts.  </li>
            <li> I live in a hot humid sub-tropical environment and have been itching like crazy for a month.  </li>
            <li> This stuff soothes the area and healed that same area in less then a day.</li>
            <li> Bottle is a bit small considering the price if you&#x27;re used to buying regular non-specialized body washes at your local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes a little and it lathers well.  </li>
            <li> Initial smell is a little medicinal</li>
            <li> no itch.&lt;br /&gt;- 3 of 4 dermatologists said it was simply extreme dry skin and 1 said it could be anything from eczema to fungal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the body has a harder time in combacting skin bacteria.</li>
            <li> I get still tries to get fungal stuff.  </li>
            <li> As expected...</li>
            <li> Absolutely no skin issues while using it.</li>
            <li> After my 4th bottle, well not much changed on the foot.</li>
            <li> makes it even harder to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Is as expected it would be</li>
            <li> In three days, no kidding or exaggeration, dark, dry areas are gone.  </li>
            <li> Less pertinent is the fact that the black bottle doesn&#x27;t enable one to see how much is left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> By the way, a little goes a LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> thing to try is clear nail polish when you are desperate - the spores need oxygen to live</li>
            <li> I like to enjoy my showers though, and the smell of the stuff is just too unpleasant for me.  </li>
            <li> And other slight patches of dry areas on my body has also gone away..!</li>
            <li> Mainly due to sweating.</li>
            <li> BTW, I was not able to find this locally.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t spread to the other cats or to any members of our family.</li>
            <li> Antibacterial specific soaps do no better than other</li>
            <li> Not sure how well this product works, I&#x27;ve switched to another product entirely</li>
            <li> this is a MUST NEED item to control ring worm or any other transmitted skin condition...</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, take that how you will!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fight bacteria and other smells and odors as advertised.</li>
            <li> and when you scratch the spores spread through being under your nails to other parts of your skin</li>
            <li> I used other products it would not rinse off as well</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s never had dried skin and now after he dried off he looks waaaay too ashy for a white boy.</li>
            <li> I found that if I squeezed a half dollar size amount on a wet washcloth and rubbed the soap with my palm in a circular motion that it will lather up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been active outdoors and sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I am not one to typically review soap, but after using this product I felt I should give them their due props.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s basically not worth the money.</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> use it in the bathtub and let the soap soak into my face for at least 5 minutes - longer if possible</li>
            <li> The secret to this type of soap is that it doesnt kill the natural bacteria on your skin like alchohal would.</li>
            <li> the lid is black and hard, especially in the shower, to see.  </li>
            <li> also use a dab of chamois butter before the ride and that helps keep the friction down.  </li>
            <li> no ringworm or any other skin problems!</li>
            <li> this feels (literally) like a step down from the previous formula.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, we rescued a kitten that has ringworm, and we&#x27;ve been using Defense Shower Gel in hopes that it&#x27;ll prevent us from getting ringworm, and also prevent it from spreading to the other cats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrong, after using it for a week the fungal infection kept growing unimpeded, and the soap smells like a mixture of chemicals found in a lab and rotten produce, so it isn&#x27;t appealing to use aside from the failed reason I got it for.</li>
            <li> It only faintly smelled of the essential oils that are supposed to make it kill germs.</li>
            <li> Healed in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Stay black</li>
            <li> Lately I have noticed dry dark areas on my knuckles and used quite a few products on them.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to heal and protect when your skin is dry, so this product works against itself.</li>
            <li> Some of these schools do not clean the mats as well as they should.</li>
            <li> I had a little area about 1 inch in diameter</li>
            <li> It takes just a little bit to lather up.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these little ones and then the gallon to save money</li>
            <li> It reminds me a little of gasoline smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it smells a little hippy-ish</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think a wee little 8 oz.</li>
            <li> my skin is dried out and breaking out.</li>
            <li> Its not approved by the FDA so they cant say that it kills fungas but in a test they did with 8 pertr dishes of fungas it killed them all.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh &amp; does what it should</li>
            <li> This shower gel dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li> It has a lemon-like scent that is not fantastic</li>
            <li> I am guessing a few ingredients are not listed.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on for few minutes and wash off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now it&#x27;s just one of those things where I&#x27;ve still been getting occasional infections, but I can&#x27;t tell if defense has prevented it from being worse.</li>
            <li> Started training Muay thai a few weeks ago and heard about this thru the JRE podcast.</li>
            <li> Well, after a few days (I forgot to keep track)</li>
            <li> This leaves you with incontinence issues and I have to wear a heavy pad.</li>
            <li> And even under hot water, the clog is very difficult to clear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using Defense and Lamisil and the ringworm dried up in days.</li>
            <li> I play soccer, so after a game I use the soap in the shower, later up and let it set in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this again because as part of my anti-fungal toenail regiment, scrub my nails with a stiff brush and Defense every morning in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I had a pretty bad Fungal Infection on my skin that kept growing, and couldn&#x27;t get rid of it, so I figured a soap designed to fight fungal infections would help,</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad skin all around.  </li>
            <li> one day I looked down and lo and behold, the ring-shaped scaling on my foot was no more!</li>
            <li> A little lathers up a lot!</li>
            <li> No more ring worm for us.</li>
            <li> During the past year I have had issues with fungas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting boils every 3 weeks or so which not much better than before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Hard to say.  </li>
            <li> sadly it didnt help my skin issues nor my daughters ( bacterial skin issues and problems from Lyme disease).I tried it as a hair shampoo and it left it very dull and tangly.</li>
            <li> Use it at least once a day in the shower and you will notice improvement in three days.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this after the gym to get rid of the nasty feeling.  </li>
            <li> Not good for the hair though at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This reeks compared to real eucalyptus, unless it is terribly rancid, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s it since I&#x27;ve never smelled rancid eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> You would feel the same way if you contemplated MERSA (and other nasty bugs) as you observe the marginal habits of your fellow gym patrons.  </li>
            <li> the plastic is hard and difficult to squeeze the gel.  </li>
            <li> again, awful cap that will repeatedly get clogged by the product, frustrating you and making you wonder how they can charge so much for this soap and use a piece-of-crap cap that clogs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> with other soaps i would need hand sanitizer after the shower (my gloves are that bad.</li>
            <li> I dont know if thats a testament to the product or a case of bad luck, but in two years of heavy training and using this soap, I never had an issue.  </li>
            <li> I am not a wrestler/mat athelete, but I had a recurring one that I was getting plain sick of taking antibiotics for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too expensive (you can buy tea tree oil for dimes)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This should smell heavenly but it has a faint stink to</li>
            <li> Expensive but will be cheaper than taking him to the doctor with ringworm.</li>
            <li> This smells awful, and I there is no way to tell if it actually kills bacteria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m breaking out like crazy.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t wrestle in the sports sense of the word, I do wrestle in the game of life, which can leave one just as vulnerable to nasty critters like MRSA, ringworm, etc.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this stuff to prevent fungus under the arms, because that&#x27;s a bad spot to have it.</li>
            <li> But the smell isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is not that bad...</li>
            <li> My son had a bad case of ringworm in his hair.  </li>
            <li> This soap has helped keep ring worm away and it also does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> and until they do I&#x27;m expected to suffer the symptoms ( erythema, edema, blistering, weeping, itching, burning rash that drives me insane and leaves terrible pock marks over legs and arms) and spend mountains of money on their injections, antibiotics, creams and lotions not to mention every recommended treatment over the counter.  </li>
            <li> I work in a building with recirculated air where if one person gets sick, everyone gets sick.</li>
            <li> Buy it because you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t horrific, I was afraid it would smell bad or</li>
            <li> This stuff works in all climates, killing off the crap without stripping your skin.</li>
            <li> Very annoying and concerning plus worrying about spreading to others in household.</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>
            <li> There was a time at which I was shaving my belly and shins and slathering Sarna Anti-Itch Lotion on the spots five times a day just to alleviate the insane itching to a point I could sleep.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> worked well for the feet, still have discoloration though in certain areas that this soap didn&#x27;t remove</li>
            <li> We use the gel and the bar soap. All wrestling season long. My son. A junor in HS prefers the gel. No more ring worm for us. Some of these schools do not clean the mats as well as they should.</li>
            <li> I used this MOST RECENTLY from June 2011-October 2011 as my nightly shower soap. I&#x27;m ordering it again because...I&#x27;m breaking out like crazy. I&#x27;ve lived in really humid, tropical areas (Florida, Hawaii, and New Orleans) and really dry areas (Flagstaff, AZ). This stuff works in all climates, killing off the crap without stripping your skin. In the interim, I&#x27;ve been using 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and not only are my bed linens and night clothes bleached out--my skin is dried out and breaking out. So, I&#x27;m back to Defense Soap. Buy it because you won&#x27;t be disappointed. By the way, a little goes a LONG WAY. Unlike GymSoap, it is TRICLOSAN-FREE!</li>
            <li> as a cyclist, you sometimes need more than regular soap or body washes made for non-athletes - especially in hot humid conditions. i use this in shower after rides all the time now, and have not had any more skin problems in the saddle contact areas. also use a dab of chamois butter before the ride and that helps keep the friction down.  the two products together are a great solution.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty bad Fungal Infection on my skin that kept growing, and couldn&#x27;t get rid of it, so I figured a soap designed to fight fungal infections would help, right? Wrong, after using it for a week the fungal infection kept growing unimpeded, and the soap smells like a mixture of chemicals found in a lab and rotten produce, so it isn&#x27;t appealing to use aside from the failed reason I got it for.</li>
            <li> This works great on any fungus or germ related break out.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell. IT STOPS jock itch in its tracks (er in your shorts)</li>
            <li> It kills on site , with a great smell.. I use everyday when I shower , a great product</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Use it to eliminate rashes caused by diabetes.  Seems to be the ticket.</li>
            <li> Ive Only Used ThIs product One Time But I Feel Great. My Skin Feels So Clean And It smells Great</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and very strong scent&lt;br /&gt;Appears to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive (you can buy tea tree oil for dimes)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t lather very well&lt;br /&gt;Dries skin (you have to spend even more to get their whole line)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s basically not worth the money. I&#x27;ll just go back to Dial and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work</li>
            <li> This gel does a very nice job of leaving the skin with no residue after rinsing.  I like to enjoy my showers though, and the smell of the stuff is just too unpleasant for me.  It had a strong, medicinal fragrance.</li>
            <li> I beleive this soap to be the best soap I have ever used for keeping the skin healthy. I am a person that is not big on herbs and oils and all that. I bought this product based mainly on the reviews that I had read.  It has two types of oils in it. Teetree oil and ecuplyptas oil. During the past year I have had issues with fungas. Mainly due to sweating. If you ever get one of these fungas growing on your body you will find that they dont go away easily. I tried alot of different brands of antifungal creme and sprays. The cremes seemed to work the best but they take alot of time. When i tried this product out I  was surprised to see how fast this stuff works. I had a little area about 1 inch in diameter and it was burning from the sweat. This stuff soothes the area and healed that same area in less then a day. IF you read the website on defense soap.com you will see that its made for atheletes. Mainly wrestlers and others that have bodily contact with dunge and such. Its not approved by the FDA so they cant say that it kills fungas but in a test they did with 8 pertr dishes of fungas it killed them all. The secret to this type of soap is that it doesnt kill the natural bacteria on your skin like alchohal would. This product encourages the natural bacteria to stay. For that reason your not likely to get recurrant infections or such so frequently. Another thing on this liquid soap is that its concentrated. Not diluted like alot of those bodywash type soaps are. It takes just a little bit to lather up. To me the oil smells strange but it seems to wash off when you rinse. I dont think that others would really notice the aroma from this soap.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that they would notice is if you have a fungas eating away on your skin!  It seems as we get older the body has a harder time in combacting skin bacteria. For me this product is the best I have ever used. The only thing I could say to myself about this product was &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;!  &amp;#34;It really works&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Defense soap is one of my favorite discoveries.  The liquid soap gives me peace of mind as I use natural ingredients to combat germs after the gym.  You would feel the same way if you contemplated MERSA (and other nasty bugs) as you observe the marginal habits of your fellow gym patrons.  Also, there has been an overall improvement in the health of my skin (i.e. blocked pores) since I started using Defense three months ago.  Makes me feel better and cleaner after my work outs.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh &amp; does what it should</li>
            <li> Makes me feel very fresh and clean.  I like how it is a natural product.  I originally purchased because I freaked out when I found something that looked like &#x27;ringworm&#x27; on my ankle but it just turned out to be a spider bite.  It is probably excellent for an itchy or sore scalp or pimples on the scalp.  I sometimes use it as shampoo also.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the foot scrubber that suctions into my shower. It only faintly smelled of the essential oils that are supposed to make it kill germs. Plus, my bottle just smelled kind old/oxidized. It lathers mildly. I prefer PediFix Funga Soap. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GBBVG4/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B001GBBVG4&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;charsnot-20</li>
            <li> Defense Shower gel does what it claims.  It smooths your skin and fights dandruff.  My scalp never felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the smell.  I can&#x27;t stomach it and it lingers on my hair and body all day.  Others don&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it so I&#x27;m probably in the minority.</li>
            <li> Skin feels dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have found Defense Shower Gel to be effective.  I would buy it again and recommend it.  Though there are two things, as a senior lady, that were a bit of a challenge for me:  One:  the plastic is hard and difficult to squeeze the gel.  I had to let it, more or less, gravitate.  Two: the lid is black and hard, especially in the shower, to see.  I have to flip it by feel.  Less pertinent is the fact that the black bottle doesn&#x27;t enable one to see how much is left in the bottle.  Again, however, I would purchase it again.  BTW, I was not able to find this locally.  Glad Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li> It does seem to do what it claimed to do, but I wish it had a better smell.  It&#x27;s really cleared up a few issues.</li>
            <li> sadly it didnt help my skin issues nor my daughters ( bacterial skin issues and problems from Lyme disease).I tried it as a hair shampoo and it left it very dull and tangly.Im glad it works for others, just didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I just used it and I think this is about the cleanest  I&#x27;ve felt, does not strip your skin, smells ok..but when you smell it you know your going to get clean very clean!</li>
            <li> my son wrestles year around and had previously been getting ringworm frequently to the point of being a real hindrance to his being able to compete in tournaments and meets. i needed to find something. i saw the defense soap in a wrestling magazine and thought i&#x27;d give it a try. i bought the bar soap and the gel soap and had him try both. it has been almost a year and he has not had another bout of ringworm since!! he prefers the gel soap because it lathers more easily than the bar. the bar soap is easier to transport when flying though (dont have to deal with the security issue). so he just uses the bar when traveling using a plane. the soap is grat and does not irritate or dry out his skin. i like the fact that it is natural instead of putting a bunch of chemicals on his body. i would highly recommend this product to anyone who wrestles!! it works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading some excellent reviews online about its abilities to get rid of bacterial infections. I am not a wrestler/mat athelete, but I had a recurring one that I was getting plain sick of taking antibiotics for. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! (Yes, it&#x27;s that good as to use capitals). After a few days (2-3), my skin infection is almost gone, and with the added bonus that this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin. The smell is pretty much like tea tree oil, and not bad at all. Doesn&#x27;t really linger on your skin too much after a shower. I even started using it on my face and it&#x27;s helped with my acne. Definitely buying this stuff again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to reduce the chance of him getting any skin infections during Jiu-jitsu because he had picked up athlete&#x27;s foot and some guys called into his Jiu-jitsu studio saying they had ringworm and didn&#x27;t know it until after practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s obviously improved his athlete&#x27;s foot and he was one of the only guys that didn&#x27;t get ringworm, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s helping to some degree. It also makes him smell really good for a quite awhile, and I appreciate that the smell is more natural than his current cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I took a star off is because it really really dries out his skin. It&#x27;s winter, so the dry air doesn&#x27;t help, but in the year I&#x27;ve been with him he&#x27;s never had dried skin and now after he dried off he looks waaaay too ashy for a white boy.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  Great prices.</li>
            <li> The FDA does not allow this company to claim this product as an anti-fungal. It is a shame being that jock itch powder, lotrimin spray, and prescribed ketoconazole cream didn&#x27;t work and the only thing that did was defense shower gel.  This a great product.  I avoided being close to my girl friend because of jock itch.  This product stopped it in its tracks and cured it when nothing else did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since I started training (in about 1999 or so) and haven&#x27;t had any sort of ringworm or skin problem - I&#x27;m not sure if the Defense Soap is 100% to thank, but I&#x27;m sure it has helped.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After grappling practice, this is the soap I use. It makes your skin feel squeaky clean. I grew to like the herbal smell after the first two uses. I found that if I squeezed a half dollar size amount on a wet washcloth and rubbed the soap with my palm in a circular motion that it will lather up well. I bought the bar soap to take on trips (to avoid the whole liquid restriction hassle in the carry on bag).</li>
            <li> great for wrestling and other full contact sports. I swear by this soap after spending years training on the mat.</li>
            <li> My son used this faithfully after each wrestling practice and tournament...no ringworm or any other skin problems! Skin did not dry out either.</li>
            <li> I shall be brief: This stuff works!  If you live in a warm and humid climate and jock itch fungus in your nether regions is a problem this is what you want.  Use it at least once a day in the shower and you will notice improvement in three days.</li>
            <li> lathers very well and smells the best. or like tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Working so far.  It does have a strong smell, but not too offensive.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Thank you very much! :)</li>
            <li> Son&#x27;s say it helps keep them clear of acne. They asked for me to order more bottles please.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is good.  It suds up easily with very little soap.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I love the tea tree oil scent.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for helping to treat fungus and I like it. After washing with this stuff, I apply my medication and it seems to last longer without itching and the area does not get as red and irritated as it did before. This stuff is also good for face washing and is refreshing, with a clean smell. I will continue to use this stuff to prevent fungus under the arms, because that&#x27;s a bad spot to have it.</li>
            <li> Great love it. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better soap than this! The cleaning ability; how far so little goes; it&#x27;s anti-fungal qualities! It&#x27;s a must try!</li>
            <li> This shower gel dried my skin out.  It was far more harsh on my skin than bleach products that I use, and even harder on my skin than Hibicleanse.  It is hard to heal and protect when your skin is dry, so this product works against itself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to assist with an infection I had after surgery and now I plan to use it all the time.  It&#x27;s great for keeping our &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; areas fresh including under the breasts during the summer (and if you are over weight in between the folds of skin).  The smell is not my favorite, but I use it in conjunction with my other shower gel.  It only takes a little and it lathers well.  The best part is the ingredients are all natural!</li>
            <li> best soap for my son after pratice and matches does a great job for cleaning his skin for infections would not go without it.</li>
            <li> No issues to report.  When it comes to infections, parasites, and bacteria -- that&#x27;s a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does its job.</li>
            <li> This soap has provided my son with great mat protection while he practices and competes in judo and BJJ. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> what wonderful soap! It has cleared up what daily use of anti-fungal sprays never really get rid of. I love it and am ordering more right now.</li>
            <li> When I Read The Warning On The Bottle Label It Says WARNING: Not For High Blood Pressure or Epilepsy.&lt;br /&gt;My Antidote Homeopatic Medication, Consult Doctor Before Using.  This Really Upset Me, No Where In The Add or Description On Amazon Does It Mention This WARNING. Had The Warning Been In The Add Like It Should Have Been, I Never Would Have Ordered This Defense Soap Shower Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Sam Carpenter</li>
            <li> Great body soap it&#x27;s refreshing it leaves you smelling clean and refreshed and if you have dry and itchy skin it&#x27;s great for the relief and for a antifungal wash for the whole body I just love this product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I wanted something that would help the issues I was having, and it does that.  The smell isn&#x27;t horrific, I was afraid it would smell bad or something that was manly, as I am a female.  But the smell isn&#x27;t bad.  The product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it does help with my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*March 2016 - I tried another brand, but I didn&#x27;t like it as much as this one.  I bought this again!</li>
            <li> A newly procurred allergy that even two dermatologists with their skin biopsies cannot even determine the cause and until they do I&#x27;m expected to suffer the symptoms ( erythema, edema, blistering, weeping, itching, burning rash that drives me insane and leaves terrible pock marks over legs and arms) and spend mountains of money on their injections, antibiotics, creams and lotions not to mention every recommended treatment over the counter.  This product is the only thing so far that relieves symptoms at first temporary then as time goes by clears them all together.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my sons who have some fungal issues. They like the scent of melaluca and tell me it is working well for them.</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff on the Joe Rogan Podcast. I use this after I train and practice Bikram yoga. Doesn&#x27;t leave you dry and gives you a refreshing feeling. Must have if you train on mats!</li>
            <li> I bought this shower gel because I wanted something that&#x27;s as close to natural as possible (i.e., without sodium lauryl sulfate and the other chemical stuff), and is not so strong that it irritates the skin.  Although I don&#x27;t wrestle in the sports sense of the word, I do wrestle in the game of life, which can leave one just as vulnerable to nasty critters like MRSA, ringworm, etc.  I do work with animals, and sometimes if there&#x27;s a ringworm breakout among the animals, it can easily get transmitted to humans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because it&#x27;s exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s very gentle, and has a nice smell -- it&#x27;s not overbearing in this regard!  It keeps my skin soft, and it has a nice, gentle tingle, thanks to the tea tree oil and eucalyptus!  My husband had MRSA once during a hospital stay, and now I also have won him over, since he has a compromised immune system.  This stuff is great!  And the price is right!  I will be ordering again -- it&#x27;s well worth the peace of mind it brings!</li>
            <li> Lately I have noticed dry dark areas on my knuckles and used quite a few products on them.  Then I tried Defense.  In three days, no kidding or exaggeration, dark, dry areas are gone.  My friend who is diabetic had a wound on her lower leg that would not heal.  I gave her a bottle of Defense to use.  Healed in less than a week.  I wonder why this product is not more popular.  By the way, it also healed my folliculitis.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and i have had no skin issues after grappling 4 times a week. It has a lemon-like scent that is not fantastic but I think it is not that bad...</li>
            <li> Very good too, but more like a hand soap more than a shower soup</li>
            <li> I like the woodsy smell of this soap, and I feel I am protecting myself. Nice tingly feel! Rinses off and leaves you squeaky clean, no oily residue, but you must moisturize afterward. Hope it helps in the battle against my recent attack of toe nail fungus. Will update info later.</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long way.  good rich lather, does not get caked if you let if &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; on skin.  Let it soak in for a bit!!!  works great.</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot i feel really clean when i use it i do recommend it great buy</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, we rescued a kitten that has ringworm, and we&#x27;ve been using Defense Shower Gel in hopes that it&#x27;ll prevent us from getting ringworm, and also prevent it from spreading to the other cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ringworm situation seems to be resolving itself, with the help of [[ASIN:B006U7BM2C Naturasil Homoeopathic Remedies for Pet Mange, 60 ml, 2 Ounce]], and it hasn&#x27;t spread to the other cats or to any members of our family. We keep a container of Defense in each shower, and by every sink. We also enjoy the fact that, in spite of numerous hand washings, the skin on our hands is not dry. We&#x27;ll probably always use Defense as a liquid hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering, there is a lingering fragrance of eucalyptus, which we kind of enjoy. The product ingredients are: Saponified oils of Coconut and Olive, Jojoba Oil, Vegetable Gum/Glycerin Extract, Aloe Vera, Tea Tree Oil and Eucalyptus Oil.</li>
            <li> I suffer from combination skin and just about anything with Tea Tree and Pine seem to help me with my issue. When this runs out I will purchase it again and keep my cycle of Pine Tar for a month and this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these little ones and then the gallon to save money and because I thought it was a great idea at first.  The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t really work.  Nearly ever scrape I get still tries to get fungal stuff.  This really does nothing to prevent or help it at all.  On the antibacterial side, a study that just came out backs up the same.  Antibacterial specific soaps do no better than other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounded so good, but in the end it&#x27;s just soap that smells like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many similar products with minimal success, not to mention I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of the ingredients in most of the other similar products I have tried. I love that this product uses essential oils and I feel the size is well worth the price. Cleared up and seems to be preventing the skin issues that I bought the product for. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this for my dry itchy skin.  I live in a hot humid sub-tropical environment and have been itching like crazy for a month.  I took a shower with this and the itch has stopped.  The redness is gone also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I perspire a lot here since the humidity stays over 60% year round, and that leads to itching sometimes for most people here.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but it might be skin yeast.  This totally relieves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts this would work but it does.  It also lathers, which surprises me considering the listed ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;saponified oils of coconut and olive, jojoba oil, vegetable gum/glycerin extract, Aloe vera, tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil.  I see nothing here that would cause this to lather.  I am guessing a few ingredients are not listed.  This should smell heavenly but it has a faint stink to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a stinky version of eucalyptus oil.  I use eucalyptus oil in everything and use it also in my bath water and in my oil burners to fragrance the house.  This reeks compared to real eucalyptus, unless it is terribly rancid, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s it since I&#x27;ve never smelled rancid eucalyptus.  It reminds me a little of gasoline smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on the back of  my scalp and it is very sticky and makes my hair feel like it has gunk in it. But it did help my itchy scalp. Not good for the hair though at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you have itchy skin that nothing helps, give this a try.  I recommend it highly for that.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and eye opening natural fragrance. This shower gel is great when used daily to get rid of fungus and used with the ther Defense products. Fungus will diminish right away.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I used it all the time when I used to wrestle and still continue to use it after working out.</li>
            <li> In the item description on the website ad it does not make a statement about a (WARNING) label on the product, which states not for high blood pressure or epilepsy.  I have epilepsy, I had to return the gel.  I also bought the soap which I also returned.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  You actually feel super clean when you rinse off, unlike most other soaps.  It rinses completely clean, and the first time I used it I was afraid it would dry my skin out since it had rinsed off so well, but surprisingly my skin was super soft and not dry at all.  The more I use it, the better my skin feels.  Thanks Defense!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This is really the best soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with the rest of similar products to go along with this one.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it is working  or not.</li>
            <li> I use this after i train on the matts. Leave it on for few minutes and wash off. I havent gotten ringworm even if ky friends do.</li>
            <li> I participate in MMA and I always use this afterwards. It has a pleasent smell that is not too strong. I have not had any problems with MRSA, ringworm or any of that! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My boys are wrestlers and this has been a saving grace . All of the lovely skin issues you get with wrestling,ringworm,staph...They use this all season. I highly recommend it.Would deal with seller too!</li>
            <li> Like this also for skin problems. even my wife uses it now.&lt;br /&gt;The honey in it makes her extra sweet!!!</li>
            <li> Updated review  Ive used this soap for over 2 months now. It is really good at making all fungal infections visible so you can treat them as for treating them it didn&#x27;t work for me. At all really. it doesn&#x27;t burn and tends to soothe however is just really for showing the infection. After using it for 2 weeks i followed with 3x daily treatments of De-colorized Iodine (you can fine any pharmacy) which has done more to heal this inflection in 10 days than any of the other products have. SO yes this is great for finding infected areas but in my case it just made the infected areas larger.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of tea tree oil, and it gives me peace of mind, after rolling on sweaty mats, or ill use it on my feet after running barefoot ect, good stuff.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well this product works, I&#x27;ve switched to another product entirely (Antifungal Soap with Tea Tree Oil) but am now combining the two together to see if this helps the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fungus is a bitch!</li>
            <li> With regard to Defense simply as a soap to clean:&lt;br /&gt;Smells ok&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling like it has a film on it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to medicinal properties:&lt;br /&gt;- My skin issue -- large and small circular patches of flakey dry skin on back and shoulders for two years...no itch.&lt;br /&gt;- 3 of 4 dermatologists said it was simply extreme dry skin and 1 said it could be anything from eczema to fungal.&lt;br /&gt;- All 4 said a lifetime of steroid cream was the only solution.&lt;br /&gt;- because I didn&#x27;t want a lifetime of steroids, I started researching and found Defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results for my condition:&lt;br /&gt;- immediate improvement within 2 days of about 20 percent&lt;br /&gt;- was very happy because I expected it to get the point of a complete recovery...never happened.&lt;br /&gt;- After 4 months still had 80 percent problem. Aveno Oatmeal bath powder seemed to help a bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT then Amazon saved me!  Read someone&#x27;s review of Defense and they said Defense didn&#x27;t  help their problem but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap DID....so I tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap. OMG...after 2 years of misery, 100 percent recovery in 2 weeks. Amazing! It has been 2 months now and rash is still gone!</li>
            <li> You actually feel clean when using this soap, not greasy from the chemicals in standard body washes. The natural oils kill the bad bacteria and any fungus that could lead to athletes foot or ringworm without affecting your skin&#x27;s natural flora which is very important to maintain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bizarrely prone to cystic skin infections and I have no idea what to do about it. Not acne, but things like infected sweat glands that need to be surgically aspirated. I&#x27;m not an athlete nor do I have much high-risk activity that would typically put someone at high risk of skin infections. It&#x27;s just genetic, I suppose, or my diet, or maybe some product I use that I haven&#x27;t isolated as the culprit yet. A nurse once recommended using antiseptic soap, and she named one. I could never remember what it was, but after some research I found Defense, which seemed to be well received. I use it in conjunction with my other body wash, since using Defense as my only body wash would become cost prohibitive at $10 for 8oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now it&#x27;s just one of those things where I&#x27;ve still been getting occasional infections, but I can&#x27;t tell if defense has prevented it from being worse. As mentioned, I either use it by itself a few times per week, or add some of it to my regular body wash, at about a 1:3 ratio (I try to use stuff that is free of potentially harmful chemicals, for what that&#x27;s worth). Maybe if I used this exclusively and in full amounts it would have a more noticeable impact, but at that rate it would have me going through almost a bottle per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they sold this in larger, more cost effective sizes. Otherwise, after this last bottle, I may resort to trying something else or possibly buying the pure essential oil version of Defense (or some other essential oils) to add to my body wash.</li>
            <li> A trial will convince you....</li>
            <li> This soap is a GOD SEND! I suffer from intertrigo sometimes. This product helped clear it up completely!! It does not have a good smell, but it is EXACTLY what they advertise. It has no artificial ingredients, so no cutesy smell. Nothing is a quick fix. You have to keep it up. The key to this product is leaving it on the skin. I put it on and do the rest of my grooming. Then rinse off. If you remove it as soon as you applied it, it will be nothing better than soap. You&#x27;ll get clean but not have the effects you were looking for.</li>
            <li> My son had a bad case of ringworm in his hair.  This worked great as a shampoo.  He uses it now as a preventive body wash during wrestling season.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this shower gel.  I have very sensitive skin, and this product prevents irritation when I use it after exercising and sweating.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Best soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Performs as described.</li>
            <li> This is the best! It does smell like turpentine in the shower, but the smell does not linger (have asked friends to be sure), have had no problems with perspiration causing those &amp;#34;warm moist area&amp;#34; body issues.  It&#x27;s just good stuff for my skin&#x27;s health.  I feel clean after a shower, whereas brand name soaps sometimes haven&#x27;t left me feeling that way. Guess there is something to that triclosan in brand name soaps that causes me skin problems, that the tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t. Just reordered three more bottles. Do not want to ever be without this soap!</li>
            <li> Have been looking &amp; tried several shower jels.  This is great for anyone with eczema or psoriasis - all natural - no perfumes.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped keep ring worm away and it also does not smell bad. I do MMA training and there is always a possibility for ring worm and I use this soap before class and after and have not gotten it. Plus my wife likes the smell better then the selson blue that I used to use.</li>
            <li> Kills and prevents fungus as advertised</li>
            <li> I use it anytime I&#x27;m in a likely risky situation: working outside and walking a lot in the heat and I NEVER have a problem anymore.</li>
            <li> I am involved in all sorts of MMA training, and my son wrestles, so we use a good amount of the stuff.  My son dropped my last bottle and most of it ran down the drain.  I ordered a new one, but in the time it took to get here, I got ringworm.  I dont know if thats a testament to the product or a case of bad luck, but in two years of heavy training and using this soap, I never had an issue.  I go without for a week, and bam, ringworm.</li>
            <li> As expected... Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.  It has a little weird smell, and lathers up really good.  The only real complaint I have is that bottle top clogs up sometimes.</li>
            <li> Anybody involved in wrestling, combat sports, or even training at a commercial gym where people publicly sweat should use Defense Soap.  Absolutely no skin issues while using it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and if all goes according to plan I will not get any type of gym funk. IE ringworm, athletes foot etc. Started training Muay thai a few weeks ago and heard about this thru the JRE podcast. Shower with it religiously after workouts. Initial smell is a little medicinal but it was girlfriend approved once I finished showering with it.</li>
            <li> I use this as soon as I get home from BJJ class. It&#x27;s become part of the ritual after class, defense soap shower and then immediately wash the gi. Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you wrestle or do MMA this is a MUST NEED item to control ring worm or any other transmitted skin condition...Just make sure you follow the directions and shower right after whatever sport you do.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  Lathers nicely with just a little bit.  The smell can be a little off putting at first, bit it does not stick with you. Good product.</li>
            <li> Well, I went to the doctor about a rather unsightly scaling going on on my foot, which I thought was eczema, but was told was &#x27;ringworm&#x27;. Freaked me out about worms, but was told it&#x27;s just a fungus, nothing to do with worms at all, and I could&#x27;ve contracted it by walking barefooted after swimming.. After reading tons of reviews I was sold on this product (Defense soap) especially with the impressive all-natural ingredients. I ordered 4 bottles. After my 4th bottle, well not much changed on the foot. I had waited 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;Just by chance I picked up a bottle of &#x27;Dr. Bonners Pure Castile Soap&#x27; at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s - I was attracted by the price at $9.99 and volume I&#x27;m getting with its big jar. Well, after a few days (I forgot to keep track) one day I looked down and lo and behold, the ring-shaped scaling on my foot was no more! And other slight patches of dry areas on my body has also gone away..! I think I know now which product I would rather stick with.</li>
            <li> I had a whole body rash when I moved to Africa. My rash lasted about 3 weeks, as soon as I started using this soap it went away. I don&#x27;t know what the rash was caused by, but the linens and stuff out here are washed and hung outside. The water used is from a river so I can only assume that there is lots of bacteria in it.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. As a heavier guy I am always concerned about body scent. This soap is perfect for preventing scent causing bacteria in the sweaty regions of the body.</li>
            <li> Insanely good.  I deal with dry skin and psoriasis.  Old spice body wash smells good but it dries my skin out and irritates my psoriasis.  This stuff gets rid of any smell I may have going on as well as leaves my skin feeling clean without drying me out.  Excellent product.  I enjoy using this after the gym to get rid of the nasty feeling.  Wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> I had athlete&#x27;s foot on/off for years. I began washing my feet with this soap once a week or so. Fungus is gone and has not returned</li>
            <li> Good product, keeps me smelling fresh, great after a workout, and its not as drying to the skin as expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who just started wrestling.  Expensive but will be cheaper than taking him to the doctor with ringworm.</li>
            <li> this soap is everything is claims to be and more. keeps my skin feeling super clean after showers.  takes the rancid smell&lt;br /&gt;of my gloves off my hands too.  with other soaps i would need hand sanitizer after the shower (my gloves are that bad. and its even helps with ingrown hairs and dry skin. 5 out of 5 stars</li>
            <li> The soap every athlete on the mat needs. Pleasant scent, only wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok I guess. Didn&#x27;t really do much for me and based off the scent I would venture to say because the amount of essential oils it has in it appears to be very small.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, if others have found it to be effective then that&#x27;s a good thing. Personally for the money invested, I would just rather purchase a bottle of Dr Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castille Peppermint soap and and in some Tea Tree and Eucalyptus Oils and Voila! You have your own anti-fungal soap an one you can make more potent than this Defense one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on re-ordering this product, I&#x27;ll just make my own.</li>
            <li> the formula has changed since i first bought this shower gel in may.  the smell isn&#x27;t as nice and they removed the jojoba oil, a natural fungicide and moisturizer.  this feels (literally) like a step down from the previous formula.</li>
            <li> Works as described...</li>
            <li> Started using Defense when I was competing in MMA.  Trained daily for years, and never got any sort of infection or rash.  Was it the soap?  Hard to say.  I still use it daily however, only on areas that are prone to that sort of thing such as my feet, hands, and anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Too cost prohibitive to use as an all over body wash.  I use the Defense first on select areas, then use my regular body wash.</li>
            <li> Bought this after trying the bar soap. This one is very condensed and goes a long way. I had prostate cancer and surgery to remove the prostate. Later had to have radiation. This leaves you with incontinence issues and I have to wear a heavy pad. It&#x27;s hard to stay clean wearing those. I got a boil the size of a quarter and 3/4\\&quot; deep in my pubic area and had to stay in hospital a week so they could give antibiotics via IV. The boil was caused from Staph and I kept getting smaller ones about every week or two. Very annoying and concerning plus worrying about spreading to others in household. Best advise Doctors had was to alcohol on them and bleaching clothing. Nothing seemed to help so I stumbled on the defense products. It wasn&#x27;t instant, but this shower gel seems to have stopped the problem. Time will tell. Staph is very had to get rid of once it&#x27;s gotten a foot hold and having to wear a pad makes it even harder to get rid of. This is the only product I have found that seems to have worked. Doctors don&#x27;t even seem to have any good advise other than OTC antibiotics, alcohol and bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5-21-14 Lowering my rating from 5 to 4 stars and that&#x27;s being generous. It&#x27;s been several months since my original review. I&#x27;m not as impressed as I was. I&#x27;m still getting boils every 3 weeks or so which not much better than before I started using this product. Not sure if it helps or the staph got a little better on it&#x27;s own. I quit using it about 3 weeks ago as a test and see no increase in getting boils. I believe this product is more intended to prevent staph if you go to a gym where it is known to spread. I still have another full bottle so I will continue experiment with it until it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li> Im not saying this is the only reason but if i had the sniffles and took a shower with this stuff I would be fine inthe morning. I work in a building with recirculated air where if one person gets sick, everyone gets sick. Been through 2 colds season and never had to buy a box of tissues. and I like the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> A skin condition that my daughter has been plagued with most of her life is now under control. It has eliminated all but one or 2 spots on her skin and those are fading. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans well. Tea Tree oil is not safe for young boys and can cause breast tissue growth and hormonal issues, so please be aware of this.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I had an issue with some soap not being as fragrant.  I hit up Defense and they generously replaced my bottle and gave me a complimentary one.  4 stars just cause I didn&#x27;t find it necessary to use this specific soap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t for sure say if it does what it claims to do but I am hopeful. My son says it burns like he!! on any open areas so be forewarned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six months and it works really well on my problem itchy areas</li>
            <li> I am not one to typically review soap, but after using this product I felt I should give them their due props.  Great soap, smells good too!  Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> My son does not wrestle without having this stuff to shower off with. Since finding this product we have not had issues with ringworm or staph</li>
            <li> Whew! This smells awful, and I there is no way to tell if it actually kills bacteria. I gave it two stars because it does clean the hair somewhat.</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Doesn&#x27;t really do much in the way of being antifungal. Personally; this broke my skin out.</li>
            <li> The cap that will always clog up to the point you can no longer pour out the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on! Do the owners of the company that makes this product actually use it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$9 and up for this soap, and yet they cannot find a way to have it dispensed without the cap getting clogged to the point it becomes useless?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh sure. They and others are gonna say, just twist off the cap and run it under very hot water until the clog is cleared. (The cap&#x27;s just gonna get clogged again fairly soon. And even under hot water, the clog is very difficult to clear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, why not just twist off the cap entirely and pour the soap out when you want to use it instead of cleaning the cap itself? (Because it is harder to control how much comes out that way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many other extremely cheaper liquid soaps where their caps did not get clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about changing your cap style so it doesn&#x27;t get clogged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, awful cap that will repeatedly get clogged by the product, frustrating you and making you wonder how they can charge so much for this soap and use a piece-of-crap cap that clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is an effective shower gel, but I cannot recommend it until they solve the cap-clogging issue.</li>
            <li> My son had been using this after every wrestling practice.  I&#x27;m assuming he brought ringworm into the house, but never showed signs of it.  However, I had not been using this and contracted it.  I started using Defense and Lamisil and the ringworm dried up in days.</li>
            <li> train by day...&lt;br /&gt;olive garden butthole.&lt;br /&gt;oh, and by the way this soap works. No staff, no ringworm ever. Stay black</li>
            <li> I should say that my boyfriend loves it actually. I think it smells a little hippy-ish but he says it makes his skin feel amazing and a little goes a long way, take that how you will!</li>
            <li> got this because of being active and not always able to take a shower immediately.  had a mild case of jock itch, this cleared it up right away.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan, I got ring worm a couple weeks after I started using this stuff...maybe I messed up but not sure its as good as people say</li>
            <li> This has a very strange smell. It works fine, as far as I can tell, but I prefer the scent and exfoliating bits of The Original Potion from the Armbar Soap Company, which retails for the same price. One of the biggest criticisms about both of these soaps is that a sport-specific soap is unnecessary and tea tree oil-based products will do just fine. From what I&#x27;ve seen, they cost about the same and I like to support the jiu jitsu community.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fight bacteria and other smells and odors as advertised. Over priced body wash with no added benefit than other products at a third of the price.</li>
            <li> Mostly tea tree and moisturizers...leaves you feeling very clean very quickly. A little lathers up a lot! Glad I tried it</li>
            <li> this stuff work great a little bit and iam clean as can be if you feel dirty at all get some of this stuff its best soap i ever had and has a nice smell to a little strong when your washing but after wards its not bad at all</li>
            <li> Works as claimed. Helps heal the skin from fungal breakouts and prevents them in the future. I work with kids so this is my go-to soap! Always have some in the cabinet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a couple of years.- works great. My skin loves it. I&#x27;ve always been active outdoors and sweat a lot. Especially in the summer.  I struggled with recurring jock itch and or athletes foot. Since adding this to my daily shower routine I&#x27;ve not had any more problems. The tea tree is wonderful and smells great too.</li>
            <li> There was a time at which I was shaving my belly and shins and slathering Sarna Anti-Itch Lotion on the spots five times a day just to alleviate the insane itching to a point I could sleep. My HMO couldn&#x27;t help (or wasn&#x27;t interested in helping). A couple of showers with Defense and the problem was OVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think a wee little 8 oz. bottle would last long, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than a dab to create plenty of lather, so that first bottle&#x27;s lasted almost two months so far and should last another two or three months, even showering eleven or twelve times a week. I&#x27;ve still ordered a two-bottle set just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out any time soon; I never want to shower without it again.</li>
            <li> Really good soap for after Jiu Jitsu training!</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago during an outbreak of ringworm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ringworm or jock itch is a fungus that spreads like measles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates pimples on your skin that are really itchy and when you scratch the spores spread through being under your nails to other parts of your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly contagious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it from where I work out using weights and had it on my face and hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it aside as I had pretty much eradicated the last episode but it surfaced again recently so I decided to use it from the first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasantly surprised at how effective it is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to leave it on your skin for as long as possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the bathtub and let the soap soak into my face for at least 5 minutes - longer if possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries up the affected areas and red pimples so the spores don&#x27;t spread&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to try is clear nail polish when you are desperate - the spores need oxygen to live</li>
            <li> Five stars because the product does what its supposed to do but as a girl, I wish it smelled more attractive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old son who wrestles. He uses this to wash after practice and matches. Smells great and lasts a long time. Just use this with any standard poof or loofa. Keep the ringworm at bay too.</li>
            <li> I have fungal folliculitis that I contracted from gym equipment. I&#x27;ve never been able to fully eradicate it, but Defense soap and body wipes help me to keep it under control when it flares up. The body wash smells like tree bark and its not clean-rinsing (leaves that sticky feel you get from many bar soaps), but it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to help. I&#x27;d give it a 5th star if it actually cured my condition.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used tea tree oil and tea tree soaps before and this has just a hint of that smell, but seems to rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used other products it would not rinse off as well and I would smell like a medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a mild smell that smells clean and fresh. Maybe minty. GF does not seem to mind. I will order more before this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> do not see much improvement.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell same as last bottle, as good.  I bought this again because as part of my anti-fungal toenail regiment, scrub my nails with a stiff brush and Defense every morning in the shower.  It seemed to help reduce my nail fungus in conjunction with another remedy.  The soap goes a long ways, also good for other parts of body.</li>
            <li> Is as expected it would be</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad skin all around.  My skin has always been problematic, but since i&#x27;ve started to exercise more, its become a bit more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The smell bothered me for awhile, however any comments about the smell i&#x27;ve received have been positive, the worst comment about it i&#x27;ve received in public was that the smell was &#x27;interesting&#x27;, and that person went on to buy some for after gym workouts.  Its not a replacement for anything medical grade, but it does do a good job of keeping away any kind of fungal (athlete&#x27;s foot/etc.) issues you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not quite strong enough to clear up any existing fungal issues on its own in my case.  Despite the fact that my wife and others think it smells nice, the scent was kind of bothersome at first.  Bottle is a bit small considering the price if you&#x27;re used to buying regular non-specialized body washes at your local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I&#x27;ve ordered several of these and about half the time the soap has leaked in transit, leaving a rather gross looking box.  Sometimes these ship in plastic baggies, sometimes they don&#x27;t, not really a fault of the product, but something to be aware of when buying.</li>
            <li> I was slkeptical at first, but after a month of using the Body Wash i must say it works. Doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on me and, best of all no rashes or skin problems  have occurred while using! I play soccer, so after a game I use the soap in the shower, later up and let it set in for a few minutes. rinses off easily!</li>
            <li> Soap has that trademark tea tree oil smell.  I have found that it does a good job with curbing jock itch if used daily.  Not a miracle cure, but does help begin the healing process.</li>
            <li> If you need to shower at gyms or facilities not near your house, this product is the way to go if you prefer the Defense Soap product line. I would love to carry my Defense Soap bar around, but I don&#x27;t want it to get messy. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d feel about using a soap bar that has come into contact in other places besides my own home shower! This is a great product and does the same job (I think) as the bar. The bar is probably more bang for your buck, but this serves it&#x27;s purpose as well. I use this for on the run showering at gyms.</li>
            <li> Love it, and I find the smell rather refreshing.  Dies not irritate ir dry my very sensitive skin either.  Loved it so much, I bought extra bottles and some for my father in law.</li>
