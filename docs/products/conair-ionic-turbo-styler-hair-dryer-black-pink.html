            <li> Love how it is lighter than my previous Conair, blow drys my hair wonderfully, no frizz.  </li>
            <li> , i dont think it drys any different then any other hair dryer.</li>

            <li> But, for the price that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product dried my quite a while and put volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li> With coarse hair it usually takes a long time and not a smooth process but using this</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s average length should be longer for having to move it from side to side of you head and trying to style with it.</li>
            <li> and i have ALOT of hair its long and really thick</li>
            <li> and it dried my hair.  </li>

            <li> I was hoping for a little more power with this hairdryer. I previously owned a Rusk Speed Freak and was hoping for something comparable but less expensive. While it definitely is nowhere near as powerful as the speed freak, it does the job well. It is very light and the attachments are great. I have fine hair so it still takes quite a while to dry with this dryer. But, for the price that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> It has the three basic setting (hot, warm, and cool) plus a cold button (a little cooler than the cool setting) It dries my thick longer hair in 5 minutes and my hair (color plus highlights processed) comes out smooth &amp; shiny w/minimal product use</li>
            <li> Works great ! Very stylish too !!</li>

            <li> pretty good hair dryer for the price, i dont think it drys any different then any other hair dryer. The cool button works great.</li>
            <li> wow !!!!this is a great  dryer, i love it&lt;br /&gt; i will buy a new one again, es genial realmente la recomiendo</li>
            <li> The concentrator is good for straighten hair. Exclude that everything is same with similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this item for a short time, and the ionizer already broke. It won&#x27;t fit on the dryer anymore. Seller was great... Item arrived quickly. Product not so great.</li>
            <li> A little lightweight and works great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Identical to the one I&#x27;ve had, but finally bit the dust after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> It works fine , the back vent cover was broken upon arrival!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!!!  I especially love the accessories it comes with, one being the concentrated part that blow dries you hair more gentler.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item and havent tryed it yet but I have a good feeling this might be good for my hair. Letts see waht happens ¢¾</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for about two months and it is great I&#x27;ve driped it like about 4 times lol and its still holding up perfectly no scratches or dents plus I&#x27;ve used it with a thermal brush to make beautiful poofy curls and it work perfectly and came with the diffuser also</li>
            <li> Did great on my hair, seems to cut hair drying time in half. With coarse hair it usually takes a long time and not a smooth process but using this it was simple</li>
            <li> Perfect size &amp; speeds. what more can I say?</li>
            <li> I received the product earlier than the stated date on the shipping details.  So far, I just used it once and it dried my hair.  Probably, it was because I may not have use the product properly.  I was not used to drying my hair before.  Overall, the product dried my quite a while and put volume to my hair.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Works just as it says it does. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Would recommend this to anyone seeking a good blow dryer and the color scheme is cool. Very light weight and compact.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s just what I needed and is professional quality, I can do what I need with minimal effort, hopefully last long</li>
            <li> Used it the first day i recieved it a true gem drys my hair so fast and i have ALOT of hair its long and really thick</li>
            <li> Bought this for my GF. She likes the product and especially wanted it from the conair brand. Because she had previous positive experiences with the conair brand products.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and the item was as described.</li>
