            <li>Product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>My co-workers liked inspecting my nails with my Gelish nail polish on.     </li>
            <li>The swatch is beautiful, but does not do justice to reflect the true colour, as almost all pictures tend to do.</li>
            <li>The swatch seems to have a kind of purple hue to it.</li>
            <li>Has a nice shimmering glitter inside the chocolate color.</li>
            <li>I have been using my own Gellish products for over a year</li>
            <li>Nice Color one of my favorites and</li>
            <li>It looks so nice in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>It is a nice color but not what the color swatch shows.</li>
            <li>love it  - beautiful rich color  </li>
            <li>Peels off very easily also.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice and easy.</li>
            <li>I love this color, it is just so pretty, gorgeous warm brown with simmer.  </li>
            <li>I have use a lot of Gelish polishes and this is the very first one I have had wrinkle up during curing time!!</li>
            <li>Sweet Chocolate is a gorgeous colour and is great for fall and winter, although I choose to use it now for Easter paired with Taupe Model to get a chocolately effect instead of the classic pastel colours.</li>
            <li>Great fast service.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and can&#x27;t wait to put it on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.  </li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I love gelish products.</li>
            <li>I had it on for a week and no chips at all...will purchase more of this brand...</li>
            <li>Having said that I love this color.</li>
            <li>June Bride layered over top...</li>
            <li>I love the color of this gel polish.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>will buy more</li>
            <li>I love this shade.</li>
            <li>and then another top coat from Shellac CND.</li>
            <li>I love the color but would not purchase it again for this reason.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this color when I saw it online once</li>
            <li>So captivating.</li>
            <li>I really love this polish....</li>
            <li>the color is great and it came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>This color is just ok.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more shimmery.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be more brown in color.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the gelish nail color...</li>
            <li>I put this on than a glitter gelish coat on top.</li>
            <li>- also used it with June Bride on top</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>A nice rich brown with a hint of gold sparkle.  </li>
            <li>I also bought Gelish Bronzed and used it over the top of this Sweet Chocolate &amp; I looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Love it the color is rich brown</li>
            <li>I did buy it in the summer, and it is definitely more of a fall/winter color, but I was so excited when I got it that I had to switch colors immediately.  </li>
            <li>and i like it,soaks off easy stays on</li>
            <li>The color is fine.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color, I love it.</li>
            <li>It has a light gold shimmer to it depending on the lighting....</li>
            <li>Fantastic for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li>so worth the money :)</li>
            <li>This color also has a light shimmer to it also.</li>
            <li>This gel polish did not harden under the UV light.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a beautiful matte grey that stays put.</li>
            <li>But as far as being a good product it is.</li>
            <li>I love this color very much.</li>
            <li>this is a rich chocolate color with a hint of gold shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>The chocolate is even prettier in person - it has small specks of sparkle that make it shimmer and is very beautiful on!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neutral and warm, but not dull in any way.  </li>
            <li>Looks great with a single coat of the Bronzed color over it, or by itself.</li>
            <li>This brown color is so beautiful and unlike any other.  </li>
            <li>and this is, by far, one of my favorite colors!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, however it does not stay on like other gelish polish I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I have bought many Harmony Gelish polish and really like it.</li>
            <li>Sweet Chocolate is a shimmery brown with hues of gold.  </li>
            <li>A real hit with many gelish fans.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery brown color that&#x27;s not as dark as the swatch.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful dark chocolate color with a hint of silver sparkle in the polish.  </li>
            <li>This color is cool, but it was not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>cool colour, wears well</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d highly recommend doing a Google search to get a better idea</li>
            <li>I saw it more brown than it really is, and darker too, but overall, it looks nice.  </li>
            <li>It looks just like it does in the picture, and it really does remind me of sweet chocolate!</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite color for fall.</li>
            <li>I ordered this color and not only did it arrive very quickly, packed very well, but I love the color!</li>
            <li>A really pretty color for fall!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with all of the Gelish polishes I&#x27;ve bought thus far; I feel they&#x27;re the only polishes I&#x27;ve gotten that were true to the advertised color.  </li>
            <li>Will DEFINITELY order again and again, thanks so much for the great deal!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But up close it has just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li>Was nervous to order online because I&#x27;ve heard nightmares of people buying Gelish that didn&#x27;t cure right from online stores.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty however this color is very temperamental!!</li>
            <li>It is very pretty in person &amp; doesn&#x27;t look much like the swatch that they have shown.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that the color swatches aren&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
            <li>friends will like it very much.</li>
            <li>Again using one coat of June Bride ( same with what I did with the Stand Out) made my nails look sexy.     </li>
            <li>The shimmers are a pretty taupe-ish color that show up in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>It definitely is a deep brown, and the more coats you add the darker it gets.</li>
            <li>so pretty for fall.</li>
            <li>I am currently wearing this colour and I love it.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>it does exactly what it;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Just as described, deep, rich brown!  </li>
            <li>polish is a good price on Amazon as the local stores charge about $15 a bottle for a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very few sites that sell Gelish products seems to have good pictures of them</li>
            <li>This is a very modern, dark shade, one of the better Gelish colors.  </li>
            <li>and I really want it for myself.  </li>
            <li>A real keeper.  </li>
            <li>My daughter wants to try it with</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Since the polish has a silver sparker in it you should gently shake it to mix the sparkle up into the polish before you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very close to the sample color.</li>
            <li>Cures very well.</li>
            <li>Very frosted looking.</li>
            <li>I really like Gelish products</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t harden like other gelish polish, and wipes off even after I cure the top coat.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this color of Gelish if you are looking for a good dark brown.</li>
            <li>and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li>Color is not the deep chocolate I expected, however, its still a nice brown/goldish color with some shimmer...</li>
            <li>A beautiful dark brown with gold and green shimmer.</li>
            <li>The second time I put a very very very thin coats and it turned out perfect!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li>I would say it is more mocha with a little bit of purple hue in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d normally gravitate towards.  </li>
            <li>great color, not a full frosted polish...just a little shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I did not have a problem with it when it was new.</li>
            <li>It is a dark brown with a gold-ish shimmer in light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing Never Too Grey right now</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesnt show messy streaks.</li>
            <li>I wanted a brown color and know how hard it is to tell for sure what you will get by the pictures.</li>
            <li>Brown nail polish may not sound very pretty, but this color is the bomb!</li>
            <li>but it so far it has survived wearing gloves at work and doing home repairs.</li>
            <li>deep color, applies and wears very well.  </li>
            <li>and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li>Its a true dark chocolate color.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying another band that is not so thick love the color</li>
            <li>my manicurist uses this brand often on me, usually just fine, but this one did not work.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and green eyes and the color looks really nice with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It is not a flat brown, but has a shimmer to it gives it a little bronzing in the light.</li>
            <li>It appeared that this polish, which worked well when it was new, had changed in consistency with age and was now no longer setting properly and peeling off my nails in sheets, even though I followed all the steps correctly.  </li>
            <li>I like this chocolate color, it had gold flecks in it, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long and go on as smooth as other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li>I bought this color after already buying some other colors (Gossip Girl, Hot Rod Red, Go Girl, June Bride...) from Gelish.</li>
            <li>Works very vell in combination with other gelish polish.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This color is just ok.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more shimmery.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more brown in color.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the gelish nail color...</li>
            <li> I put this on than a glitter gelish coat on top.</li>
            <li> - also used it with June Bride on top</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> A nice rich brown with a hint of gold sparkle.  </li>
            <li> I also bought Gelish Bronzed and used it over the top of this Sweet Chocolate &amp; I looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it the color is rich brown</li>
            <li> I did buy it in the summer, and it is definitely more of a fall/winter color, but I was so excited when I got it that I had to switch colors immediately.  </li>
            <li> and i like it,soaks off easy stays on</li>
            <li> The color is fine.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color, I love it.</li>
            <li> It has a light gold shimmer to it depending on the lighting....</li>
            <li> Fantastic for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li> so worth the money :)</li>
            <li> This color also has a light shimmer to it also.</li>
            <li> This gel polish did not harden under the UV light.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a beautiful matte grey that stays put.</li>
            <li> But as far as being a good product it is.</li>
            <li> I love this color very much.</li>
            <li> this is a rich chocolate color with a hint of gold shimmer in it.</li>
            <li> The chocolate is even prettier in person - it has small specks of sparkle that make it shimmer and is very beautiful on!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neutral and warm, but not dull in any way.  </li>
            <li> Looks great with a single coat of the Bronzed color over it, or by itself.</li>
            <li> This brown color is so beautiful and unlike any other.  </li>
            <li> and this is, by far, one of my favorite colors!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color, however it does not stay on like other gelish polish I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have bought many Harmony Gelish polish and really like it.</li>
            <li> Sweet Chocolate is a shimmery brown with hues of gold.  </li>
            <li> A real hit with many gelish fans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery brown color that&#x27;s not as dark as the swatch.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful dark chocolate color with a hint of silver sparkle in the polish.  </li>
            <li> This color is cool, but it was not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> cool colour, wears well</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d highly recommend doing a Google search to get a better idea</li>
            <li> I saw it more brown than it really is, and darker too, but overall, it looks nice.  </li>
            <li> It looks just like it does in the picture, and it really does remind me of sweet chocolate!</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite color for fall.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color and not only did it arrive very quickly, packed very well, but I love the color!</li>
            <li> A really pretty color for fall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with all of the Gelish polishes I&#x27;ve bought thus far; I feel they&#x27;re the only polishes I&#x27;ve gotten that were true to the advertised color.  </li>
            <li> Will DEFINITELY order again and again, thanks so much for the great deal!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But up close it has just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Was nervous to order online because I&#x27;ve heard nightmares of people buying Gelish that didn&#x27;t cure right from online stores.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty however this color is very temperamental!!</li>
            <li> It is very pretty in person &amp; doesn&#x27;t look much like the swatch that they have shown.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the color swatches aren&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
            <li> friends will like it very much.</li>
            <li> Again using one coat of June Bride ( same with what I did with the Stand Out) made my nails look sexy.     </li>
            <li> The shimmers are a pretty taupe-ish color that show up in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> It definitely is a deep brown, and the more coats you add the darker it gets.</li>
            <li> so pretty for fall.</li>
            <li> I am currently wearing this colour and I love it.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> it does exactly what it;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Just as described, deep, rich brown!  </li>
            <li> polish is a good price on Amazon as the local stores charge about $15 a bottle for a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very few sites that sell Gelish products seems to have good pictures of them</li>
            <li> This is a very modern, dark shade, one of the better Gelish colors.  </li>
            <li> and I really want it for myself.  </li>
            <li> A real keeper.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wants to try it with</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Since the polish has a silver sparker in it you should gently shake it to mix the sparkle up into the polish before you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very close to the sample color.</li>
            <li> Cures very well.</li>
            <li> Very frosted looking.</li>
            <li> I really like Gelish products</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t harden like other gelish polish, and wipes off even after I cure the top coat.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this color of Gelish if you are looking for a good dark brown.</li>
            <li> and I am usually a pretty busy gal</li>
            <li> Color is not the deep chocolate I expected, however, its still a nice brown/goldish color with some shimmer...</li>
            <li> A beautiful dark brown with gold and green shimmer.</li>
            <li> The second time I put a very very very thin coats and it turned out perfect!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks</li>
            <li> I would say it is more mocha with a little bit of purple hue in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d normally gravitate towards.  </li>
            <li> great color, not a full frosted polish...just a little shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I did not have a problem with it when it was new.</li>
            <li> It is a dark brown with a gold-ish shimmer in light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing Never Too Grey right now</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and doesnt show messy streaks.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brown color and know how hard it is to tell for sure what you will get by the pictures.</li>
            <li> Brown nail polish may not sound very pretty, but this color is the bomb!</li>
            <li> but it so far it has survived wearing gloves at work and doing home repairs.</li>
            <li> deep color, applies and wears very well.  </li>
            <li> and my hands see a lot of action.</li>
            <li> Its a true dark chocolate color.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying another band that is not so thick love the color</li>
            <li> my manicurist uses this brand often on me, usually just fine, but this one did not work.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and green eyes and the color looks really nice with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It is not a flat brown, but has a shimmer to it gives it a little bronzing in the light.</li>
            <li> It appeared that this polish, which worked well when it was new, had changed in consistency with age and was now no longer setting properly and peeling off my nails in sheets, even though I followed all the steps correctly.  </li>
            <li> I like this chocolate color, it had gold flecks in it, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long and go on as smooth as other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this color after already buying some other colors (Gossip Girl, Hot Rod Red, Go Girl, June Bride...) from Gelish.</li>
            <li> Works very vell in combination with other gelish polish.</li>
            <li> Beware it is a little more runny than some of the other Gelish nail polishes (so a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I tried three times with different foundation brands, but this one must have been old product; cracked and wrinkled badly and would chip off within minutes of top coat application.</li>
            <li> Tip: Use longer curing time for a really long lasting polish.</li>
            <li> A bottle will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> My first sign that my coat is too thick is usually flooding of the cuticle but this polish doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li> Seriously; its ridiculous how many times I&#x27;ve bought a coral polish online only to receive a neon orange polish in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, which are the same as the other gel polishes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Since it is a darker color it takes a bit longer to dry.  </li>
            <li> In her LED lamp it would take one minute to dry and with her combination CCFL and LED lamp it takes about 1 minute and 40</li>
            <li> You pay less money for a bottle that is over 66% larger.  </li>
            <li> the gelish colors are a little different than pictures show..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it on for a few days</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have ever bought this color for myself, but my husband got me a Gelish kit for my birthday last month with a few colors that he picked off my wish list.  </li>
            <li> Color was as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a total mess and a rip off!</li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with the other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> Too bad we can&#x27;t return this stuff easily.  </li>
            <li> The picture makes is look a dark chocolate brown.</li>
            <li> I tend to stick with dark reds and purples, so it&#x27;s not a color</li>
            <li> The color is a Dark Brown metallic.</li>
            <li> It is dark brown with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...</li>
            <li> This is the dark, chocolatey, frosted color it looked like in the pic, and I can&#x27;t wait put it on</li>
            <li> My only issue with this gel is that it will wrinkle if your coat is too thick.</li>
            <li> (I would suggest that you try some other colors before this one though!)</li>
            <li> It is a dark brown with a slight shimmer in sunlight.</li>
            <li> I noted that the polish was leaking around the bottle cap, and I had to wipe up a mess each time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of shine and a little shimmer to it, also.</li>
            <li> then you dont know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced that with other Gelish colors or OPI polish.</li>
            <li> this is tooo thick</li>
            <li> but it makes your nail to thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got two other unfortunate color choices that ill never use.</li>
            <li> I used this with Shellac CND Base Coat, then two coats of this color</li>
            <li> but this bottle was BAD!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This polish is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the color!  Has shimmer to it.  Arrived in timely manner.</li>
            <li> Beautiful chocolate brown, looks great</li>
            <li> Great fast service.  Love the color and can&#x27;t wait to put it on my nails.  I have bought many Harmony Gelish polish and really like it.</li>
            <li> Great color for fall. The brown has a lot of gold and bronzy sparkle to it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting (in a good way).</li>
            <li> Nice color but doesn&#x27;t stay on the way a nail salons polish does</li>
            <li> I used this alone but it was not so impressive. Again using one coat of June Bride ( same with what I did with the Stand Out) made my nails look sexy.     My co-workers liked inspecting my nails with my Gelish nail polish on.     Tip: Use longer curing time for a really long lasting polish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color.  Its one of my favorites by Gelish.  This brown color is so beautiful and unlike any other.  It has a light gold shimmer to it depending on the lighting.... Its beautiful.  Love this color!</li>
            <li> The color shown does not do justice for this shade. The picture makes is look a dark chocolate brown. But up close it has just the right amount of shimmer. I also bought Gelish Bronzed and used it over the top of this Sweet Chocolate &amp; I looks amazing. I got so many compliments on it. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sweet Chocolate is a shimmery brown with hues of gold.  It is very pretty in person &amp; doesn&#x27;t look much like the swatch that they have shown.</li>
            <li> this is a rich chocolate color with a hint of gold shimmer in it. if you like more shimmer than what it has try bronzed over it looks great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color as a gift for a friend and I really want it for myself.  It is my new favorite color for fall.</li>
            <li> The polish is the color that was advertised.  I&#x27;m not dying to try it, but I will, someday.  The color is fine.</li>
            <li> When my manicurist used it on me, it wouldn&#x27;t cure at all.  Peels off very easily also.  Keep in mind my manicurist uses this brand often on me, usually just fine, but this one did not work.  Waist of money!</li>
            <li> Sweet chocolate !!! A real keeper.  A nice rich brown with a hint of gold sparkle.  A real hit with many gelish fans.</li>
            <li> I love gelish products. They have great colors and this is a great fall color. It is easy to apply and doesnt show messy streaks. must have.</li>
            <li> I love this yummy bronze color!  It&#x27;s neutral and warm, but not dull in any way.  Fantastic for fall and winter.  2 coats are all that is necessary.  I received a lot of compliments on this one.</li>
            <li> Color is not the deep chocolate I expected, however, its still a nice brown/goldish color with some shimmer...I had it on for a week and no chips at all...will purchase more of this brand...so worth the money :)</li>
            <li> Very few sites that sell Gelish products seems to have good pictures of them so I&#x27;d highly recommend doing a Google search to get a better idea what they look like before buying any colors. Having said that I love this color. It is a dark brown with a gold-ish shimmer in light. I&#x27;ve only had it on for a few days but it so far it has survived wearing gloves at work and doing home repairs.</li>

            <li> I love the color of this gel polish. It is a dark brown with a slight shimmer in sunlight. My only issue with this gel is that it will wrinkle if your coat is too thick. I have never experienced that with other Gelish colors or OPI polish. My first sign that my coat is too thick is usually flooding of the cuticle but this polish doesn&#x27;t really do that. It&#x27;s not a problem if you pay extra attention during application.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and shins very nicely. I have gotten numerous compliments on this nail polish. It definitely is a deep brown, and the more coats you add the darker it gets. Beware it is a little more runny than some of the other Gelish nail polishes (so a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> Love the Gelish product! This color is a deep brown color with a hint of sparkle in it. so pretty for fall. I recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li> I am currently wearing this colour and I love it. The colour has shimmer to it which seems to reflect gold and copper. The swatch is beautiful, but does not do justice to reflect the true colour, as almost all pictures tend to do. The colour reminds me of milk chocolate in person. The swatch seems to have a kind of purple hue to it. Sweet Chocolate is a gorgeous colour and is great for fall and winter, although I choose to use it now for Easter paired with Taupe Model to get a chocolately effect instead of the classic pastel colours. The two colours are just awesome together!!! Highly recommend! Great coverage with just two coats!!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It goes on smooth and looks great. It goes with anything. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17RKYLPT8QJFO]]My wife just loves Gelish polishes and she wears darker colors in the fall.  This is a beautiful dark chocolate color with a hint of silver sparkle in the polish.  It looks beautiful.  Since it is a darker color it takes a bit longer to dry.  In her LED lamp it would take one minute to dry and with her combination CCFL and LED lamp it takes about 1 minute and 40 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is a good price on Amazon as the local stores charge about $15 a bottle for a smaller bottle.  You pay less money for a bottle that is over 66% larger.  A bottle will last you a long time.  Since the polish has a silver sparker in it you should gently shake it to mix the sparkle up into the polish before you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife thinks that Gelish polishes are the best!</li>
            <li> My personal favorite.  It is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I like this chocolate color, it had gold flecks in it, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long and go on as smooth as other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> Love it the color is rich brown and i like it,soaks off easy stays on good,very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more</li>
            <li> The best color.  Winter, fall, spring, summer...it&#x27;s a winner.  I love this shade. It has a purple cast to it.  Compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this color after already buying some other colors (Gossip Girl, Hot Rod Red, Go Girl, June Bride...) from Gelish. This color is cool, but it was not what I was expecting. I saw it more brown than it really is, and darker too, but overall, it looks nice.  Now, the products from Gelish are amazing. I thought that only Shellac CND had these gel nail polishes, but when I found Gelish I decided to try them out. I used this with Shellac CND Base Coat, then two coats of this color and then another top coat from Shellac CND. I thought that you couldn&#x27;t mix these products, but I worked perfectly for me!  I hope you try it out! (I would suggest that you try some other colors before this one though!)</li>
            <li> I noted that the polish was leaking around the bottle cap, and I had to wipe up a mess each time I used it.  It appeared that this polish, which worked well when it was new, had changed in consistency with age and was now no longer setting properly and peeling off my nails in sheets, even though I followed all the steps correctly.  I did not have a problem with it when it was new. I love the color but would not purchase it again for this reason. I have not had a problem with the other Gelish colors. I&#x27;m wearing Never Too Grey right now and it&#x27;s a beautiful matte grey that stays put.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I tried three times with different foundation brands, but this one must have been old product; cracked and wrinkled badly and would chip off within minutes of top coat application. Great color, but this bottle was BAD!</li>
            <li> Brown nail polish may not sound very pretty, but this color is the bomb! A beautiful dark brown with gold and green shimmer.</li>
            <li> cool colour, wears well</li>
            <li> Very close to the sample color. Has a nice shimmering glitter inside the chocolate color.</li>
            <li> Color was as I expected.  I found that the first couple times I used it there were small chunks left on my nails.  I didn&#x27;t notice any the last time I used it, that&#x27;s why I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this color when I saw it online once &amp; I knew I had to have it. So captivating. Will post a pic soon once I have it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brown color and know how hard it is to tell for sure what you will get by the pictures. I ordered this color and not only did it arrive very quickly, packed very well, but I love the color! It&#x27;s a very nice color for Fall!</li>
            <li> I love this shade! It looks just like it does in the picture, and it really does remind me of sweet chocolate! I would definitely recommend this color of Gelish if you are looking for a good dark brown. It has a lot of shine and a little shimmer to it, also. Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> I have been using my own Gellish products for over a year and this is, by far, one of my favorite colors!  The chocolate is even prettier in person - it has small specks of sparkle that make it shimmer and is very beautiful on!  I did buy it in the summer, and it is definitely more of a fall/winter color, but I was so excited when I got it that I had to switch colors immediately.  I got so many compliments that I am buying some for my friends!</li>
            <li> This color also has a light shimmer to it also. the gelish colors are a little different than pictures show..this is a brown color with shimmer</li>
            <li> Way browner than the sample appears.... Too bad we can&#x27;t return this stuff easily.  I&#x27;ve got two other unfortunate color choices that ill never use. Maybe I can mix up something with the three of them?</li>
            <li> I really love this polish....the color is great and it came fast in the mail. I would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> The color is a Dark Brown metallic. Goes on nice and easy. Cures very well. Pleased with this product 100%!</li>
            <li> Just as described, deep, rich brown!  This is a great fall color!  And Harmony Gelish shellac is my fav brand to use!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color, I love it. Looks great with a single coat of the Bronzed color over it, or by itself. Went on opaque with only two coats, and looks terrific.</li>
            <li> This polish is terrible. It won&#x27;t harden like other gelish polish, and wipes off even after I cure the top coat. It&#x27;s a beautiful color, however it does not stay on like other gelish polish I have purchased.</li>
            <li> beautiful color! love, love, love!!! delivery in a timely manner..</li>
            <li> This is a great color! It is not a flat brown, but has a shimmer to it gives it a little bronzing in the light.</li>
            <li> Nice Color one of my favorites and it stays on until you take it off.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty however this color is very temperamental!! I have use a lot of Gelish polishes and this is the very first one I have had wrinkle up during curing time!! I had to take it off and start all over and anyone that has done gel polishes knows that is a lot of work!!! The second time I put a very very very thin coats and it turned out perfect!!</li>
            <li> I love this color, it is just so pretty, gorgeous warm brown with simmer.  It looks so nice in the sunlight. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> This color is just ok. I thought it would be more shimmery. It is dark brown with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be more brown in color. Like chocolate. I would say it is more mocha with a little bit of purple hue in it. Very frosted looking. It is a nice color but not what the color swatch shows. But as far as being a good product it is. I really like Gelish products the only thing is that the color swatches aren&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
            <li> This chocolate Color is one of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;A color of nature. This Color has&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s on feel of softness about it self.&lt;br /&gt;My friends will like it very much.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, which are the same as the other gel polishes I&#x27;ve used. This gel polish did not harden under the UV light. It was a total mess and a rip off! I will never purchase Harmony Gelish UV Soak off Gel Polish again. I&#x27;m sticking with IBD Gel Polish it does exactly what it;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> great color, not a full frosted polish...just a little shimmer.  deep color, applies and wears very well.  very sophisticated and a great &#x27;winter&#x27; color</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint about this product...I didn&#x27;t invent it. I love this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried gel polish then you dont know what you are missing. Perfect manicure and stays without chipping and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks and I am usually a pretty busy gal and my hands see a lot of action. The best!!</li>
            <li> this is tooo thick I ended up buying another band that is not so thick love the color but it makes your nail to thick</li>
            <li> Awsome color for fall and its a glittery browm I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the gelish nail color...the gelish seems to stay on even longer than 3 weeks and still looks good.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing. Works very vell in combination with other gelish polish. I put this on than a glitter gelish coat on top.</li>
            <li> love it  - beautiful rich color  - also used it with June Bride on top</li>
            <li> I love this color very much. The color you see in the pictures is what you get.  Its a true dark chocolate color.  I absolutely love it. Probably one of my favorites!  I received several compliments when I used this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with all of the Gelish polishes I&#x27;ve bought thus far; I feel they&#x27;re the only polishes I&#x27;ve gotten that were true to the advertised color.  Seriously; its ridiculous how many times I&#x27;ve bought a coral polish online only to receive a neon orange polish in the mail.  But I digress.  This is the dark, chocolatey, frosted color it looked like in the pic, and I can&#x27;t wait put it on so I can be reminded of chocolate every time I look at my fingernails.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and looks great.  I love the Harmony Gelish line!  They have so many wonderful colors to choose from, one to fit every mood and occasion!</li>
            <li> All five of the colors I ordered were delivered promptly, packaged well, and turned out great. Was nervous to order online because I&#x27;ve heard nightmares of people buying Gelish that didn&#x27;t cure right from online stores. Not the case here, the product is Salon quality as promised. Will DEFINITELY order again and again, thanks so much for the great deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- unless you have a salon card, the only place open to the public to purchase is Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply where they are $13.99 for only a 3rd of the size!! YOU CANT beat this price!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very modern, dark shade, one of the better Gelish colors.  I have since given up the UV Gel systems out of concern for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  I haven&#x27;t used this color yet but have used this polish before and very satisfied with it.</li>
