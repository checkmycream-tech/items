            <li>Truly the best WORKING product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best product hi ever used</li>
            <li>perfect bump solution</li>
            <li>because I know it is the best, besides the tea tree extract entrenched in this solution</li>
            <li>It was good for moisture</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>But this product is effective, and I did use it for years.</li>
            <li>The cream is so much more effective.</li>
            <li>I already have the cream the liquid ointment is more effective.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased the cream because they had run out of the liquid, and that was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.</li>
            <li>and they said that it cleared up many of their in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the cream.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the cream.</li>
            <li>I can bet if you use this product just once a day I would gladly pay you 100 US for each bump that you see on your face that you show me....</li>
            <li>so when i brought this item and with in a week of trying it out my bumps vanished and my neck was looking quite refreshing just putting it on twice a day and there after.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>-------Sincerely, Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I got this product at Wal-mart for a pretty good price thinking it would work.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I get razor bumps easily.</li>
            <li>product has kept my skin relatively smooth, for someone who uses his clippers every 3 or 4 days, and helps to minimize or get rid of razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Till now I am seeing full 100% results with this product from B&amp;C...</li>
            <li>I quickly had to recommend this product to friends and people who have been searching for solutions and boy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched guys to it as well, so it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re struggling.</li>
            <li>Works well, not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t often use a razor, only on special occasions, and rely on my hair clippers most of the time.</li>
            <li>and I apply it right after shaving and the bumps never even appear.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I ordered and it was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I guess I have pretty course hair because I get ingrowns around my bikini line.</li>
            <li>Its more of a \\&quot;good\\&quot; burn, where you know it is actually doing something.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how many bumps I would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I can only imagine how many bumps I would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many products for ethnic skin to relieve the problem, even visiting a dermatologist for different prescriptions, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Also the price is decent and has more than enough cream.</li>
            <li>This is not a creme and really a liquid that you apply via cotton balls.</li>
            <li>I was told by my barber to try this product and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>and then I will get bumps, but the cream is very helpful in getting rid of or minimizing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is how fast it eliminates razor bumps and still prevents it from occuring.</li>
            <li>But since I don&#x27;t have the money for that at this moment, this product really works and you can count on it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d need too much (legs, bikini) to apply it long-term to see how it really worked.</li>
            <li>Very upsetting.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a razor, lightly, after the clippers in order to clean up some spots, but I don&#x27;t shave my entire face or head with a razor on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I read several positive reviews, then quickly visited my beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the right product, and in the meantime, the ladies ointment formula is much less intense than the regular formula and much more effective on sensitive spots like your face and bikini area with a lot less irritation.</li>
            <li>Most of us are just not lucky enough to be able to use a razor regularly without consequences, so to say that this product doesn&#x27;t work is inaccurate.</li>
            <li>I most definitely have seen a big improvement.</li>
            <li>MY DERMATOLOGIST SAID SEND IT BACK RIGHT AWAY  </li>
            <li>With skin tight, you can see results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>product stings a tiny bit but nothing significant, and definitely nothing that would deter me from using this product.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it did relieve ingrowns, but maybe only slightly more than tea tree oil + any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My husband was prescribed antibiotics to handle the large amounts of razor bumps on the back portion of his head.  </li>
            <li>Hope that helps clear up some confusion.er me from using this product.</li>
            <li>Hope that helps clear up some confusion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that was clear when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to obtain a few sample packets.  </li>
            <li>Every product has limitations and only something very expensive would be able to deal with the plight that most people of color experience while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have resulted to using a straight edge razor which gives me less irritation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually notice a difference in the bumps when using this, though it was a lot less intense than the ointments.</li>

            <li> Skin Tight products are a bit pricey but less expensive than prescription products and give fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Found a recipe online thou to make your own, which does not smell as bad and cost less.</li>
            <li> I researched online for possible remedies and came across the site for B&amp;C Skin Tight.  </li>
            <li> i recently searched around amazon.com and found this product called SKIN TIGHT catchy name indeed.</li>
            <li> SURE IT WAS JUST BAD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who are curious, here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who are curious, here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled</li>
            <li> The skin on my chin, where all the hair is, after about a week of use, became so dry that my skin looked scaly with all the dead, dry skin on it.</li>
            <li> He try other product, but none of them work like this one.</li>
            <li> I was waking up every morning with my face itching due to the ingrown hairs, I use this thing and the bumps and itching stop.  </li>
            <li> The last few days I&#x27;ve been using Skin Tight in the morning and before bed</li>
            <li> For that matter, there are very few people who can use a razor regularly, without consequential razor bumps, no matter what product they use afterwards.</li>
            <li> I saw a bottle of b&amp;c skin tight on my uncle&#x27;s dresser and read the label carefully and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female who suffers from hairs on my chin.  </li>
            <li> SO NOT WORTH TE MONEY...</li>
            <li> The scent is awful, but the product is good</li>
            <li> main reason for writing this review is that I was about to reorder and saw some of the erroneous reviews written by other users.</li>
            <li> main reason for writing this review is that I was about to reorder and saw some of the erroneous reviews written by other users.</li>
            <li> and I end up spilling some about half the time.</li>
            <li> did think of one con for Skin Tight...</li>
            <li> B &amp; C Skin Tight</li>
            <li> When I get a little lax and don&#x27;t use the products for a few days, the bumps return.  </li>
            <li> and my skin does not seem to be dried out.</li>
            <li> and every time I applied it, it stung pretty bad.</li>
            <li> So whoever wrote the review about alcohol in the cream drying out their skin was obviously mistaken or had the wrong product.</li>
            <li> So whoever wrote the review about alcohol in the cream drying out their skin was obviously mistaken or had the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happenend</li>
            <li> For years, I plucked and shaved them, eventually developing serious ingrown hair bumps which are unsightly under make-up.  </li>
            <li> After 2 years suffering from these razor bumps under my neck i seriously thought about doing something about this..</li>
            <li> It is painful when you apply it, and it dries the skin out because of the alcohol in it, which will only worsen ingrown hairs!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if they sent me the wrong product or what happened.  </li>
            <li> It was abou $10 at Walmart, which seemed expensive, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the antibiotics did litte for him.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE SMELLS OF KEROSINE POSSIBLY TAMPERED WITH AS IT HAD NO SAFETY SEAL AND BURNED UPON APPLICATION</li>
            <li> If you have bad ingrowns hairs it might take up to 2 months to see results, but I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> IT STINKS!</li>
            <li> truly the pain is terrible..</li>

            <li> My husband purchase this product, he use it often , it does work the bumps not a problem for him now. He try other product, but none of them work like this one. I will purchase some for him myself. His problem is solve.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they sent me the wrong product or what happened.  This is not a creme and really a liquid that you apply via cotton balls.</li>
            <li> The scent is awful, but the product is good I most definitely have seen a big improvement. If you have bad ingrowns hairs it might take up to 2 months to see results, but I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I guess I have pretty course hair because I get ingrowns around my bikini line. This didn&#x27;t help me one bit.</li>
            <li> I was at WalMart looking for something to alleviate razor bumps and I saw this product. It was abou $10 at Walmart, which seemed expensive, but I bought it anyway. I was not disappointed! After using Skin Tight the first time, the bumps and irritation had noticably diminished after just a few hours. I applied it as directed a few times a day and the bumps were completely gone after just a couple of days. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I apply it right after shaving and the bumps never even appear. This stuff is like magic. It hasn&#x27;t caused me any pain at all and my skin does not seem to be dried out. The last few days I&#x27;ve been using Skin Tight in the morning and before bed and I stared using [[ASIN:B000ONZA58 Burn Gel]] once or twice in the afternoon. No bumps, no redness, no irritation at all! Try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did think of one con for Skin Tight... I don&#x27;t like the applicator. you have to squirt it onto a cotton ball and I end up spilling some about half the time. I&#x27;d rather it came in a roll on applicator.</li>
            <li> I never give reviews but I want to let anyone who in dealing with unsightly ingrown hairs that this is the product for u</li>
            <li> My husband was prescribed antibiotics to handle the large amounts of razor bumps on the back portion of his head.  Unfortunately the antibiotics did litte for him.  Only when he was recommended this product by a friend who had a similar condition did this work.  The product is exxcellent!!  The shipper also sent the product by the promised dates.</li>
            <li> I was told by my barber to try this product and it worked really well. I will continue to buy this when I need it. I would recommend it to anyone with the same skin problems.</li>
            <li> Clarification: This review is for the regular cream, not the extra strength. This Amazon listing is for the liquid not the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for quite some time. I actually purchased the cream because they had run out of the liquid, and that was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The cream is so much more effective. I even purchased it for a friend and they said that it cleared up many of their in-grown hairs. I used to use the liquid, which came in a 4 oz. bottle, but so much of it was wasted on the cotton balls. One bottle would only last me about two months. The liquid contained a lot of alcohol, which was used as a delivery system, and it did dry out my skin. The cream does not dry out your skin, and if anything, it slightly moisturizes it. I always apply the cream after I have shaved and washed the area, and it has worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often use a razor, only on special occasions, and rely on my hair clippers most of the time. Sometimes I use a razor, lightly, after the clippers in order to clean up some spots, but I don&#x27;t shave my entire face or head with a razor on a regular basis. For that matter, there are very few people who can use a razor regularly, without consequential razor bumps, no matter what product they use afterwards. Most of us are just not lucky enough to be able to use a razor regularly without consequences, so to say that this product doesn&#x27;t work is inaccurate. Every product has limitations and only something very expensive would be able to deal with the plight that most people of color experience while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has kept my skin relatively smooth, for someone who uses his clippers every 3 or 4 days, and helps to minimize or get rid of razor bumps. Every now and then I will get bumps, but the cream is very helpful in getting rid of or minimizing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product stings a tiny bit but nothing significant, and definitely nothing that would deter me from using this product. Its more of a \\&quot;good\\&quot; burn, where you know it is actually doing something. I can only imagine how many bumps I would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are curious, here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;Acetylsalicylic acid&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl stearate&lt;br /&gt;PEG 100 stearate&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitan stearate&lt;br /&gt;Emulsifying wax NF&lt;br /&gt;Cetereth 20&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;Myristyl myristate&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A&lt;br /&gt;DL panthenol&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Dioazolidinyl urea&lt;br /&gt;Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethyl cellulose&lt;br /&gt;Allantoin&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only alcohol here is DL Panthenol which is actually used as a moisturizer and treating sunburn or tattoos. So whoever wrote the review about alcohol in the cream drying out their skin was obviously mistaken or had the wrong product. I will never use the liquid again but I LOVE the cream. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANYONE WHO HAS AN ASPIRIN ALLERGY (acetylsalicylic acid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for writing this review is that I was about to reorder and saw some of the erroneous reviews written by other users. BTW, this jar has lasted me over a year. I don&#x27;t think that you can actually get the extra strength cream on here, but the regular strength cream is doing the job. Just stay away from the liquid. Hope that helps clear up some confusion.er me from using this product. Its more of a \\&quot;good\\&quot; burn, where you know it is actually doing something. I can only imagine how many bumps I would have had, had I not been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are curious, here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Distilled water&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil&lt;br /&gt;Acetylsalicylic acid&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl stearate&lt;br /&gt;PEG 100 stearate&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitan stearate&lt;br /&gt;Emulsifying wax NF&lt;br /&gt;Cetereth 20&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;Myristyl myristate&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A&lt;br /&gt;DL panthenol&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Dioazolidinyl urea&lt;br /&gt;Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethyl cellulose&lt;br /&gt;Allantoin&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only alcohol here is DL Panthenol which is actually used as a moisturizer and treating sunburn or tattoos. So whoever wrote the review about alcohol in the cream drying out their skin was obviously mistaken or had the wrong product. I will never use the liquid again but I LOVE the cream.

            <li> This is exactly what I ordered and it was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For years I have been trying all types of home remedies and different razor bump products.One day while on a vacation at my uncles house I saw a bottle of b&amp;c skin tight on my uncle&#x27;s dresser and read the label carefully and decided to try it out.I applied it once the same day and in the morning I realised that my razor bumps were starting to diminish so I applied again the same day and the next morning ALL were gone!What amazes me about this product is how fast it eliminates razor bumps and still prevents it from occuring.A couple of days after I searched for it on amazon.com and purchased a tube immidiately.Till now I am seeing full 100% results with this product from B&amp;C...I can bet if you use this product just once a day I would gladly pay you 100 US for each bump that you see on your face that you show me....Truly the best WORKING product that I have ever used.Just try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> I was waking up every morning with my face itching due to the ingrown hairs, I use this thing and the bumps and itching stop.  Still the ingrown hair is there, but for the itching part and the bumps this would definitely help. Still I would do my laser hair removal... But since I don&#x27;t have the money for that at this moment, this product really works and you can count on it.</li>
            <li> I got this product at Wal-mart for a pretty good price thinking it would work. It didn&#x27;t and every time I applied it, it stung pretty bad. I&#x27;m African American and had a problem with ingrown hairs and razor bumps. I&#x27;d try something else like Barcs or something</li>
            <li> I am an African American female who suffers from hairs on my chin.  For years, I plucked and shaved them, eventually developing serious ingrown hair bumps which are unsightly under make-up.  I tried many products for ethnic skin to relieve the problem, even visiting a dermatologist for different prescriptions, but nothing worked.  I researched online for possible remedies and came across the site for B&amp;C Skin Tight.  I read several positive reviews, then quickly visited my beauty supply store.  I was fortunate to obtain a few sample packets.  I tried it and had almost immediate improvement!  Within a week, the bumps virtually disappeared!  I now use the Razor &amp; Bump Astringent in the morning and the Ingrown Hair &amp; Razor Bump Creme at night.  The website says not to be used with the astringent but I&#x27;ve had no problems.  In fact, the creme moisturizes because the astringent can be somewhat drying to the skin.  When I get a little lax and don&#x27;t use the products for a few days, the bumps return.  Skin Tight products are a bit pricey but less expensive than prescription products and give fantastic results!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually notice a difference in the bumps when using this, though it was a lot less intense than the ointments. My skin is already dry so I was hoping this would do the trick and help me avoid flaky skin. I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the right product, and in the meantime, the ladies ointment formula is much less intense than the regular formula and much more effective on sensitive spots like your face and bikini area with a lot less irritation. I&#x27;ve switched guys to it as well, so it&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re struggling.</li>
            <li> After 2 years suffering from these razor bumps under my neck i seriously thought about doing something about this.. it irritates my skin every time i shave and truly the pain is terrible.. i recently searched around amazon.com and found this product called SKIN TIGHT catchy name indeed. so when i brought this item and with in a week of trying it out my bumps vanished and my neck was looking quite refreshing just putting it on twice a day and there after. I quickly had to recommend this product to friends and people who have been searching for solutions and boy is this the one!</li>
            <li> It is definitely NOT non-comedogenic! I broke out with tiny pimples! My son will be home from college soon and I will see if he likes it. If so he can have it, if not it goes in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I wanted the cream and I got a liquid treatment instead.  Not sure what happenend but I have sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the best product hi ever used</li>
            <li> Love this product. I always get ingrown hairs and razor bumps but this virtually eliminates them. I use to find it in the stores but  not anymore.</li>
            <li> perfect bump solution</li>
            <li> Has saved me lots of pain and skin turmoil. Works overnight</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will. If you use it on a regular basis you will not experience razor bumps again. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product!  It is painful when you apply it, and it dries the skin out because of the alcohol in it, which will only worsen ingrown hairs!  The skin on my chin, where all the hair is, after about a week of use, became so dry that my skin looked scaly with all the dead, dry skin on it.</li>
            <li> I get razor bumps easily. I have resulted to using a straight edge razor which gives me less irritation. When I am in a rush I use an elected razor which causes me irritation. With skin tight, you can see results pretty quickly. The bumps go away and leaves you with a smoother shave and smoother skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works exceedingly well when used properly. I continue to purchase B &amp; C Skin Tight because I know it is the best, besides the tea tree extract entrenched in this solution helps soothes my skin!         -------Sincerely, Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> IT STINKS! Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s too expensive and I&#x27;d need too much (legs, bikini) to apply it long-term to see how it really worked. It was good for moisture and I feel like it did relieve ingrowns, but maybe only slightly more than tea tree oil + any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE SMELLS OF KEROSINE POSSIBLY TAMPERED WITH AS IT HAD NO SAFETY SEAL AND BURNED UPON APPLICATION NO KNOWN ALLERGIES SO IM SURE IT WAS JUST BAD PRODUCT. MY DERMATOLOGIST SAID SEND IT BACK RIGHT AWAY  AS IT LEFT PUSTULES ON MY SKIN WERE IT WAS USED , DO NOT BUY SO NOT WORTH TE MONEY...</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinkung it was the liquid. I got the cream version. Very upsetting. I already have the cream the liquid ointment is more effective.</li>
            <li> Works well, not crazy about the smell. Found a recipe online thou to make your own, which does not smell as bad and cost less. But this product is effective, and I did use it for years.</li>
            <li> On the bottom of the bottle, it says known to cause birth defects. I don&#x27;t think that was clear when I bought it.</li>
            <li> What i wanted and it works. I recommend this product to anyone. Also the price is decent and has more than enough cream.</li>
