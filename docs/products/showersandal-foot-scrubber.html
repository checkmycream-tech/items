            <li>I was so happy to use this foot scrubber.  </li>
            <li>The sandal itself feels great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all about enjoying the wonderful massage that it provides.     </li>
            <li>What a handy product!</li>
            <li>Good concept, but needs some refinement.</li>
            <li>After a good scrubbing in the shower, and drying the feet and walking about barefoot, the feet feel like they can breathe.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>My feet get a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Works well to give my feet a good, sudsy scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>The Avivo product was a bit pricey, but it looked like a good solution to my problem.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Product came exactly as pictured and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, sticks to the floor nicely and the bristles perfect.</li>
            <li>as a handy capped lady these pleased me 100%, now if you could come up with a electrc bottle opener I would be on top of world,</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>The upper plastic part serves as a perfect drying rest.    </li>
            <li>and I am sure it will help with the day-to-day comfort of my mother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got</li>
            <li>My feet never felt better.  </li>
            <li>I have size 12 feet and while scrubbing, I bang the top of my foot on the crossover.</li>
            <li>This sandal is better than washing my feet without it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I say more?)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Then I bought the shower sandal and that is so much better and easier.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s able to exfoliate the tops and bottoms on his feet in while in the shower without putting himself in a precarious position.</li>
            <li>The band over the top and the generous suction cups underneath helps keep the foot snugly in place.</li>
            <li>Well, this scrubber takes care of making sure your feet are soap, shampoo, conditioner and shaving foam-free.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the as seen on TV version.</li>
            <li>Ticklish and tingly your feet get cleaned from the top to the bottom.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning the feet, and gives a good \\&quot;massage\\&quot; at the same time.</li>
            <li>but I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right soft/hardness to do a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>This is not the product I was originally looking for, however its amazing</li>
            <li>For those who need to sit down when taking a shower and love a good foot massage, this will be a great gift too.</li>
            <li>Clean feet should be the law!</li>
            <li>This footscrubber was great - its suction cups keeps it pretty secure and makes it easy to clean your feet.</li>
            <li>If you use this there and your feet are a bit tender, wearing socks may help your feet feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The bristles do a good scrubbing job but are soft enough to feel very pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that the sandal is an excellent product</li>
            <li>After walking around barefoot most of the summer I needed something to help clean my feet in the shower.</li>
            <li>and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so well it take a strong pull to remove it.</li>
            <li>But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.    </li>
            <li>Very useful for my Mother who can&#x27;t lean to reach her feet</li>
            <li>In addition to feeling clean and well-scrubbed, it is also a great sole massage.</li>
            <li>At first I was reluctant to pay more for this one</li>
            <li>It slips when you put your foot in and try to clean.  </li>
            <li>My feet are clean.</li>
            <li>This is okay, and better then nothing, but too soft to feel good enough to do the job for me.  </li>
            <li>Unless the shower/bath has exotic tiling that will not allow any adherence, I found the suction cups to work very well.</li>
            <li>The sole is contoured to the feet, and top of feet bristles help clean top of toe nails.  </li>
            <li>works pretty good , feels great in tired sore feet , bristles could be a bit stiffer though .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will probably order more for family and friends.</li>
            <li>Any positive reviews on this cheap junk must come from their sales guys.  </li>
            <li>I could not bend but very much wanted to clean my feet</li>
            <li>DO NOT get carried away the first time!</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the heavily advertised version.  </li>
            <li>A great idea that needs a few improvements.</li>
            <li>It is  an effective foot massager placed on the floor next to a chair.</li>
            <li>I thought this would neither stick nor be heavy enough to give me a good scrub, but it succeeds on both counts.</li>
            <li>It is very large so it fits my wide,long feet.</li>
            <li>As I got older I could no longer reach my feet and they were never getting really clean.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recall if I&#x27;ve read this suggestion; but after each use, it&#x27;s best to leave it to dry with the bristles facing down.</li>
            <li>If they could make one in a larger size &amp; find a way to make it stick better, I would give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>this one is way better than the last one my brother bought!</li>
            <li>This scrubber came apart the first time used.  </li>
            <li>I AM PLEASED WITH THE DEVICE, HOWEVER, THEY NEED TO MAKE A LONGER MODEL FOR BIGGER FEET AND LARGER SUCTION CUPS FOR BETTER PURCHASE ON THE TUB.</li>
            <li>First the bar that holds the top bristles is too narrow and you can easily bash the sides of your foot on it.</li>
            <li>This would be great for anyone recovering from an injury, folks with low back problems, or an older person who still showers but cant bend over.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and you can clean every part of your foot.</li>
            <li>It is pure pleasure to use the sandal in the shower.</li>
            <li>The Footscrubber arrived in a very timely manner; and, with proper packaging (that&#x27;s always important to me).    </li>
            <li>I think some customers may have had problems with slippage because of placing too much pressure on the pad -</li>
            <li>But when I opened the package I was relieved to see that it is made well and of very sturdy material.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to be very well made</li>
            <li>Scrubs my feet very well.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bathtub very well.</li>
            <li>But doubt that it will wear out for it is very well made.</li>
            <li>This thing really works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a Million Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, study, grips well to the bath and feel divine.</li>
            <li>It will only adhere to completely smooth surfaces, so if you have any texture to your shower</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>It really works well when you can&#x27;t bend to reach your feet.</li>
            <li>I am back here, ordering two more - one for my 10 year old daughter and one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>very good, but the bristles on the bottom of foot a little to stiff.</li>
            <li>The scrubber could be about an inch longer to accommodate larger foot sizes and finally the heel area should have longer bristles to enable it to reach the heel area better.</li>
            <li>The suction cups work well and hold it steady.</li>
            <li>thought the price was high for what you get.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Hand rails are highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I know my feet are clean and helps with the dry skin you can sometimes get in the winter.</li>
            <li>I use old, leftover soap that I melt in hot water &amp; put in old shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li>For people out there who can&#x27;t wash their feet the normal way this is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and still like new.</li>
            <li>However, if you have very sensitive feet, this is probably the one you want.</li>
            <li>The Avivo Shower Sandal Foot-scrubber is made of strong flexible plastic that I think will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Oh wow!</li>
            <li>The suction on the shoe only works on a smooth flat tub or shower.  </li>
            <li>this is for the shower it makes a shower better this way an even for the home no more stinky feet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real pain to keep clean, even with rinsing after a shower a soap film accumlates and is real hard to clean without soaking in vinegar</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it far enough away from the tub wall or prepare to get into the fetal position due to slamming your toes.</li>
            <li>Also, you need to take extra care when you use it with the recommended liquid soap because your feet will be VERY slippery until you get them rinsed.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 90 year old father so he could wash his feet because he cannot bend over in the shower.  </li>
            <li>So far this footscrubber fits the bill.</li>
            <li>The only problem with using  is that it doesn&#x27;t really cling to the bottom of my shower as I expected it to do, buy I&#x27;m able to use it by holing it still with one foot as I move my other foot through it (a bit tricky here if one has balance problems).</li>
            <li>well this little object, while pricey, allowed me to clean my feet and regain some dignity.</li>
            <li>Long bristles are more convenient to scrub feet than other forms, such as plastic extrusions.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had a built in soap trough across the top strap in the center that would hold the soap and let it run onto your foot through holes in the bottom, I think you will use less soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that has a physical limitation, or anyone in general for that matter.  </li>
            <li>The upper bristles are softer than expected but for long term use, it is fine.</li>
            <li>No more having to try and reach in a shower to clean my feet with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It was a little spendy but after using it I say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I do hit my toes on the sides if I am not careful.</li>
            <li>More expensive up front, but no dishonest misrepresentation or deception.  </li>
            <li>(small request, right?)</li>

            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bathtub very well.</li>
            <li> But doubt that it will wear out for it is very well made.</li>
            <li> This thing really works.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a Million Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, study, grips well to the bath and feel divine.</li>
            <li> It will only adhere to completely smooth surfaces, so if you have any texture to your shower</li>
            <li> It really does the job.</li>
            <li> It really works well when you can&#x27;t bend to reach your feet.</li>
            <li> I am back here, ordering two more - one for my 10 year old daughter and one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> very good, but the bristles on the bottom of foot a little to stiff.</li>
            <li> The scrubber could be about an inch longer to accommodate larger foot sizes and finally the heel area should have longer bristles to enable it to reach the heel area better.</li>
            <li> The suction cups work well and hold it steady.</li>
            <li> thought the price was high for what you get.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hand rails are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I know my feet are clean and helps with the dry skin you can sometimes get in the winter.</li>
            <li> I use old, leftover soap that I melt in hot water &amp; put in old shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li> For people out there who can&#x27;t wash their feet the normal way this is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and still like new.</li>
            <li> However, if you have very sensitive feet, this is probably the one you want.</li>
            <li> The Avivo Shower Sandal Foot-scrubber is made of strong flexible plastic that I think will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Oh wow!</li>
            <li> The suction on the shoe only works on a smooth flat tub or shower.  </li>
            <li> this is for the shower it makes a shower better this way an even for the home no more stinky feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real pain to keep clean, even with rinsing after a shower a soap film accumlates and is real hard to clean without soaking in vinegar</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it far enough away from the tub wall or prepare to get into the fetal position due to slamming your toes.</li>
            <li> Also, you need to take extra care when you use it with the recommended liquid soap because your feet will be VERY slippery until you get them rinsed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 90 year old father so he could wash his feet because he cannot bend over in the shower.  </li>
            <li> So far this footscrubber fits the bill.</li>
            <li> The only problem with using  is that it doesn&#x27;t really cling to the bottom of my shower as I expected it to do, buy I&#x27;m able to use it by holing it still with one foot as I move my other foot through it (a bit tricky here if one has balance problems).</li>
            <li> well this little object, while pricey, allowed me to clean my feet and regain some dignity.</li>
            <li> Long bristles are more convenient to scrub feet than other forms, such as plastic extrusions.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had a built in soap trough across the top strap in the center that would hold the soap and let it run onto your foot through holes in the bottom, I think you will use less soap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that has a physical limitation, or anyone in general for that matter.  </li>
            <li> The upper bristles are softer than expected but for long term use, it is fine.</li>
            <li> No more having to try and reach in a shower to clean my feet with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> It was a little spendy but after using it I say it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I do hit my toes on the sides if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> More expensive up front, but no dishonest misrepresentation or deception.  </li>
            <li> (small request, right?)</li>
            <li> the price was high, I found it at retail store for half of what I pay....</li>
            <li> It helps so much with cleaning my feet as my shower stall is small.  </li>
            <li> Quality design, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Three of us have been using it for four months everyday and it has become a shower accessory we can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> We looked at the other less expensive alternatives but decided to get this one and very glad we did.</li>
            <li> Not to big on the pink color they sent me, but its a nifty product.</li>
            <li> I just put it down in the bathtub, put a little bit of liquid soap on it, and then I move each foot back and forth on the soft bristles and presto!</li>
            <li> It does need to be hung up to dry and wish it had a hole to attach a hook though so it could dry easier on the shower wall.</li>
            <li> Does the job for people with limited mobility.  </li>
            <li> I have to hold it down for him to actually use it because my bathtub is textured.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still keeping it because I need it due to a knee injury, but in order to use it, I have to jam it into the corner of the shower and hold the back with my other foot while I use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful when sliding your foot in &amp; out on it</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was worried reading other reviews that the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t hold in my shower, but my tiles are bigger and they hold tight.  </li>
            <li> The only minus point is that suction cups are small and do not stick to non slip tile shower floor</li>
            <li> It will not stick to the shower floor and you have to hold it with your other foot in order to use it.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other review.</li>
            <li> especially the fact that it was hard to do without it.</li>
            <li> It sticks immediately to my tile shower floor as I press down.</li>
            <li> Have you noticed that sometimes when soaps run down your legs that the detergent stays on your feet when you get out of the shower?</li>
            <li> With the water running, place or drop the brush where you want it, step one foot into the brush, press down firmly</li>
            <li> If you or someone you know also happens to be a grizzled cop with the build of an Alaskan lumberjack who has trouble washing their feet and is difficult to shop for, I highly recommend ordering the Avivo Shower Sandal.</li>
            <li> but it does hurt a little.</li>
            <li> I also like the little pumice stone at the heal.</li>
            <li> Squirt a  little body wash on it and wash your feet no hands.  </li>
            <li> but it was awkward to use and took too much time.</li>
            <li> I am partially disabled, so washing my feet was always a bit of a problem.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy but not so stiff that they would scratch your feet.</li>
            <li> I have a size 14 shoe so its a little small to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Avivo Shower Sandal Footscrubber for my father, a six foot three burly cop who is generally impossible to buy for, and he absolutely loves this product as he no longer has to struggle in a cramped shower space to scrub the bottom of his feet.</li>
            <li> The suction cups on the bottom are to small</li>
            <li> Well I am not sure how to rate this item because I have not recieved it as of yet.  </li>
            <li> [I had tried the cheaper one from the TV ad and was not pleased.]</li>
            <li> The shoe doesn&#x27;t stick to the floor or wall, so it is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Suctions to the shower floor, but not so hard it can&#x27;t be pulled off.  </li>
            <li> I place the shoe where i want it and step hard.  </li>
            <li> the negative side, it won&#x27;t stay stuck to the floor of the tub (as others have also noted).  </li>
            <li> Lots of hype over the TV-advertised foot scrubber, but reviews blast the company as being remarkably dishonest.  </li>
            <li> I had hip replacement surgery and was unable to bend down for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Works well for me since I have a bad back.</li>
            <li> Whenever my back went bad, I used a foot washer with a sponge and brush at the end of it to wash my feet</li>
            <li> Arthritic back makes it painful to bend over to reach my feet.  </li>
            <li> very hard on your feet, scratches...</li>
            <li> Another product has poor reviews because it may slip when in use... ??</li>
            <li> I was nervous that it would be flimsy or poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken the skin</li>
            <li> Alot sturdier than the rickitty thin one sold on tv.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a little painful to ram the side of it between your toes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product as a Christmas gift for my mom.  </li>
            <li> I have size 13 feet and have had some painful incidents if i scrub too vigorously.</li>
            <li> I fell and tore my quad tendon and the recovery was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The shoe doesn&#x27;t stick to the floor or wall, so it is hard to use. Good concept, but needs some refinement.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! Three of us have been using it for four months everyday and it has become a shower accessory we can&#x27;t live without. It&#x27;s well made and still like new. Don&#x27;t hesitate...buy this thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always so pleasant to write a postive review!    The Footscrubber arrived in a very timely manner; and, with proper packaging (that&#x27;s always important to me).    Unless the shower/bath has exotic tiling that will not allow any adherence, I found the suction cups to work very well. I think some customers may have had problems with slippage because of placing too much pressure on the pad - it&#x27;s all about enjoying the wonderful massage that it provides.     Can&#x27;t recall if I&#x27;ve read this suggestion; but after each use, it&#x27;s best to leave it to dry with the bristles facing down. The upper plastic part serves as a perfect drying rest.    I highly recommend this product and will probably order more for family and friends.</li>
            <li> Very useful for my Mother who can&#x27;t lean to reach her feet</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as pictured and works perfectly.  Received on time.</li>
            <li> makes washing feet easier</li>
            <li> Wow! It is addictive. DO NOT get carried away the first time! The skin on the tops of my feet hurt the next day. With the water running, place or drop the brush where you want it, step one foot into the brush, press down firmly and it will stay in place. Another product has poor reviews because it may slip when in use... ?? WTH??</li>
            <li> If you have any type of \\&quot;texture\\&quot; on the floor or your shower or tub (non-slip surface), this will not stick!  I&#x27;m still keeping it because I need it due to a knee injury, but in order to use it, I have to jam it into the corner of the shower and hold the back with my other foot while I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was high for what you get.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Avivo Shower Sandal Footscrubber for my father, a six foot three burly cop who is generally impossible to buy for, and he absolutely loves this product as he no longer has to struggle in a cramped shower space to scrub the bottom of his feet. If you or someone you know also happens to be a grizzled cop with the build of an Alaskan lumberjack who has trouble washing their feet and is difficult to shop for, I highly recommend ordering the Avivo Shower Sandal. If this hasn&#x27;t convinced you to buy this product, I don&#x27;t know what will.</li>
            <li> The product has only one flaw.  It slips when you put your foot in and try to clean.  It will not stick to the shower floor and you have to hold it with your other foot in order to use it.  The suction cups on the bottom are to small and I think that is the reason they want stick.  Other than that the sandal is an excellent product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product as a Christmas gift for my mom.  I was nervous that it would be flimsy or poorly made.  But when I opened the package I was relieved to see that it is made well and of very sturdy material.  I was happy to give it as a gift and I am sure it will help with the day-to-day comfort of my mother.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves this for cleanning her feet</li>
            <li> What a handy product! Just be careful when sliding your foot in &amp; out on it - it&#x27;s a little painful to ram the side of it between your toes. No fault of the product, just operators error.</li>
            <li> I am using it every day!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these on the recommendation of my girlfriend although hers may be of a different manufacturer.  This one seems to be very well made and I don&#x27;t see it falling apart any time soon.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, it won&#x27;t stay stuck to the floor of the tub (as others have also noted).  Also, you need to take extra care when you use it with the recommended liquid soap because your feet will be VERY slippery until you get them rinsed.  Hand rails are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Item aappears to be well made. The bristles are sturdy but not so stiff that they would scratch your feet.</li>
            <li> Lots of hype over the TV-advertised foot scrubber, but reviews blast the company as being remarkably dishonest.  This is a great alternative to the heavily advertised version.  More expensive up front, but no dishonest misrepresentation or deception.  Works great.  My feet never felt better.  Arthritic back makes it painful to bend over to reach my feet.  Using this, I don&#x27;t need to bend over.  Scrubs my feet very well.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot care product I have ever bought for myself. It is pure pleasure to use the sandal in the shower. It sticks immediately to my tile shower floor as I press down. The bristles do a good scrubbing job but are soft enough to feel very pleasant on the skin. I don&#x27;t want to stop! In addition to feeling clean and well-scrubbed, it is also a great sole massage. I am back here, ordering two more - one for my 10 year old daughter and one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other review. This is a great idea. But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.    This brush is obviously not designed for a grown man&#x27;s feet. I have size 12 feet and while scrubbing, I bang the top of my foot on the crossover. I haven&#x27;t broken the skin but it does hurt a little. Also it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bathtub very well. So the brush tends to move around when you&#x27;re scrubbing. You need to use a liquid soap. No way for bar soap to work. I use old, leftover soap that I melt in hot water &amp; put in old shampoo bottles. You could use liquid body wash. But why?      If they could make one in a larger size &amp; find a way to make it stick better, I would give this 5 stars. But it does the job well enough as is.</li>
            <li> This sandal is better than washing my feet without it. I&#x27;m in my mid 70s and have spinal arthritis which keeps me from reaching my feet with my hands. The only problem with using  is that it doesn&#x27;t really cling to the bottom of my shower as I expected it to do, buy I&#x27;m able to use it by holing it still with one foot as I move my other foot through it (a bit tricky here if one has balance problems).</li>
            <li> This is not the product I was originally looking for, however its amazing and I love it. No more having to try and reach in a shower to clean my feet with a wash cloth. I know my feet are clean and helps with the dry skin you can sometimes get in the winter.</li>
            <li> Pondered ordering this, as a friend had one similar in looks. They bought it at the dollar store(need I say more?) It was a little spendy but after using it I say it&#x27;s worth the money. Have been having issues with arthritic knees and couldn&#x27;t bend anymore in the shower. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. One day was scanning Amazon,which I must say meets all my needs, when I came across the foot scrubber. Oh wow! When it arrived I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I am very satisfied. Has lots of suction cups on the bottom. It is very large so it fits my wide,long feet. The bristles are soft and you can clean every part of your foot. I ordered  shower grabbers for it as I could see that people who have balance issues wiould need something for support while using it. I needed some anyway as my arthritis prevents me from getting in and out of the shower without something for support. For people out there who can&#x27;t wash their feet the normal way this is a lifesaver. If it ever wears out I will definetly replace it. But doubt that it will wear out for it is very well made.</li>
            <li> Well I am not sure how to rate this item because I have not recieved it as of yet.  It shows i purchased it on 8-13-2011 and today is 10-5-2011.</li>
            <li> Works well for me since I have a bad back.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for me and seems to improve my circulation.</li>
            <li> Not to big on the pink color they sent me, but its a nifty product. Just make sure you use it far enough away from the tub wall or prepare to get into the fetal position due to slamming your toes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It helps so much with cleaning my feet as my shower stall is small.  I do hit my toes on the sides if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> this one is way better than the last one my brother bought!</li>
            <li> Whenever my back went bad, I used a foot washer with a sponge and brush at the end of it to wash my feet but it was awkward to use and took too much time. Then I bought the shower sandal and that is so much better and easier. I just put it down in the bathtub, put a little bit of liquid soap on it, and then I move each foot back and forth on the soft bristles and presto! My feet are clean. Great product!</li>
            <li> I had hip replacement surgery and was unable to bend down for quite some time.  This footscrubber was great - its suction cups keeps it pretty secure and makes it easy to clean your feet.</li>
            <li> will not stick to the shower,,i almost  triped a couple of times using it</li>
            <li> as a handy capped lady these pleased me 100%, now if you could come up with a electrc bottle opener I would be on top of world,</li>
            <li> Does the job for people with limited mobility.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I fell and tore my quad tendon and the recovery was awful. I could not bend but very much wanted to clean my feet (small request, right?) well this little object, while pricey, allowed me to clean my feet and regain some dignity. This would be great for anyone recovering from an injury, folks with low back problems, or an older person who still showers but cant bend over. Clean feet should be the law!</li>
            <li> My father is in his mid-70s and he adores this tool. It suction-cups to the tub floor and he&#x27;s able to exfoliate the tops and bottoms on his feet in while in the shower without putting himself in a precarious position.</li>
            <li> This thing really works.  As I got older I could no longer reach my feet and they were never getting really clean.  With this device that is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> We looked at the other less expensive alternatives but decided to get this one and very glad we did. Works very well, sticks to the floor nicely and the bristles perfect.</li>
            <li> This foot scrubber is  a \\&quot;Five Toe\\&quot; in and out of our shower, so we gave it Five Stars. Here&#x27;s why.  It is amphibious-like because we use it in and outside of the shower. It is  an effective foot massager placed on the floor next to a chair. If you use this there and your feet are a bit tender, wearing socks may help your feet feel more comfortable. Overall the bristles are bendable enough to soothingly  brush over the tickly nerves on the feet. The band over the top and the generous suction cups underneath helps keep the foot snugly in place. Have you noticed that sometimes when soaps run down your legs that the detergent stays on your feet when you get out of the shower? Well, this scrubber takes care of making sure your feet are soap, shampoo, conditioner and shaving foam-free.  After a good scrubbing in the shower, and drying the feet and walking about barefoot, the feet feel like they can breathe. Definitely, this product is recommended for everyone, and especially for anyone that needs help reaching their feet. For those who need to sit down when taking a shower and love a good foot massage, this will be a great gift too.</li>
            <li> Alot sturdier than the rickitty thin one sold on tv.  My son loves this one.  Thanks a Million Amazon you are The Greatest!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Stays on the shower floor while you scrub away. Well built I think it will last for years. Way better than the as seen on TV version.</li>
            <li> A great idea that needs a few improvements. First the bar that holds the top bristles is too narrow and you can easily bash the sides of your foot on it. I have size 13 feet and have had some painful incidents if i scrub too vigorously. The scrubber could be about an inch longer to accommodate larger foot sizes and finally the heel area should have longer bristles to enable it to reach the heel area better. If these modifications are incorporated this would be a five star product. As to the scrubber sticking to the shower or tub floor i have had zero issues in fact its sticks so well it take a strong pull to remove it. Perhaps it has been modified since some of the reviewes that had this issue?</li>
            <li> I thought this would neither stick nor be heavy enough to give me a good scrub, but it succeeds on both counts. WOuld definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought this footscrubber for my husband.  It works great.  Suctions to the shower floor, but not so hard it can&#x27;t be pulled off.  He loves the ability to put foot soap on the scrubber and doesn&#x27;t have to struggle with balance issues while washing his feet.  It&#x27;s a life saver.  It does need to be hung up to dry and wish it had a hole to attach a hook though so it could dry easier on the shower wall.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my husband who can&#x27;t bend or reach his feet.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  I have a size 14 shoe so its a little small to use.</li>
            <li> very good, but the bristles on the bottom of foot a little to stiff.</li>
            <li> works well but I wish the bristles were a bit stiffer, the side of the feet could feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is okay, and better then nothing, but too soft to feel good enough to do the job for me.  However, if you have very sensitive feet, this is probably the one you want.</li>
            <li> Long bristles are more convenient to scrub feet than other forms, such as plastic extrusions.  The sole is contoured to the feet, and top of feet bristles help clean top of toe nails.  The only minus point is that suction cups are small and do not stick to non slip tile shower floor</li>
            <li> I was between this and a cheaper model but decided on this one and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s very well made, study, grips well to the bath and feel divine. Ticklish and tingly your feet get cleaned from the top to the bottom. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m arthritic and this footscrubber cleans between my toes as well as the side, bottom and heels of my feet all while in my shower seat.</li>
            <li> I loved it. My job in cleaning between my toes is great especially the fact that it was hard to do without it. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> works pretty good , feels great in tired sore feet , bristles could be a bit stiffer though .</li>
            <li> Others have commented that the shoe does not stay in place.  My shower floor is 4x4 tiles.  I place the shoe where i want it and step hard.  It sticks solid for use.  After use,  ⒾI pick it up with my foot and slide it into the corner.  My feet get a good scrubbing. It works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 90 year old father so he could wash his feet because he cannot bend over in the shower.  The suction on the shoe only works on a smooth flat tub or shower.  I have to hold it down for him to actually use it because my bathtub is textured.  Otherwise, these is a great item and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well to give my feet a good, sudsy scrubbing.  Quality design, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> After walking around barefoot most of the summer I needed something to help clean my feet in the shower. So far this footscrubber fits the bill. It adheres well to the surface &amp; it doesn&#x27;t slip when I am using it. The bristles are just the right soft/hardness to do a fairly good job. I also like the little pumice stone at the heal.</li>
            <li> very hard on your feet, scratches...</li>
            <li> This think tickles your feet like the dickens. It will only adhere to completely smooth surfaces, so if you have any texture to your shower do not order this. I wish the bristles were stiffer.</li>
            <li> I am partially disabled, so washing my feet was always a bit of a problem.  The Avivo product was a bit pricey, but it looked like a good solution to my problem.  It is.  I highly recommend this product for anyone that has a physical limitation, or anyone in general for that matter.  It does a great job of cleaning the feet, and gives a good \\&quot;massage\\&quot; at the same time.</li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant to pay more for this one but I am glad that I did. [I had tried the cheaper one from the TV ad and was not pleased.] The Avivo is well made. and easy to use. The suction cups work well and hold it steady. There is no heel stone but I like that for me. The upper bristles are softer than expected but for long term use, it is fine. The Avivo Shower Sandal Foot-scrubber is made of strong flexible plastic that I think will last a long time. I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> this is for the shower it makes a shower better this way an even for the home no more stinky feet</li>
            <li> Any positive reviews on this cheap junk must come from their sales guys.  This scrubber came apart the first time used.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My (soccer player) son had chronic stinky feet until I gave him this scrubber.  It is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real pain to keep clean, even with rinsing after a shower a soap film accumlates and is real hard to clean without soaking in vinegar</li>
            <li> Please make a type for size 11 feet and larger.  People with larger feet can only wash their toes with this size shower sandal foot scrubber.</li>
            <li> I AM PLEASED WITH THE DEVICE, HOWEVER, THEY NEED TO MAKE A LONGER MODEL FOR BIGGER FEET AND LARGER SUCTION CUPS FOR BETTER PURCHASE ON THE TUB.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to use this foot scrubber.  It really does the job. Squirt a  little body wash on it and wash your feet no hands.  I bought it in anticipation of an upcoming surgery.  It really works well when you can&#x27;t bend to reach your feet.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use. Wish it had a built in soap trough across the top strap in the center that would hold the soap and let it run onto your foot through holes in the bottom, I think you will use less soap. Very good product, and will use always.</li>
            <li> The product its excellent but the price was high, I found it at retail store for half of what I pay....</li>
            <li> I was worried reading other reviews that the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t hold in my shower, but my tiles are bigger and they hold tight.  The sandal itself feels great, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m getting a massage for my feet every time I use it!  Would definitely recommend this brand of this product.</li>
