            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>I rated this 4 star because this is a great product but be AWARE -</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the reviews for most of these types of machines that there is no customer service.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this, thinking the LED area was more substantial in size.</li>
            <li>If you are ready to spend 10-20 minutes 3 times a week to do this, great.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Its a 4 just because I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li>Ok so I did not get a reliable unit, and maybe I am being too generous</li>
            <li>Light are a nice and soothing touch for clients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>its ok i guess never got it</li>
            <li>This seems to be okay product</li>
            <li>good and cheap thanks</li>
            <li>There are some great YouTube videos on how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>Just got the machine, all the instructions are there on the light to use and how to use it.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the photo-rejuvenation facial kit.  </li>
            <li>If you eat well and use good natural skin care you will glow.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this les device for the first time today and I am looking forward to continuous use and anticipated futurw results as i will be digent in using it.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve seen Youtube videos that mentioned the device emits heat as well and mine stays cool</li>
            <li>People I haven&#x27;t seen for awhile ask what I did because I look so good, rested, and younger too!!</li>
            <li>But, sonic means sound right?  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Seems helpful to use on mildly inflamed joints.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend LED light therapy for anyone not looking for results LIKE YESTERDAY!  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the other machine, this combination would be great, but it wasn&#x27;t  the right one for me.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already starting to feel so much better about myself!</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles are gone or very diminished.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I feel it won&#x27;t be worth the time commitment 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the red light for anti aging and skin tightening.</li>
            <li>I will attempt to step up my regimen and perhaps can give a more detailed review later.</li>
            <li>Faster effective and last!!!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it really seemed to be effective while it worked.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>It worked well the first 3-4 times I used it.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS WHICH COLOR TO USE AND HOW TO USE IT</li>
            <li>WHAT EXACTLY IS</li>
            <li>IT DOESNT EVEN GET HOT</li>
            <li>My skin has definitely gotten better as a result of using this.</li>
            <li>I do not use it on my forehead or eye area because even with the protective glasses, I am sensitive to the light being so close to my eyes.</li>
            <li>My face and neck are really firming up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE AWARE -</li>
            <li>I have mature skin with enlarged pores, blackheads, redness and white dumps on the jaw line and have tried to many products without success.  </li>
            <li>Each day I see a little more improvement!</li>
            <li>Product came with proper instructions/info in easy to understand</li>
            <li>I really like using this Project Beauty LED light for the different beauty purposes.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>Includes detailed instructions for various skin locations on the body.</li>
            <li>I should have read the description more carefully.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>~ Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So it getting ready to be donated.</li>
            <li>I already have a high frequency machine, so really needed the light therapy area to be bigger.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a short time and it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>but I decided to not ship back to vendor out of a reluctance to send all the way back to China and wait for another unit that I could not be sure of, so I Kept it.</li>
            <li>The Seller was most co-operative and accommodating on my choice to initially send back, so I have no problems with them they were honoring their return policies.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it, haven&#x27;t seen huge difference since only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>If you are not sure how to use the machine there are many videos on youtube.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this product .has</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old, I bought this product along with the Derma Roller and use twice a week as my regimen, my skin</li>
            <li>Feels fairly professional but not quite there .</li>
            <li>Do not waste money worked twice then completely stopped.  </li>
            <li>When using this product, always make sure to not go past the time allotted, which is about ten minutes until the wand shuts off.</li>
            <li>It has high, medium and low setting.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions you should see major improvements to your skin.</li>
            <li>Now about the unit, it shuts off abruptly and I can not get a consistent connection, but when it does stay on all the buttons work.</li>
            <li>but if you have major dental work.</li>
            <li>I have been using it only 4 days and have seen a major improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li>Waste of money,  very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, it turned off after only a minute or so of use, but I turned it back on and it stayed on long enough to complete a treatment.</li>
            <li>The green light does reduce redness and brightens a little bit.  </li>

            <li> I have been using it only 4 days and have seen a major improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money,  very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, it turned off after only a minute or so of use, but I turned it back on and it stayed on long enough to complete a treatment.</li>
            <li> The green light does reduce redness and brightens a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the green light has actually done anything.</li>
            <li> Then I tried using it last night and it turned off after only a few seconds, I turned it back on, then it went off again after only a second...</li>
            <li> PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO USE THIS SILLY LIGHT.</li>
            <li> The redness has gone down and the white bumps have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Broke down after only 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the devise is actually functioning properly.  </li>
            <li> Not a very good translation from Chinese to English</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding it hard to add to my busy routine.  </li>
            <li> Not drastic, but it helps to firm up loose skin.</li>
            <li> If I could give a negative ten I would.  </li>
            <li> Previous versions had cordless models  </li>
            <li> well, skin is smoother, gave a bit of a glow, dark spots lightened a little even on my chest, neck.</li>
            <li> Been just few weeks using it every few days, I have noticed my skin looking clearer, always had dark circles under my eyes and it seems like they are getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> I also feel that it has helped with my little acne bumps on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I will continue for another few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for a few weeks and did not see any difference, bummer, wished it had worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for a few months I can say that I have seen some results.</li>
            <li> After using it on and off for a few months, I no longer have crows feet!</li>
            <li> Its hard to tell.....</li>
            <li> Its hard to say if there is any difference I pause to use it because of the problems, there is no sensation but you must use an conductor.</li>
            <li> I have not used the item, the instructions are confusing.</li>
            <li> I look like a few years have been erased from my face and neck!!</li>
            <li> The subtle sonic vice helps product penetrate.</li>
            <li> this occurred over and over till it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on at all, so it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> Obviously, I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of this device and hope I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> The sonic function is what seems questionable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the device stopped working after 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror one day and was shocked!!!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap!!!  </li>

            <li> Shipped fast and I love the product!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this les device for the first time today and I am looking forward to continuous use and anticipated futurw results as i will be digent in using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have mature skin with enlarged pores, blackheads, redness and white dumps on the jaw line and have tried to many products without success.  I have been using it only 4 days and have seen a major improvement to my skin. The redness has gone down and the white bumps have disappeared. There are some great YouTube videos on how to use it properly. If you follow the directions you should see major improvements to your skin. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this product .has done nothing for my face i have used it for 3 months now. i will probably donate it</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Includes detailed instructions for various skin locations on the body. Seems helpful to use on mildly inflamed joints.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference the first time I used this. Exfoliates well, skin is smoother, gave a bit of a glow, dark spots lightened a little even on my chest, neck. Haven&#x27;t tried the hands yet. The directions are for a different model. It worked well the first 3-4 times I used it. It shut off while using it. So, I turned it back on. It worked then turned off again. To use it I have to keep turning it back on, it turns off, I turn it back on, etc. I may keep it for when I can&#x27;t  get to or afford to go the dermatologist. No burning smell, no smoke from the machine or the GFCI outlet, not burning or hurting me... I&#x27;ve read the reviews for most of these types of machines that there is no customer service. They were correct! There is none!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite things!</li>
            <li> I had ordered this, thinking the LED area was more substantial in size. I should have read the description more carefully. I already have a high frequency machine, so really needed the light therapy area to be bigger. If you don&#x27;t have the other machine, this combination would be great, but it wasn&#x27;t  the right one for me.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say whether this is working or not.  The green light does reduce redness and brightens a little bit.  I&#x27;m not sure if the devise is actually functioning properly.  The sonic function is what seems questionable.  It has high, medium and low setting.  When I set it up to my ear, I can here three different tones depending on what setting it&#x27;s on.  But I&#x27;ve seen Youtube videos that mentioned the device emits heat as well and mine stays cool no matter what setting its on.  But, sonic means sound right?  So, I&#x27;m assuming that it must be working.  This device takes time to see results and requires commitment.  If you are ready to spend 10-20 minutes 3 times a week to do this, great.  I have to admit....  I&#x27;m finding it hard to add to my busy routine.  I will continue for another few weeks.  If I notice improvement, I&#x27;ll stick with it.  Otherwise, I feel it won&#x27;t be worth the time commitment 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS WHICH COLOR TO USE AND HOW TO USE IT AND DO I NEED ALOE VERA ON MY SKIN&lt;br /&gt;FIRST,  I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE WHAT EXACTLY IS IT SUPPOSE TO DO.  IT DOESNT EVEN GET HOT SO PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO USE THIS SILLY LIGHT.</li>
            <li> Love this! My skin has definitely gotten better as a result of using this.</li>
            <li> Just got the machine, all the instructions are there on the light to use and how to use it. If you are not sure how to use the machine there are many videos on youtube. So far I like it, haven&#x27;t seen huge difference since only used it twice so far but I do feel like it&#x27;s doing something. Will post update if find time.</li>
            <li> Broke down after only 1 week of use. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it really seemed to be effective while it worked. The first few times I used it, it turned off after only a minute or so of use, but I turned it back on and it stayed on long enough to complete a treatment. Then I tried using it last night and it turned off after only a few seconds, I turned it back on, then it went off again after only a second...this occurred over and over till it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on at all, so it&#x27;s broken. Obviously, I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality of this device and hope I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few weeks and did not see any difference, bummer, wished it had worked for me.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product.  After using it on and off for a few months, I no longer have crows feet! I looked in the mirror one day and was shocked!!! I also feel that it has helped with my little acne bumps on my forehead. My skin is smooth.  Not sure if the green light has actually done anything. Its hard to tell.....</li>
            <li> Love this. Definitely see a difference.  Don&#x27;t expect a $15000 face lift look. If you eat well and use good natural skin care you will glow. I use aloe vera gel instead of chemical ridden ultrasound gel. Use this instead of fillers and botox</li>
            <li> Been just few weeks using it every few days, I have noticed my skin looking clearer, always had dark circles under my eyes and it seems like they are getting lighter.  Its a 4 just because I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li> The product is not quality , what they offer, is not it about the product</li>
            <li> good service and quality merchandise.  Happy with the photo-rejuvenation facial kit.  Simple to use.  Waiting to see the results it will give.</li>
            <li> I really like using this Project Beauty LED light for the different beauty purposes.I mostly use the red light for anti aging and skin tightening. When using this product, always make sure to not go past the time allotted, which is about ten minutes until the wand shuts off. I use it on my cheeks and under my chin, and am starting to see a difference in the texture of the skin there. I do not use it on my forehead or eye area because even with the protective glasses, I am sensitive to the light being so close to my eyes. I can actually see the red beam even with my eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few months I can say that I have seen some results. Not drastic, but it helps to firm up loose skin. Always use the protective eye gear when using this product. I highly recommend LED light therapy for anyone not looking for results LIKE YESTERDAY!  Use the wand several times a week for several months and you will definitely start to see results.</li>
            <li> Love this! Fast shipping ~ Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing item.  A great purchase.</li>
            <li> This has dramatically changed my skin. Fine lines and wrinkles are gone or very diminished. Also keeps my rash, that I get on my chest, at bay. Great item,</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> did not receive cream/liquid or instructions with product. Not happy</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old, I bought this product along with the Derma Roller and use twice a week as my regimen, my skin&lt;br /&gt;Is brighter more youthful, and age spots are fading, also sagging chin area looks more tightened!!! Great product&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for about a month and what a difference. I will continue with this regimen forever!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I did not get a reliable unit, and maybe I am being too generous but I decided to not ship back to vendor out of a reluctance to send all the way back to China and wait for another unit that I could not be sure of, so I Kept it. The Seller was most co-operative and accommodating on my choice to initially send back, so I have no problems with them they were honoring their return policies. Now about the unit, it shuts off abruptly and I can not get a consistent connection, but when it does stay on all the buttons work. Its hard to say if there is any difference I pause to use it because of the problems, there is no sensation but you must use an conductor. I will attempt to step up my regimen and perhaps can give a more detailed review later.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a short time and it&#x27;s not bad my skin looks smoother&lt;br /&gt;And tighter. :) it&#x27;s a good home product.</li>
            <li> I have not used the item, the instructions are confusing. Not a very good translation from Chinese to English</li>
            <li> i think this stuff is very good considering we can use it safely in the privacy of our home.</li>
            <li> It wont turn,,,,just died after 3 days use. Cant recommend for anyone to buy.</li>
            <li> Feels fairly professional but not quite there . Light are a nice and soothing touch for clients. The subtle sonic vice helps product penetrate.</li>
            <li> I love my Project E Beauty LED! My face and neck are really firming up! It feels good too! Fast and easy. Great for aging skin. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and needed to get rid of the sagging and drooping of my face and neck. In one week there&#x27;s a wonderful firming! I&#x27;m already starting to feel so much better about myself! Each day I see a little more improvement! Imagine in six months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!! I can&#x27;t believe the change in my appearance!! I look like a few years have been erased from my face and neck!! People I haven&#x27;t seen for awhile ask what I did because I look so good, rested, and younger too!! I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not just my imagination!!</li>
            <li> good and cheap thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good packaging.  Arrived on time. Product came with proper instructions/info in easy to understand English.&lt;br /&gt;Functions properly. Have not used it regularly yet.  Will try to post results later.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> If I could give a negative ten I would.  Piece of crap!!!  Do not waste money worked twice then completely stopped.  Lights come on but the ultrasound doesn&#x27;t.  Go get ultherapy!!!  Faster effective and last!!! Was traveling and missed the return deadline. So it getting ready to be donated.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 4 times and I am already seeing results. My hyper pigmentation is lightening up and my husband said my face looks smoother. Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I rated this 4 star because this is a great product but be AWARE - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM FROM SELLER &amp;#34;e-river&amp;#34;. The products does not match the description listed on Amazon. A friend of mine purchase this item from seller &amp;#34;Project E Beauty&amp;#34; and it is working fabulously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE - I purchased two photo-rejuvenation kits and they looked nothing like the pictures posted on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The goggle did NOT come with a case as shown on Amazon, GOD KNOWS WHOSE HAS TOUCHED THEM!&lt;br /&gt;2. They did NOT include Included Duplex E Collagen Ion Gel which was for FREE!!!</li>
            <li> Previous versions had cordless models  What happened</li>
            <li> Great customer service, awesome product!</li>
            <li> its ok i guess never got it</li>
            <li> This seems to be okay product but if you have major dental work. It will affect it later so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the device stopped working after 7 weeks. I thought it should have a one year warranty but cannot find anything and since it is after a month of purchase I cannot return it. Waste of money,  very dissapointed!</li>
