            <li>so much wanted to love this product.....</li>
            <li>This foundation does exactly what I want as it evens out my skin tone, is lightweight, does not look caked up and is easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>A quick search and...</li>
            <li>Another quick search and....</li>
            <li>Not only is it affordable, but it is very light and feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of foundation and have found the Maybelline New York Dream Matte Mousse Foundation in Nude great for my combination skin (normal to oily).</li>
            <li>It is a full coverage foundation that doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out and matches my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li>It covers up minor skin discolorations and leaves me feeling nice and matte.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is OK for the price.</li>
            <li>Price is better than all stores, just wish they made a bigger size.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see so many positive reviews about this product - I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
            <li>In addition, many of the collections have a lot of pink undertones, such as the Light 5 -</li>
            <li>The nude has a very orange tint.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Twenty years ago I discovered that I didn&#x27;t need to use any moisturizer on my face which changed my whole appearance, because I stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>so I will choose Classic Ivory (Light 2) next time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Texture is okay, a little clumpy compared to the liquid I was used to.</li>
            <li>and that was a little steep for something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like or would work for me.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product as described, came as a double pack</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>But if you try to scoop it out on your fingers as if you were putting on a liquid foundation, it beads up and looks like something you picked off an old brown sweater.  </li>
            <li>This product had older packaging than what is currently sold in stores.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea, oily t-zone, and occasional adult acne, so this is no small feat.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in 20 years that I&#x27;ve tried something other than powder</li>
            <li>Overall I really LIKE this stuff, I would LOVE it if it wasn&#x27;t cakey, but for me this is&#x27;nt a big deal because in a few hours my skin oils make it appear less cakey.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product thinking I was only going to get one of the mousses but to my surprised I received two.</li>
            <li>But when I received it and first tried to apply it, I thought I&#x27;d gotten an old product because it seemed dried out and cakey.  </li>
            <li>, that is almost impossible to completely remove with a good handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only give it 4 stars because it can be cakey, and I prefer to look as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>I have normal/dry skin, with no dry patches.</li>
            <li>But because my oily skin does come through at times I do tend to finish it off with a little bit of veil or powder, though not as much, it is still a must!</li>
            <li>you are looking for pink or dark selections, you have found the right product line.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Overall, this product is OK for the price. However, the color selection is just terrible. The Medium 2 is one of the darkest mediums that I have ever seen. Any thing above 2 is very dark for white skin. In addition, many of the collections have a lot of pink undertones, such as the Light 5 - it&#x27;s pink, pink, pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this foundation is difficult to \\&quot;get right.\\&quot; I was hopeful that this might substitute for my favorite - but expensive - Benefit foundation. It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for pink or dark selections, you have found the right product line. Otherwise, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking I was only going to get one of the mousses but to my surprised I received two. This product was way way way worth the price!!</li>
            <li> This product had older packaging than what is currently sold in stores.  The seal is intact though so I am hoping it will be fresh and good to use.</li>

This foundation goes on smooth with such a flawless finish and has staying power. But because my oily skin does come through at times I do tend to finish it off with a little bit of veil or powder, though not as much, it is still a must! This foundation does exactly what I want as it evens out my skin tone, is lightweight, does not look caked up and is easy to apply and remove. Best part is it does not cause my sensitive skin to break out and has not clogged my pores up (not yet anyway)! Great price and ships quickly. Give it a try!</li>

            <li> great ptice two fay shipping, love it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described, came as a double pack and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to foundation for as long as I can remember. Not only is it affordable, but it is very light and feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all! It stays on really well and is very easy to apply, as it is super smooth and creamy and feels good on the skin. I hate liquid foundations, as I find them messy and oftentimes heavy, so after I found this foundation, I&#x27;ve never looked back. I recommend this product to my friends and have converted many people!</li>
            <li> its all good i love it thank you good job</li>
            <li> It doesnt rub in smoothly.  It clumps on my skin.  Will never use again</li>
            <li> The nude has a very orange tint.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. Twenty years ago I discovered that I didn&#x27;t need to use any moisturizer on my face which changed my whole appearance, because I stopped breaking out. I also begun using powder instead of liquid make up. This is the first time in 20 years that I&#x27;ve tried something other than powder and I love it. I even use it as a under-eye concealer. It doesn&#x27;t crease and it holds up for about 4-5 hours for me. It covers up minor skin discolorations and leaves me feeling nice and matte. This is the 2nd one I get. I have one for the winter that is lighter and another for the summer when I have a bit of a tan. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The trick to this foundation is in the application.  Read on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so much wanted to love this product.....everyone gave it great reviews and I thought it would be the answer to all my skin woes.  But when I received it and first tried to apply it, I thought I&#x27;d gotten an old product because it seemed dried out and cakey.  This is not a mousse like a whipped, airy, spray mousse (obviously, since it comes in a jar).  But if you try to scoop it out on your fingers as if you were putting on a liquid foundation, it beads up and looks like something you picked off an old brown sweater.  But...why all the great reviews?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... off to youtube I went.  And what I found on youtube was several makeup tutorials for this product using a foundation brush.  AHHHHH...(cue the lightbulb moment).  Most of the tutorials suggested the MAC duo fibre face brush.  A quick search and...$42?!?!  Eep.  While I agree that in most cases you get what you pay for an quality brushes are an investment, you&#x27;re talking to a person who had never used a brush to apply foundation before and that was a little steep for something that I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like or would work for me.  Another quick search and....Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ([[ASIN:B007O7AZBG B007O7AZBG]]  At under $10, this was more in my range for trying something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the results...  perfection.  Putting this foundation on with a foundation brush gives me great results.  I have rosacea, oily t-zone, and occasional adult acne, so this is no small feat.  It literally gives me an airbrushed look.  An added bonus to using a foundation brush to apply your makeup (I&#x27;ve never liked makeup sponges) is that you don&#x27;t get foundation on your fingers, pressed into your fingerprints, that is almost impossible to completely remove with a good handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re thinking about this foundation, go for it...  but add on a foundation brush and watch a couple youtube videos.  The results will be much better that way.be much better that way.</li>
            <li> I tried this matte mousse foundation and was so disappointed! My skin felt dry all day and I don´t like the coverage at all. I am surprised to see so many positive reviews about this product - I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Well, considering that you&#x27;re buying makeup online, one would hope you know what you&#x27;re looking for. The misses loves this stuff. Price is better than all stores, just wish they made a bigger size. The thick glass is very deceiving</li>
            <li> This foundation goes on smoothly and has a medium to full coverage. I have normal/dry skin, with no dry patches. For color comparison purposes, I wear Buff Beige in Cover Girl foundations and this was a little too dark so I will choose Classic Ivory (Light 2) next time.</li>
            <li> For someone who has avoided all drug store foundations for years because they made me break out this stuff is pretty awesome. I only give it 4 stars because it can be cakey, and I prefer to look as natural as possible. I try to put on extra moisturizer or mix a little in with the mousse on my finger before applying it. My friend who went to beauty school recommended it to me and she loves it also. It is a full coverage foundation that doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out and matches my skin tone really well. I have a skin tone that people think is darker than it is. Alot of the time someone will look at me and say I have &amp;#34;olive skin&amp;#34;, but when it comes to cosmetics I usually need lights or naturals. Overall I really LIKE this stuff, I would LOVE it if it wasn&#x27;t cakey, but for me this is&#x27;nt a big deal because in a few hours my skin oils make it appear less cakey. I have read other reviews on the net saying that this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on. I don&#x27;t have a problem with that it seems to stay for the most part. If my face rubbed up against something with pressure it would come off, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for me.</li>
            <li> This foundation is light yet it still does a pretty good job although it looks kind of dry but mainly only if you look up close.</li>
            <li> Best deal for the price.  Coverage is perfect and lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and still have oily skin with occasional break-outs.  This matte foundation looks fresh for 12 hours!</li>
            <li> Good for my dry/combination skin. Goes on flawless and the color is not too light. I just started using it and I like it much more than powder or liquid because it blends very nicely.</li>
            <li> Loved this foundation!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation, the formula is the best I have ever had on my face, it is so light and great cover.</li>
            <li> This is the lightest makeup i&#x27;ve ever used, great coverage and the color is perfection. The only thing is that I don&#x27;t have enough ...I need more!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years! Light stuff, doesn&#x27;t feel like you caked on a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> Good product but pricey.  I was not very impressed with the amount you get for the money&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will add more product or lower the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not darker than expected, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skin because of it&#x27;s orange-y tint. The formula/texture is great and the coverage/pigmentation is nice as far as drugstore make up goes but like I said, it&#x27;s a bit orange and I have to correct it by using a violet toned primer.</li>
            <li> I was used to wearing Avon mousse foundation but they no longer carry it. this works just as well maybe better. very good product!</li>
