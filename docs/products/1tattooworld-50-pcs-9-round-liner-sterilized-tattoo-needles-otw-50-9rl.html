            <li> I love the tattoos but my skin dont like the needles. But my new batman looks nice! I love it</li>
            <li> The seals on the packages of the needles are all opened and not sterile</li>
            <li> I bought all this stuff for a friend and say&#x27;s that everything work&#x27;s as advertise.</li>
            <li> awesome needles. you get exactly what they say &amp;#34;10 of each for 3-9 round liner, 5-9 Shader, and 5-9 single mags.. I know they came in the mail</li>
            <li> Awesome product, great price. Would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Good product, however, the box I received had one that was sticking out of the packaging. Not safe at all. Who knows what bacteria might be on it and I could&#x27;ve easily stuck myself if I wasn&#x27;t looking carefully.</li>
            <li> The needles were packaged properly and on first look they were fine but the \\&quot;liner\\&quot; grouping is horrible they are between a liner and a shader i thought that maybe they were mislabled but comparing them to a 9rs they arent the same they almost ruined some work i was doing. do not order needles from this company.</li>
            <li> I did not receive everything that was in the description that I paid for Also the training CD was not very helpful at all YouTube and google had better videos, but other than that the things I did receive worked well.</li>

            <li> Great needles. All soldering was done well and exactly as described by seller.</li>
            <li> Came in right sizes, slow shipping but great purchase for a great price.</li>
