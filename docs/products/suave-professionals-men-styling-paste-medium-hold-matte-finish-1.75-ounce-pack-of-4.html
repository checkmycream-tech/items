            <li>It was nice to order them in bulk for a good price.</li>
            <li>Also, I have found it works best in my hair right after a shower with my hair mostly-but not completely-dry.</li>
            <li>Like AC products, you have to figure out the right amount of moisture in your hair to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Great light hold at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Great price and so far very happy with results which I doubt will change.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I look sexy as a result of this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I have not tried a better product!</li>
            <li>this thing is a jar of sexual harassment!</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It comes of easily and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Great product and a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>However, once in, it holds hair nicely.</li>
            <li>The paste smells nice and it spreads nicely on your hands and in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Works well and nice scent.</li>
            <li>This is a good hair product for an even better price.</li>
            <li>Holds well but kind of oily</li>
            <li>Loving it, been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li>just gives a nice finish and shape.</li>
            <li>Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li>Came in a nice neat box well protected.</li>
            <li>The scent that is clean and smells great is just the cherry on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To find the quantity of product at such a good value was impressive.</li>
            <li>This paste has a good texture and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique product that is clearly liked by a lot of people!</li>
            <li>I hoped it would be the magic bullet for my hair that has never done anything I liked.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and holds well for most of the day.</li>
            <li>, I loved the smooth ointment recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>It makes you hair look and feel as if it is just magically staying in place on its own.</li>
            <li>Suave is by far the best of them.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best styling paste for the price.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and smells great, too.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this because the price was good but it does not hold up well</li>
            <li>Clean scent and cheaper than the alternatives while still being just as good, for all my purposes.</li>
            <li>and its very easy to apply even more so than the Fiber</li>
            <li>The product smells great and it&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for great styling ability at a nice price.</li>
            <li>My hair is 6 cm, this ointment is wavy and fell super good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
            <li>Awesome product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>It smells great, lasts the whole day, and is inexpensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>I bought a 4-pack, and was really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re much better off spending a bit more to get a better quality product now.  </li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>It immediately became a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>This styling paste is perfect for people with short hair that are looking for the bedhead look.</li>
            <li>so you end up using slightly more.  </li>
            <li>Not enough to care about though because it works great!</li>
            <li>I like this better than the pricier ones.</li>
            <li>in all, for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This is the best of the all the hair products I have tried and it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>maybe even better.  </li>
            <li>It is better than gel</li>
            <li>I found this product on Amazon and bought it because of the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The price is phenomenal, comparatively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great matte finish, lasts all day, and it is very inexpensive for the quality of product you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Also, great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside I have with it is the intense smell it has.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to make them look great</li>
            <li>and it is a nice, light cream that holds well.</li>
            <li>Better than Axe.</li>
            <li>I love this hair putty.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and this is a case of getting what you pay f&lt;br /&gt;For.</li>
            <li>Wish it has more shine when applied on hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They hold just as well as the fiber and have that matte finish that I love.</li>
            <li>best part is that for a price that is cheaper than ONE bottle of American Crew Fiber, Suave delivers FOUR bottles.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>What more do you want.</li>
            <li>Its fabulous!</li>
            <li>In overall, the scent and the result of the appliance of the gel is impressive.</li>
            <li>As a compromise, I tend to use this product to style before work and times when I don&#x27;t really care how great my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this product in the store</li>
            <li>I heard they were discontinuing this product, I wish I had bought more at that price</li>
            <li>Works as well as salon quality brands for much better value.</li>
            <li>Compared the AC, it&#x27;s more greasy, and doesn&#x27;t seem to either hold or hold up as well.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok when it has quality ingredients</li>
            <li>and it works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Been looking for the perfect hair product that wasn&#x27;t going to break the bank like \\&quot;American Crew\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>For my hair, love the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>dont know how this would work for guys with short hair, but I have about 5 inches on top, and it molds my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it will ship overseas and I can still look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love it, but I believe Suave is no longer producing this product.  </li>
            <li>I found it here on Amazon at an even better price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>So much better than using a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; product for thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Extremely cheap but holds well and has a nice consistency.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.com</li>
            <li>I have used many hair products over the year.</li>
            <li>These worked OK.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t find any reason to give it more.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>but &#x27;healthy looking hair\\</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product can&#x27;t find an affordable substitute anywhere in stores.</li>
            <li>Great quality styling product without the high price.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use, and effective.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, but I wish it had more hold to it, but perhaps I need to use more for my shorter hair..</li>
            <li>AC smells sweet, but almost in a honey type way which was nice.</li>
            <li>It holds pretty good if you apply it in wet/dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed the way I want it all day long... really great!</li>
            <li>Amazing prize, Great styling paste for the teenage boy or college student.</li>
            <li>and I find its best applied when dry.</li>
            <li>It works like a pomade, for me best when hair is nearly dry and still damp.</li>
            <li>This works better and is significantly cheaper than most of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brands.  </li>
            <li>Quality is very good although it seems to be a slightly different texture from the store bought.</li>
            <li>I picked up the Suave Styling Paste at Wal-mart (price is dirt cheap) and glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever at a fraction of the cost of other products.</li>
            <li>Leaves a natural-like texture and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Holds all day, washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on hair and remove when showering.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and is easy to wash out in the morning.</li>
            <li>I did notice a strong fruity smell when applying it</li>
            <li>Just does the job for me and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>The hold is strong, with a non-greasy finish.</li>
            <li>Has an exceptionally strong hold while still having a matte/dry look.</li>
            <li>I did not like the smell is too strong, besides this quite greasy, and has no touch matte as indicated.</li>
            <li>Strong, Perfumed Smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a strong fragrance and not too sticky.</li>
            <li>It barely costs anything and works great.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality product - nice, light scent similar to their shampoo products for men.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I fell in love with this hair paste and love the non greasy and flexible look i wanted.</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described!</li>
            <li>It gives hair a very natural look yet still has a good hold.</li>
            <li>The WEN is also great because it washes out really easily, your hands aren&#x27;t left sticky!  </li>
            <li>This one is great to use on damp hair for a more polished/gel-looking style and on dry hair for the matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has good hold and is not stiff.</li>
            <li>Part of me is worried it&#x27;ll be discontinued because its so cheap compared to the others.</li>
            <li>Such a great value compared to the leading brands.</li>
            <li>matte finish, cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>The styling paste is light and matte in texture.  </li>
            <li>This product is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>but, unlike Axe, it&#x27;s always smooth and silky in the container and never leaves clumps when applying.</li>
            <li>and I like a light matte hold for my hair.</li>
            <li>Cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>Cheap and does not hold.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, getting compliments from the ladies all the time at the office...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of it and its cheap</li>
            <li>This fit the bill quite well and turned out to be a lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend buying this product its great</li>
            <li>I can get a nice straight look by just using a dab of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is fairly cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Dare to compare to some high-cost items, you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good putty for a while since my old line is not being made anymore.</li>
            <li>As far as hold and looks go I would rate it as just as good as AC.</li>
            <li>It works great, if you use the right amount it will keep your hair in shape all day and looks natural and non-clumpy.</li>
            <li>I live in Brazil, this ointment bothered by amazon, did an experiment to see if it worked as you say yourself, and to love this cream, my hair ta super gorgeous, already used many ointments, but this really turned my hair</li>
            <li>Works great, last long, and great price.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>It has about as much hold as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shaping paste (a slightly better product, but 7 times the cost of this per pot), and allows for easy shaping until it dries.</li>
            <li>, I like more of a light hold with a light shape to my hair and the paste provides that very well.</li>
            <li>This product works great all day long.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a very good value, so in like a year and a half, when I run out of all 4 cans, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is clean, affordable, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Still not as easy to find as it could be, it is worth seeking out or just ordering on Amazon.</li>
            <li>In this case it&#x27;s a near perfect match for American Crew styling</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and manly - the American Crew lacks a fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought 2x 4 packs of this with a special 50% discount on the the purchase of 2.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best if you don&#x27;t want to have your hair all gunky or hard.</li>
            <li>So I tried this Suave Paste on a whim - it was cheap enough to risk - and it seem to be the perfect merger of American Crew Fiber and Paste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- lasts well in outdoor full sun heat and doesn&#x27;t gloop or drip</li>
            <li>Still much cheaper than crew even using more.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Suave :)</li>
            <li>I finally ordered this styling paste after reading the good reviews it had.</li>
            <li>Leaves no sticky feeling on hair and really helps to stylish your look.</li>
            <li>Suave styling paste smells sweet almost in a sugar/fruit type way.</li>
            <li>As good as American Crew fiber paste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more fragrant than I would prefer, and has a very fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>For a supposedly low quality brand, this is good quality hair product.</li>
            <li>I use the styling paste on damp hair every day and it is true to name</li>
            <li>Tried this about a year ago when I found it at a Target store as an alternative to American Crew fiber paste... loved it (and the price) then for some reason couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a great price compared to other products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 8-9 inches in length, this stuff gives my hair a solid hold for about the first 10 hours of day and kind of releases by the evening, which for me is what I desire because while I&#x27;m at work its a bit more executive/corporate looking and by the evening</li>
            <li>2 stars for the great smell, other than that</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t find it anymore locally (Super Target, Wal-Mart, Rite Aid, drugstores, etc.)  </li>
            <li>It is comparable to American crew fiber although the fiber do provide a better hold but also cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great product that I feel is well worth the $11 I spent on it.</li>
            <li>First off I have to say the price is fantastic for this</li>
            <li>I think that the price is amazing and is better than any other competitor.</li>
            <li>This product on the other hand is very light and has a great natural hold.</li>
            <li>Works almost as good as American Crew Fiber/Forming Cream (yes, very very close in quality, but not quite there).</li>
            <li>This provide great hold while having less of a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>True to the label a nice medium hold with a matte finish, no problem lasting all day.</li>
            <li>Find it superior to higher priced products that I tried after the last one I had ran out.  </li>
            <li>Avoid touching your hair (or allowing other people to touch your hair), putting on headwear (helmet, hat, bandana, headphones, hoodie, etc.), or resting your head on anything (head rest, pillow, vehicle interior, etc.), and you might be able to pull off a *clean* styled look, else...</li>
            <li>This is the closest thing to the old formulation of Garnier&#x27;s Surf Wax (which they no longer make, and I used for years) and is the perfect product for those that want the ability to style their hair without a greasy mess (ie.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, smells great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about men&#x27;s hair products, but this stuff was cheap, so I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Works well, holds my hair in place, great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>This product along with the Suave Men&#x27;s Pomade paste produces such an amazing shiny but not oily hair style.  </li>
            <li>I would really recommend anyone who would like to try it and its really cheap.</li>
            <li>It gives you a more natural look in styling which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>My local store discontinued this product, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, and it&#x27;s good enough for me to keep buying it from now on.</li>
            <li>I laugh when I see the fancy brands for almost $20 a pop.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this one is even better than Crew and nearly $15-20 cheaper.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t near this cheap for 4 of them!</li>
            <li>but cheap enough if they love it</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price for this, especially if you buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li>just fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>For the price...this stuff is pretty good...not as good as the American Crew but works pretty well.</li>
            <li>you got a DRY, NON-CLUMPY, FLEXIBLE hairdo with a MILD SHINE AND STRONG HOLD that everyone will love and make you look like a model or superstar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cut off most of my thin, fine locks back in March (for a modern pixie) and have since been on a mission to find the best products for my use.</li>
            <li>I use this right after I get out the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the right product!!!  </li>
            <li>With this product it is easy to spread evenly through the air and is easy to smooth the hair down.</li>
            <li>For how well this holds it washes out surprisingly easily, it feels likes it rinses out completely before I&#x27;ve even used shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great value compared to the expensive salon brands, does a better job</li>
            <li>I believe I found a permanent replacement for the American Crew Fiber, good bye old friend.</li>
            <li>Perhaps most importantly, though, is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like the stuff the barber shop tries to sell me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, not greasy, and has a natural look to it.</li>
            <li>Overall a good price conscious purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great... holds firm all day...but don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of holding hair and not looking a helmet of hair nor like a greasy mess</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much at all to style my hair.</li>
            <li>The AC forming cream smells very much like a manly hair product from the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much to give my hair some texture.</li>
            <li>Good but a little bit too glossy</li>
            <li>Great, hard to find product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very straight hair, which can make it difficult to find a good hair product.</li>
            <li>The hold is not as strong, but it&#x27;s still good at giving a spiky or messy look in my short hair, and it&#x27;s precise enough for me to fine tune problem areas.</li>
            <li>Be aware their is a hint of fruity odor that comes off of it, but it never bothered me.</li>
            <li>Thanks Suave, and Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the same or better quality as the $15 paste my barber sells.</li>
            <li>Recently I have been going to target and finding that my favorite hair product hasn&#x27;t been stocked.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li>This four pack will last me a while, but when it runs out I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>I was pretty discouraged when it was removed from the market a year ago, so when I found it again I bought a years supply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair products.</li>
            <li>And because its so consistent, you can fine tune it be just applying more or less paste.</li>
            <li>but I need it for that first day</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, works as good as the much more expensive American Crew brand product that is similar.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a big deal to get them more.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>and I think so many have caught on that it is virtually the same product as Dove Men that Unilever has changed the packaging.</li>
            <li>I got 4 1.75 ounce containers of this for a buck and change more than 1 of the American Crew costs (with shipping).  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Most recently I was using Axe &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says:</li>
            <li>used to use American Crew Fiber, which had better hold but</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be more simple.  </li>
            <li>but I have tried many other Suave products and was definitely not disappointed by this.</li>
            <li>firm hold good price product</li>
            <li>I used to use WEN defining paste, and I loved that it would hold without the heavy or gel like weight.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product about a year and a half ago and was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Hair does not feel stiff, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, smells good, keeps my husband&#x27;s very thick, course, wiry hair in place,</li>
            <li>I put my hair straight back with a taper on the sides and on top  </li>
            <li>It gives hair a  matte finish, but with  a little more shine than the Fiber (a more natural look).</li>
            <li>me describe the positive aspects of this product.</li>
            <li>For everyday indications, I think this product is an economical solution that may not perform perfectly, but again you are not shelling out a ton of money for everyday hair styling at work.  </li>
            <li>It provides a nice, clean look and hold without looking greasy or hard.</li>
            <li>long on top).</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the more expensive pomade!</li>
            <li>Good hold, natural look, and cheaper than any other product out there (</li>
            <li>Switched over from Axe products, and this is just as good, if not better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair, but my hair has no texture naturally.</li>
            <li>I also used to use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream which had a nice soft texture and good hold, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this because they are becoming hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Works well, comes off easy, and holds with enough give.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with no shine and moderate hold that would be easy to apply in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I recommend giving this a try over some of the more expensive brands like Axe because it is as good or better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>This styling paste is pretty decent, it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as AC products like fiber and forming cream</li>
            <li>I have relatively short medium to fine hair and it works very well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to give you a little control and texture, without it being sticky, heavy, glossy, or gummy, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t spend $17 a jar on aveda men&#x27;s styling matte finish pommade, so i found this stuff here and have been very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a shine and holds all day.</li>
            <li>Holds and styles well with hair, but does leave a white residue unless you smooth out the paste thoroughly with your hands.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your hair does not feel sticky or crunchy; only a flawless, malleable (yet firm) hair style is left.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the price was SUBSTANTIALLY better than American Crew, getting more than twice the product for a few bucks less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, but gives off a very sticky feel.  </li>
            <li>It holds and doesn&#x27;t form clumps, but really doesn&#x27;t style that well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is much cheaper than anything else I have tried for my hair.</li>
            <li>I am puerto rican/peruvuian just in case anyone wants a reference type thing.</li>
            <li>yet it holds very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly cheap compared to similar products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and unless you use too much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see how it could be too much.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell, and likes the fact she can run her fingers in my hair without feeling like she held bacon; pomade gets really greasy.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it does really mix well into your hair.</li>
            <li>You really need to work it in.</li>
            <li>but when i have amazon who really cares.</li>
            <li>, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much (dime size amount on the fingertip), and it retains its hold all day.</li>
            <li>Works well and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>This paste hold hair really well but doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny coat.  </li>
            <li>and you have to really work it to get to the point that it disappears in your hair.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Holds up very well to weather.</li>
            <li>Cheap alternative to the American Crew Molding Paste.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have anything to complain about.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like how clumpy they were and how the hold was &#x27;meh&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Also very well priced.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and cannot find it at any of the stores around here, anymore.  </li>
            <li>and it kept drying out before I could use the whole container.</li>
            <li>This product is low sheen with a good hold, not for those looking for &amp;#34;the wet look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought this as an alternative to American Crew Forming Cream, as it&#x27;s significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Much better value than some of the other hair products out there.  </li>
            <li>This holds ok at first but will go limp as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Seriously, that&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Hopefully with some experimentation on technique and with different hair lengths (I have medium to short hair) to see if it works better any certain way.</li>
            <li>I would recommend lightly wetting your hair before applying depending on how long your hair is.</li>
            <li>I will always buy this as long as it is still available.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have the same gritty texture as the aveda pommade which give it a bit extra roughness and is more shiny than aveda&#x27;s but not bad.</li>
            <li>I was using Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, but my stylist told me I needed something more matte and less spikey.</li>
            <li>Less with a coupon) and get more than 3oz.</li>
            <li>Husband loves this more than the more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched around from forming creams, pomades and gels over the years, looking for decent hold without my hair feeling and looking like a shiny helmet.</li>
            <li>While I have a couple, more expensive favorite go-to products, I like this.</li>
            <li>The selection at department stores is heavily weighted toward women&#x27;s hair products, and most companies seem uninterested in offering reasonably priced products for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Beeswax is one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>To me this works better than the more expensive products.</li>
            <li>If you are on a tight budget, for sure try this.</li>
            <li>I hope that they keep making it forever and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a highly underrated styling paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Sheen is high but not greasy.</li>
            <li>But the problem is finding the right paste, wax, or gel - as many can be hard to use on fine hair, leave a glossy residue, or weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, just wished it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a product that holds and works.  </li>
            <li>I use something a little better when going out.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and quickly style my thick but frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this Suave pomade to anyone who wants natural looking hold.</li>
            <li>Suave made a great men&#x27;s hair product that isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive and I can buy in bulk here.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair styling cream for several reasons the first being</li>
            <li>None have been able to deliver the matte finish that they have promised with a firm hold, except for for this Suave Styling Paste.</li>
            <li>Aveda and American Crew all of a distinct scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using heavily perfumed products, but I&#x27;m glad to report the smell dissipates after some wear.</li>
            <li>, I get pretty much the same hold &amp; look</li>
            <li>I would have liked it 5 star if it were not so thick.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable, specially when compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>I think the Axe product (Axe Styling Cream Natural Understated Look 2.64 oz) is just a little better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this stuff.</li>
            <li>New to waxes and pastes</li>
            <li>I bought recently , and I expected better results.</li>
            <li>After years of using every men&#x27;s hair care product out there if the type from the high end stuff down the the big extra value sized goop of Dep from Wally I&#x27;ve found this provides the best amount of gold without making the hair stiff and shiny.</li>
            <li>Not a shiny look, very natural.</li>
            <li>I generally never write reviews unless they really impress, and these certainly have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I discovered Suave, my new favorite hair paste for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li>For me, the Suave works better than the aforementioned products and is much less expensive, a great combination.  </li>
            <li>With the rebranding price increase depending on where you look you might check out the prices of the higher end American Crew brand items.</li>
            <li>Last time I bought AXE pomade, which was like 6 bucks or so; can&#x27;t remember exactly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things in the past and this product has ended up being my favorite, with a bonus of it being a fraction of the cost of comparable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product, hope this helps others save a few bucks!</li>
            <li>I usually do not write any reviews</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than any other I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Then I went to a hair stylist and with some simple techniques I got the results that were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Really all you have to do is use a hair dryer to shape your hair in the general direction and shape</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this product either way, I even use a little bit on my two-year-olds massive head of a hair :).</li>
            <li>Wow, was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>My hair is never stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, my hair tends to be very limp and flat.</li>
            <li>Soft and creamy but waxier like the Fiber with a stiffer hold.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>i would recommend American Crew Fiber, which costs just as much as four of these</li>
            <li>I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued, since it is much cheaper than Crew defining paste and holds my hair just the same.  </li>
            <li>My hair moves in the wind naturally but returns to its place with this paste.</li>
            <li>She tried to sell me $15-20 products like Woody&#x27;s Matte Clay or American Crew Fiber, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Medium hold and matte finish give it a natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this product, I have short hair</li>
            <li>On a whim I decided to purchase the Suave Mens Styling Paste from my local Wal Mart as it was priced very well at around $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets hair to stick together, without being sticky, to help form natural looking styling, when styled with your hands.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this stuff works better with longer hair at least it does when my hair is longer.</li>
            <li>As it shows on the package, it&#x27;s supposed to be like AC Defining Paste, so I won&#x27;t compare it directly to AC Fiber, but it does stand in well for it.</li>
            <li>There is no shine to my hair and my styling looks quite natural.</li>
            <li>This does not work up well in your hands - mine often formed chunks that would stick out in your hair (unless your are completely gray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave did send me a $5 coupon in the mail after I called them (Unilever) and I&#x27;ve tossed the rest.</li>
            <li>I have thick Asian hair and it manage to keep my side tidy all day(I have a short/medium faux hawk).</li>
            <li>saw that this 4-pack of Suave had a really similar advertised quality, with a medium hold paste that even claims to compare to the American Crew product right on the label.</li>
            <li>It works well for me, but I have to be careful to use just the right amount or it can get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; throughout the day.</li>
            <li>take a little bit of the styling paste and spread it onto my finger tips, and then very lightly work it through my (dry) hair.</li>
            <li>last all day, cheap, i am used to have long hair and cut it short, this helps me have style all day.</li>
            <li>most hair products - a little dab goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>its alright, if u have thick soft hair with great volume this isnt going to work for you, the hold doesnt last long and to last long you need a lot of the product making your hair greasy looking which defeats the whole purpose of matte finish.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ask too much out of hair product, just to give it a little more control and look than my naturally bland hair looks.  </li>
            <li>A/C Fiber does work good, but weighs hair down and makes hair look too \\&quot;dull looking\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used American Crew&#x27;s Paste in the past but didn&#x27;t have the hold I was looking for - more</li>
            <li>It has a medium hold-not quite as strong as some other products I&#x27;ve used and with my stiff hair, I find I need to use a little more.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these, as I was  user of American Crew for over 2 years, and well this takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use a small fingers-worth with slightly damp hair, then after your hair is completely dry, style it, it works great.</li>
            <li>I started using this product when I couldn&#x27;t find my normal jar of $20 hair product at a local grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Works a little bit better with wet hair.</li>
            <li>(Crew, Garnier Fructis, Axe, etc) in order to find a strong hold that does not make your hair hard or shiny.</li>
            <li>i used american crew fiber and i wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>It has a generic scent, which I could live without, but not anything overpowering.</li>
            <li>Be careful to always tighten the lid back on, or it will dry out easily.</li>
            <li>only about 2-3 inchs long so wetting first allows me to achieve the look i want.</li>
            <li>you compare the price you can get almost ten times as much of this for the cost of one jar of American Crew (at retail price).</li>
            <li>Really reminds me of the more expensive products that you see.</li>
            <li>medium hold is good for people with thick hair whose hair needs just a finishing touch, if you wan to style your hair and move it around get something with a stronger hold like Aamerican Crew Fiber,</li>
            <li>The white gel is very soft and spreadable in your hands.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does the same job compared to expensive brands such as axe and american crew.</li>
            <li>This works great and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li>I usually used American Crew Fiber as it seemed to thicken my fine hair and wasn&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
            <li>I really have a hard time finding a paste or gel that I consistently like.  </li>
            <li>It gives a natural look so if you want a glossier look you&#x27;ll probably want to go a different route, pomades or something.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to keep your hair fluffed and keep it in place but still look natural, I would try a different product.  </li>
            <li>Like some have said, it gives that natural look instead of all greasy and such.</li>
            <li>I tried this paste and it is very similar to my old putty.</li>
            <li>You can barely feel the stuff in your hair</li>
            <li>I have used Old Spice&#x27;s various hair products, also tried the line of Axe hair products.</li>
            <li>Waterless paste consistency that solidifies in your hair too quickly, particularly when used with dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not really attractive either.</li>
            <li>Less hold, and doesn&#x27;t get the defined style look when hair gets grouped together, but better than ending up with embarrassing flakes after a few hours when the paste dries and breaks up.</li>
            <li>If you like to style without the crazy wet gel look, and be able to rinse clean</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this stuff I got it at Target for less than $3.00</li>
            <li>its a casual loose look that still has a good hold.</li>
            <li>think I get similar style without paste, just using moist hands and running it through my hair (short straight Asian hair) similarly.</li>
            <li>The product is much lighter than other styling cremes yet works just as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very careful not to rub too much into any one area, the trick is to spread a little bit around evenly so my hair still looks natural, yet has some much needed shape and texture.</li>
            <li>I wish my local retailers still sold this styling paste, but at least it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
            <li>does not dry hair.</li>
            <li>Very small amount is needed for just some light hold on short hair.</li>
            <li>considering the next closest product is about the same cost as 4 of these pucks, and works nearly the same.</li>
            <li>The suave/dove product can be equal or less than in price (per ounce) than those higher end products (like American Crew) now.</li>
            <li>Compared to other ones (American Crew and Axe) which are way more expensive and also stink, this is pure gold.</li>
            <li>For several years, I&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber for getting my short hair just right on weekends or when going out, but I used another product for everyday styling to save money.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff better than any of the hair products I&#x27;ve had for the past few years that ranged from $5 to $40 in price.</li>
            <li>I simply wash my hair, rarely do I blow dry it anymore, I run a little product through it once it dries to give it texture and presto - I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, it has a nice matte finish, but you can still work your hair once its dry, so you get the casual but refined look</li>
            <li>I like that it is cheap, but I don&#x27;t think it holds as well as other ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This is very weak as far as hold, doesn&#x27;t give texture and is too light</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was nice to order them in bulk for a good price.</li>
            <li> Also, I have found it works best in my hair right after a shower with my hair mostly-but not completely-dry.</li>
            <li> Like AC products, you have to figure out the right amount of moisture in your hair to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Great light hold at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Great price and so far very happy with results which I doubt will change.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I look sexy as a result of this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I have not tried a better product!</li>
            <li> this thing is a jar of sexual harassment!</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It comes of easily and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Great product and a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> However, once in, it holds hair nicely.</li>
            <li> The paste smells nice and it spreads nicely on your hands and in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well and nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair product for an even better price.</li>
            <li> Holds well but kind of oily</li>
            <li> Loving it, been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> just gives a nice finish and shape.</li>
            <li> Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> Came in a nice neat box well protected.</li>
            <li> The scent that is clean and smells great is just the cherry on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To find the quantity of product at such a good value was impressive.</li>
            <li> This paste has a good texture and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a unique product that is clearly liked by a lot of people!</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be the magic bullet for my hair that has never done anything I liked.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and holds well for most of the day.</li>
            <li> , I loved the smooth ointment recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It makes you hair look and feel as if it is just magically staying in place on its own.</li>
            <li> Suave is by far the best of them.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best styling paste for the price.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and smells great, too.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered this because the price was good but it does not hold up well</li>
            <li> Clean scent and cheaper than the alternatives while still being just as good, for all my purposes.</li>
            <li> and its very easy to apply even more so than the Fiber</li>
            <li> The product smells great and it&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for great styling ability at a nice price.</li>
            <li> My hair is 6 cm, this ointment is wavy and fell super good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> It smells great, lasts the whole day, and is inexpensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I bought a 4-pack, and was really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re much better off spending a bit more to get a better quality product now.  </li>
            <li> I want more.</li>
            <li> It immediately became a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> This styling paste is perfect for people with short hair that are looking for the bedhead look.</li>
            <li> so you end up using slightly more.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to care about though because it works great!</li>
            <li> I like this better than the pricier ones.</li>
            <li> in all, for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the all the hair products I have tried and it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> maybe even better.  </li>
            <li> It is better than gel</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon and bought it because of the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The price is phenomenal, comparatively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a great matte finish, lasts all day, and it is very inexpensive for the quality of product you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Also, great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside I have with it is the intense smell it has.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough to make them look great</li>
            <li> and it is a nice, light cream that holds well.</li>
            <li> Better than Axe.</li>
            <li> I love this hair putty.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and this is a case of getting what you pay f&lt;br /&gt;For.</li>
            <li> Wish it has more shine when applied on hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They hold just as well as the fiber and have that matte finish that I love.</li>
            <li> best part is that for a price that is cheaper than ONE bottle of American Crew Fiber, Suave delivers FOUR bottles.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> What more do you want.</li>
            <li> Its fabulous!</li>
            <li> In overall, the scent and the result of the appliance of the gel is impressive.</li>
            <li> As a compromise, I tend to use this product to style before work and times when I don&#x27;t really care how great my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this product in the store</li>
            <li> I heard they were discontinuing this product, I wish I had bought more at that price</li>
            <li> Works as well as salon quality brands for much better value.</li>
            <li> Compared the AC, it&#x27;s more greasy, and doesn&#x27;t seem to either hold or hold up as well.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok when it has quality ingredients</li>
            <li> and it works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Been looking for the perfect hair product that wasn&#x27;t going to break the bank like \\&quot;American Crew\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> For my hair, love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and love it.</li>
            <li> dont know how this would work for guys with short hair, but I have about 5 inches on top, and it molds my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it will ship overseas and I can still look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love it, but I believe Suave is no longer producing this product.  </li>
            <li> I found it here on Amazon at an even better price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> So much better than using a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; product for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap but holds well and has a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products over the year.</li>
            <li> These worked OK.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t find any reason to give it more.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> but &#x27;healthy looking hair\\</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product can&#x27;t find an affordable substitute anywhere in stores.</li>
            <li> Great quality styling product without the high price.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, and effective.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, but I wish it had more hold to it, but perhaps I need to use more for my shorter hair..</li>
            <li> AC smells sweet, but almost in a honey type way which was nice.</li>
            <li> It holds pretty good if you apply it in wet/dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed the way I want it all day long... really great!</li>
            <li> Amazing prize, Great styling paste for the teenage boy or college student.</li>
            <li> and I find its best applied when dry.</li>
            <li> It works like a pomade, for me best when hair is nearly dry and still damp.</li>
            <li> This works better and is significantly cheaper than most of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brands.  </li>
            <li> Quality is very good although it seems to be a slightly different texture from the store bought.</li>
            <li> I picked up the Suave Styling Paste at Wal-mart (price is dirt cheap) and glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever at a fraction of the cost of other products.</li>
            <li> Leaves a natural-like texture and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on hair and remove when showering.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and is easy to wash out in the morning.</li>
            <li> I did notice a strong fruity smell when applying it</li>
            <li> Just does the job for me and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> The hold is strong, with a non-greasy finish.</li>
            <li> Has an exceptionally strong hold while still having a matte/dry look.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell is too strong, besides this quite greasy, and has no touch matte as indicated.</li>
            <li> Strong, Perfumed Smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a strong fragrance and not too sticky.</li>
            <li> It barely costs anything and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product - nice, light scent similar to their shampoo products for men.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I fell in love with this hair paste and love the non greasy and flexible look i wanted.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described!</li>
            <li> It gives hair a very natural look yet still has a good hold.</li>
            <li> The WEN is also great because it washes out really easily, your hands aren&#x27;t left sticky!  </li>
            <li> This one is great to use on damp hair for a more polished/gel-looking style and on dry hair for the matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has good hold and is not stiff.</li>
            <li> Part of me is worried it&#x27;ll be discontinued because its so cheap compared to the others.</li>
            <li> Such a great value compared to the leading brands.</li>
            <li> matte finish, cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> The styling paste is light and matte in texture.  </li>
            <li> This product is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> but, unlike Axe, it&#x27;s always smooth and silky in the container and never leaves clumps when applying.</li>
            <li> and I like a light matte hold for my hair.</li>
            <li> Cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> Cheap and does not hold.  </li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, getting compliments from the ladies all the time at the office...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of it and its cheap</li>
            <li> This fit the bill quite well and turned out to be a lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend buying this product its great</li>
            <li> I can get a nice straight look by just using a dab of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Dare to compare to some high-cost items, you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good putty for a while since my old line is not being made anymore.</li>
            <li> As far as hold and looks go I would rate it as just as good as AC.</li>
            <li> It works great, if you use the right amount it will keep your hair in shape all day and looks natural and non-clumpy.</li>
            <li> I live in Brazil, this ointment bothered by amazon, did an experiment to see if it worked as you say yourself, and to love this cream, my hair ta super gorgeous, already used many ointments, but this really turned my hair</li>
            <li> Works great, last long, and great price.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> It has about as much hold as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shaping paste (a slightly better product, but 7 times the cost of this per pot), and allows for easy shaping until it dries.</li>
            <li> , I like more of a light hold with a light shape to my hair and the paste provides that very well.</li>
            <li> This product works great all day long.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still a very good value, so in like a year and a half, when I run out of all 4 cans, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is clean, affordable, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Still not as easy to find as it could be, it is worth seeking out or just ordering on Amazon.</li>
            <li> In this case it&#x27;s a near perfect match for American Crew styling</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and manly - the American Crew lacks a fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought 2x 4 packs of this with a special 50% discount on the the purchase of 2.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the best if you don&#x27;t want to have your hair all gunky or hard.</li>
            <li> So I tried this Suave Paste on a whim - it was cheap enough to risk - and it seem to be the perfect merger of American Crew Fiber and Paste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- lasts well in outdoor full sun heat and doesn&#x27;t gloop or drip</li>
            <li> Still much cheaper than crew even using more.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Suave :)</li>
            <li> I finally ordered this styling paste after reading the good reviews it had.</li>
            <li> Leaves no sticky feeling on hair and really helps to stylish your look.</li>
            <li> Suave styling paste smells sweet almost in a sugar/fruit type way.</li>
            <li> As good as American Crew fiber paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more fragrant than I would prefer, and has a very fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> For a supposedly low quality brand, this is good quality hair product.</li>
            <li> I use the styling paste on damp hair every day and it is true to name</li>
            <li> Tried this about a year ago when I found it at a Target store as an alternative to American Crew fiber paste... loved it (and the price) then for some reason couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a great price compared to other products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 8-9 inches in length, this stuff gives my hair a solid hold for about the first 10 hours of day and kind of releases by the evening, which for me is what I desire because while I&#x27;m at work its a bit more executive/corporate looking and by the evening</li>
            <li> 2 stars for the great smell, other than that</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find it anymore locally (Super Target, Wal-Mart, Rite Aid, drugstores, etc.)  </li>
            <li> It is comparable to American crew fiber although the fiber do provide a better hold but also cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a great product that I feel is well worth the $11 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say the price is fantastic for this</li>
            <li> I think that the price is amazing and is better than any other competitor.</li>
            <li> This product on the other hand is very light and has a great natural hold.</li>
            <li> Works almost as good as American Crew Fiber/Forming Cream (yes, very very close in quality, but not quite there).</li>
            <li> This provide great hold while having less of a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> True to the label a nice medium hold with a matte finish, no problem lasting all day.</li>
            <li> Find it superior to higher priced products that I tried after the last one I had ran out.  </li>
            <li> Avoid touching your hair (or allowing other people to touch your hair), putting on headwear (helmet, hat, bandana, headphones, hoodie, etc.), or resting your head on anything (head rest, pillow, vehicle interior, etc.), and you might be able to pull off a *clean* styled look, else...</li>
            <li> This is the closest thing to the old formulation of Garnier&#x27;s Surf Wax (which they no longer make, and I used for years) and is the perfect product for those that want the ability to style their hair without a greasy mess (ie.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, smells great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about men&#x27;s hair products, but this stuff was cheap, so I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Works well, holds my hair in place, great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> This product along with the Suave Men&#x27;s Pomade paste produces such an amazing shiny but not oily hair style.  </li>
            <li> I would really recommend anyone who would like to try it and its really cheap.</li>
            <li> It gives you a more natural look in styling which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> My local store discontinued this product, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, and it&#x27;s good enough for me to keep buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> I laugh when I see the fancy brands for almost $20 a pop.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this one is even better than Crew and nearly $15-20 cheaper.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t near this cheap for 4 of them!</li>
            <li> but cheap enough if they love it</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price for this, especially if you buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> just fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> For the price...this stuff is pretty good...not as good as the American Crew but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> you got a DRY, NON-CLUMPY, FLEXIBLE hairdo with a MILD SHINE AND STRONG HOLD that everyone will love and make you look like a model or superstar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cut off most of my thin, fine locks back in March (for a modern pixie) and have since been on a mission to find the best products for my use.</li>
            <li> I use this right after I get out the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the right product!!!  </li>
            <li> With this product it is easy to spread evenly through the air and is easy to smooth the hair down.</li>
            <li> For how well this holds it washes out surprisingly easily, it feels likes it rinses out completely before I&#x27;ve even used shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great value compared to the expensive salon brands, does a better job</li>
            <li> I believe I found a permanent replacement for the American Crew Fiber, good bye old friend.</li>
            <li> Perhaps most importantly, though, is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like the stuff the barber shop tries to sell me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, not greasy, and has a natural look to it.</li>
            <li> Overall a good price conscious purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great... holds firm all day...but don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of holding hair and not looking a helmet of hair nor like a greasy mess</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use very much at all to style my hair.</li>
            <li> The AC forming cream smells very much like a manly hair product from the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very much to give my hair some texture.</li>
            <li> Good but a little bit too glossy</li>
            <li> Great, hard to find product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very straight hair, which can make it difficult to find a good hair product.</li>
            <li> The hold is not as strong, but it&#x27;s still good at giving a spiky or messy look in my short hair, and it&#x27;s precise enough for me to fine tune problem areas.</li>
            <li> Be aware their is a hint of fruity odor that comes off of it, but it never bothered me.</li>
            <li> Thanks Suave, and Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the same or better quality as the $15 paste my barber sells.</li>
            <li> Recently I have been going to target and finding that my favorite hair product hasn&#x27;t been stocked.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> This four pack will last me a while, but when it runs out I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I was pretty discouraged when it was removed from the market a year ago, so when I found it again I bought a years supply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair products.</li>
            <li> And because its so consistent, you can fine tune it be just applying more or less paste.</li>
            <li> but I need it for that first day</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, works as good as the much more expensive American Crew brand product that is similar.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a big deal to get them more.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> and I think so many have caught on that it is virtually the same product as Dove Men that Unilever has changed the packaging.</li>
            <li> I got 4 1.75 ounce containers of this for a buck and change more than 1 of the American Crew costs (with shipping).  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Most recently I was using Axe &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says:</li>
            <li> used to use American Crew Fiber, which had better hold but</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be more simple.  </li>
            <li> but I have tried many other Suave products and was definitely not disappointed by this.</li>
            <li> firm hold good price product</li>
            <li> I used to use WEN defining paste, and I loved that it would hold without the heavy or gel like weight.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product about a year and a half ago and was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not feel stiff, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, smells good, keeps my husband&#x27;s very thick, course, wiry hair in place,</li>
            <li> I put my hair straight back with a taper on the sides and on top  </li>
            <li> It gives hair a  matte finish, but with  a little more shine than the Fiber (a more natural look).</li>
            <li> me describe the positive aspects of this product.</li>
            <li> For everyday indications, I think this product is an economical solution that may not perform perfectly, but again you are not shelling out a ton of money for everyday hair styling at work.  </li>
            <li> It provides a nice, clean look and hold without looking greasy or hard.</li>
            <li> long on top).</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the more expensive pomade!</li>
            <li> Good hold, natural look, and cheaper than any other product out there (</li>
            <li> Switched over from Axe products, and this is just as good, if not better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair, but my hair has no texture naturally.</li>
            <li> I also used to use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream which had a nice soft texture and good hold, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this because they are becoming hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Works well, comes off easy, and holds with enough give.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with no shine and moderate hold that would be easy to apply in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I recommend giving this a try over some of the more expensive brands like Axe because it is as good or better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This styling paste is pretty decent, it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as AC products like fiber and forming cream</li>
            <li> I have relatively short medium to fine hair and it works very well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to give you a little control and texture, without it being sticky, heavy, glossy, or gummy, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t spend $17 a jar on aveda men&#x27;s styling matte finish pommade, so i found this stuff here and have been very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a shine and holds all day.</li>
            <li> Holds and styles well with hair, but does leave a white residue unless you smooth out the paste thoroughly with your hands.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hair does not feel sticky or crunchy; only a flawless, malleable (yet firm) hair style is left.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the price was SUBSTANTIALLY better than American Crew, getting more than twice the product for a few bucks less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works, but gives off a very sticky feel.  </li>
            <li> It holds and doesn&#x27;t form clumps, but really doesn&#x27;t style that well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is much cheaper than anything else I have tried for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am puerto rican/peruvuian just in case anyone wants a reference type thing.</li>
            <li> yet it holds very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly cheap compared to similar products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and unless you use too much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how it could be too much.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell, and likes the fact she can run her fingers in my hair without feeling like she held bacon; pomade gets really greasy.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it does really mix well into your hair.</li>
            <li> You really need to work it in.</li>
            <li> but when i have amazon who really cares.</li>
            <li> , it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use much (dime size amount on the fingertip), and it retains its hold all day.</li>
            <li> Works well and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> This paste hold hair really well but doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny coat.  </li>
            <li> and you have to really work it to get to the point that it disappears in your hair.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Holds up very well to weather.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative to the American Crew Molding Paste.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like how clumpy they were and how the hold was &#x27;meh&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Also very well priced.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and cannot find it at any of the stores around here, anymore.  </li>
            <li> and it kept drying out before I could use the whole container.</li>
            <li> This product is low sheen with a good hold, not for those looking for &amp;#34;the wet look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to American Crew Forming Cream, as it&#x27;s significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Much better value than some of the other hair products out there.  </li>
            <li> This holds ok at first but will go limp as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Seriously, that&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Hopefully with some experimentation on technique and with different hair lengths (I have medium to short hair) to see if it works better any certain way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend lightly wetting your hair before applying depending on how long your hair is.</li>
            <li> I will always buy this as long as it is still available.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the same gritty texture as the aveda pommade which give it a bit extra roughness and is more shiny than aveda&#x27;s but not bad.</li>
            <li> I was using Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, but my stylist told me I needed something more matte and less spikey.</li>
            <li> Less with a coupon) and get more than 3oz.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this more than the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched around from forming creams, pomades and gels over the years, looking for decent hold without my hair feeling and looking like a shiny helmet.</li>
            <li> While I have a couple, more expensive favorite go-to products, I like this.</li>
            <li> The selection at department stores is heavily weighted toward women&#x27;s hair products, and most companies seem uninterested in offering reasonably priced products for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Beeswax is one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li> To me this works better than the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> If you are on a tight budget, for sure try this.</li>
            <li> I hope that they keep making it forever and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a highly underrated styling paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sheen is high but not greasy.</li>
            <li> But the problem is finding the right paste, wax, or gel - as many can be hard to use on fine hair, leave a glossy residue, or weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, just wished it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a product that holds and works.  </li>
            <li> I use something a little better when going out.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and quickly style my thick but frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this Suave pomade to anyone who wants natural looking hold.</li>
            <li> Suave made a great men&#x27;s hair product that isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive and I can buy in bulk here.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair styling cream for several reasons the first being</li>
            <li> None have been able to deliver the matte finish that they have promised with a firm hold, except for for this Suave Styling Paste.</li>
            <li> Aveda and American Crew all of a distinct scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using heavily perfumed products, but I&#x27;m glad to report the smell dissipates after some wear.</li>
            <li> , I get pretty much the same hold &amp; look</li>
            <li> I would have liked it 5 star if it were not so thick.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable, specially when compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I think the Axe product (Axe Styling Cream Natural Understated Look 2.64 oz) is just a little better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this stuff.</li>
            <li> New to waxes and pastes</li>
            <li> I bought recently , and I expected better results.</li>
            <li> After years of using every men&#x27;s hair care product out there if the type from the high end stuff down the the big extra value sized goop of Dep from Wally I&#x27;ve found this provides the best amount of gold without making the hair stiff and shiny.</li>
            <li> Not a shiny look, very natural.</li>
            <li> I generally never write reviews unless they really impress, and these certainly have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I discovered Suave, my new favorite hair paste for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> For me, the Suave works better than the aforementioned products and is much less expensive, a great combination.  </li>
            <li> With the rebranding price increase depending on where you look you might check out the prices of the higher end American Crew brand items.</li>
            <li> Last time I bought AXE pomade, which was like 6 bucks or so; can&#x27;t remember exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things in the past and this product has ended up being my favorite, with a bonus of it being a fraction of the cost of comparable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product, hope this helps others save a few bucks!</li>
            <li> I usually do not write any reviews</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than any other I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Then I went to a hair stylist and with some simple techniques I got the results that were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Really all you have to do is use a hair dryer to shape your hair in the general direction and shape</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this product either way, I even use a little bit on my two-year-olds massive head of a hair :).</li>
            <li> Wow, was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> My hair is never stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own, my hair tends to be very limp and flat.</li>
            <li> Soft and creamy but waxier like the Fiber with a stiffer hold.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> i would recommend American Crew Fiber, which costs just as much as four of these</li>
            <li> I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued, since it is much cheaper than Crew defining paste and holds my hair just the same.  </li>
            <li> My hair moves in the wind naturally but returns to its place with this paste.</li>
            <li> She tried to sell me $15-20 products like Woody&#x27;s Matte Clay or American Crew Fiber, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Medium hold and matte finish give it a natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product, I have short hair</li>
            <li> On a whim I decided to purchase the Suave Mens Styling Paste from my local Wal Mart as it was priced very well at around $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets hair to stick together, without being sticky, to help form natural looking styling, when styled with your hands.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this stuff works better with longer hair at least it does when my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> As it shows on the package, it&#x27;s supposed to be like AC Defining Paste, so I won&#x27;t compare it directly to AC Fiber, but it does stand in well for it.</li>
            <li> There is no shine to my hair and my styling looks quite natural.</li>
            <li> This does not work up well in your hands - mine often formed chunks that would stick out in your hair (unless your are completely gray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave did send me a $5 coupon in the mail after I called them (Unilever) and I&#x27;ve tossed the rest.</li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair and it manage to keep my side tidy all day(I have a short/medium faux hawk).</li>
            <li> saw that this 4-pack of Suave had a really similar advertised quality, with a medium hold paste that even claims to compare to the American Crew product right on the label.</li>
            <li> It works well for me, but I have to be careful to use just the right amount or it can get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; throughout the day.</li>
            <li> take a little bit of the styling paste and spread it onto my finger tips, and then very lightly work it through my (dry) hair.</li>
            <li> last all day, cheap, i am used to have long hair and cut it short, this helps me have style all day.</li>
            <li> most hair products - a little dab goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> its alright, if u have thick soft hair with great volume this isnt going to work for you, the hold doesnt last long and to last long you need a lot of the product making your hair greasy looking which defeats the whole purpose of matte finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ask too much out of hair product, just to give it a little more control and look than my naturally bland hair looks.  </li>
            <li> A/C Fiber does work good, but weighs hair down and makes hair look too \\&quot;dull looking\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used American Crew&#x27;s Paste in the past but didn&#x27;t have the hold I was looking for - more</li>
            <li> It has a medium hold-not quite as strong as some other products I&#x27;ve used and with my stiff hair, I find I need to use a little more.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these, as I was  user of American Crew for over 2 years, and well this takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use a small fingers-worth with slightly damp hair, then after your hair is completely dry, style it, it works great.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I couldn&#x27;t find my normal jar of $20 hair product at a local grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Works a little bit better with wet hair.</li>
            <li> (Crew, Garnier Fructis, Axe, etc) in order to find a strong hold that does not make your hair hard or shiny.</li>
            <li> i used american crew fiber and i wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> It has a generic scent, which I could live without, but not anything overpowering.</li>
            <li> Be careful to always tighten the lid back on, or it will dry out easily.</li>
            <li> only about 2-3 inchs long so wetting first allows me to achieve the look i want.</li>
            <li> you compare the price you can get almost ten times as much of this for the cost of one jar of American Crew (at retail price).</li>
            <li> Really reminds me of the more expensive products that you see.</li>
            <li> medium hold is good for people with thick hair whose hair needs just a finishing touch, if you wan to style your hair and move it around get something with a stronger hold like Aamerican Crew Fiber,</li>
            <li> The white gel is very soft and spreadable in your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does the same job compared to expensive brands such as axe and american crew.</li>
            <li> This works great and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually used American Crew Fiber as it seemed to thicken my fine hair and wasn&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
            <li> I really have a hard time finding a paste or gel that I consistently like.  </li>
            <li> It gives a natural look so if you want a glossier look you&#x27;ll probably want to go a different route, pomades or something.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to keep your hair fluffed and keep it in place but still look natural, I would try a different product.  </li>
            <li> Like some have said, it gives that natural look instead of all greasy and such.</li>
            <li> I tried this paste and it is very similar to my old putty.</li>
            <li> You can barely feel the stuff in your hair</li>
            <li> I have used Old Spice&#x27;s various hair products, also tried the line of Axe hair products.</li>
            <li> Waterless paste consistency that solidifies in your hair too quickly, particularly when used with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not really attractive either.</li>
            <li> Less hold, and doesn&#x27;t get the defined style look when hair gets grouped together, but better than ending up with embarrassing flakes after a few hours when the paste dries and breaks up.</li>
            <li> If you like to style without the crazy wet gel look, and be able to rinse clean</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this stuff I got it at Target for less than $3.00</li>
            <li> its a casual loose look that still has a good hold.</li>
            <li> think I get similar style without paste, just using moist hands and running it through my hair (short straight Asian hair) similarly.</li>
            <li> The product is much lighter than other styling cremes yet works just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful not to rub too much into any one area, the trick is to spread a little bit around evenly so my hair still looks natural, yet has some much needed shape and texture.</li>
            <li> I wish my local retailers still sold this styling paste, but at least it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
            <li> does not dry hair.</li>
            <li> Very small amount is needed for just some light hold on short hair.</li>
            <li> considering the next closest product is about the same cost as 4 of these pucks, and works nearly the same.</li>
            <li> The suave/dove product can be equal or less than in price (per ounce) than those higher end products (like American Crew) now.</li>
            <li> Compared to other ones (American Crew and Axe) which are way more expensive and also stink, this is pure gold.</li>
            <li> For several years, I&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber for getting my short hair just right on weekends or when going out, but I used another product for everyday styling to save money.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff better than any of the hair products I&#x27;ve had for the past few years that ranged from $5 to $40 in price.</li>
            <li> I simply wash my hair, rarely do I blow dry it anymore, I run a little product through it once it dries to give it texture and presto - I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, it has a nice matte finish, but you can still work your hair once its dry, so you get the casual but refined look</li>
            <li> I like that it is cheap, but I don&#x27;t think it holds as well as other ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> This is very weak as far as hold, doesn&#x27;t give texture and is too light</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a few years and it is just as good as the expensive hair products.  </li>
            <li> The only two negatives are that it&#x27;s getting impossible to find locally at retail and the Amazon price with shipping works out to about $7/jar, more than double the normal retail price.  </li>
            <li> I want people to take me a little more serious in meetings and it doesn&#x27;t work so well when I look like I&#x27;m in a boy band.</li>
            <li> It holds very well without making your hair too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it is much cheaper then the usual suave product I used, and I figured how different can it be?  </li>
            <li> i like the hold but the white paste makes my hair look grey or white.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although by default, this is the same price as my local store ($2.88 for a single \\&quot;can\\&quot;), I buy this from Amazon because Amazon often has coupons</li>
            <li> , it just makes you&#x27;re hair greasy and flat..</li>
            <li> I started using the crew brad for my hair because its doesn&#x27;t want to stay flat.  </li>
            <li> and it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I found it on amazon, but am a bit disappointed that you are required to buy them in 4-packs and that the price is not as good as when I got it at Target.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up the same way as some waxier pastes will, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky or dry.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t accidentally leave it open or it will all dry out.</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to the American Crew version that is at least twice as much.  </li>
            <li> The four pack should last me a long long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of product over the years and besides the crazy expensive salon product this stuff works the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless other hair products that would somewhat match the same consistency of the Fiber I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> On occasion though, I do find that this specific product is sometimes sold out at my local grocery or Walmart stores, so when that happens I either have to get some other brand</li>
            <li> It was once the same gray color packaging as the other product but now has changed to blue.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place, keeps it soft, and leaves little if any buildup.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find it hard to find these in stores and really like them for doing my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through the gambit (both cheap and expensive).</li>
            <li> I usually can get it at Wal-Mart for $3 or so and it&#x27;ll last me nearly 6 months.  </li>
            <li> dried out - old product</li>
            <li> No icky slick &amp;#34;greaser&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I am set for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> I just hope it stays around a long time and is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> but I would find that when left in colder surroundings it would stiffen up and would become a lot harder to apply</li>
            <li> I work 12 hour shifts and on the humid days and long nights I do wish it was a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> Also its definitely a matte finish, doesn&#x27;t look shiny, wet, or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hairstylist -- just a guy.  </li>
            <li> Big plus: it has no real scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I know I help my stylist every time I buy their product but good grief</li>
            <li> I feel it should be little soft so that it could move easily in dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the Suave styling paste 18-24 months ago when I tired of paying large $$$ for both Redkin and American Crew hair paste.  </li>
            <li> As long as they do, and I&#x27;m wearing my hair this way, I&#x27;ll keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew&#x27;s Fiber product for the past 8 years as it had been the only product that I felt left my hair feeling and looking the way I want it.</li>
            <li> Its also reworkable but as with any other hair care product it will not hold as well the second time.</li>
            <li> I got this paste for styling my hair when its dry and straightened</li>
            <li> a dry, matte effect, is all I needed.</li>
            <li> Can recommend if you want dry looking hair</li>
            <li> I found this stuff at Walmart about 6 months ago and decided to give it a try because it was inexpensive, and I gotta say, it gives me the hold I want from my hair, whether I put it in with dry or damp hair.</li>
            <li> apply well to dry hair.</li>
            <li> If I needed to fix my hair during the day, I couldn&#x27;t do it with dry</li>
            <li> This gives a bit of a dry</li>
            <li> My only complaint so far is the smell.</li>
            <li> Also, after a few days it sort of pills in the container, which makes it even more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a 5th star was because I think it&#x27;s smell could be a littler better (it does not smell bad at all, just not particularly fragrant).</li>
            <li> Occasionally if I put it in and neglect to work it enough, it may cause my hair to be a bit stiff, but even then just running my fingers through a couple times gets the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Get months from a single tin.  </li>
            <li> Only a few products work well with my hair since I have very bushy and thick hair.</li>
            <li> He has tried Bumble and Bumble down to drug store ones and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t smell too feminine and has hold without clunkiness and no shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was getting only one since the price was a little lower than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I end up using less of it compared to the American Crew equivilant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the past several years I have used American Crew hair styling products and saw this</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that i could no longer find this item at the local stores, I really love the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> A pack of 4 will probably last me a year and a half, but beats paying others&#x27; prices.</li>
            <li> I put a little on after getting out of the shower and it gives a moderate hold all day.  </li>
            <li> What I found was not only less expensive, but it&#x27;s easier to work with (white and creamy in your hand), but as soon as it hits your hair, it becomes invisible and has the same effect that my old brand had...</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, probably bc of the low cost (low margins).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had enough - I needed to find a replacement, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending THAT much on a product that merely kept my hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second round of 4 containers</li>
            <li> The price of this product used to be roughly $12 for a pack of four...</li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t notice it a few minutes later and nobody has commented about it</li>
            <li> BUT it can get to glossy if your not too careful.</li>
            <li> Rub it in hands, get them a bit wet, and put it in not-dry, but not soaking wet, hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that wet look</li>
            <li> You can still get a wet look if you leave your hair wet when applying it.</li>
            <li> All others are too wet or liquidy.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan of is the smell.</li>
            <li> I find that if your hair is slightly dampened, smear a nickel size between fingers, slightly wet your fingers and rub them together, then go at it, you don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;grey look\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others I like but give off a strong or unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the trick--and for less than half the price of American Crew paste.</li>
            <li> Was using gel prior to this product and just didn&#x27;t like the wet, slick, crunchy look/feeling of it, so I came across this</li>
            <li> I used to use various Axe hair products, but found it slowly became more expensive for a fairly small amount of product when you consider that half of their jars are hollow.</li>
            <li> This is not greasy or flaky, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying the high price for goop to keep my hair looking neat.</li>
            <li> I was just used to the heavier and stiffer paste of other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> If I want EXTREME HOLD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the other chealp grocery store hair products and none of them can compare.</li>
            <li> at first I couldn&#x27;t get it to do what I wanted, because I was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but truthfully it&#x27;s not the same.  </li>
            <li> I chose to buy this product due to</li>
            <li> It does not hold your hair like other products can.</li>
            <li> On the downside, it is a little tough to wash off your hands, and each container doesn&#x27;t come with much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possibly due to the high heat we&#x27;ve been having, but this is pretty much worthless to me.</li>
            <li> Few years back before I transitioned to Suave Styling Paste, I was using Axe&#x27;s Messy look hair paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really hard to find anything that performs similarly to American Crew styling products.</li>
            <li> A small dime sized amount is enough to hold your hair firm.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce that extreme shine like other products do and isn&#x27;t sticky once dried.  </li>
            <li> I use American Crew Fiber and lately I just can&#x27;t upkeep $13-15 per jar.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and I think is is an average men&#x27;s product with average results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average hair product.  </li>
            <li> It works well on my short, thick hair.</li>
            <li> which doesn&#x27;t really go well with business casual.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down our hair either.</li>
            <li> Not to be harsh, but it&#x27;s like the rest of Suave&#x27;s products - does the trick, but I prefer other brands.</li>
            <li> And a lot less pricey.</li>
            <li> think this product is comparable to Crew Fiber, with perhaps slightly less hold.</li>
            <li> (my hair is typically between 1-2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> or I have to opt for one of the expensive American Crew Fiber products at my local Sport Clips.  </li>
            <li> The hold and ability to style hair is a slight disadvantage.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would have less of a paste feel.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is about half the price</li>
            <li> I wish this Suave product gave a slightly stronger hold.</li>
            <li> It is almost half the price of the axe pommade, and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> it holds well but doesn&#x27;t get overly stiff like some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> I use about 3-4 pea size and rub it in my palm first like crazy.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair tight, barber cut</li>
            <li> It has a matte finish and if you apply less, it can add volume and have a weak (dynamic?)</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of both expensive and inexpensive products over the years trying to find one that holds my puffy hair down without looking too slick.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;-Only use a little paste.</li>
            <li> I repeat this process of working in a little at a time about 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was using it on wet hair (which made my hair remain looking wet,clumpy, and hard)</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as a Crew product but, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat 4 containers.  </li>
            <li> When applied with towel dried hair, it creates a gel look.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying through the nose for American Crew products</li>
            <li> I feel like the product&#x27;s hold wears off after a few hours rather than holding all day.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> But it does work just as well, and it is usually priced 1/3 or 1/4 of the other products!</li>
            <li> It is ever so slightly thinner (I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m putting it correctly.</li>
            <li> I have a thick head of hair, and I am required to keep a hat on outdoors due to a uniform requirement.  </li>
            <li> Pomade will make your hair stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I like it because his hair isn&#x27;t stiff like it was with gel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a stiff or medium hold on my hair</li>
            <li> husband likes this paste because it holds his hair in place without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling stiff, sticky, and greasy, and makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> the texture of the paste was too stiff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy and no strong smell either.</li>
            <li> This is a lot like American Crew Fiber, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought a jar of this sauve paste and found that it works at least as well as any of the Axe products for much less money.</li>
            <li> It does hold well with very little product used each time and does not make hair feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> ,  I would use it after my hair dried (but it was too hard to shape),  </li>
            <li> Mine is usually</li>
            <li> I therefore bought a few 4-packs just in case!</li>
            <li> My hair without this product usually straightens out after a day(starts getting oily)</li>
            <li> After spending a small fortune on mens hair products I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Usually for me it&#x27;s about 15 minutes after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> Although I do like American Crew Fiber, that stuff is EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> The cost of the product is a definite plus since comparable salon products can be 4-5 times as expensive.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair in one place without the slick look.</li>
            <li> Only matched by expensive products like Crew.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insane to spend that much money on a tiny tin of hair goop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming from using Redken Work Hard Molding Paste For Men.</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores though</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding this product in retail stores and when I did it was $4-$5 per unit.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t make your hair hard, sticky, or oily...  </li>
            <li> It was hard to work into my hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s really hard to complain.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these in stores lately.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be discontinued, at least I can not find it any longer in stores.</li>
            <li> I might re-apply if I&#x27;m going out after work, but it lasts me through the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen it in box stores lately</li>
            <li> I went to at least 8 stores (supermarkets and drug stores) and it was nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li> And the value is just crazy, the 4 pack should last you for almost a year.</li>
            <li> This has been an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather thick and poofs a bit when I come out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really thick</li>
            <li> I have thick and wave hair.</li>
            <li> with the AC Fiber I usually apply all these paste style products on my damp hair, the Suave Paste went on well and spreads well on your finger tips (that&#x27;s what she said!)</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is it looks like I&#x27;ll have to order it in bulk here on Amazon from now on, as I can hardly find it in Wal-Mart&#x27;s stores</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The closest thing I&#x27;ve found to Crew Molding Paste and definitely less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find in local stores, which implies to me that Suave may discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This paste has serious hold, I put it in</li>
            <li> Like other styling products, it suffers from a flaw where it dries brittle and flakes off with any contact, and you wind up with what looks like severe dandruff.</li>
            <li> VERY hard for me to tell the difference between the way this looks, feels, and works vs. the stuff where I get my hair cut that costs $30 for 1.5 oz.  </li>
            <li> Was tired of using gel and always having a &amp;#34;wet-head&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> We hate going to Walmart, but that was the only place we could find this product.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying almost $20 a tin for hair stuff, so I decided to try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other alternatives to the crazy expensive Crew grooming cream.</li>
            <li> But since crew is expensive I got this.  </li>
            <li> but I could not find anything that wasnt really expensive.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i cannot find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but on Amazon now.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried it, so I was skeptical and bought 8 of them for $8.22 when it was on sale.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fairly expensive</li>
            <li> so I was afraid it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Then just get through your hair from roots up by just rubbing like crazy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the axe stuff is so expensive!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with</li>
            <li> I really hated the jar they came in too: over-sized and bulky.</li>
            <li> Worst hair paste I have ever tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this hair styling cream for several reasons the first being it holds well but doesn&#x27;t get overly stiff like some of the other products out there. It gives you a more natural look in styling which is a bonus. I would recommend lightly wetting your hair before applying depending on how long your hair is. Mine is usually only about 2-3 inchs long so wetting first allows me to achieve the look i want. This is my second round of 4 containers and I dont see any reason to stop using it. Be aware their is a hint of fruity odor that comes off of it, but it never bothered me.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is definitely good! I would have liked it 5 star if it were not so thick. I feel it should be little soft so that it could move easily in dry hair. However, once in, it holds hair nicely. Can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as a Crew product but, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat 4 containers.  It does work well.  I was just used to the heavier and stiffer paste of other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> really good quality, like the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best if you don&#x27;t want to have your hair all gunky or hard. Leaves a natural-like texture and easy to wash out. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. It&#x27;s inexpensive, but gets the job done, and the scent is neutral. My local store discontinued this product, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> I work in television. On air 5 dats a week and this is the best. Hard to find in stores, probably bc of the low cost (low margins). Perfect texture. Part of me is worried it&#x27;ll be discontinued because its so cheap compared to the others. Thanks Suave, and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product. Hold isn&#x27;t greasy or anything. Occasionally if I put it in and neglect to work it enough, it may cause my hair to be a bit stiff, but even then just running my fingers through a couple times gets the desired effect. Such a great value compared to the leading brands.</li>
            <li> This is the same or better quality as the $15 paste my barber sells.</li>
            <li> Great product! Cheap, easy to use, and effective.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying the high price for goop to keep my hair looking neat. I usually used American Crew Fiber as it seemed to thicken my fine hair and wasn&#x27;t crunchy. I&#x27;d used American Crew&#x27;s Paste in the past but didn&#x27;t have the hold I was looking for - more greasy - sort of the consistency of the stuff mechanics use to get car crapola from their hands. So I tried this Suave Paste on a whim - it was cheap enough to risk - and it seem to be the perfect merger of American Crew Fiber and Paste. Soft and creamy but waxier like the Fiber with a stiffer hold. Must be the beeswax. Pleasantly surprised. Perfect for thinning or fine hair if you desire the matte finish and no crunch. Oh. And a lot less pricey.</li>
            <li> matte finish, cheap, it works. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I used to use the yellow Axe paste until I started troubleshooting what have me acne on my head. Changed to this Suave product and all is well. Doesn&#x27;t have a shiny finish. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the closest thing to the old formulation of Garnier&#x27;s Surf Wax (which they no longer make, and I used for years) and is the perfect product for those that want the ability to style their hair without a greasy mess (ie. pomade.) It smells great, lasts the whole day, and is inexpensive for what you get. I bought a 4-pack, and was really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I used to use the AXE Pomade, but that stuff went through the roof price wise.  This paste is white, but leaves no white residue once you&#x27;ve put it in your hair.  It holds very well without making your hair too stiff.  I really enjoy this!</li>
            <li> Comparing this to pomade, it&#x27;s great if you want hair you can run your fingers through.  Pomade will make your hair stiff and sticky.  This paste makes your hair pliable and not brittle.</li>
            <li> dried out - old product</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.  The price of this product used to be roughly $12 for a pack of four...now it&#x27;s $30!  What changed to make it $18 more expensive?  This product was a great deal for the price.  You&#x27;re much better off spending a bit more to get a better quality product now.  I&#x27;m definitely switching to another brand unless the price drops.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say the price is fantastic for this so I had to try it. I hoped it would be the magic bullet for my hair that has never done anything I liked. While it hasn&#x27;t been the cure all it has been very good. It does hold well with very little product used each time and does not make hair feel crunchy. I did notice a strong fruity smell when applying it, however I don&#x27;t notice it a few minutes later and nobody has commented about it so I&#x27;m under the impression it is not off putting/noticeable. Since the best deal was a 4-pack I&#x27;ll be using it for a while. Hopefully with some experimentation on technique and with different hair lengths (I have medium to short hair) to see if it works better any certain way. For how well this holds it washes out surprisingly easily, it feels likes it rinses out completely before I&#x27;ve even used shampoo. I would recommend giving this a try, if you can find it in a store locally do that so you can test it out with just 1 can instead of buying 4, I could not find it locally.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t spend $17 a jar on aveda men&#x27;s styling matte finish pommade, so i found this stuff here and have been very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***note- I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere within 50 miles of me, walmart, target, etc., leading me to think they&#x27;ve pulled them from the shelves as suave does tend to do if there&#x27;s no profit in it, so I went ahead and bought a two year supply just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel, mousse, muds don&#x27;t work on my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- great hold&lt;br /&gt;- non greasy&lt;br /&gt;- good neutral fruit scent&lt;br /&gt;- lasts well in outdoor full sun heat and doesn&#x27;t gloop or drip&lt;br /&gt;- works on asian hair&lt;br /&gt;- 1/4 the price of american crew and aveda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- cannot find in store&lt;br /&gt;- murmurings of being discontinued&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t have the same gritty texture as the aveda pommade which give it a bit extra roughness and is more shiny than aveda&#x27;s but not bad.</li>
            <li> True to the label a nice medium hold with a matte finish, no problem lasting all day.</li>
            <li> I want more. This styling paste is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> its alright, if u have thick soft hair with great volume this isnt going to work for you, the hold doesnt last long and to last long you need a lot of the product making your hair greasy looking which defeats the whole purpose of matte finish. i would recommend American Crew Fiber, which costs just as much as four of these so you can tell its product is great. i used american crew fiber and i wanted to try something new so im switching back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this medium hold is good for people with thick hair whose hair needs just a finishing touch, if you wan to style your hair and move it around get something with a stronger hold like Aamerican Crew Fiber, im donating all of mine because it wont work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of product over the years and besides the crazy expensive salon product this stuff works the best. It doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a shine and holds all day. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I found this product at target a year ago and was througholy impressed by how well it held my hair.  It immediately became a favorite of mine. Recently I have been going to target and finding that my favorite hair product hasn&#x27;t been stocked.  I hope it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued, since it is much cheaper than Crew defining paste and holds my hair just the same.  I therefore bought a few 4-packs just in case!</li>
            <li> Holds and styles well with hair, but does leave a white residue unless you smooth out the paste thoroughly with your hands.</li>
            <li> Its a good hair product BUT it can get to glossy if your not too careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming from using Redken Work Hard Molding Paste For Men. The RedKen is better, but it doesn&#x27;t ship with Prime and it&#x27;s expensive. This product works very well, and it&#x27;s good enough for me to keep buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> My fav hairstyling product. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> Great product and a fantastic price. I could no longer find it in stores but Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> was impressed by how well it held my hair, it does not give off the greasy effect which is my favorite part!</li>
            <li> This styling paste is perfect for people with short hair that are looking for the bedhead look. This is not greasy or flaky, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years now, and it continues to work great. Just work it in, comb it out, and you&#x27;re good for the day!</li>
            <li> this is the only hair product that makes my hair cool.i tried everything else and doesnt work. hard to find in stores though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to crew but Does not hold as well so you end up using slightly more.  Still much cheaper than crew even using more.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be discontinued, at least I can not find it any longer in stores. I just hope they keep it on Amazon. As long as they do, and I&#x27;m wearing my hair this way, I&#x27;ll keep buying it! Quality is very good although it seems to be a slightly different texture from the store bought. Not enough to care about though because it works great!</li>
            <li> I like this better than the pricier ones. Just does the job for me and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I&#x27;ve had others I like but give off a strong or unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Great product but one star review for what I feel is a misleading marketing process and price hike. This item has been discontinued but rebranded Dove&#x27;s Men Care Fortifying Styling Paste. With the rebranding price increase depending on where you look you might check out the prices of the higher end American Crew brand items. The suave/dove product can be equal or less than in price (per ounce) than those higher end products (like American Crew) now. Keep in mind this is 1.5 ounces only so compare it in price by ounce and not by cost per container.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, smells great.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- You have to use a lot to get your hair to stay in the style you want&lt;br /&gt;- When you use a lot, your hair looks greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding this product in retail stores and when I did it was $4-$5 per unit. To find the quantity of product at such a good value was impressive. The shipping was quick and the product arrived in perfect condition. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well, comes off easy, and holds with enough give. It is very affordable, specially when compared to other brands. But it used to be a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I look sexy as a result of this product! #justsayin</li>
            <li> This is the best of the all the hair products I have tried and it seems to last forever. Must buy.</li>
            <li> This remains the only hair paste I&#x27;ll use. It provides a nice, clean look and hold without looking greasy or hard. My hair moves in the wind naturally but returns to its place with this paste. I have tried probably a dozen others but always return to this blue label Suave.</li>
            <li> Love this product! And a good price point</li>
            <li> I used to use Got2beinplay scultpting paste.  They downsized the product, but not the price.  So I looked for something else.  What I found was not only less expensive, but it&#x27;s easier to work with (white and creamy in your hand), but as soon as it hits your hair, it becomes invisible and has the same effect that my old brand had... maybe even better.  I have fine, thin hair.  This gives it volume and texture, with a matte finish.  No shine.  Hair does not feel stiff, and it smells good.  Perfect.  I laugh when I see the fancy brands for almost $20 a pop.  It&#x27;s insane to spend that much money on a tiny tin of hair goop.</li>
            <li> This in my opinion creates the perfect hold for my hair. It is like a pomade without being too sticky and goopy. It is better than gel and it doesn&#x27;t give you that shiny 80s look. Great product Suave, please don&#x27;t discontinue!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ask too much out of hair product, just to give it a little more control and look than my naturally bland hair looks.  At the price point, you just can&#x27;t beat this stuff. I usually can get it at Wal-Mart for $3 or so and it&#x27;ll last me nearly 6 months.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have tried various brands over the years (Crew, Garnier Fructis, Axe, etc) in order to find a strong hold that does not make your hair hard or shiny. None have been able to deliver the matte finish that they have promised with a firm hold, except for for this Suave Styling Paste. It is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me describe the positive aspects of this product. The white gel is very soft and spreadable in your hands. Therefore you do not have to worry about having clumps of hair product in your hair. A small dime sized amount is enough to hold your hair firm. Your hair does not feel sticky or crunchy; only a flawless, malleable (yet firm) hair style is left. Suave mate finish is the best hair product I have every used in my life!! I hope that they keep making it forever and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this more than the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great product!  Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Really reminds me of the more expensive products that you see. I&#x27;ve been using for two years and will not stop</li>
            <li> The styling paste is light and matte in texture.  It goes on easy, but I wish it had more hold to it, but perhaps I need to use more for my shorter hair..</li>
            <li> I switched from american crew to this to save money. It works well for me, but I have to be careful to use just the right amount or it can get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; throughout the day. Also, I have found it works best in my hair right after a shower with my hair mostly-but not completely-dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive products and none of them hold the style to my hair like Suave Styling Paste does.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff. Clean scent and cheaper than the alternatives while still being just as good, for all my purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched around from forming creams, pomades and gels over the years, looking for decent hold without my hair feeling and looking like a shiny helmet. This stuff does the trick--and for less than half the price of American Crew paste. It doesn&#x27;t build up the same way as some waxier pastes will, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky or dry. A great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I couldn&#x27;t find my normal jar of $20 hair product at a local grocery store.  This works better and is significantly cheaper than most of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brands.  I exclusively use this product now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably a dozen of the &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; level styling pastes to try and find a cheaper alternative to Aveda. This doesn&#x27;t have the great scent that the Aveda paste has (hence 4 stars and not 5), but the texture is perfect. I&#x27;d say this one is even better than Crew and nearly $15-20 cheaper. It gives a natural look so if you want a glossier look you&#x27;ll probably want to go a different route, pomades or something. But I highly recommend this product either way, I even use a little bit on my two-year-olds massive head of a hair :).</li>
            <li> Too junky . Does not hold well either, it just makes you&#x27;re hair greasy and flat.. Worst hair paste I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product is a fantastic value. I was using Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, but my stylist told me I needed something more matte and less spikey. She tried to sell me $15-20 products like Woody&#x27;s Matte Clay or American Crew Fiber, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for my hair. I found this product on Amazon and bought it because of the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The product works great, has a nice matte look and doesn&#x27;t make my hair spikey. The price is unbeatable ($2-3 / jar), especially when compared to competing products that cost $15-20 for the same amount of product. This four pack will last me a while, but when it runs out I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Switched from american crew.  AC was alot more expensive then this stuff, the only reason I wanted to switch was to save money.  This styling paste is pretty decent, it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as AC products like fiber and forming cream but this gets the job done.  It does not hold as well as AC does later in the day.  The paste smells nice and it spreads nicely on your hands and in your hair.  saving Alot of money by getting this stuff.</li>
            <li> Product holds hair as needed without the flaking or stiffness.  Great value compared to the expensive salon brands, does a better job</li>
            <li> Good hold, natural look, and cheaper than any other product out there (but it was only $12 for the 4-pack when I bought it). Be careful to always tighten the lid back on, or it will dry out easily.</li>
            <li> I like the multi-pack, as the product is good.  Also a good size as you can take them on an airplane in your quart sized baggie.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Got for it.</li>
            <li> I habitually used American Crew Styling Cream for years - even as the price crept up to $15 a container. I&#x27;d had enough - I needed to find a replacement, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending THAT much on a product that merely kept my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that this 4-pack of Suave had a really similar advertised quality, with a medium hold paste that even claims to compare to the American Crew product right on the label. I also noticed that the price was SUBSTANTIALLY better than American Crew, getting more than twice the product for a few bucks less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Styling Paste has made me a believer - and I&#x27;m going to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The texture is firmer - I end up using less of it compared to the American Crew equivilant.&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is pleasant and manly - the American Crew lacks a fragrance (that I&#x27;ve ever noticed)&lt;br /&gt;3. The price is phenomenal, comparatively.&lt;br /&gt;4. The hold is strong, with a non-greasy finish. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever at a fraction of the cost of other products. I was pretty discouraged when it was removed from the market a year ago, so when I found it again I bought a years supply. It has the perfect amount of hold without the shine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about men&#x27;s hair products, but this stuff was cheap, so I figured I would give it a try.  It works, but gives off a very sticky feel.  If you are looking for a product to keep your hair fluffed and keep it in place but still look natural, I would try a different product.  It holds and doesn&#x27;t form clumps, but really doesn&#x27;t style that well.</li>
            <li> I got this paste for styling my hair when its dry and straightened (i&#x27;m a dude). Last time I bought AXE pomade, which was like 6 bucks or so; can&#x27;t remember exactly. It wasn&#x27;t near this cheap for 4 of them! This Suave pomade smells good and works well. Like some have said, it gives that natural look instead of all greasy and such. If I want EXTREME HOLD I use my got to be glued(german company, yellow tube) this stuff is like cement let me tell you lol. I would recommend this Suave pomade to anyone who wants natural looking hold. It is white paste and not very solid like some that you need a pick axe to scoop some out. Thanks Amazon and Suave :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair products. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things in the past and this product has ended up being my favorite, with a bonus of it being a fraction of the cost of comparable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is comparable to Crew Fiber, with perhaps slightly less hold. (4) packs of the Suave product on Amazon.com being cheaper than I puck of Crew Fiber at a box store. This product is low sheen with a good hold, not for those looking for &amp;#34;the wet look&amp;#34;. I keep my hair tight, barber cut and I find its best applied when dry. Smells nice and holds well for most of the day. I might re-apply if I&#x27;m going out after work, but it lasts me through the work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen it in box stores lately so I was afraid it was discontinued. Behold! Amazon.com to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Great, hard to find product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is much cheaper than anything else I have tried for my hair. Has an exceptionally strong hold while still having a matte/dry look.</li>
            <li> After overpaying for Axe paste, and being super-disappointed in its rubbery and clumpy nature, I switched to Suave&#x27;s paste. Forget the price- that speaks for itself (it&#x27;s a steal) - and focus on performance. This stuff is awesome. Its truly a paste but, unlike Axe, it&#x27;s always smooth and silky in the container and never leaves clumps when applying. It has a generic scent, which I could live without, but not anything overpowering. The hold is spot-on. And because its so consistent, you can fine tune it be just applying more or less paste. No shiny hair either. It has a matte finish and if you apply less, it can add volume and have a weak (dynamic?) hold.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an outstanding product. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell is too strong, besides this quite greasy, and has no touch matte as indicated.I bought recently , and I expected better results.</li>
            <li> While this stuff works in a pinch, it is no substitute for Crew fiber or another quality product. I will not buy again. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a highly underrated styling paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great matte finish, lasts all day, and it is very inexpensive for the quality of product you&#x27;re getting. Great stuff! :)</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly.I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 months now. Rub it in hands, get them a bit wet, and put it in not-dry, but not soaking wet, hair. Holds all day, washes out easily. Also, great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside I have with it is the intense smell it has. It&#x27;s sort of a fruity hair-producty smell. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not really attractive either. But, for the value, I&#x27;m not too worried about it considering the next closest product is about the same cost as 4 of these pucks, and works nearly the same.</li>
            <li> I use this right after I get out the shower. My hair is rather thick and poofs a bit when I come out of the shower. I am puerto rican/peruvuian just in case anyone wants a reference type thing. My hair without this product usually straightens out after a day(starts getting oily) but I need it for that first day frizz. I use about 3-4 pea size and rub it in my palm first like crazy. Then just get through your hair from roots up by just rubbing like crazy. Works great, last long, and great price. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> After spending a small fortune on mens hair products I decided to give this a try. My boyfriend loves it! The smell is great too, not overpowering. Definitely a cost-efficient hair product.</li>
            <li> Good price for some of the best paste -- equally as good as competitor brands! And for the price, it&#x27;s like buying it at Walmart!</li>
            <li> I live in Brazil, this ointment bothered by amazon, did an experiment to see if it worked as you say yourself, and to love this cream, my hair ta super gorgeous, already used many ointments, but this really turned my hair, I loved the smooth ointment recommend it to everyone. My hair is 6 cm, this ointment is wavy and fell super good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;has a dry, matte effect, is all I needed.</li>
            <li> The closest thing I&#x27;ve found to Crew Molding Paste and definitely less expensive. Works well and nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good putty for a while since my old line is not being made anymore. I tried this paste and it is very similar to my old putty. It has good hold and is not stiff. I don&#x27;t have to use very much at all to style my hair. I recommend giving this a try over some of the more expensive brands like Axe because it is as good or better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I started using the crew brad for my hair because its doesn&#x27;t want to stay flat.  But since crew is expensive I got this.  Its not as good as Crew but it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is clean, affordable, and it works like a charm. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and can never see myself using anything else. No icky slick &amp;#34;greaser&amp;#34; look. It makes you hair look and feel as if it is just magically staying in place on its own. Plus the stuff smells AWESOME. Bottom line...put this stuff in your hair!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair product for an even better price.It is ever so slightly thinner (I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m putting it correctly. It requires a little more to get the job done, is what I mean.) than let&#x27;s say, American Crew, or Bed Head. But it does work just as well, and it is usually priced 1/3 or 1/4 of the other products!</li>
            <li> This holds ok at first but will go limp as the day goes on. It&#x27;s possibly due to the high heat we&#x27;ve been having, but this is pretty much worthless to me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It doesn&#x27;t produce that extreme shine like other products do and isn&#x27;t sticky once dried.  It doesn&#x27;t give that wet look if you are looking for that, go with their pomade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other alternatives to the crazy expensive Crew grooming cream. Suave is by far the best of them.</li>
            <li> Works almost as good as American Crew Fiber/Forming Cream (yes, very very close in quality, but not quite there). I say both Fiber and Forming Cream because Suave Styling Paste is like a middle ground between the two. I used American Crew Fiber for several years, and have permanently switched to this. At a 1/4th of the price? Yes, please. Buy a four pack and style your hair for two to three years for the price of one American Crew cannister.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s the BOMB! Cheap, smells good, keeps my husband&#x27;s very thick, course, wiry hair in place, albeit he has to use quite a bit. I like it because his hair isn&#x27;t stiff like it was with gel and he can re-comb it when needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, works as good as the much more expensive American Crew brand product that is similar. I will always buy this as long as it is still available.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both like this product. We have tried 5 or 6 different brands, both inexpensive and pricy, but have found them to be either too sticky or they don&#x27;t hold the style. This paste has a good texture and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong. It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh down our hair either.</li>
            <li> Only a few products work well with my hair since I have very bushy and thick hair. With this product I have total control over my hair and have the ability to style it any way I want without using a ton of the product. It comes of easily and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  You can barely feel the stuff in your hair yet it holds very well.  It smells good too!  I&#x27;ll buy another four pack when I am on my last container!  I just wish they sold it in stores!</li>
            <li> You can buy 8 containers for about the same price (~$32.00) from Soap.com (found it as Suave&#x27;s only listed online retailer from their website). Love the product, hope this helps others save a few bucks! Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write any reviews but I had to for this product. I was looking for a good hair product that would give me the look I wanted but I could not find anything that wasnt really expensive. I tried hair gels but i did not like the greasy look. I finally ordered this styling paste after reading the good reviews it had. After the first use I fell in love with this hair paste and love the non greasy and flexible look i wanted. It is the best hair styling paste I have used and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Amazing prize, Great styling paste for the teenage boy or college student. It&#x27;s good enough to make them look great but cheap enough if they love it it&#x27;s not a big deal to get them more.</li>
            <li> Axe kept jacking up their price and I saw this on the shelf at WalMart.  Now I find no one stocks this. I was told at Save Mart it is discontinued. I bought 2x 4 packs of this with a special 50% discount on the the purchase of 2.  I am set for a LONG time.  This really good stuff. I have relatively short medium to fine hair and it works very well. Not sticky, not clumpy, not to greasy.  I actually like it better than any other I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for the price. The matte finish is what I prefer and the hold is excellent. I think the Axe product (Axe Styling Cream Natural Understated Look 2.64 oz) is just a little better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this stuff.</li>
            <li> After years of switching between different hair styling gels and pastes... I finally found this!!! Its awesome and perfect for my frowhawk.</li>
            <li> Great price and so far very happy with results which I doubt will change.  Can recommend if you want dry looking hair</li>
            <li> Few years back before I transitioned to Suave Styling Paste, I was using Axe&#x27;s Messy look hair paste. I&#x27;ve made the change because Axe keeps on increasing the price of their product. Then I discovered Suave, my new favorite hair paste for the past 4 years. The price is unbeatable, the scent is great, and just a dime size amount will get the job done. Medium hold and matte finish give it a natural look. When applied with towel dried hair, it creates a gel look.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quickly style my thick but frizzy hair.  My wife loves the smell.  It&#x27;s incredibly cheap compared to similar products I have tried.  Just don&#x27;t accidentally leave it open or it will all dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it is a nice, light cream that holds well. Very small amount is needed for just some light hold on short hair. It&#x27;s non-greasy and unless you use too much I can&#x27;t see how it could be too much. This won&#x27;t give a gel-like hold but that&#x27;s not what you use this for.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Better than Axe. Never could find it at Walmart so I got it here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. It barely costs anything and works great. Plus it has a pleasant smell. Compared to other ones (American Crew and Axe) which are way more expensive and also stink, this is pure gold. If you&#x27;re looking for this in the stores Walmart and Meijer carry it.</li>
            <li> last all day, cheap, i am used to have long hair and cut it short, this helps me have style all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves no sticky feeling on hair and really helps to stylish your look.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I have used American Crew hair styling products and saw this so I  decided to give it a shot. Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased. I have been using this styling paste for 3-4 weeks now. Like AC products, you have to figure out the right amount of moisture in your hair to get the best results. Usually for me it&#x27;s about 15 minutes after I get out of the shower (my hair is typically between 1-2&amp;#34; long on top). As far as hold and looks go I would rate it as just as good as AC. The only thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan of is the smell. To me it smells too sugary/sweet. AC smells sweet, but almost in a honey type way which was nice. Suave styling paste smells sweet almost in a sugar/fruit type way. That being said I would still recommend it, especially since you can purchase 4 for the price of 1 AC product. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I also was a American Crew Fiber user, but found that A/C products are  pricey. A/C Fiber does work good, but weighs hair down and makes hair look too \\&quot;dull looking\\&quot;.  I picked up the Suave Styling Paste at Wal-mart (price is dirt cheap) and glad that I did. This product has a really good hold and is easier to work into hair than the Fiber. The paste is creme like and has a really good smell.  It gives hair a  matte finish, but with  a little more shine than the Fiber (a more natural look). It works well on my short, thick hair. I just hope it stays around a long time and is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well and does not look greasy. Amazon offers a great price for this, especially if you buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Switched over from Axe products, and this is just as good, if not better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and just tried it out. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t really work well with my hair. Doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> I love this hair putty.  Smeels good, works well.  Not greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Great light hold at a good price.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy and no strong smell either.</li>
            <li> Good but a little bit too glossy</li>
            <li> Using this product for years&lt;br /&gt;Great hold not greasy or shinny</li>
            <li> Love the smell, just wished it lasted a little longer. Definitely helps to forst damp hair, apply, red amo and then apply touchups to get stiffer/longer hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product, I have short hair and I like a light matte hold for my hair. I have been using American Crew&#x27;s Fiber product for the past 8 years as it had been the only product that I felt left my hair feeling and looking the way I want it. The AC Fiber does a great job but I would find that when left in colder surroundings it would stiffen up and would become a lot harder to apply and I would end up loosing some hair in the process of trying to apply it. I&#x27;ve tried countless other hair products that would somewhat match the same consistency of the Fiber I had been using for years. I have used Old Spice&#x27;s various hair products, also tried the line of Axe hair products. I even purchased some of the more expensive salon style mens hair products and nothing came close to what I had with the AC Fiber. On a whim I decided to purchase the Suave Mens Styling Paste from my local Wal Mart as it was priced very well at around $3.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with the AC Fiber I usually apply all these paste style products on my damp hair, the Suave Paste went on well and spreads well on your finger tips (that&#x27;s what she said!) and its very easy to apply even more so than the Fiber I had been using all these years. I don&#x27;t like a stiff or medium hold on my hair, I like more of a light hold with a light shape to my hair and the paste provides that very well. The price for this product makes it a must buy, I have been paying close to $9 per 3oz canister of AC Fiber I can buy two canisters of the 1.75oz Paste for around $7 (In Store. Less with a coupon) and get more than 3oz. I believe I found a permanent replacement for the American Crew Fiber, good bye old friend.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I&#x27;ll use. It&#x27;s not shiny like pomade, it&#x27;s not crunchy like gel, and it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune like the stuff the barber shop tries to sell me. I&#x27;ve tried all of the other chealp grocery store hair products and none of them can compare.</li>
            <li> great price, good product</li>
            <li> I started buying this instead of American Crew paste.  I am saving a ton of cash.  The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  Aveda and American Crew all of a distinct scent.  This has nothing.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just nothing.</li>
            <li> Holds well but kind of oily</li>
            <li> Strong, Perfumed Smell Aside, Good Product - Even for Us Ladies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a simple inexpensive matte styling paste, I&#x27;d say this product will do for you. I ordered these so I could have one at work, one in my gym bag, and a couple for home use. I cut off most of my thin, fine locks back in March (for a modern pixie) and have since been on a mission to find the best products for my use. I simply wash my hair, rarely do I blow dry it anymore, I run a little product through it once it dries to give it texture and presto - I&#x27;m done. But the problem is finding the right paste, wax, or gel - as many can be hard to use on fine hair, leave a glossy residue, or weigh it down too much. I&#x27;ve been through the gambit (both cheap and expensive). While I have a couple, more expensive favorite go-to products, I like this. My only complaint so far is the smell. I don&#x27;t like using heavily perfumed products, but I&#x27;m glad to report the smell dissipates after some wear. If you are looking for something to give you a little control and texture, without it being sticky, heavy, glossy, or gummy, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have Curly Hair; black/Mexican. And use the side part hairstyle. It works like a pomade, for me best when hair is nearly dry and still damp. My wife loves the smell, and likes the fact she can run her fingers in my hair without feeling like she held bacon; pomade gets really greasy.  Got this in about 6days. Can&#x27;t compare to American Crew fiber, but for the price and result; will probably never try any thing else.</li>
            <li> I used to use various Axe hair products, but found it slowly became more expensive for a fairly small amount of product when you consider that half of their jars are hollow. I bought a jar of this sauve paste and found that it works at least as well as any of the Axe products for much less money. Still not as easy to find as it could be, it is worth seeking out or just ordering on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fair. I have tried so many products and this is a case of getting what you pay f&lt;br /&gt;For. This is very weak as far as hold, doesn&#x27;t give texture and is too light</li>
            <li> Loving it, been using it for about a month now. Not a shiny look, very natural. My girlfriend likes the feel of it. Lasts all day for me, 10+ hours at work.</li>
            <li> As good as American Crew fiber paste.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot,the smell good,store don&#x27;t sale it here</li>
            <li> Works well and hold the hair in style.  Wish it has more shine when applied on hair.  It looks matted.</li>
            <li> Used a lot of products in my day, for the price -- this is the best.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Local stores stopped selling this product.  Find it superior to higher priced products that I tried after the last one I had ran out.  The four pack should last me a long long time.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this because the price was good but it does not hold up well &amp; it does really mix well into your hair. You really need to work it in. Will probably go back to loreal hair putty.</li>
            <li> I use American Crew Fiber and lately I just can&#x27;t upkeep $13-15 per jar. So, I wanted a cheaper alternative. I generally never write reviews unless they really impress, and these certainly have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hold just as well as the fiber and have that matte finish that I love. The scent that is clean and smells great is just the cherry on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these, as I was  user of American Crew for over 2 years, and well this takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that for a price that is cheaper than ONE bottle of American Crew Fiber, Suave delivers FOUR bottles. I think that the price is amazing and is better than any other competitor.</li>
            <li> I first used this product about a year and a half ago and was very pleased with it.  As a user of various gels, pastes, pomades, and fibers over my lifetime, this one product that has yet to be discontinued. On occasion though, I do find that this specific product is sometimes sold out at my local grocery or Walmart stores, so when that happens I either have to get some other brand I&#x27;m disappointed with or I have to opt for one of the expensive American Crew Fiber products at my local Sport Clips.  Although I do like American Crew Fiber, that stuff is EXPENSIVE. I know I help my stylist every time I buy their product but good grief, it breaks the bank, even when it&#x27;s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Suave Styling Paste, I get pretty much the same hold &amp; look I expect from the American Crew stuff at a fraction of the price. What especially like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, it lasts all day, and it&#x27;s a matte finish so my hair doesn&#x27;t look like I put a bunch of Crisco in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although by default, this is the same price as my local store ($2.88 for a single \\&quot;can\\&quot;), I buy this from Amazon because Amazon often has coupons plus you can  take advantage of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program.  With list price of $11.52, I got this 4-pack for $7.72 when all was said &amp; done.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and smells great, too.  Not too musky or perfumey... just fresh smelling.  Won&#x27;t make your hair hard, sticky, or oily...  just gives a nice finish and shape.</li>
            <li> i like the hold but the white paste makes my hair look grey or white.  firm hold good price product</li>
            <li> Gets hair to stick together, without being sticky, to help form natural looking styling, when styled with your hands. Like other styling products, it suffers from a flaw where it dries brittle and flakes off with any contact, and you wind up with what looks like severe dandruff. Avoid touching your hair (or allowing other people to touch your hair), putting on headwear (helmet, hat, bandana, headphones, hoodie, etc.), or resting your head on anything (head rest, pillow, vehicle interior, etc.), and you might be able to pull off a *clean* styled look, else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I get similar style without paste, just using moist hands and running it through my hair (short straight Asian hair) similarly. Less hold, and doesn&#x27;t get the defined style look when hair gets grouped together, but better than ending up with embarrassing flakes after a few hours when the paste dries and breaks up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.Cheap and it works. What more do you want.</li>
            <li> Man, you should see my hair.  Its fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the right product!!!  After years of using every men&#x27;s hair care product out there if the type from the high end stuff down the the big extra value sized goop of Dep from Wally I&#x27;ve found this provides the best amount of gold without making the hair stiff and shiny. You can still get a wet look if you leave your hair wet when applying it. Its also reworkable but as with any other hair care product it will not hold as well the second time. It&#x27;s an excellent value for the price and I think so many have caught on that it is virtually the same product as Dove Men that Unilever has changed the packaging. It was once the same gray color packaging as the other product but now has changed to blue.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the more expensive pomade! My hair is never stiff and sticky. Glad I found this because they are becoming hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Cheap and does not hold.  Not worth the money.  Spend a little more and get a product that holds and works.  Will not buy this ever again</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying through the nose for American Crew products but I could not find anything that was comparable.  Suave&#x27;s men&#x27;s product line are comparable.  In this case it&#x27;s a near perfect match for American Crew styling paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you compare the price you can get almost ten times as much of this for the cost of one jar of American Crew (at retail price).</li>
            <li> In overall, the scent and the result of the appliance of the gel is impressive. I have not tried a better product!</li>
            <li> Works well, holds my hair in place, great for everyday use.  Cheap.  I use it on my hair for work days.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a few years and it is just as good as the expensive hair products.  unfortunately i cannot find it in stores anymore. but when i have amazon who really cares.</li>
            <li> Waterless paste consistency that solidifies in your hair too quickly, particularly when used with dry hair.  Works a little bit better with wet hair. Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is great and I can&#x27;t find it in the local stores anymore.  Suave made a great men&#x27;s hair product that isn&#x27;t ridiculously expensive and I can buy in bulk here.  Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two months and I think is is an average men&#x27;s product with average results.  The cost of the product is a definite plus since comparable salon products can be 4-5 times as expensive.  The hold and ability to style hair is a slight disadvantage.  I feel like the product&#x27;s hold wears off after a few hours rather than holding all day.  As a compromise, I tend to use this product to style before work and times when I don&#x27;t really care how great my hair looks.  I use something a little better when going out.  For everyday indications, I think this product is an economical solution that may not perform perfectly, but again you are not shelling out a ton of money for everyday hair styling at work.  I would purchase this again, and would recommend to others for the aforementioned indications.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect hair paste, great to be able to buy it in a pack of 4.  great price too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It holds my hair in place, keeps it soft, and leaves little if any buildup. Smells great as well. I used to be able to buy this product in the store but unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but on Amazon now.  This product is comparable to the American Crew version that is at least twice as much.  Also, living in Florida on the beach, I can dive in the ocean and when it washes out it does not burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does the same job compared to expensive brands such as axe and american crew. I have never tried it, so I was skeptical and bought 8 of them for $8.22 when it was on sale. I heard they were discontinuing this product, I wish I had bought more at that price, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or sticky unless you use a ton which you don&#x27;t have to. In my opinion this stuff works better with longer hair at least it does when my hair is longer. It&#x27;s also one of the cheaper product of its kind and its great quality.</li>
            <li> For several years, I&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber for getting my short hair just right on weekends or when going out, but I used another product for everyday styling to save money. When that product was discontinued, I started looking everywhere for a replacement. It&#x27;s actually really hard to find anything that performs similarly to American Crew styling products. The selection at department stores is heavily weighted toward women&#x27;s hair products, and most companies seem uninterested in offering reasonably priced products for men&#x27;s hair. Well, this Suave formula is great. As it shows on the package, it&#x27;s supposed to be like AC Defining Paste, so I won&#x27;t compare it directly to AC Fiber, but it does stand in well for it. The hold is not as strong, but it&#x27;s still good at giving a spiky or messy look in my short hair, and it&#x27;s precise enough for me to fine tune problem areas. I don&#x27;t need to use much (dime size amount on the fingertip), and it retains its hold all day. Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with flaking, as others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just hope Suave will keep this product. It&#x27;s impossible to find in local stores, which implies to me that Suave may discontinue it. Suave, please keep it. It&#x27;s a unique product that is clearly liked by a lot of people!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product - nice, light scent similar to their shampoo products for men.  Does a good job of holding hair and not looking a helmet of hair nor like a greasy mess - it stays somewhat pliable so if you like to re-style your hair in the afternoon etc, it&#x27;s possible to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most hair products - a little dab goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Works well and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> There use to be a fragrance infused into the paste. But the batches I got there&#x27;s no smell to it. Just smells like lard.</li>
            <li> For the price...this stuff is pretty good...not as good as the American Crew but works pretty well. If you are on a tight budget, for sure try this.</li>
            <li> Works as well as salon quality brands for much better value.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The product is much lighter than other styling cremes yet works just as well. It gives hair a very natural look yet still has a good hold. The only reason I did not give it a 5th star was because I think it&#x27;s smell could be a littler better (it does not smell bad at all, just not particularly fragrant).</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to American Crew Forming Cream, as it&#x27;s significantly cheaper.  Compared the AC, it&#x27;s more greasy, and doesn&#x27;t seem to either hold or hold up as well.  It&#x27;s still a good product, especially for the price.  I got 4 1.75 ounce containers of this for a buck and change more than 1 of the American Crew costs (with shipping).  Another factor to compare is the smell.  It&#x27;s a bit more fragrant than I would prefer, and has a very fruity smell.  The AC forming cream smells very much like a manly hair product from the 70&#x27;s.  That&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I never used to use hair products until it was recommended to me during a haircut. I gave this stuff a try because my brother used it. It works great, if you use the right amount it will keep your hair in shape all day and looks natural and non-clumpy. If you use a small fingers-worth with slightly damp hair, then after your hair is completely dry, style it, it works great. Plus it&#x27;s a great price compared to other products. I will continue to buy this paste for my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the Suave styling paste 18-24 months ago when I tired of paying large $$$ for both Redkin and American Crew hair paste.  Wow, was I surprised!  For me, the Suave works better than the aforementioned products and is much less expensive, a great combination.  This paste doesn&#x27;t give your hair the wet-look, which I detest.  It holds all day until bedtime.  The only two negatives are that it&#x27;s getting impossible to find locally at retail and the Amazon price with shipping works out to about $7/jar, more than double the normal retail price.  It&#x27;s still on Suave&#x27;s website but I can&#x27;t find it anymore locally (Super Target, Wal-Mart, Rite Aid, drugstores, etc.)  Maybe that&#x27;s by design......................</li>
            <li> For a supposedly low quality brand, this is good quality hair product. Sheen is high but not greasy. Beeswax is one of the main ingredients. It has a medium hold-not quite as strong as some other products I&#x27;ve used and with my stiff hair, I find I need to use a little more. But that&#x27;s ok when it has quality ingredients and you get FOUR tubs. I ordered this thinking I was getting only one since the price was a little lower than other similar products. But four? Seriously, that&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> This paste hold hair really well but doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny coat.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much to give my hair some texture.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would have less of a paste feel. This stuff is really thick and you have to really work it to get to the point that it disappears in your hair. Also, after a few days it sort of pills in the container, which makes it even more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I used to use fructis hair gel but this stuff is about half the price and it works MUCH better. I would never go back.</li>
            <li> Been looking for the perfect hair product that wasn&#x27;t going to break the bank like \\&quot;American Crew\\&quot;.  When used correctly, this stuff is the bomb.  at first I couldn&#x27;t get it to do what I wanted, because I was using it wrong. Then I went to a hair stylist and with some simple techniques I got the results that were exactly what I was looking for.  I was using it on wet hair (which made my hair remain looking wet,clumpy, and hard),  I would use it after my hair dried (but it was too hard to shape),  Really all you have to do is use a hair dryer to shape your hair in the general direction and shape you want it to go and then BOOM use this stuff to finish it up, and VUALA you got a DRY, NON-CLUMPY, FLEXIBLE hairdo with a MILD SHINE AND STRONG HOLD that everyone will love and make you look like a model or superstar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I would use a leave-in heat protection spray before hair-drying if you don&#x27;t want you hair to become damaged from repeated hairdrying.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these in stores lately. Still the price per unit is balanced</li>
            <li> For my hair, love the product. Easy to put on hair and remove when showering. Not meant to make your hair a rock to prevent movement.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in one place without the slick look.</li>
            <li> works good.  not shiny or crunchy.  not strongest hold, but i don&#x27;t need that.</li>
            <li> This is a lot like American Crew Fiber, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less expensive. It&#x27;s not quite the same, but I actually prefer the way this feels and smells compared to Fiber. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and love it. Only bad thing is it looks like I&#x27;ll have to order it in bulk here on Amazon from now on, as I can hardly find it in Wal-Mart&#x27;s stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT! Thank me later.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find it hard to find these in stores and really like them for doing my hair. It was nice to order them in bulk for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while now, but when I last ran out, I could not find it anywhere. I went to at least 8 stores (supermarkets and drug stores) and it was nowhere to be found. Finally, I went to amazon, and paid about $3 per pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great. It has about as much hold as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shaping paste (a slightly better product, but 7 times the cost of this per pot), and allows for easy shaping until it dries. Once it dries, it has a nice matte finish, but you can still work your hair once its dry, so you get the casual but refined look I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know how this would work for guys with short hair, but I have about 5 inches on top, and it molds my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but paste is a bit difficult to dissolve into hair and can flake later on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overseas and had to buy the 4 pack because it is not sold out here.  I have a thick head of hair, and I am required to keep a hat on outdoors due to a uniform requirement.  I put a little on after getting out of the shower and it gives a moderate hold all day.  Even at the end of a shift all you have to do is run your hand through your hair to adjust, and if will reform without the look of even having a product in your hair.  My alternative was some AXE stuff they were selling out here, and I would&#x27;ve rather cut my hair off.  Thankfully it will ship overseas and I can still look fabulous!</li>
            <li> I just turned 27 so I felt it was time to retire the Got2Bglu hair do which doesn&#x27;t really go well with business casual. I want people to take me a little more serious in meetings and it doesn&#x27;t work so well when I look like I&#x27;m in a boy band. This paste has serious hold, I put it in around 6am before work and get home around 6pm and the hair is still all in place. It smells fantastic, getting compliments from the ladies all the time at the office...this thing is a jar of sexual harassment! And the value is just crazy, the 4 pack should last you for almost a year. I&#x27;ll buy again after/if I ever run out of this good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product along with the Suave Men&#x27;s Pomade paste produces such an amazing shiny but not oily hair style.  Love it, but I believe Suave is no longer producing this product.  I&#x27;m buying in bulk before inventories run out.</li>
            <li> I use the styling paste on damp hair every day and it is true to name - it is a medium hold with a matte finish. There is no shine to my hair and my styling looks quite natural. I work 12 hour shifts and on the humid days and long nights I do wish it was a stronger hold. I recommend it and hope amazon restocks on the item soon!</li>
            <li> My Husband uses this product. He wasn&#x27;t very happy when the store where we shop stopped carrying it. I found it here on Amazon at an even better price. This was my second order of the 4 pack. I&#x27;m sure I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes this paste because it holds his hair in place without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> I used to use WEN defining paste, and I loved that it would hold without the heavy or gel like weight.  The WEN is also great because it washes out really easily, your hands aren&#x27;t left sticky!  This product is almost identical to the WEN, and 1/4 the price!!!! If you like to style without the crazy wet gel look, and be able to rinse clean then this is the stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Great price.  Much better value than some of the other hair products out there.  Used to use American Crew pomade and fiber \\&quot;paste\\&quot; but gets what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Was tired of using gel and always having a &amp;#34;wet-head&amp;#34; look. This holds the hair in place without making it &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of both expensive and inexpensive products over the years trying to find one that holds my puffy hair down without looking too slick. They were either clumpy, left flakes or just didn&#x27;t last through the day. With this product it is easy to spread evenly through the air and is easy to smooth the hair down. It doesn&#x27;t flake and is easy to wash out in the morning. It also doesn&#x27;t look I just stepped off the set of Grease. Excellent product at a good price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of it and its cheap but it just doesn&#x27;t do much. oh well, just have to find something else.</li>
            <li> We hate going to Walmart, but that was the only place we could find this product. So glad we found it here for a great price. The BF loves this stuff. It keeps his hair in place, smells good, and since it has a matte finish, it doesn&#x27;t make his hair look greasy. It&#x27;s all he will use.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. So much better than using a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; product for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this daily in his hair. It is the perfect pasty consistency. It does not ever look greasy or clump up in his hair. This paste is great for styling mens&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best styling paste for the price. It holds pretty good if you apply it in wet/dry hair.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this stuff.  When he uses it he looks so good.  We have had to purchase on line BC we could not find it at any store.  I just hope that the product is not being discontinues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a strong fragrance and not too sticky.</li>
            <li> does not dry hair. makes hair fuller. Holds up very well to weather. Great buy at good price. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My husband is picky about his hair stuff. He has tried Bumble and Bumble down to drug store ones and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t smell too feminine and has hold without clunkiness and no shine.&lt;br /&gt;It is also a great value in this bundle!</li>
            <li> Started using this stuff about a year or two ago and haven&#x27;t switched off since.  Extremely cheap but holds well and has a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff better than any of the hair products I&#x27;ve had for the past few years that ranged from $5 to $40 in price. It has a really good smell, makes a good texture and is versatile. If you style your hair in any sort of business cut, this stuff will work well for you. The first time I bought this stuff I got it at Target for less than $3.00 but when I ran out they no longer had it in the store. I found it on amazon, but am a bit disappointed that you are required to buy them in 4-packs and that the price is not as good as when I got it at Target. But it&#x27;s still a very good value, so in like a year and a half, when I run out of all 4 cans, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My son in law loves this product and has been using it for years. It&#x27;s great to be able to get him a years supply in one click.</li>
            <li> Great scent, didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative to the American Crew Molding Paste.  It gets the job done, but truthfully it&#x27;s not the same.  I switched back.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff at Walmart about 6 months ago and decided to give it a try because it was inexpensive, and I gotta say, it gives me the hold I want from my hair, whether I put it in with dry or damp hair. I put my hair straight back with a taper on the sides and on top  it&#x27;s 8-9 inches in length, this stuff gives my hair a solid hold for about the first 10 hours of day and kind of releases by the evening, which for me is what I desire because while I&#x27;m at work its a bit more executive/corporate looking and by the evening its a casual loose look that still has a good hold. Also its definitely a matte finish, doesn&#x27;t look shiny, wet, or greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s easy to apply, not greasy, and has a natural look to it. And who can argue with the price? I wish my local retailers still sold this styling paste, but at least it&#x27;s still available online. I just hope Suave don&#x27;t discontinue it. I don&#x27;t know what else I&#x27;d use.</li>
            <li> No American Crew, as product claims to compare to, but it holds my hair as it is supposed to. Nice scent as well. If the price stays low, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best value hair wax i&#x27;ve tried out and i&#x27;ve tried a lot. This provide great hold while having less of a greasy feel. It is comparable to American crew fiber although the fiber do provide a better hold but also cost a lot more. I have thick Asian hair and it manage to keep my side tidy all day(I have a short/medium faux hawk). It may not be the best but for the money it is the best value hair wax you can buy. Stock up on it if you can.</li>
            <li> I chose to buy this product due to it&#x27;s amazingly low price for the number of containers you are getting. This paste turned out to exceed my expectations. I will simply make a pro/con list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-adds ton of texture to your hair. I have a full head of hair, but my hair has no texture naturally. This paste helped to add texture to my hair without making it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;-strong hold. Lasted me basically all day, from 6 AM when I put it on until dinner time. Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;-Good value. Each one comes out to be around $3 per 1.75 oz container, which is a bargain for me.&lt;br /&gt;-Only use a little paste. This way, it lasts you a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t apply well to dry hair. If I needed to fix my hair during the day, I couldn&#x27;t do it with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product that I feel is well worth the $11 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average hair product.  Not to be harsh, but it&#x27;s like the rest of Suave&#x27;s products - does the trick, but I prefer other brands.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with no shine and moderate hold that would be easy to apply in the mornings. This fit the bill quite well and turned out to be a lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the best styling product around!</li>
            <li> This paste holds well and gives a dryish look.  On the downside, it is a little tough to wash off your hands, and each container doesn&#x27;t come with much.  I really have a hard time finding a paste or gel that I consistently like.  This is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Don&#x27;t really have anything to complain about. The smell is good, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Works as intended! Medium hold and the smell is not too heavy. Overall a good price conscious purchase.</li>
            <li> To me this works better than the more expensive products. My Walmart briefly carried it then stopped. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.com</li>
            <li> Smells great and has a great medium hold. If you need something stronger, I would go with something else.</li>
            <li> This hair wax works great, super effective, smells nice, and a great value!  Definitely recommend buying this product its great</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is much cheaper then the usual suave product I used, and I figured how different can it be?  I&#x27;d suggest skipping it however.  It leaves your hair feeling stiff, sticky, and greasy, and makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> s***ty ingredients but does work</li>
            <li> The product smells great and it&#x27;s super easy to use.  In addition washing it out is no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Just a couple dabs will do ya. This stuff works great... holds firm all day...but don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products over the year. Most recently I was using Axe &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;. These worked OK. I didn&#x27;t really like how clumpy they were and how the hold was &#x27;meh&#x27;. I really hated the jar they came in too: over-sized and bulky. This product on the other hand is very light and has a great natural hold. The jar is slim and convenient. It is exactly what it says: Medium Hold with a matte finish. Also very well priced.</li>
            <li> This is the best budget paste I have used.  All others are too wet or liquidy.  This one is great to use on damp hair for a more polished/gel-looking style and on dry hair for the matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to purchase this at walmart but have not seen it recently.  Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that i could no longer find this item at the local stores, I really love the way it leaves my hair. It was deliver at the time they said it would. Came in a nice neat box well protected. I love everything about this product I would really recommend anyone who would like to try it and its really cheap. Ty Suave and Amazon</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you are looking to spike your hair. Use it to give it texture and and make hair shiny</li>
            <li> Good product, holds my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very straight hair, which can make it difficult to find a good hair product. On it&#x27;s own, my hair tends to be very limp and flat. I use this styling paste to add some volume, texture and a bit of hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a little bit of the styling paste and spread it onto my finger tips, and then very lightly work it through my (dry) hair. I try to go for the roots rather than the tips of my hair. I&#x27;m very careful not to rub too much into any one area, the trick is to spread a little bit around evenly so my hair still looks natural, yet has some much needed shape and texture. I repeat this process of working in a little at a time about 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use American Crew Fiber, which had better hold but the texture of the paste was too stiff. It was hard to work into my hair. I also used to use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream which had a nice soft texture and good hold, but quite expensive. I wish this Suave product gave a slightly stronger hold. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. For the price, it&#x27;s really hard to complain.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying almost $20 a tin for hair stuff, so I decided to try this stuff out. Works great! I find that if your hair is slightly dampened, smear a nickel size between fingers, slightly wet your fingers and rub them together, then go at it, you don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;grey look\\&quot;. A pack of 4 will probably last me a year and a half, but beats paying others&#x27; prices.</li>
            <li> Tried this about a year ago when I found it at a Target store as an alternative to American Crew fiber paste... loved it (and the price) then for some reason couldn&#x27;t find it again. Thank you Amazon. Bought a 4-pack. Will last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hairstylist -- just a guy.  VERY hard for me to tell the difference between the way this looks, feels, and works vs. the stuff where I get my hair cut that costs $30 for 1.5 oz.  Over the years I&#x27;ve become fond of Suave for their products and their value, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I used to use BedHead styling paste but it&#x27;s fairly expensive and so when Suave came out with this product I jumped at the chance to try it.  Then is disappeared from the store shelves so I checked to see if I could get it here and I could so this is where I will order it from now on.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wave hair. This stuff is amazing I can get a nice straight look by just using a dab of this stuff. Compared to the Salon comparable product it blows it out of the water and is a fraction of the price. Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> This does not work up well in your hands - mine often formed chunks that would stick out in your hair (unless your are completely gray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave did send me a $5 coupon in the mail after I called them (Unilever) and I&#x27;ve tossed the rest.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and cannot find it at any of the stores around here, anymore.  It is almost half the price of the axe pommade, and works just as well.  I don&#x27;t know why the axe stuff is so expensive!</li>
            <li> This product is fairly cheap but you get what you pay for. It does not hold your hair like other products can. I&#x27;m going to go back to Axe/Gatsby. This has been an utter disappointment. 2 stars for the great smell, other than that, I can&#x27;t find any reason to give it more.</li>
            <li> Great quality styling product without the high price.  I&#x27;ve been using Suave styling paste for a couple years now and it&#x27;s great.  Lets me style my hair the way I want without a greasy look to it.  Quick and easy to use and it last a long time.  Get months from a single tin.  Rub your fingers over it, rub in your hair, style how you want.  Can&#x27;t be more simple.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for great styling ability at a nice price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! New to waxes and pastes but I have tried many other Suave products and was definitely not disappointed by this. Was using gel prior to this product and just didn&#x27;t like the wet, slick, crunchy look/feeling of it, so I came across this and I absolutely love the matte finish. This gives a bit of a dry but &#x27;healthy looking hair\\&quot; look. A nickel-sized amount is sufficient enough to last all day with some hairspray to keep shape!</li>
            <li> I like that it is cheap, but I don&#x27;t think it holds as well as other ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is inexpensive, and works as well on my hair as the salon equivalent. Big plus: it has no real scent whatsoever. That&#x27;s a plus in my book. Lasts quite a while, too.</li>
            <li> Love this product can&#x27;t find an affordable substitute anywhere in stores. Only matched by expensive products like Crew.</li>
            <li> Used American Crew and it kept drying out before I could use the whole container. This works great and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> This product works great all day long. Dare to compare to some high-cost items, you will enjoy this product. My hair stayed the way I want it all day long... really great!</li>
