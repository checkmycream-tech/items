            <li>these are perfect  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality and timely delivery</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>but it DOES successfully keep me from poking at a blemish, which is probably its most effective benefit.</li>
            <li>the patch didn&#x27;t work well for me, it kind of reduced the redness of the acne, but didn&#x27;t stop it .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think whatever &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; is on this is all that effective--</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t even know what ingredients make it so effective</li>
            <li>but these need to be in everyones drawer, as handy as a bandaid.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting so much more.</li>
            <li>I actually love the product.</li>
            <li>These things are interesting.</li>
            <li>The fit was good and they stayed on pretty well, but they did not work.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>might work OK as a simple cover to keep from touching acne, but are otherwise useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are really high quality and, better yet, they work.</li>
            <li>spots are much thinner and would be invisible if they didn&#x27;t reflect light.</li>
            <li>These Trouble Care Patches are great.</li>
            <li>Unless you are looking for something to just cover your blemish to keep you from picking at it, these aren&#x27;t worth your money.  </li>
            <li>(Complimentary blurry cell phone photo attached)</li>
            <li>Just useful to cover the acne, doesn&#x27;t do anything to &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I purchased this after having some success with Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know the ingredients are in English on their website along with more reviews.</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t replace Nexcare patches, but they are so much cheaper per unit.</li>
            <li>So much.</li>
            <li>Plus they were discreet and come in cool multiple sizes.</li>
            <li>I think these are great for &amp;#34;pickers.&amp;#34; I use these to keep my stupid self from touching and messing around with face blemishes.</li>
            <li>Mainly they help flatten out popped pimples (I think?)</li>
            <li>Occasionally, this little sticker will gently suck out some gunk overnight, but that&#x27;s really more of a bonus when it does happen.</li>
            <li>This is completely my fault, but I keep dropping the sheets on the floor.</li>
            <li>There are quite a few in the package, but I&#x27;m going through them pretty quickly because I consistently fling them onto the floor when they&#x27;re only like half done.</li>
            <li>I love using the Nexcare Acne Patches, but they can get expensive fast.  </li>
            <li>The patches are clear so even if you have a late night visitor it wont turn into an obvious &amp;#34;Yeah, I&#x27;m wearing zit-zappers.&amp;#34; They also stick really well to freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li>She put them on and several hours later sent me a gross ass picture of the freshly removed &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; with a giant pustule in the center.</li>
            <li>They helped my pimple come to head over night and really kept the swelling and size down.</li>

            <li> These really aren&#x27;t much other than little clear stickers you put on your face, but there&#x27;s genius to the simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has done nothing to fix it or the minor eruptions on which I have used it.</li>
            <li> Also long shipping time.</li>

            <li> I do like that the patches are small and clear.</li>

            <li> Even though I thought I was saving money at the time, I ended up wasting it because these are pretty much useless.  </li>
            <li> Those, now discontinued, were impregnated with Aloe, Witch Hazel and other blemish reducing stuff.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guess that there isn&#x27;t any active ingredients based on performance.</li>
            <li> Sad really.</li>
            <li> Not worth cost or wait.</li>
            <li> These patches will cover a trouble spot  but not much else.</li>
            <li> I used the stickers on open acne wounds several times, but they failed to draw out pus.</li>
            <li> Guys, seriously, these actually work.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try these since I&#x27;ve been suffering from some nasty pimples lately</li>
            <li> It maybe negates a little redness as well, but again, I think that&#x27;s because the sticker is keeping me from compulsively messing with my face.</li>
            <li> This product worked no better than any other overnight or speedy acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> These are just little round stickers of tape.</li>

            <li> But alas, no such luck.  </li>
            <li> Useless for acne and possibly damaging to the skin when you peel them off.</li>
            <li> and then it pulls the pimple too hard and leaves a scar.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my little cousin who suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> Not a dupe for the Nexcare patches, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but these work like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> I use them is I wash my face at night and use these bad boys on my visible blemishes before I head to bed.</li>
            <li> When you wake up and peel it off, sometimes it can take the ugly pimple with it....</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I have been using it on a particularly gruesome zit that feels like a rock under the skin which won&#x27;t disappear or come to a head.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the patch didn&#x27;t work well for me, it kind of reduced the redness of the acne, but didn&#x27;t stop it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a substitute since the Neutrogena product went off the market and these are perfect  I almost forget I have one on in the middle of the night.  Helps my acne heal quicker.</li>
            <li> I tried this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work but after using this my face has definitely cleared instantly. I love it. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Hit or miss, depending on the type of blemish you&#x27;re using this to bust. I don&#x27;t think whatever &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; is on this is all that effective-- but it DOES successfully keep me from poking at a blemish, which is probably its most effective benefit. Occasionally, this little sticker will gently suck out some gunk overnight, but that&#x27;s really more of a bonus when it does happen. It maybe negates a little redness as well, but again, I think that&#x27;s because the sticker is keeping me from compulsively messing with my face. I do like that the patches are small and clear. And there&#x27;s a bit of a velvety plastic texture on the outside, so if you dab the tiniest bit of bb cream on it, you can still like... answer the door at night wearing these, and your guest will be none the wiser that you have something on your face.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem to work for me. That is not a guarantee of their lack of effectiveness. I have been using it on a particularly gruesome zit that feels like a rock under the skin which won&#x27;t disappear or come to a head. It has done nothing to fix it or the minor eruptions on which I have used it.</li>
            <li> I know all the experts say not to squeeze your zits but I found that for myself if I squeeze all that junk out it heals up faster. This patch helps immensely in the healing process. I stick it on my zit and it heals up almost overnight!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having some success with Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers. The Nexcare brand was absorbent, but fell off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;MISSHA spots are much thinner and would be invisible if they didn&#x27;t reflect light. The fit was good and they stayed on pretty well, but they did not work. I used the stickers on open acne wounds several times, but they failed to draw out pus. (The Nexcare covers plumped up and turned white overnight.)&lt;br /&gt;I read several reviews in which people said this product didn&#x27;t work, but I figured some people didn&#x27;t use them on open wounds.&lt;br /&gt;They might work OK as a simple cover to keep from touching acne, but are otherwise useless.&lt;br /&gt;I threw the rest in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product worked no better than any other overnight or speedy acne treatment.  Good thing it was inexpensive as I am about to throw away this product.</li>
            <li> These are not hydrocolloid acne patches that will suck the exudate out of your zits. These are just little round stickers of tape. Useless for acne and possibly damaging to the skin when you peel them off.</li>
            <li> Guys, seriously, these actually work. I&#x27;m sort of in shock as I write this since so few products ACTUALLY work but these work like CRAZY. The package is Japanese so I don&#x27;t even know what ingredients make it so effective but these need to be in everyones drawer, as handy as a bandaid. Order 2 or 3 packs in case they stop making them (I am) I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell these in America, they should be in vending machines in highschools.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all even after weeks of uses on same spot. What a disappointment! I was expecting so much more.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know the ingredients are in English on their website along with more reviews. I actually love the product. It doesn&#x27;t work on everything but it helps with my cysts. I&#x27;m also African American so I put one on apply a Lil makeup and no one can even see a pimple. The patch reduces redness flattens the pimple and then bring it to a head. Would have given a 5 but every now and then it pulls the pimple too hard and leaves a scar.</li>
            <li> I love using the Nexcare Acne Patches, but they can get expensive fast.  I thought I would give these a try after reading a few reviews.  Even though I thought I was saving money at the time, I ended up wasting it because these are pretty much useless.  Unless you are looking for something to just cover your blemish to keep you from picking at it, these aren&#x27;t worth your money.  They don&#x27;t absorb like the Nexcare Patches do.</li>
            <li> Not a dupe for the Nexcare patches, unfortunately. However they do help somewhat. If I have popped a pimple and applied my spot treatment and it won&#x27;t stop releasing liquid, I&#x27;ll stick one of these on it. It doesn&#x27;t soak up the pus/blood but it does help stop the seepage of whatever is seeping lol. Sometimes they fall off while I&#x27;m sleeping. Mainly they help flatten out popped pimples (I think?) overnight. This is completely my fault, but I keep dropping the sheets on the floor. Obviously I have to throw the whole sheet away because the floor is dirty, and open up a new one. There are quite a few in the package, but I&#x27;m going through them pretty quickly because I consistently fling them onto the floor when they&#x27;re only like half done. Sad really. These won&#x27;t replace Nexcare patches, but they are so much cheaper per unit. So much.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and timely delivery</li>
            <li> Ugh you reviewers...this is a KOREAN product. Not Japanese, not Chinese.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but was discreet</li>
            <li> These Trouble Care Patches are great. The patches are clear so even if you have a late night visitor it wont turn into an obvious &amp;#34;Yeah, I&#x27;m wearing zit-zappers.&amp;#34; They also stick really well to freshly washed skin. I&#x27;ve tried others that fall off about a minute after you put them on. These are really high quality and, better yet, they work.</li>
            <li> I was seeking a patch to replace the Ponds dots that worked like a charm. Those, now discontinued, were impregnated with Aloe, Witch Hazel and other blemish reducing stuff. These patches seem to just be discs of plastic.I can&#x27;t read the ingredients which are written in Chinese but I&#x27;m guess that there isn&#x27;t any active ingredients based on performance.These patches will cover a trouble spot  but not much else.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my little cousin who suffers from acne. She put them on and several hours later sent me a gross ass picture of the freshly removed &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; with a giant pustule in the center. She was amazed as was I. (Complimentary blurry cell phone photo attached)</li>
            <li> Just useful to cover the acne, doesn&#x27;t do anything to &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34; the process of healing.</li>
            <li> Stickers often get destroyed when trying to remove from sheet. Also long shipping time. Not worth cost or wait.</li>
            <li> These things are interesting. They will definitely draw the impurities out of one&#x27;s skin. But then you have to excise the impurity out of your skin and are left with a big red mark.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I think these are great for &amp;#34;pickers.&amp;#34; I use these to keep my stupid self from touching and messing around with face blemishes. These really aren&#x27;t much other than little clear stickers you put on your face, but there&#x27;s genius to the simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use them is I wash my face at night and use these bad boys on my visible blemishes before I head to bed. What this does is it keeps me from messing with them, and also keeps stuff from rubbing against and agitating the blemish while you sleep. When you wake up and peel it off, sometimes it can take the ugly pimple with it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Nexcare Acne Patches, which work fantastically.  I was hoping these would work since they&#x27;re less expensive, stick better, and are less obtrusive.  But alas, no such luck.  These cover zits, but that&#x27;s about it.  No redness reducing, zit-absorbing, or zit-flattening abilities.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try these since I&#x27;ve been suffering from some nasty pimples lately and I was not disappointed. They helped my pimple come to head over night and really kept the swelling and size down. Plus they were discreet and come in cool multiple sizes. I will definitely be re-purchasing!</li>
