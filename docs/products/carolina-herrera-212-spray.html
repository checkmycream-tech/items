            <li> The reasons people are having issues with the quality of their product could be b/c they&#x27;re buying from a 3rd party seller; there could be a possibility that you could end up with a fake or tester not as described.</li>
            <li> So I suspect it&#x27;s a fake one :-(</li>
            <li> It was definitely a fake!!!</li>

            <li> At first my wife did not like the scent but it has grown on her. She now uses it frequently.</li>
            <li> Un buena fragancia para una mujer.</li>
            <li> Just for the record, mine came nicely wrapped and wasn&#x27;t a tester; I purchased the 2oz size. I buy this and 212 sexy. I&#x27;d like to eventually try all the 212 variations. The reasons people are having issues with the quality of their product could be b/c they&#x27;re buying from a 3rd party seller; there could be a possibility that you could end up with a fake or tester not as described. Mine was shipped directly from Amazon LLC. When you click on the size of the perfume, on the right by the price it will tell you who it&#x27;s sold by.

            <li> Excelente compra, no tengo nada que decir con respecto al producto y el manejo del mismo dentro de USA, en cambio por parte del despacho dentro de Venezuela pésimo, tarda mucho tiempo en llegar y esto por culpa del sistema de aduana de nuestro país.</li>
