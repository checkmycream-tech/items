            <li>The powder is finely milled and I love that</li>
            <li>The best for setting your highlight, awe heck, you can set your entire face with this!!!&lt;br /&gt;Feels light, non drying (but I do have really oily skin), but this sets my face lovely and compliments my chocolate skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so finely milled.</li>
            <li>It does not settle into my fine lines or look cakey.</li>
            <li>Settled into fine lines.</li>
            <li>Love this setting powder I use it everyday to set under my eyes it very  good for  brown</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an amazing product along with fast shipping</li>
            <li>Great setting powder, not too yellow.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a great powder especially for the under eye area here&#x27;s your product.  </li>
            <li>Item was supposed to be new but came without a top and now the price is up 5$ more than what I originally paid for it.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel like this product was worth 20$!</li>
            <li>Plus its only good for the undereye highlight on me and i have since found a powder that works well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dark skin complexion and looks great on</li>
            <li>Great for dark skin.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Blends very well and smooth.</li>
            <li>This Butter Cup Powder is definitely worth having to set my under eye.</li>
            <li>The yellow tint is perfect for my Black Opal Truly Topaz shade because with the pinkish translucent powders, I would end up looking lobstery-red at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and finely milled.</li>
            <li>I let it &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; under my eyes before sweeping it off and it looks so much like that kardashian under eye highlight!</li>
            <li>One reviewer stated this very thing, I wish I would have listened!</li>
            <li>It has a fine and lightweight feel to it, and keeps foundations true to colour all day long.  </li>
            <li>Perfect setting powder for highlighting and contouring plus theres enough to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Amazing for Brown skin &amp; Dark skin women</li>
            <li>Need to be package differently to make it easy to pour.</li>
            <li>It reduced oil and shine, and really sets my foundation well.  </li>
            <li>I had seen YTubers with my undertone pull it off very well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this powder to be any greater than any other setting powder.</li>
            <li>I typically avoid &#x27;hyped&#x27; products, but I am so glad I purchased this powder.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been hearing about this brand and this particular powder all over YouTube.</li>
            <li>I find that the YouTube beauty community finds a product, everyone latches on to it, everyone co signs it, then they all move on to something new and claim they didn&#x27;t really love the previous product at hand.</li>
            <li>Other brands are very pricy and have less this is just as good and afortable price.</li>
            <li>It can be a little messy to travel with, but on this skin it is great.</li>
            <li>When applied under the eyes if you let it sit a few minutes on your you&#x27;ll see powder melt into any fine lines and fill in any pores.</li>
            <li>It almost completely stopped my under eye creasing of my concealer.</li>
            <li>This far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>It will completely elevate your face.</li>
            <li>Also, it gives a soft look to the makeup.</li>
            <li>It makes my under eye highlight so natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon started distributing it because shipping from the company sucks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $20 on their website so not sure why fifteen dollars more on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t live up to the hype for me which is why I returned it.</li>
            <li>Very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; powder, like confection sugar &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;, so brushing away is minimal.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s only $20 on their website so not sure why fifteen dollars more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t live up to the hype for me which is why I returned it.</li>
            <li> Very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; powder, like confection sugar &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;, so brushing away is minimal.</li>
            <li> the banana powder and raved how long lasting it was.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Definitely brown girl friendly, you want be sorry if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> This product settled into the lines under my eyes and made me look at least ten years older.</li>
            <li> I used various brands before, but this powder beats them all - no makeup rub-off, and less touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> I am a Black Female with a medium-dark complexion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no ashy effect.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sit in your creases like other powders.</li>
            <li> an dark skin lady&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I also find loose powders to be a little messy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make us look dried and ashy</li>
            <li> I could have gotten from Sacha Cosmetics for $10.00 less!</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a foundation or powder for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Too messy!</li>
            <li> I mean of course until this came along...</li>
            <li> It will change your makeup game.</li>
            <li> This setting powder creased bad and it&#x27;s darker than my skin tone (nc35).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I would buy this over Ben Nye Banana Powder... Blends very well and smooth. I&#x27;m a dark skin complexion and looks great on</li>
            <li> The Sacha Buttercup setting powder is amazing! It leaves no unfinished marks! It&#x27;s just an amazing product along with fast shipping</li>
            <li> The best setting powder for darker skin tones, I absolutely love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love it, great for stopping under eye creasing from concealer.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! I love it!!! I&#x27;m of a deeper complexion and this powder blends into my skin like a dream. It almost completely stopped my under eye creasing of my concealer. I have used various setting powders including Ben Nye and I have to say that this is my new favorite. Definitely brown girl friendly, you want be sorry if you purchase it. This far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS LIKE BUTTER!</li>
            <li> Sacha Buttercup Powder is amazing!  It has a fine and lightweight feel to it, and keeps foundations true to colour all day long.  The yellow tint is perfect for my Black Opal Truly Topaz shade because with the pinkish translucent powders, I would end up looking lobstery-red at the end of the day.  No problem with this powder here at all.  I used various brands before, but this powder beats them all - no makeup rub-off, and less touch-ups.  It reduced oil and shine, and really sets my foundation well.  Give it a try, and be amazed at the results.  RegentX says so.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  There is a Buttercup compact coming soon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!! Gives me the perfect natural highlighted look!!! I definitely will be ordering a back up!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice. I watched reviews on this product and it definitely lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this setting powder! I am NC44/45 and I use it over my concealer (NC42) and it makes my face look flawless. I received so many compliments after using this! It doesn&#x27;t cake up and it&#x27;s a beautiful tone for women of color. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Sometimes following the &amp;#34;masses&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t always going to work out in your favor. So I&#x27;ve been hearing about this brand and this particular powder all over YouTube. I find that the YouTube beauty community finds a product, everyone latches on to it, everyone co signs it, then they all move on to something new and claim they didn&#x27;t really love the previous product at hand. Now before we knew about this it was the banana powder. Everyone loved! the banana powder and raved how long lasting it was. I mean of course until this came along... Now everyone complains about how chalky the banana powder is, and states that Buttercup is now &amp;#34;Bae&amp;#34;. Whatever. Before that it was the MUFE translucent powder, which we all now know sometimes leaves that white powdery look in flash photos. Anyways I went and bought this basically because YouTube told me to. When I received it it did not seem much different than the Ben Nye banana powder everyone is now no longer using. I also didn&#x27;t feel like this product was worth 20$! And with that I returned it and now I see it&#x27;s currently going for 30$. I&#x27;ll pass. I didn&#x27;t find this powder to be any greater than any other setting powder. It definitely didn&#x27;t live up to the hype for me which is why I returned it. I also find loose powders to be a little messy. I know as a regular girl I would never use all of this setting powder in this lifetime. So I decided not to succumb to the hype and saved my money. This wasn&#x27;t for me, but then again, everything isn&#x27;t for everybody.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This powder is LIFE. Hunty listen, if you haven&#x27;t bought this yet then you need to. It will change your makeup game. It will completely elevate your face. This powder was so good that I bought it for myself when it was $20 and went back and got it for my best friend when they raised the price to $30.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. Excellent highlight setting powder...</li>
            <li> Love this setting powder I use it everyday to set under my eyes it very  good for  brown an dark skin lady&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This an excellent powder for setting your under eye concealer. Also, it gives a soft look to the makeup.</li>
            <li> Item was supposed to be new but came without a top and now the price is up 5$ more than what I originally paid for it.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best setting powder for the under eye area after applying concealer!!! There is no creasing at all and it&#x27;s so finely milled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the powder once and oh my goodness! It&#x27;s beautiful! It makes my under eye highlight so natural. I typically avoid &#x27;hyped&#x27; products, but I am so glad I purchased this powder.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;m so glad Amazon started distributing it because shipping from the company sucks. This is wayyy better than Ben bye because it&#x27;s really finely milled and just melts into your skin. Perfect setting powder for highlighting and contouring plus theres enough to last for a long time. A must have!</li>
            <li> Used to wear the Ben Bye Banana Powder, this one is much more silky, I am a Mac NC 44 and this color is beautiful. Doesn&#x27;t make me look ashy, can&#x27;t use the Ben Bye anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought mine at a sacha store. Amazing setting powder or for use as a highlight. Absolutely no ashy effect. Great for dark skin. Photographs well. Very soft and finely milled. You get about an ounce of product. It&#x27;s a lot! Great value for money!</li>
            <li> Amazing for women of color.</li>
            <li> I thought it was interesting that I could but this here on Amazon and with my prime, I was able to avoid 8.00 in shipping fees that Sacha would have charged me....thats one plus! The powder is finely milled and I love that, my only qualm is that I feel like my yellow undertone was accentuated with this product. I had seen YTubers with my undertone pull it off very well but, its not working for me. Plus its only good for the undereye highlight on me and i have since found a powder that works well all over even under the eye....</li>
            <li> The setting powder does what it says it does. I use it for my under eyes concealer and it instantly mattifies them and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great setting powder keeps my makeup on all day</li>
            <li> I am in love with the this product! The powder literally melts into my skin. I let it &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; under my eyes before sweeping it off and it looks so much like that kardashian under eye highlight! I will continue to buy!!!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the powder. It&#x27;s great as a setting powder for my highlight.</li>
            <li> Love this! Sets highlight to perfection.</li>
            <li> The best for setting your highlight, awe heck, you can set your entire face with this!!!&lt;br /&gt;Feels light, non drying (but I do have really oily skin), but this sets my face lovely and compliments my chocolate skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;Love...nothing but great things to say about this product!</li>
            <li> I use it to set my under eye concealer. I am a Black Female with a medium-dark complexion. This Butter Cup Powder is definitely worth having to set my under eye. If you are of a lighter complexion you could probably set your entire face with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome setting powder for highlighting</li>
            <li> Great highlight &amp;#34;cook&amp;#34; powder.... Doesn&#x27;t sit in your creases like other powders. Very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; powder, like confection sugar &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;, so brushing away is minimal. You would love this product and it goes with all skin tones, esp. us brown African American girls! It doesn&#x27;t make us look dried and ashy-lol!</li>
            <li> Love this powder..Bye bye Ben Nye.. Hello Sacha Buttercup!!</li>

            <li> I love it. I am a chocolate girl and this works great on me!</li>
            <li> This powder is perfect, I prefer this one over the banana powder because is smoother and lite. It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw this powder on utube and decided to try it, so glad i did. Other brands are very pricy and have less this is just as good and afortable price. Its my go to powder for my concelear not to crease up.</li>
            <li> Excellent for highlight . Perfect for use under eye after concealer is applied😀👍🏽</li>
            <li> Love using this powder to cook my highlight and set my under eye concealer.  It does not settle into my fine lines or look cakey. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. It slides on like butter.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and super quick shipping with Amazon prime!</li>
            <li> LOve Love LOve this stuff!!! Works just as well as BenNye and its not ashy looking on darker tones.</li>
            <li> When applied under the eyes if you let it sit a few minutes on your you&#x27;ll see powder melt into any fine lines and fill in any pores. It&#x27;s a very fine powder.</li>
            <li> Please get this. It is the bomb.com</li>
            <li> This product is number 1 in my book of favorite makeup productd.</li>
            <li> Got this after Farrah Dhukai&#x27;s rave review on YouTube. Love it. Prevents my corrector and concealer from creasing. Doesn&#x27;t look too yellow. For reference I&#x27;m NC42 .</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if i was going to like it, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Lighter than Banana Powder...I love it!</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a foundation or powder for my skin tone.  The buttercup is perfect for my skintone (light-medium/yellow skin tone)</li>
            <li> This is everything! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product but should have done a bit more research. I could have gotten from Sacha Cosmetics for $10.00 less!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $20 on their website so not sure why fifteen dollars more on Amazon. Anyways, this product is just as amazing as everyone says. It keeps my oily skin in check which I love. I now only have to blot once midday. It&#x27;s perfect once you learn how to apply it. I don&#x27;t use foundation anymore. Just foundation primer and this powder.</li>
            <li> Flawless! just flawless for our ladies of color who have cool undertones :)</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a great powder especially for the under eye area here&#x27;s your product.  great job.  I use this and then add a darker setting powder for all over but this blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Settled into fine lines. One reviewer stated this very thing, I wish I would have listened! This product settled into the lines under my eyes and made me look at least ten years older. I do not like it at all. It&#x27;s gotten so many good reviews and that is why I went for this one instead of Ben Nye, I think I&#x27;ll give ole Ben a try, it&#x27;s got to be better than this.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this setting powder. It set my foundation perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect for women of color! I&#x27;m in love and it&#x27;s inexpensive. Yayyy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nw45 in mac. It is the perfect color for setting my highlight. Love it, you can set it and forget it. It&#x27;s really good!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...takes my highlight to another level...Luv it!</li>
            <li> I love this powder more than the Ben Nye!  This powder if finely milled and does not settle into any lines in my face!</li>
            <li> I love this powder. It can be a little messy to travel with, but on this skin it is great. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Need to be package differently to make it easy to pour. Too messy! But love the product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the buttercup setting powder by Sacha and I am highly disappointed. This setting powder creased bad and it&#x27;s darker than my skin tone (nc35). I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing for Brown skin &amp; Dark skin women</li>
