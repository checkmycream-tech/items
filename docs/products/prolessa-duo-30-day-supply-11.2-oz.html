    <ol>
            <li> Actually received early very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> My wife used this product with the Herbalife Shake  and did not notice a change in her weight. She eats well and works out 45 min to an hour 5 to 6 days out the week and say nothing. Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> Can you say best thing ever?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li> Not tasety. You can taste it through all the other ingredients in your smoothie, like friuts and vanilla protein powder. So I don&#x27;t use it. Can&#x27;t tell you if it works because I don&#x27;t drink it because of the bad taste.</li>
            <li> I like the 30day prolessa I have notice less inches in my stomach. It helps when u eat high fatty foods on the weekend. I take it every other day with my Protine smoothie.</li>
            <li> Adding this product to the shake really makes you feel full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost 10 pounds total with this powder combined with my formula 1 shakes. Love this stuff. Amazon is the cheapest place to get it too. I totally recommend.</li>
            <li> The price was awesome😀</li>
            <li> Great product, and great service!</li>
            <li> it really works its not my first time using it</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, taste better when mixed with something fruity</li>
            <li> The price is wonderful compared to the $100+ price if bought from Herbalife. I followed the directions on how to use it and it does noticeably change the flavor of my shakes and it is not good. I have not bought this product from a Herbalife representative so I cannot compare taste but I plan on buying from Herbalife next month to compare. I&#x27;ve been using herbalife products for 3 weeks now along with exercise and have lost 5 pounds.</li>
            <li> Helps you stay full feeling</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this helped with making me stay feeling full. I use a scant scoop full, to help make it last longer.  It is a very fine powder and dissolves well. Read the instructions, add at the last minute. Glad I took a chance on this product. The price is also very good.</li>
            <li> Noticed a little less hunger but no weight change.</li>
            <li> This product donot have Expiry date...????Maybe This cheap by that is already expired.</li>
            <li> It made me more hungry. I poured it into my shake I rather just drink the herballife shake. Too expensive. For it do to nothing.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS GREAT! EATING RIGHT AND WORKING OUT WHILE DRINKING THIS WORKS GREAT HELPING VERY MUCH WITH MY WEIGHT</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I could not believe how great this stuff is. The very first day I took it I was not hungry all morning. It really does work with calming yourn hunger and any kind of cravings. I take this every morning with a protein shake add some fruit and I am ready to go out the house. I have not lost weight, but I have lost, about 5 inches after a month of trying it out. I work out and do weights and this might explain why I have not lost so much weight but I can tell that my body is smaller. IITs not about how much you weight because muscles weights way more than fat, so Im happy with the fact that I have not lost so much weight, I am happier that I lost inches. I drink plenty of water with this and like I said it worked the very first day I took it.</li>
            <li> A must have with your starter pack! Once a day at lunch time with your shake/meal. Curb&#x27;s your appetite, and helps you lose inches.</li>
            <li> I have seen results with this!  In combination with the Formula 1 shake mix, I have lost several inchea in my stomach which has been the most difficult area with targetted exercises.</li>
            <li> Tastes yummy in the shake!</li>
            <li> Taste is good. Need to see how it works.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I generally workout 4 times a week and eat a healthy diet. I didn&#x27;t lose any weight and didn&#x27;t feel like it curbed my appetite by any means. It also gave me stomach issues that I don&#x27;t have now that I&#x27;m off the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff fast shipping</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product to eliminate and burn fat in combination with Herbalife shake, I love it, this is my second time!!</li>
            <li> Yes. The product came in good time and it meets my expectations!!</li>
            <li> So i ordered this product  the end of july and it kept getting delayed being delivered. When i started using the product i found a strange stench  that came after i drank my shake with it. It left my shaker bottle smelling like mold and it even started to mold a little in the bottle of the shaker even if i washed it out right away.  I did some  research  about it and when i looked at the canister  for any other information  i saw the expiration date  on the bottom. It expired the beginning of this month! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Taste like paint very clumy and hurt my stomach</li>
            <li> It was on time and it works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love it got it faster than the other things I order</li>
            <li> Wish taste was different but it works .</li>
            <li> I just started using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It works! If you want to lose weight use it! The product arrive on time and in excellent conditions.</li>
            <li> Comes sealed package and expiring a year from now! Works great and I definitely feel more filled and burn more calories during the day. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I was eating 60% right and it still was effective .. So for my last two weeks I&#x27;m going to do 90% and see what it does</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will, but it has a very chalky taste.  Because of the cost I don&#x27;t think I will order again.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper purchasing this product from here...got shipment in a few days. Great results</li>
            <li> its ok, does not mix well with any fluids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about a month and so far I&#x27;m seeing results</li>
            <li> As described in the product details - It works fantastic for losing inches with the other discipline actions.</li>
