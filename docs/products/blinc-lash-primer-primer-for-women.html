            <li>It is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Blinc mascara is great.</li>
            <li>Great product, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how it would stand up to a good cry</li>
            <li>I have also used Clinique and I feel this is just as good.</li>
            <li>greay company with good ingredients</li>
            <li>Stays on till washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Love this product...works soo well with my blinc mascara</li>
            <li>.....makes my lasehs absorb the mascara better...</li>
            <li>I love the Blinc lash primer.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyelash primer, I used to use cils booster by Lancôme</li>
            <li>Love the product -</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS and will always use it.</li>
            <li>And I top it off with the Blinc mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan for years and continue to love this product.</li>
            <li>It makes the Mascara even better.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, some is in good condition and some appear to be old or to have gotten too warm for a period of time.</li>
            <li>and I think this is just as good and more reasonably priced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When it was time to remove  it off my eyes, everything came off easily.</li>
            <li>so if you get caught in the rain it will remove some of the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; but the clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s s animal friendly.</li>
            <li>I love to use this first (before mascara) because it dries a bit slower than mascara</li>
            <li>Recommended by an aesthetician and she was right!</li>
            <li>This primer plus Blinc dark brown mascara are great.  </li>
            <li>It adds a nice coat to my lashes and after I finish with my mascara, I have long full looking lashes.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>When I get a new tube, I like it to be and easy to apply, not clumpy.</li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t buy again as I&#x27;ve seen some better ones for similar pricing.</li>
            <li>When I purchased  the first tube of Blinc Mascara, I did not see this primer.</li>
            <li>This time around I just paid a lot more for it and it didn&#x27;t come on the other end of a tube of mascara as it was sold by a major manufacturer back then.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Seems old and sticky.</li>
            <li>Now, my lashes are almost 2x my natural length.</li>
            <li>The coverage is much heavier than other products that I&#x27;ve tried on the market</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave a black film under your eyes after the clean up like some other mascaras do.</li>

            <li> and when you apply to lashes it feels very wet</li>

            <li> I agree with the previous review.</li>

            <li> While I realize there are no miracle lash growers, this product disappointed me in what it actually did claim it would do in comparison to what it did do; clump my mascara very thinkly on my lashes.</li>

            <li> This product does what it states, however, it comes out  very thick</li>

            <li> Love this product...works soo well with my blinc mascara.....makes my lasehs absorb the mascara better...just takes a few swipes and lasts a very long time....Blinc is the best..and I have used the best mascaras...this is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This product does what it states, however, it comes out  very thick and when you apply to lashes it feels very wet</li>
            <li> While I realize there are no miracle lash growers, this product disappointed me in what it actually did claim it would do in comparison to what it did do; clump my mascara very thinkly on my lashes. It also causes your lashes to separate and look unnaturally pointy. Lastly, I was recommended this product by an aqaintance in passing but would not have ordered it had I realized it was the same as an over the counter \\&quot;lash primer\\&quot; I tried years ago and was already disappointed in the outcome. This time around I just paid a lot more for it and it didn&#x27;t come on the other end of a tube of mascara as it was sold by a major manufacturer back then.</li>
            <li> I love the Blinc lash primer.  The coverage is much heavier than other products that I&#x27;ve tried on the market but it helps to condition my eyelashes at night which is when I apply it.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash primer, I used to use cils booster by Lancôme and I think this is just as good and more reasonably priced here on Amazon. It adds a nice coat to my lashes and after I finish with my mascara, I have long full looking lashes. I use it every time I put on mascara.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous review. Blinc mascara is great. Once applied it stays on until you remove it. It&#x27;s not waterproof so if you get caught in the rain it will remove some of the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; but the clean up is quick and easy. I can&#x27;t say how it would stand up to a good cry but I suspect it would also loosen the hold of some of the \\&quot;tubes\\&quot;.  Removing the mascara is a breeze with makeup remover and it doesn&#x27;t leave a black film under your eyes after the clean up like some other mascaras do. I like to use the mascara with the blinc lash primer. My lashes are healthier because of the primer and it gives a fuller look to your lashes with you use the primer under the mascara.</li>
            <li> Great product, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love the product - It works. Must wait 30 seconds before applying the Blinc Mascra but it is so worth it.  I run and this stuff stays until I take it off.  I LOVE THIS and will always use it.</li>
            <li> Seems old and sticky. Also, appears to be less product in the tube. When I get a new tube, I like it to be and easy to apply, not clumpy. I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, some is in good condition and some appear to be old or to have gotten too warm for a period of time.</li>
            <li> I like this primer. I have also used Clinique and I feel this is just as good. It goes on well and it seems like my lashes are a little longer since I started  using this product. Definitely a bonus! If you wait too long to put on mascara though, it gets a little hard and the mascara doesn&#x27;t go on as well.</li>
            <li> excellent,  even put on my eyebrows to help grow and it&#x27;s s animal friendly. greay company with good ingredients</li>
            <li> This primer plus Blinc dark brown mascara are great.  First time my eyes haven&#x27;t reacted negatively to mascara.  Stays on till washed off with warm water.</li>
            <li> This is the only primer I use. And I top it off with the Blinc mascara. I have been a fan for years and continue to love this product.</li>
            <li> I did eyelash extensions for 6 months, tried Latisse, and either my lashes got pulled out to almost nothing, or saw no results with prescription formula. Now, my lashes are almost 2x my natural length. I bought Blinc primer only for thickening, not expecting them to grow the way they have!! A definite surprise and an 8th of the cost! I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Primer is gross, watery and clumpy</li>
            <li> It does the job. However, I won&#x27;t buy again as I&#x27;ve seen some better ones for similar pricing.</li>
            <li> I love to use this first (before mascara) because it dries a bit slower than mascara so you have time to get your lashes separated and put them where you want them before applying mascara.  Recommended by an aesthetician and she was right!</li>
            <li> When I purchased  the first tube of Blinc Mascara, I did not see this primer. After reading the reviews I figured I would try it too.  It is awesome.  It makes the Mascara even better.  After I put it on and  waited a minute or so, then put the mascara on, it did go on faster. Plus I only needed to put on one coat, so you save on Mascara.  When it was time to remove  it off my eyes, everything came off easily. No rubbing. I would purchase it again along with the Blinc Mascara.</li>
            <li> Love. I use with blinc black mascara</li>
