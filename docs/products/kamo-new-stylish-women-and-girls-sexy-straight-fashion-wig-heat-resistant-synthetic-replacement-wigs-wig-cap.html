            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>colors are nice tho .also</li>
            <li>nice wig did NOT come with wig cap like stated .</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this wig</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how anyone would be able to wear this for any period of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Some of the customer photos are really cute.</li>
            <li>Love it except for the part.</li>
            <li>Looks really cute if you&#x27;re going to wear a hat of some sort.</li>
            <li>Looks better in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love the wig..</li>
            <li>I am a hair stylist and it is now my favorite wig.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and soft and affordable.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly</li>
            <li>Very stunning look, wig looks and feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>Did not like the fit or style once I got it.</li>
            <li>This wig is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this wig to cover my own hair (I have short, turquoise hair) while at work.  </li>
            <li>Do have to brush it with a special brush after I put it on..</li>
            <li>Would never be able to pull off as real</li>
            <li>This wig has beautiful colors, as other reviewers described, but the hairline where the skin part is didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing a couple more until my hair grows back from chemotherapy. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s three colors: medium brown, warm brown, and a really light blonde.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at the customer pics or reviews first.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig!</li>
            <li>It fits really well and looks and feels pretty decent.</li>
            <li>feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>Just too much hair.</li>
            <li>it doesnt look like the pictures but for the price didnt expect to much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping....</li>
            <li>It does not look real</li>
            <li>Just fabulous the part is white</li>
            <li>so looks vey real.</li>
            <li>Pros are the hair it really dense.  </li>
            <li>The three colors are blended throughout, and the light blonde isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really thick, which is fine, but what the picture doesn&#x27;t show very well are these huge, nearly white chunks right at the face.  </li>
            <li>Was pleased with the quality of the product for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Looked more blonde than brown because of those white chunks..</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have high hope for it.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be blended in a little better than they are.  </li>
            <li>I think it looks a little more natural with a hat on.</li>
            <li>I moved the part over a little bit, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>got a lot of comploiments not exactly the colors i was hoping it was but still very pretty</li>
            <li>Looks natural on me..</li>
            <li>I was able to pull half of the hair back into a ponytail, and the underlayer had enough hair to still cover the cap and not allow my personal hair to be seen.  </li>
            <li>The blonde pops out so much it&#x27;s distracting to the quality of the overall wig, which is why I was styling the hair away from my face.  </li>
            <li>The highlights area lot more blonde than I thought they&#x27;d be, so there is a lot of styling that needs done, but its a fairly thick wig.</li>
            <li>I am going to have some one thin it out some and see if it looks better, I hope it does</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The wig was full but the seam showed and the two blonde streaks in front made it look fake.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look bad by itself either completely love the wig</li>
            <li> Needs a haircut but thats expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the wig will work for someone that has long hair under the wig, because for me the wig is slightly tight (I have a medium sized head).</li>
            <li> Got this wig for my models during photoshoots as well as for when I wan long hair.</li>
            <li> The color and style is just not right for me....</li>
            <li> but I returned it as you can see the seam down the part.</li>
            <li> Cutting bangs into this wig will not work, as the center part is very set.</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that the highlights are &amp;#34;mirrored&amp;#34; to the other side (making it look fake).</li>
            <li> Initially I had worn this as a middle part wig, but it looked atrocious.</li>
            <li> This wig is entirely too dense and the highlights are so fake looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very heavy</li>
            <li> but it is way to thick up front</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so thick up front</li>
            <li> I am a little sad</li>
            <li> The highlights look fake at roots and the front is heavy and falls forward in my face, but with a hat</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> The highlights are too uniform and makes them look to fake.</li>
            <li> and I feel stupid wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a tall forehead and this looked terrible when I tried it on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice wig, great price, is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig this is the second time I have bought it but I always wear a hat or beanie when i wear it but it doesn&#x27;t look bad by itself either completely love the wig</li>
            <li> I am returning this. NOT because of the quality. GREAT quality... but two reasons. The color and style is just not right for me.... But take NOTE!! The highlights are too uniform and makes them look to fake. Otherwise, GREAT quality and very pretty! I might have even gotten around the highlights if it were a style and color for me.</li>
            <li> Did not like the fit or style once I got it. I have a bit of a tall forehead and this looked terrible when I tried it on. It&#x27;s also very heavy and I don&#x27;t know how anyone would be able to wear this for any period of time. Sent back.</li>
            <li> Highlights are way too chunky. Makes this look like a wig and only a wig. Would never be able to pull off as real</li>
            <li> Was pleased with the quality of the product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It&#x27;s really thick, which is fine, but what the picture doesn&#x27;t show very well are these huge, nearly white chunks right at the face.  There are also a lot of colors in this wig.  In the end it wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for.  Looked more blonde than brown because of those white chunks..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the customer pics or reviews first. I should have because the highlights are not as blended as I would have liked. It&#x27;s an inexpensive  wig though, so I&#x27;ll probably wear it anyway. Some of the customer photos are really cute. I&#x27;ll use those to help me out.</li>
            <li> Arrived Quickly Looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments on this and love the color! Beautiful wig, fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this 5 stars if you change the title of the product I bought it tried curling it and it melted it is NOT heat resistant</li>
            <li> On time. great product. feels like real hair. Just too much hair. Overall I like it.</li>
            <li> The wig was full but the seam showed and the two blonde streaks in front made it look fake. Fix that and it would be a five star!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful! Love it except for the part. I have never worn a wig so if you could tell me how to change the part. I am guessing when I wash it.</li>
            <li> Looks like a Halloween costume wig</li>
            <li> It fits really well and looks and feels pretty decent.</li>
            <li> it doesnt look like the pictures but for the price didnt expect to much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and soft and affordable. The highlights look fake at roots and the front is heavy and falls forward in my face, but with a hat it is AMAZING!!! Great quality!!! I want more like this!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous! This wig is entirely too dense and the highlights are so fake looking. Perfect for a halloween costume!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.... Nice</li>
            <li> Came very quickly but I returned it as you can see the seam down the part. 😔</li>
            <li> It does not look real</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price. My only dislike is that the highlights are &amp;#34;mirrored&amp;#34; to the other side (making it look fake). Looks really cute if you&#x27;re going to wear a hat of some sort.</li>
            <li> hairline by for head was bald and that part in the middle looks unsightly ...colors are nice tho .also the hair falls out a lot and very easily ...if u buy this wear a hat!</li>
            <li> Not as described.. Hair is falling out. Looks like a rats nest..</li>
            <li> Very nice fit,and the product came in a nice bag and was exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> nice wig did NOT come with wig cap like stated .</li>
            <li> got a lot of comploiments not exactly the colors i was hoping it was but still very pretty</li>
            <li> I really like this wig! I think it looks a little more natural with a hat on. The highlights are very modern and the cut is very cute! I received my order in two days and I&#x27;m very happy with the thickness and quality of the wig. I&#x27;ll be purchasing a couple more until my hair grows back from chemotherapy. :)</li>
            <li> This wig is very pretty, bright highlights. Very stunning look, wig looks and feels like real hair. Very easy to brush and maintain not shiny plastic look like others I&#x27;ve seen. I will be buying more wigs like this, very very good quality.</li>
            <li> Do not like it at all. Looks better in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love the wig.. Looks natural on me.. Do have to brush it with a special brush after I put it on..</li>
            <li> This wig is fabulous.  I am a hair stylist and it is now my favorite wig. Needs a haircut but thats expected.  Just fabulous the part is white so looks vey real. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> This wig has beautiful colors, as other reviewers described, but the hairline where the skin part is didn&#x27;t look right. I tried sewing it under, and that helped but not enough. Cutting bangs into this wig will not work, as the center part is very set. I ordered 2 of these and only one had the hairline issue, so you can take your chances. I will not be purchasing this again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, even in perfect condition, the center part can&#x27;t be changed and doesn&#x27;t look very good on me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the color but it is way to thick up front and I feel stupid wearing it. I am going to have some one thin it out some and see if it looks better, I hope it does but I don&#x27;t have high hope for it. If it wasn&#x27;t so thick up front I think it would be a great wig. I am a little sad</li>
            <li> Got this wig for my models during photoshoots as well as for when I wan long hair. Initially I had worn this as a middle part wig, but it looked atrocious. I moved the part over a little bit, and it looks fantastic. The highlights area lot more blonde than I thought they&#x27;d be, so there is a lot of styling that needs done, but its a fairly thick wig. Looks good wavy and straightened. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to have one of my models wear it!</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this wig to cover my own hair (I have short, turquoise hair) while at work.  Pros are the hair it really dense.  I was able to pull half of the hair back into a ponytail, and the underlayer had enough hair to still cover the cap and not allow my personal hair to be seen.  It seems the front two inches of hair along the seam is the densest, probably because of the highlights they put in the wig.  These highlights, however, are a con for me.  I thought they would be blended in a little better than they are.  It&#x27;s three colors: medium brown, warm brown, and a really light blonde.  The blonde pops out so much it&#x27;s distracting to the quality of the overall wig, which is why I was styling the hair away from my face.  The three colors are blended throughout, and the light blonde isn&#x27;t so dang in-your-face otherwise.  I don&#x27;t know how well the wig will work for someone that has long hair under the wig, because for me the wig is slightly tight (I have a medium sized head).</li>
