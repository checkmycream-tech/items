            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Great light and great magnifier</li>
            <li>The lighting is as bright as my conair home mirror reflections which is to say it&#x27;s nice and bright</li>
            <li>Closes up nicely</li>
            <li>I needed one primarily for &amp;#34;detail work&amp;#34; which is a nice euphemism for plucking and tweezing all areas of my face!</li>
            <li>10x is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>This travel mirror is well made, has a great magnification &amp; is easy to carry as it folds up easily.</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for the smaller jobs.</li>
            <li>i bit bulky but worth it since it has good lighting compared to hotel lighting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Appreciate that the magnifying mirror is on top.  </li>
            <li>I ended up breaking the hing for the top magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>Really like this mirror, and feel it will be great for travel.  </li>
            <li>I gave some as gifts and my friends were pleased.</li>
            <li>I had to put it on top of books to put on my makeup, otherwise I would have to bend over to see the mirror (even though I had expanded the length).  </li>
            <li>Found another Floxite 7504-10L like much better</li>
            <li>perfect for travel, but pack it carefully in luggage if flyingâ€¦it will break</li>
            <li>My cheap hand mirror worked better.</li>
            <li>The lighting is very bright and the circular concentration around the mirror is more useful than my old one which had a light just under the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these for myself and liked it so much that I bought two more for gifts.</li>
            <li>and it stands and conforms easily.</li>
            <li>Product would probably be fine except it was too strong magnification for me</li>
            <li>Mirror works fine.</li>
            <li>Light and compact for travel.</li>
            <li>so you could use their light and your 10x.</li>
            <li>The light is sufficient if you&#x27;re applying make-up, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li>in that it&#x27;s light, foldable, and has a case.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a teeny bit smaller, but this is a great mirror and will go with me on all my trips.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t light up.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mirror originally at Brookstone.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Excellent magnification (may be a little too powerful for some),</li>
            <li>I really liked my old one</li>
            <li>/blush because you need to be able to see the whole face for that.</li>
            <li>They gave me a full refund with returned product.</li>
            <li>This is a gift for my wife and she love it, Thanks</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>This little lighted mirror is great for vacation.</li>
            <li>Worked great until the top mirror&#x27;s light failed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>She found it useful as we travelled around from hotel to hotel.</li>
            <li>Great little lighted mirror for travel, and just the right size for your cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>Would have given it a five rating if lighting were a little brighter, but overall, this is the best travel mirror I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If the mirror was a little bigger it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Since it folds  flat it would still be easy to fit in a suitcase if it were larger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would love to see this company come out with something bigger.</li>
            <li>Since I only use this for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;, it ended up being the better choice.</li>
            <li>Batteries should last longer than most because of LED lights.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it consistently for four weeks now and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery.</li>
            <li>Again, have not been able to locate a Zadro mirror in local stores here in Greenwood, SC.  </li>
            <li>Took it on a recent trip and was glad to have it.</li>
            <li>but with the illuminated outer rim show exactly where you&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li>It went on it&#x27;s first trip last week and did a fine job.</li>
            <li>I had to place it atop of my duffle bag on top of a desk to get it high enough to meet my face so that I could put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s still large enough to do detailed tweezing &amp; makeup (which is why I wanted an LED/10x mirror, anyway).</li>
            <li>The lights are great when you have poor hotel lighting.</li>
            <li>This is much better quality than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to superglue it but not holding out much hope it will work.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t find that very often with online shopping.</li>
            <li>far as the complaints about the size, it&#x27;s exactly as described in their description; so, no surprises there.</li>
            <li>Nice, small makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>Oh the joys of getting older.  </li>
            <li>I understand in older models it was on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I have an older version of this mirror, and think this is a substantial upgrade.  </li>
            <li>so you have to find a high surface to put it on.  </li>
            <li>the magnified for detail work and  the normal mirror for mineral makeup</li>
            <li>Not a great mirror but good for travel</li>
            <li>This little travel mirror raises to about 12 inches when extended - it &amp;#34;out shines&amp;#34; all others inthat both the regular and the magnification mirror light up unlike most where only the bottom mirror will actually light - easy to compact down for travel and battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I sent it right back and would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li>in a bathroom or other room with added light.</li>
            <li>I installed the new batteries</li>
            <li>I never expected this mirror to be these large and out of balance.  </li>
            <li>I felt I needed to write this because so many folks were complaining that it was small.</li>
            <li>I used for the first time while traveling and away from my lighted big mirror.  </li>
            <li>Purchase this as a gift, great concept but way to small for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Large enough to put makeup on.</li>
            <li>My only concern is the first time I used it the light flickered a couple of times so a little worried about how well made it is and how long it will last, but if it does, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $30, especially compared to the larger LED mirrors for triple &amp; quadruple the price.</li>
            <li>No distortion and unlike a lot of the other more expensive travel mirrors, you can angle this one around easily and don&#x27;t have to prop it up on things to get the height.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly flexible and when opened it can be awkward to get the right angle.  </li>
            <li>There is not enough light, the mirror is too small.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, our Wal-Mart isn&#x27;t restocking this brand.</li>
            <li>Opened up, it can stand on its own (although it does slowly creep down as the minutes pass, which is a reason I gave it 4 stars;</li>
            <li>Would be helpful, if the mirror extended a little higher.</li>
            <li>When I travel, I often find that I have a large mirror for doing my hair but not a small one for small jobs like eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is 3-1/2&amp;#34;, too small to be useful.  </li>
            <li>Light is not bright enough to be helpful.</li>

            <li> Light is not bright enough to be helpful.</li>
            <li> Light not ideal.</li>
            <li> So dim that I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was on until I went into a dark room.</li>
            <li> Found one a long time ago in our Wal-Mart, but I dropped it recently and broke it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought new batteries, thinking that what I had might be dead.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going abroad and fine yourself unable to see properly to have a decent shave, then look no more; purchase one of these.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> an just be very careful or look for an alternate product.  </li>
            <li> The casing is very protective, so no worries of broken glass while traveling.</li>
            <li> Be careful though -</li>
            <li> Only made it a few trips then broke where it folds between the two mirrors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mirror works fine. Smaller than I expected. Very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> The magnification is great - lighting is great - but what I don&#x27;t like about it is the size ... the mirrors are too small</li>
            <li> It was a great deal  i like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. The lighting is bright and even. You can see every pore in the 10x. The mirrors are strait and sturdy. The casing is very protective, so no worries of broken glass while traveling. I like the option to have one or both lights on. Opened up, it can stand on its own (although it does slowly creep down as the minutes pass, which is a reason I gave it 4 stars; the other being that it&#x27;s hard to open up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the complaints about the size, it&#x27;s exactly as described in their description; so, no surprises there. Plus, it&#x27;s still large enough to do detailed tweezing &amp; makeup (which is why I wanted an LED/10x mirror, anyway). Definitely worth the $30, especially compared to the larger LED mirrors for triple &amp; quadruple the price.</li>
            <li> horrible LIGHTING, all you can see is 1 eye at a time.  Closes up nicely and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Worked great until the top mirror&#x27;s light failed. I am past Amazon&#x27;s return date, but the mirror has only been used for 3 trips in less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> It went on it&#x27;s first trip last week and did a fine job. Folds up small and the case protects the mirrors well.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself and liked it so much that I bought two more for gifts. When I travel, I often find that I have a large mirror for doing my hair but not a small one for small jobs like eye makeup. This mirror is perfect for the smaller jobs. The lights are great when you have poor hotel lighting.</li>
            <li> This mirror arrived on time, however it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  I went out and bought new batteries, thinking that what I had might be dead.  I installed the new batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work.  Piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The mirror is perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror originally at Brookstone.  Then saw it on Amazon and gave it as a gift.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  Great light and great magnifier and it stands and conforms easily.</li>
            <li> The magnifier is almost scary in it&#x27;s power. Just what I needed for a summer place I visit in a northern pine forest with poor inside and outside lighting. One needs to use both lights, though, to see well in the regular strength mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent lighting!  Would be helpful, if the mirror extended a little higher.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use. Doesn&#x27;t stay in position set. Tips over. Light not ideal. 10x is VERY strong. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This little travel mirror raises to about 12 inches when extended - it &amp;#34;out shines&amp;#34; all others inthat both the regular and the magnification mirror light up unlike most where only the bottom mirror will actually light - easy to compact down for travel and battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mirror. Great light and perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> this is my second one.  I really liked my old one but my daughter broke it.  I don&#x27;t know how so I had to get another one.  I always take it when I travel.  i bit bulky but worth it since it has good lighting compared to hotel lighting.</li>
            <li> Nice, small makeup mirror.  Good for traveling.  One of the best and smallest I have found.  Oh the joys of getting older.  This does the job.</li>
            <li> I researched travel mirrors extensively before giving this a shot. I needed one primarily for &amp;#34;detail work&amp;#34; which is a nice euphemism for plucking and tweezing all areas of my face! The lighting is as bright as my conair home mirror reflections which is to say it&#x27;s nice and bright which I was worried about based on other reviews. No distortion and unlike a lot of the other more expensive travel mirrors, you can angle this one around easily and don&#x27;t have to prop it up on things to get the height. If you are looking for a mirror to apply makeup, I wouldn&#x27;t go with this model as the non magnified mirror is on the bottom and would be a bit awkward to look into...and it&#x27;s quite small. But for what I was looking for, it&#x27;s perfect. Light and compact for travel. My only concern is the first time I used it the light flickered a couple of times so a little worried about how well made it is and how long it will last, but if it does, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The lighted perimeter of the mirror takes up 1/2&amp;#34; of the mirror.  The mirror itself is 3-1/2&amp;#34;, too small to be useful.  The 1x mirror is the lower mirror so you have to find a high surface to put it on.  Wish it had a way to hang it on the hotel mirror so you could use their light and your 10x.</li>
            <li> I took this to Europe for two weeks because I couldn&#x27;t find an electric makeup mirror that would work over there with an adapter.  I had to place it atop of my duffle bag on top of a desk to get it high enough to meet my face so that I could put my makeup on.  You don&#x27;t want to be looking down at a mirror to put your makeup on!  Eventually I figured out that it&#x27;s easier to hold it in your hand while putting on mascara or lipstick but for tasks that require two hands such as putting on eyeliner you will find yourself scrunched over it which resulted in a backache for me by the time I got all my makeup on. The mirrors are very small,  and need to be twice the size that they are.  Since it folds  flat it would still be easy to fit in a suitcase if it were larger.&lt;br /&gt; I used both mirrors,...the magnified for detail work and  the normal mirror for mineral makeup/blush because you need to be able to see the whole face for that.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Lighting is great! Perfect size! I no longer have to travel with my big mirror</li>
            <li> I ordered this to travel with and out of the box it didn&#x27;t work.  I sent it right back and would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> This little lighted mirror is great for vacation. Remember, it is small. It&#x27;s supposed to be! It&#x27;s for travel. I felt I needed to write this because so many folks were complaining that it was small. The light is sufficient if you&#x27;re applying make-up, etc. in a bathroom or other room with added light. To me it is big enough to see the areas you&#x27;re working on.</li>
            <li> So dim that I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was on until I went into a dark room.</li>
            <li> Purchase this as a gift, great concept but way to small for everyday use. Would love to see this company come out with something bigger.</li>
            <li> This is much better quality than I expected.  It&#x27;s sturdy and well made.  The lighting is very bright and the circular concentration around the mirror is more useful than my old one which had a light just under the mirror.  I still need to set it on something to get the height my aging back requires.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate that the magnifying mirror is on top.  I understand in older models it was on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/20/15.  I ended up breaking the hing for the top magnifying mirror.  It&#x27;s not terribly flexible and when opened it can be awkward to get the right angle.  I&#x27;m going to try to superglue it but not holding out much hope it will work.  I&#x27;m on the fence if I should order another an just be very careful or look for an alternate product.  Removed one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6/1/15. I ended up purchasing the smaller (and less expensive) 15x mirror offered here on amazon.  Since I only use this for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;, it ended up being the better choice.</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror. Small enough to use in carry on luggage. Large enough to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> Didnt work upon purchase. Had to return it. They gave me a full refund with returned product.</li>
            <li> Really like this mirror, and feel it will be great for travel.  Batteries should last longer than most because of LED lights.  Would have given it a five rating if lighting were a little brighter, but overall, this is the best travel mirror I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for travel or everyday use. I&#x27;ve used it consistently for four weeks now and still haven&#x27;t had to change the battery. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Too small and very heavy for travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel mirror.</li>
            <li> Again, have not been able to locate a Zadro mirror in local stores here in Greenwood, SC.  Found one a long time ago in our Wal-Mart, but I dropped it recently and broke it.  Apparently, our Wal-Mart isn&#x27;t restocking this brand.</li>
            <li> Not a great mirror but good for travel in that it&#x27;s light, foldable, and has a case.  I gave some as gifts and my friends were pleased.</li>
            <li> I have an older version of this mirror, and think this is a substantial upgrade.  I travel a lot, and haven&#x27;t found a great solution for close-in makeup application and eyebrow tweezing until I hit on this.  I wish it were a teeny bit smaller, but this is a great mirror and will go with me on all my trips.</li>
            <li> Great compact travel item</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my wife and she love it, Thanks</li>
            <li> Sent product back.  Mirrors are too small, stand is awkward and unsteady.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.  I used for the first time while traveling and away from my lighted big mirror.  It worked great and I look forward to using it on vacation next week.  I won&#x27;t come back with my eyebrows looking awful!  Yah!</li>
            <li> Excellent for traveling.</li>
            <li> Really small and it wouldn&#x27;t light up.  Returned it for a refund</li>
            <li> This mirror looked promising but it was dead on arrival, so I returned it.  Also, it was heavier than I could afford in my travel bag when every ounce counts.</li>
            <li> I never expected this mirror to be these large and out of balance.  It is awkward, the lighting too dim, and focal range seems off.  We were away when it arrived and then it was too late to return it.</li>
            <li> we travel and sometimes the lights is the hotels bathrooms are just too low so I got this little unit and my Girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Took it on a recent trip and was glad to have it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for my trip to Europe.  There is not enough light, the mirror is too small.  I had to put it on top of books to put on my makeup, otherwise I would have to bend over to see the mirror (even though I had expanded the length).  I am very disappointed in this mirror.  I do not recommend anyone to purchase.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going abroad and fine yourself unable to see properly to have a decent shave, then look no more; purchase one of these. Excellent magnification (may be a little too powerful for some), but with the illuminated outer rim show exactly where you&#x27;ve missed. Recommend this item to both women or men.</li>
            <li> Way too small a mirror for my needs.  Found another Floxite 7504-10L like much better</li>
            <li> works great for travel.</li>
            <li> perfect for travel, but pack it carefully in luggage if flyingâ€¦it will break</li>
            <li> Product would probably be fine except it was too strong magnification for me so I returned it.  Be careful though - there was a 15% restocking charge.  You don&#x27;t find that very often with online shopping.</li>
            <li> Mirror was difficult to use because both mirrors are too small - even for travel mirrors. Light is not bright enough to be helpful. My cheap hand mirror worked better.</li>
            <li> Great little lighted mirror for travel, and just the right size for your cosmetic bag. I received it as a gift and bought one for my daughter also.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and my wife loved it. She found it useful as we travelled around from hotel to hotel.</li>
            <li> This travel mirror is well made, has a great magnification &amp; is easy to carry as it folds up easily. Good product. If the mirror was a little bigger it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like. Only made it a few trips then broke where it folds between the two mirrors.</li>
            <li> Works the way it says it does. Takes up little space in your luggage. Just what my wife was looking for.</li>
