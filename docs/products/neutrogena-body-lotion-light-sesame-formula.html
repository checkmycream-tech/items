            <li>one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most scents in products.  </li>
            <li>Then there are those who are given headaches by the smells of many products.  </li>
            <li>I will order  more soon</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>

            <li>Love the two fers</li>
            <li>Love it for night cream before going to bed.</li>
            <li>A must have after a refreshing shower with Neutrogena&#x27;s Shower Gel</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of this lotion &amp;</li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of the greasy feeling most lotions leave on your hands</li>
            <li>and I have been doing it for years :)</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would moisturize more.</li>
            <li>I do love Netrogena hand cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion on and off for years and still love</li>
            <li>This is pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is very light.</li>
            <li>The scent in this lotion is light but lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent</li>
            <li>It is lighter than most lotions, but still leaves my skin silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the light sesame fragrance, and my skin is noticeably softer after applying it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much care for a good deal of these products</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite as strong a scent as the body oil, but it is there in the background.  </li>
            <li>The smell was so strong I couldn&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant sesame scent, not too overpowering like perfume, but just enough to be refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Light and smooth, protects your skin without any greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs well, and helps keep my hands and skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li>and it is said to be a light lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin feeling so silky smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li>I used the light sesame oil as well.  </li>
            <li>Light and creamy.</li>
            <li>how smooth it makes my skin</li>
            <li>Both the lotion and the scent are light</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs well -</li>
            <li>The scent is a nice light sesame frangrance, and the consistency is very silky.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t leave your hands oily very long and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I like but not that great for dry  hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is super light and fresh, and the moisturizer is also light (so you don&#x27;t feel all greasy).</li>
            <li>It is a great combo to feel fresh all day long</li>
            <li>And it has a fresh and light smell.</li>
            <li>It smells light and fresh.</li>
            <li>His skin has never been in such good shape.</li>
            <li>I like how this lotion is light and non-greasy, leaving my skin with just the right amount of moisture after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>quick delivery</li>
            <li>I really love the soft  clean scent of this lotion.</li>
            <li>they give this lotion at Hampton Inns (and I used to stock up on the little bottles every time I stayed there lol).</li>
            <li>and I really like the light lotion feel.  </li>
            <li>My hands looked really moisturized from this light lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a light moisturize that is not greasy and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>fresh from the box.</li>
            <li>This formula is lightweight, fast absorbing and non greasy which I love.</li>
            <li>The only reason I went four stars is because it didn&#x27;t heal my hands on its own.</li>
            <li>, it is the only kind I will use.</li>
            <li>The consistency, absorption, the feeling left in the skin afterwards, even though not as good as my old product, are worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than all the other main brands (top brands) and stores in the mall.</li>
            <li>and I think it was good just a little pricey</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small size (larger than travel size) is perfect to carry in my gym bag or luggage without being too bulky.  </li>
            <li>I first found this in a hotel-</li>
            <li>light going on skin not heavy like some products</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Neutrogena Body Lotion.</li>
            <li>I actually wish that it smelled a bit more like the body oil</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft And smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and soft....</li>
            <li>I have purchased and re-purchased many Neutrogena products for daily use</li>
            <li>I recently tried the neutrogena body washes and I love them</li>
            <li>I found it at someone&#x27;s home years ago and wrote it down as I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>The light, almost lemony, scent is refreshing and fades quickly so as not to interfere with cologne.  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday use, on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>Had to return it back, Amazon was good in taking it back.</li>
            <li>Have loved this lotion for years, so hope they keep making this lovely, for the price in a pump, you just can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li>Not sure why some said it didn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li>Light with a light subtle clean smell.</li>
            <li>so I would only put on lotion if I really had to... until I discovered Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame formula</li>
            <li>I really like it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time sniffing lotions as for the most part</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted there are going to be people who &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t Stand It&amp;#34; but there are a whole lot of people who will dislike something.  </li>
            <li>I wold recommend this to absolutely everyone because trust me,</li>
            <li>I buy it every summer because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>I showed it today to 4 different people who have different tastes and no one liked it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it as it said it has the same Light Sesame Formula as the Body Oil which I was mainly placing the order for.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, but not thick.</li>
            <li>This lotion is light, but keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li>When I put it on, I was getting that same feeling other lotions give, but then noticed the scent and while enjoying it, realized the lotion had just absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is mainly intended to be applied after a shower or bath while the skin is still damp.  </li>
            <li>It was a good price too -  not a strong fragrance but enough.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is hard to explain how amazing this stuff is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick or sticky.  </li>
            <li>A real deal to get two for under ten dollars, plus not having to look for it in stores is the real bonus!</li>
            <li>I used to use Lubriderm with oatmeal, because I have really dry skin, but am so happy I found this and that is works without being so thick.</li>
            <li>It is light enough for daily wear on your hands without feeling like you rubbed on petroleum jelly like some hand lotions.</li>
            <li>I actually used this lotion and mixed with the Neutrogena light sesame oil for a couple of weeks to heal.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive so I cannot wear normal stick deodorant (plus</li>
            <li>There is nothing I can complain about as far as how they were shipped, the condition of the shipment or the product.</li>
            <li>have to give it for amazon for the fast returning procedures and overall services with me.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, even with the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in the US for only a few weeks, and I searched high and low for my favorite lotion, a Neutrogena extra light for dry skin, until resigning and admitting it&#x27;s not sold here.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I apply the Neutrogena sesame oil onto my wet skin.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft and calming and the lotion is rich without being too oily or heavy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have asthma, but some of these things people wear because they think they smell good can seriously cause some other people to nearly die because they cannot breathe...</li>
            <li>Also has only a soft scent for those that or sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>however they are made for something with more body than oil and the oil just more or less runs through the roller ball type and the other applicators are basically and open platform that the lotion would stick to well enough and long enough for me to get it from the applicator to my back and then be pushed around over the skin on my back after a shower.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is a little thinner than I like, but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product 4 stars because you do have to re-apply a couple times per day to not feel dry where as the oil lasts all day (but is greasy for the first 30 minutes or so...)</li>
            <li>But it can be used as a general lotion</li>
            <li>this is a light weight hard working body lotion - this is the only lotion i use - not overpowering scent</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the really big single bottle which is often hard to get the last 1/4 out of the bottom.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, but it is getting harder to find it at your normal outlet stores.  </li>
            <li>This was the exact product she was missing.</li>
            <li>They were very fast, and I had no more problems.</li>
            <li>I think they stopped using quite so much in their products now as I&#x27;ve not been prevented from getting near the aisle lately.  </li>

            <li> Very light and airy both in scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li> It is a very light fresh scent and feels good on your skin no greasy residue</li>
            <li> We will buy some more when this one is over.</li>
            <li> love this lotion.</li>
            <li> light, absorbs quickly, nice sent</li>
            <li> I use it in the summer and in the mornings when I can&#x27;t wait for a more substantial lotion or cream to penetrate.  </li>
            <li> It is nice when I need something light, though, so I will keep it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Once healed, the lotion alone has prevented any more cracking.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> but it sure does help.  </li>
            <li> Love the silky feeling it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  </li>
            <li> so I went to Amazon.com and was able to find it with no problem.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most scents in products.  </li>
            <li> Then there are those who are given headaches by the smells of many products.  </li>
            <li> I will order  more soon</li>
            <li> I love this lotion</li>
            <li> and I use the oil with it just to give me more protection.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will order, again , I love that I can get 2 at a time ,</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I liked this body lotion because it&#x27;s light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love the two fers</li>
            <li> Love it for night cream before going to bed.</li>
            <li> A must have after a refreshing shower with Neutrogena&#x27;s Shower Gel</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent of this lotion &amp;</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of the greasy feeling most lotions leave on your hands</li>
            <li> and I have been doing it for years :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would moisturize more.</li>
            <li> I do love Netrogena hand cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion on and off for years and still love</li>
            <li> This is pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is very light.</li>
            <li> The scent in this lotion is light but lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the light scent</li>
            <li> It is lighter than most lotions, but still leaves my skin silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the light sesame fragrance, and my skin is noticeably softer after applying it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for a good deal of these products</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have quite as strong a scent as the body oil, but it is there in the background.  </li>
            <li> The smell was so strong I couldn&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant sesame scent, not too overpowering like perfume, but just enough to be refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Light and smooth, protects your skin without any greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs well, and helps keep my hands and skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li> and it is said to be a light lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin feeling so silky smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li> I used the light sesame oil as well.  </li>
            <li> Light and creamy.</li>
            <li> how smooth it makes my skin</li>
            <li> Both the lotion and the scent are light</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs well -</li>
            <li> The scent is a nice light sesame frangrance, and the consistency is very silky.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t leave your hands oily very long and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I like but not that great for dry  hands.</li>
            <li> The smell is super light and fresh, and the moisturizer is also light (so you don&#x27;t feel all greasy).</li>
            <li> It is a great combo to feel fresh all day long</li>
            <li> And it has a fresh and light smell.</li>
            <li> It smells light and fresh.</li>
            <li> His skin has never been in such good shape.</li>
            <li> I like how this lotion is light and non-greasy, leaving my skin with just the right amount of moisture after a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> quick delivery</li>
            <li> I really love the soft  clean scent of this lotion.</li>
            <li> they give this lotion at Hampton Inns (and I used to stock up on the little bottles every time I stayed there lol).</li>
            <li> and I really like the light lotion feel.  </li>
            <li> My hands looked really moisturized from this light lotion.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is a light moisturize that is not greasy and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> fresh from the box.</li>
            <li> This formula is lightweight, fast absorbing and non greasy which I love.</li>
            <li> The only reason I went four stars is because it didn&#x27;t heal my hands on its own.</li>
            <li> , it is the only kind I will use.</li>
            <li> The consistency, absorption, the feeling left in the skin afterwards, even though not as good as my old product, are worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than all the other main brands (top brands) and stores in the mall.</li>
            <li> and I think it was good just a little pricey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small size (larger than travel size) is perfect to carry in my gym bag or luggage without being too bulky.  </li>
            <li> I first found this in a hotel-</li>
            <li> light going on skin not heavy like some products</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Neutrogena Body Lotion.</li>
            <li> I actually wish that it smelled a bit more like the body oil</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft And smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and soft....</li>
            <li> I have purchased and re-purchased many Neutrogena products for daily use</li>
            <li> I recently tried the neutrogena body washes and I love them</li>
            <li> I found it at someone&#x27;s home years ago and wrote it down as I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> The light, almost lemony, scent is refreshing and fades quickly so as not to interfere with cologne.  </li>
            <li> Great for everyday use, on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> Had to return it back, Amazon was good in taking it back.</li>
            <li> Have loved this lotion for years, so hope they keep making this lovely, for the price in a pump, you just can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Not sure why some said it didn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li> Light with a light subtle clean smell.</li>
            <li> so I would only put on lotion if I really had to... until I discovered Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame formula</li>
            <li> I really like it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time sniffing lotions as for the most part</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted there are going to be people who &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t Stand It&amp;#34; but there are a whole lot of people who will dislike something.  </li>
            <li> I wold recommend this to absolutely everyone because trust me,</li>
            <li> I buy it every summer because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I showed it today to 4 different people who have different tastes and no one liked it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it as it said it has the same Light Sesame Formula as the Body Oil which I was mainly placing the order for.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, but not thick.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light, but keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on, I was getting that same feeling other lotions give, but then noticed the scent and while enjoying it, realized the lotion had just absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is mainly intended to be applied after a shower or bath while the skin is still damp.  </li>
            <li> It was a good price too -  not a strong fragrance but enough.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain how amazing this stuff is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick or sticky.  </li>
            <li> A real deal to get two for under ten dollars, plus not having to look for it in stores is the real bonus!</li>
            <li> I used to use Lubriderm with oatmeal, because I have really dry skin, but am so happy I found this and that is works without being so thick.</li>
            <li> It is light enough for daily wear on your hands without feeling like you rubbed on petroleum jelly like some hand lotions.</li>
            <li> I actually used this lotion and mixed with the Neutrogena light sesame oil for a couple of weeks to heal.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so I cannot wear normal stick deodorant (plus</li>
            <li> There is nothing I can complain about as far as how they were shipped, the condition of the shipment or the product.</li>
            <li> have to give it for amazon for the fast returning procedures and overall services with me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, even with the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the US for only a few weeks, and I searched high and low for my favorite lotion, a Neutrogena extra light for dry skin, until resigning and admitting it&#x27;s not sold here.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I apply the Neutrogena sesame oil onto my wet skin.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft and calming and the lotion is rich without being too oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have asthma, but some of these things people wear because they think they smell good can seriously cause some other people to nearly die because they cannot breathe...</li>
            <li> Also has only a soft scent for those that or sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> however they are made for something with more body than oil and the oil just more or less runs through the roller ball type and the other applicators are basically and open platform that the lotion would stick to well enough and long enough for me to get it from the applicator to my back and then be pushed around over the skin on my back after a shower.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thinner than I like, but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because you do have to re-apply a couple times per day to not feel dry where as the oil lasts all day (but is greasy for the first 30 minutes or so...)</li>
            <li> But it can be used as a general lotion</li>
            <li> this is a light weight hard working body lotion - this is the only lotion i use - not overpowering scent</li>
            <li> and I like it better than the really big single bottle which is often hard to get the last 1/4 out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but it is getting harder to find it at your normal outlet stores.  </li>
            <li> This was the exact product she was missing.</li>
            <li> They were very fast, and I had no more problems.</li>
            <li> I think they stopped using quite so much in their products now as I&#x27;ve not been prevented from getting near the aisle lately.  </li>
            <li> But one person&#x27;s heavenly scent is the next&#x27;s headache to near death due to inability to breathe.  </li>
            <li> For my INSANELY sensitive skin, lotions usually make me break out, even the ones for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bag was snug enough around the bottles to keep them from banging around and vibrations to loosen the caps during long miles in the back of a truck.  </li>
            <li> It is not thick and does not leave skin feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> They were packaged tightly in a heat sealed plastic bag marked packaged for shipment.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been using it in conjunction with the body oil, yet it&#x27;s still not moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to get someone else go get my unscented white TP out of the TP aisle in the store because I couldn&#x27;t get within 2 rows of the stuff due to the overuse of scent by charmin.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, it does not work to alleviate dry or itchy skin, and it does not hydrate for very long.  </li>
            <li> I have used it through the winter months to help with my ridiculously dry hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had hoped to layer Neutrogena Body Lotion over Neutrogena Body Oil on towel-dryed skin on areas that remain dry and ichy after bathing...</li>
            <li> My husbands skin is so dry.</li>
            <li> put it on before bed last night and at first was already overwhelmed by the smell; it&#x27;s waaaay too strong and awful.</li>
            <li> and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores now, and although I&#x27;m not much of a lotion person, I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> as in not get a lung full of air not an exaggerated statement for effect, but serious medical issue.  </li>
            <li> A small bottle of this lotion was among the toiletry amenities in a hotel i stay in recently.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not pretty</li>
            <li> So do NOT think it&#x27;s like a sour dish rag or anything remotely like that!  </li>
            <li> I did say SLIGHT.</li>
            <li> Any lotion has that slight sourness to it from my experience with them.  </li>
            <li> so I put a little bit of baking soda in my hand and</li>
            <li> Smell takes a little getting used to - didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that this lotion isn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, sticky or greasy</li>
            <li> However it is NOT a strong odor even in the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for nearly every perfume that are very expensive and a lot of people lay out a lot of money for them.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> This is impossible to find other than online.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this lotion in stores but was unable to find.</li>
            <li> The cold and the washing cracks my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought it in bulk as I was afraid they may discontinue it.</li>
            <li> but the smell is something i can&#x27;t get use to :(  </li>
            <li> I felt stupid asking where they got it and looked around at stores.</li>
            <li> Both the lotion and the oil have a sesame oil base.  </li>
            <li> I hate putting lotion on, it is sticky and terrible for me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> fresh from the box. my mom loves it. We will buy some more when this one is over. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but it is getting harder to find it at your normal outlet stores.  Thankfully Amazon.com has it in stock and at a good price.  Light and smooth, protects your skin without any greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve found.  Light with a great smell and not at all greasy!</li>
            <li> love this lotion. i put it on after i use the neutrogena sesame oil in the shower.</li>
            <li> light, absorbs quickly, nice sent</li>
            <li> I like how this lotion is light and non-greasy, leaving my skin with just the right amount of moisture after a bath or shower.  It has a pleasant sesame scent, not too overpowering like perfume, but just enough to be refreshing.  It&#x27;s small size (larger than travel size) is perfect to carry in my gym bag or luggage without being too bulky.  I first experienced this lotion as a free travel size from a hotel, and loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> This formula is lightweight, fast absorbing and non greasy which I love. The scent is not overpowering. It does not moisturize as well as thicker creams but it gets the job done.I have recommended it to several friends which is definitely how I mark the quality of a product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so light and pleasant to use! And it has a fresh and light smell. I use it as an eye makeup remover, which simultaneously moisturizes the eye area. It is light enough for daily wear on your hands without feeling like you rubbed on petroleum jelly like some hand lotions. Use those for night formulas.</li>
            <li> Not soo effective and smell is good but powerful.  Had to return it back, Amazon was good in taking it back.</li>
            <li> Sure, this lotion is smooth, smells great, and absorbs fully.  I use it in the summer and in the mornings when I can&#x27;t wait for a more substantial lotion or cream to penetrate.  Having said that, it does not work to alleviate dry or itchy skin, and it does not hydrate for very long.  I have very dry skin and have been using it in conjunction with the body oil, yet it&#x27;s still not moisturizing enough.  It is nice when I need something light, though, so I will keep it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Not sticky.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Shipped perfectly sealed and safe - love it on my skin too</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Light with a light subtle clean smell. Perfect lotion!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! I use it every day when I get out of the shower. The smell is super light and fresh, and the moisturizer is also light (so you don&#x27;t feel all greasy). I first found this in a hotel- they give this lotion at Hampton Inns (and I used to stock up on the little bottles every time I stayed there lol). Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product great price!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite lotion</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells great and goes on clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the Neutrogena body oil and was thrilled to find this.  The oil has a nicer smell, but this one is non-descript and I really like the light lotion feel.  Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This formula is about the only lotion that I will use.  It is light, absorbs well, and helps keep my hands and skin from drying out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I can&#x27;t stand anything that feels like I want to wipe it off after using it.</li>
            <li> This has a great scent and a light feel.  It does an excellent job as a body moisturizer.  It comes in 2 and I like it better than the really big single bottle which is often hard to get the last 1/4 out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> The scent in this lotion is light but lovely. Makes me feel good.  Great lotion and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have used it through the winter months to help with my ridiculously dry hands. The cold and the washing cracks my skin.  I actually used this lotion and mixed with the Neutrogena light sesame oil for a couple of weeks to heal.  Once healed, the lotion alone has prevented any more cracking. It smells light and fresh. The only reason I went four stars is because it didn&#x27;t heal my hands on its own.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The scent is a nice light sesame frangrance, and the consistency is very silky. It is very moisturizing, but not thick. Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  It was a good price too -  not a strong fragrance but enough.  It is a good body lotion that my husband and I both use.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great price for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Best moisturising lotion I have ever used. It is very good on my skin and I will recommend it to anyone who wants a flawless skin</li>
            <li> what can I say it may not make his crab claws perfect but it sure does help.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> not as moisturizing as the Curel that we use religiously, but it smells so yummy.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to find this scent of lotion. I have looked all over and now I found it. I&#x27;m very happy with it and love the smell.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this lotion in stores but was unable to find. Love the silky feeling it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> moisturizes well without being greasy</li>
            <li> This is impossible to find other than online. Check every local store you can think of - no one carries it. I have no idea why as it&#x27;s the best lotion I have ever found. I bought it in bulk as I was afraid they may discontinue it. It&#x27;s better than all the other main brands (top brands) and stores in the mall. It is hard to explain how amazing this stuff is. I has no smell. It soaks in fast. It won&#x27;t leave your hands oily very long and it feels great. I found it at someone&#x27;s home years ago and wrote it down as I loved it so much. I felt stupid asking where they got it and looked around at stores. I finally checked Amazon and this is the only place I could find it. It is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> love this nice light refreshing fragrance, love the body wash as well!  light going on skin not heavy like some products</li>
            <li> This is pretty good lotion. The smell is great -- light and clean. The consistency is a little thinner than I like, but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.  It is a very light fresh scent and feels good on your skin no greasy residue</li>
            <li> This lotion is lightweight and absorbs into skin fast without a sticky heavy residue. This is the only lotion that I use.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this lotion. She used to get it at WalMart; however, being in rural central Illinois...they haven&#x27;t been keeping it in stock. This was the exact product she was missing. I&#x27;m so glad we found it!</li>
            <li> The absolute best body  lotion.  It&#x27;s not thick or sticky.  Use it after every shower!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and Amazon is the place to buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion.  It feels so light on your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the smell is very pleasant.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in any store so I went to Amazon.com and was able to find it with no problem.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite products.  quick delivery</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. It goes on smooth and is very light. Also has only a soft scent for those that or sensitive to perfumes. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t carry it in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Neutrogena Body Lotion. I ordered it as it said it has the same Light Sesame Formula as the Body Oil which I was mainly placing the order for. But this product may help solve an issue I have with trying to get the body oil on my back.  I have tried using lotion applicators to put the oil on my back however they are made for something with more body than oil and the oil just more or less runs through the roller ball type and the other applicators are basically and open platform that the lotion would stick to well enough and long enough for me to get it from the applicator to my back and then be pushed around over the skin on my back after a shower.  This product is mainly intended to be applied after a shower or bath while the skin is still damp.  But it can be used as a general lotion also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It said that there is some of the Body oil in this lotion as a part of its ingredient list. It doesn&#x27;t have quite as strong a scent as the body oil, but it is there in the background.  There is also a hint of sourness to the scent of this product in the bottle, but I do not notice it once on my skin.  However it is NOT a strong odor even in the bottle. So do NOT think it&#x27;s like a sour dish rag or anything remotely like that!  I did say SLIGHT. Any lotion has that slight sourness to it from my experience with them.  Not that I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time sniffing lotions as for the most part I don&#x27;t like most scents in products.  I ordered this one because the body oils is one that I actually DO like.  I actually wish that it smelled a bit more like the body oil but it&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted there are going to be people who &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t Stand It&amp;#34; but there are a whole lot of people who will dislike something.  I don&#x27;t much care for a good deal of these products and I don&#x27;t care for nearly every perfume that are very expensive and a lot of people lay out a lot of money for them.  However when they wear them and come around me,  they make my bronchials close up and I have to get away from them so I can breathe.  Seriously. I don&#x27;t even have asthma, but some of these things people wear because they think they smell good can seriously cause some other people to nearly die because they cannot breathe...as in not get a lung full of air not an exaggerated statement for effect, but serious medical issue.  Then there are those who are given headaches by the smells of many products.  I used to have to get someone else go get my unscented white TP out of the TP aisle in the store because I couldn&#x27;t get within 2 rows of the stuff due to the overuse of scent by charmin.  I think they stopped using quite so much in their products now as I&#x27;ve not been prevented from getting near the aisle lately.  But one person&#x27;s heavenly scent is the next&#x27;s headache to near death due to inability to breathe.  Subjective and that&#x27;s not the purpose of these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered in a timely manner as advertised in 2 bottles each 8.5 oz.  They were packaged tightly in a heat sealed plastic bag marked packaged for shipment.  The bag was snug enough around the bottles to keep them from banging around and vibrations to loosen the caps during long miles in the back of a truck.  However, I&#x27;m trying out Amazon Prime and got my delivery in 2 days.  There are no leaks, this and the package of 2 bottles of the Neutrogena Body oil 16 oz each were all that was in the shipment, both arrived intact no leaks as advertised. There is nothing I can complain about as far as how they were shipped, the condition of the shipment or the product.</li>
            <li> For my INSANELY sensitive skin, lotions usually make me break out, even the ones for sensitive skin. This one though, absolutely love!!! Not too heavy, sticky or greasy so i don&#x27;t break out yet it keeps my skin perfectly moisturized. I wold recommend this to absolutely everyone because trust me, if i can use it (my family uses me as the standard on what to use on their kids and even their babies), anyone can!</li>
            <li> I really love the soft  clean scent of this lotion. It leaves your skin feeling soft And smooth. I will order  more soon</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this lotion.  I like that it has the same sesame fragrance as the oil.  I put it on right after I apply the Neutrogena sesame oil onto my wet skin.  The scent is light and soft....you can apply perfume or body sprays and it won&#x27;t clash.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that this lotion isn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I use the oil with it just to give me more protection.  Not sure why some said it didn&#x27;t smell good I love the light scent and I think it was good just a little pricey</li>
            <li> It came in perfect condition and it works exactly as promoted. Great for everyday use, on sensitive skin as well. It is not thick and does not leave skin feeling heavy. Light and wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will order, again , I love that I can get 2 at a time ,</li>
            <li> Learned about this Neutrogrena lotion during one of my hotel stays.  Picked up the hotel bottle and loved it.  Searched for it at the local stores and when I ran out, I checked Amazon.  Two for the price of one based on what they charge at the local stores.  Great deal!  This lotion is light, but keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  I used to use Lubriderm with oatmeal, because I have really dry skin, but am so happy I found this and that is works without being so thick.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and light lotion.</li>
            <li> A small bottle of this lotion was among the toiletry amenities in a hotel i stay in recently. I loved the fragrance and the light non- greasy feel of the Sesame lotion. I have been searching... Buying... Trying.. All sorts if lotions for something that did not leave me feeling as if is I had bathed in grease!&lt;br /&gt;This is the one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the US for only a few weeks, and I searched high and low for my favorite lotion, a Neutrogena extra light for dry skin, until resigning and admitting it&#x27;s not sold here. I decided instead to buy this one, since there were many good reviews and it is said to be a light lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the product itself is good. The consistency, absorption, the feeling left in the skin afterwards, even though not as good as my old product, are worth the money. This is the only reason I could put 2 stars here.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on before bed last night and at first was already overwhelmed by the smell; it&#x27;s waaaay too strong and awful. It&#x27;s like stronger-smelling sunscreen. I decided to give it a try, though; maybe it would fade with time.&lt;br /&gt;It was 4a.m. when I decided I had to return this. The smell was so strong I couldn&#x27;t sleep. I had a headache. I showed it today to 4 different people who have different tastes and no one liked it. One actually had an allergy crisis just by smelling it from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have to give it for amazon for the fast returning procedures and overall services with me. They were very fast, and I had no more problems. I guess a migraine and no sleep were already enough.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and re-purchased many Neutrogena products for daily use (Deep Moisture Body Wash, Neutrogena Body Oil, Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night, Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Eye Cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had hoped to layer Neutrogena Body Lotion over Neutrogena Body Oil on towel-dryed skin on areas that remain dry and ichy after bathing...my legs and arms.  Both the lotion and the oil have a sesame oil base.  I assumed they&#x27;d be compatible.  However, the lotion pills when used this way, and the pills can&#x27;t be blended in.  They have to be dry-wiped or showered off.  Yuck.  Won&#x27;t purchase again for this use.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the neutrogena body washes and I love them so I thought I would give this lotion a try.  This leaves your skin feeling so silky smooth and glowing.  My hands looked really moisturized from this light lotion.  Basically this stuff does what it says and its a great companion to the bath/shower gels.  Love it.  Four stars because I wish the bottle was larger for the money.</li>
            <li> i like the lotion it works okay but the smell is something i can&#x27;t get use to :(  it&#x27;s not pretty</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product in the warmer weather. It is lighter than most lotions, but still leaves my skin silky and smooth. I buy it every summer because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I liked this body lotion because it&#x27;s light and non-greasy.  It also has a very pleasant barely-there scent.  I used the light sesame oil as well.  I only gave this product 4 stars because you do have to re-apply a couple times per day to not feel dry where as the oil lasts all day (but is greasy for the first 30 minutes or so...)</li>
            <li> Great deal! Love the two fers</li>
            <li> Perfect for the face.</li>
            <li> Love it for night cream before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a light moisturize that is not greasy and dries fast.  The light, almost lemony, scent is refreshing and fades quickly so as not to interfere with cologne.  A must have after a refreshing shower with Neutrogena&#x27;s Shower Gel</li>
            <li> I like but not that great for dry  hands.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is the same as Rainbath. That&#x27;s why I buy it. Light and creamy. Your skin never felt so,good</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent of this lotion &amp; how smooth it makes my skin but it does nothing for ashy skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of the greasy feeling most lotions leave on your hands so I would only put on lotion if I really had to... until I discovered Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame formula and now I am in love! This lotion feels really nice on and smells very nice. Both the lotion and the scent are light but it is still so moisturizing! I actually also use this lotion for my deodorant. My skin is sensitive so I cannot wear normal stick deodorant (plus the aluminum in most deodorants is so unhealthy for you!) so I put a little bit of baking soda in my hand and then a pump of this lotion and apply to my both armpits. It is a great combo to feel fresh all day long and I have been doing it for years :)</li>
            <li> Love the light sesame fragrance, and my skin is noticeably softer after applying it.</li>
            <li> Like this formula. Smell takes a little getting used to - didn&#x27;t bother me. Wanted something for my niight table to remind me to use it at bedtime. This does the trick!</li>
            <li> this is a light weight hard working body lotion - this is the only lotion i use - not overpowering scent</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy. I still prefer the oil to the lotion though.</li>
            <li> Have loved this lotion for years, so hope they keep making this lovely, for the price in a pump, you just can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> This has to be the best smelling lotion - ever!  Very light and airy both in scent and consistency.  I was looking for something that would moisturize more.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores now, and although I&#x27;m not much of a lotion person, I like this product very much. A real deal to get two for under ten dollars, plus not having to look for it in stores is the real bonus!</li>
            <li> Wonderful body lotion! Have used for years, but cannot find in stores</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful!  It is light and absorbs well - I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hate putting lotion on, it is sticky and terrible for me. I do love Netrogena hand cream, it is the only kind I will use. So thought I would try the body lotion. I was skeptical, even with the good reviews. When I put it on, I was getting that same feeling other lotions give, but then noticed the scent and while enjoying it, realized the lotion had just absorbed into my skin. Then felt my skin and was very impressed with the silky feel. My husbands skin is so dry. He is confined to bed from a stroke. When I wash him up, I use a manly cream for him. I decided to try the Neutrogena. While I was impressed with his skins reaction to it, he was saying how good it smelled. His skin has never been in such good shape. We both love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion on and off for years and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft and calming and the lotion is rich without being too oily or heavy.</li>
