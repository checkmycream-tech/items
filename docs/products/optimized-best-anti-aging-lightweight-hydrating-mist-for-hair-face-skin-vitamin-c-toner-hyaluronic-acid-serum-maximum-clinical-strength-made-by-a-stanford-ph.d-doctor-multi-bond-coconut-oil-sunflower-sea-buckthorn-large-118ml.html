            <li>/&gt;Thank you Optimized for making an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am loving this Optimized H2O spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The squirt nozzle is nice for getting product dispensed evenly.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is suitable for every women.</li>
            <li>By far the best product I have ever used for my hair.    </li>
            <li>Label is easy to read!  </li>
            <li>It will also help diminish fine lines and wrinkles which is amazing.</li>
            <li>After about 3-4 days of this I have noticed a huge difference in her hair!  </li>
            <li>I  LOVE  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product for skin and hair!</li>
            <li>I have tried it and absolutely love it as well.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the Evian spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like water but better.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I heard this product is to protect your scalp and skin, but also I could maintain better volume of my hair with this mist with just 2~3 spray after my hair wax.</li>
            <li>However, as I used more of it, the product no longer has any effect on my hair</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend and I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing.</li>
            <li>Excellent facial and body mist.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling healthy and looking radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that it is made with all nature ingredients</li>
            <li>I love the satisfied products</li>
            <li>also love using this product to reactivate my styling aids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is more shiny.</li>
            <li>Not only its quality as a mist, I like the scent of this, very pleasant one.</li>
            <li>This product was complimentary in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled that I had found the right product for my hair.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a light mist, there is also no issue with it causing my makeup to cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have used this spray on freshly sunburnt skin and it has kept my skin hydrated and healthy since using it.  </li>
            <li>first used this after she got out of the tub, sprayed her roots then lightly sprayed her hair!  </li>
            <li>I used this product again and was able to comb thru her hair much easier!  </li>
            <li>And this mister bottle is a unique sprayer that micronizes the water nutrient for maximum absorbsion into the skin.</li>
            <li>Just a few sprays in the morning when I brush my hair and its left looking good, and better yet, feeling great.  </li>
            <li>After blow drying, my hair feels sleek and smooth, yet not greasy like I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in the fridge for a clean cool mist.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in the fridge for a clean cool mist.</li>
            <li>The label is nice and the bottle is clear.</li>
            <li>It absorbs super quick into hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to purchase more!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li>and I really love it so far.</li>
            <li>I even spray on my face sometimes when I&#x27;m  outside for some natural UV protection and as a nice refresher :)...  </li>
            <li>So good!!!!!get it  right now~</li>
            <li>I used it as indicated on my dry and color-treated hair, and on my first use my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>my mother was in hospital and not drinking very much</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s), but after using this my hair has started growing again and the fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li>.. look at how most have similar grammatical errors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Especially after I work out, its so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am definitely getting more.</li>
            <li>love it especially for the summer.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I had given this product a 5-star review when I first tried it</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves.</li>
            <li>Really like this product and have been using on my face even though it&#x27;s for your head.  </li>
            <li>So far I am having success with my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>This is priced much cheaper than some products that have done absolutely nothing for her hair besides cause buildup!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can spritz this product throughout my hair and smooth everything back out.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t cause any product build-up unlike most other products on the market.</li>
            <li>I like it alot hair feela soft and face feels super soft</li>
            <li>Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and it helps reduce the frizziness in my hair from this high humidity.</li>
            <li>So many people use just plain water which drys out the skin.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural solution for styling and revitalizing their hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance, it&#x27;s clear in color!  </li>
            <li>This product was received at low cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>So I recommend it to someone who are sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and soft and my face refreshed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and tends to frizz no matter what.</li>
            <li>It is also free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I normally use products in my hair to prevent heat damage from my blow dryer and flat iron</li>
            <li>I found that spraying this on the ends of my hair before I flat iron my hair, keeps it smoother and straighter longer, and also acts as a heat protectant when the iron is placed directly ontop of my hair after it&#x27;s been sprayed onto it.</li>
            <li>You can spray it on your skin to plump and tighten while helping to reduce large pores, dark spots and signs of aging.</li>

            <li> I tried this Optimized H20 and at first was pretty skeptical about it&#x27;s claims because it is water!</li>
            <li> She has those natural curls and no matter what I put on them by a few hours</li>
            <li> You have just made a life long</li>
            <li> product provides a wide variety of nutrients that are essential to both skin and hair, including Biotin.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient, multi-purpose solution to dry skin, dry hair, and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as frizzy, it has quite a bit of shine and even though she didn&#x27;t suffer from dry scalp I can tell a difference in her scalp that it&#x27;s healthier!  </li>
            <li> it provides instant moisture and helps fight dry, limp, frizzy and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my face after washing, after applying makeup, or even when my makeup just needs a little freshen up in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> is just what i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always dealt with an itchy scalp and untameable hair as long as I can remember, and Optimized H20 remedies both without the incessant use of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> However, this product has brought life back into my dull hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li> In the morning her hair was slightly manageable.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using it everyday, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> So, not sure if I will like it or not.</li>
            <li> Fake people are rating this and they&#x27;re mostly Asian</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it does.</li>
            <li> but they always leave my hair feeling oily and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I have bought very expensive hair products in the past that promised to eliminate frizziness and they never did.</li>
            <li> almost all the reviews are obviously fake</li>

            <li> I just got this and I have been using it everyday, twice a day. I use it in the morning after my shower and I use it before bed. I use it on my face and scalp. It is very refreshing. It feels very nice.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to note almost all the reviews are obviously fake.. look at how most have similar grammatical errors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times now, and I love it. Especially after I work out, its so refreshing. I&#x27;ve also had problems with my hair falling out and premature wrinkles. (I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s), but after using this my hair has started growing again and the fine lines are fading. It&#x27;s definitely a product I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother to use on her hair and skin. She absolutely loves. I have tried it and absolutely love it as well. I am definitely getting more. Try it and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and have been using on my face even though it&#x27;s for your head.  Oops!  I think it&#x27;s better than the Evian spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! You can use it on your body , your face , and your hair.&lt;br /&gt;When my mother was in hospital and not drinking very much i used it on her skin to help hydrate her.&lt;br /&gt;A nice lil product to keep in your purse!</li>

            <li> So good!!!!!get it  right now~</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughters insanely unruly curly hair!  She has those natural curls and no matter what I put on them by a few hours her hair looks as if it was never taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;I first used this after she got out of the tub, sprayed her roots then lightly sprayed her hair!  In the morning her hair was slightly manageable.  So in the morning we do our morning routine, by wetting and combing thru her hair.  I used this product again and was able to comb thru her hair much easier!  After about 3-4 days of this I have noticed a huge difference in her hair!  It&#x27;s not as frizzy, it has quite a bit of shine and even though she didn&#x27;t suffer from dry scalp I can tell a difference in her scalp that it&#x27;s healthier!  I am very impressed with this product!  So far I am having success with my daughters hair.  This is priced much cheaper than some products that have done absolutely nothing for her hair besides cause buildup!&lt;br /&gt;This product does not cause any buildup what so ever!  It&#x27;s just like water but better.  Water with steroids is what we will call it.  There is no fragrance, it&#x27;s clear in color!  The bottle is just like any spray bottle and functions just like one!  Label is easy to read!  Packaged very well!&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to write an honest unbiased review!</li>
            <li> Fake people are rating this and they&#x27;re mostly Asian</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference in both my skin and hair.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and this product has improved the dryness and texture of my aging skin on my face, legs and arms.  Definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> Not only its quality as a mist, I like the scent of this, very pleasant one. :) I heard this product is to protect your scalp and skin, but also I could maintain better volume of my hair with this mist with just 2~3 spray after my hair wax. thanks!</li>
            <li> I had given this product a 5-star review when I first tried it but I&#x27;m changing my review to three stars because it seems as it no longer has any effect on my hair. I used it as indicated on my dry and color-treated hair, and on my first use my hair looked amazing. I was so thrilled that I had found the right product for my hair. However, as I used more of it, the product no longer has any effect on my hair and I haven&#x27;t even finished the bottle. I will continue using it until the bottle is all gone and will consider changing my review.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Although the smell reminds me of working in a tanning salon, I don&#x27;t mind it.  It&#x27;s not a very strong scent.  I&#x27;ve used it on my skin and my hair.  It&#x27;s very refreshing on my face and neck.  Would recommend and I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love it! It feels so good on my face. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so I use this product to moisten and style. My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I can see and feel a smoother texture in my hair and skin ! There is no oily feel ,only extra bounce and body whenever you need it. Just spritz and go. Use it both under makeup and over for setting .</li>
            <li> Excellent facial and body mist.  So many people use just plain water which drys out the skin.  This stuff actually helps to moisture and vitalize the skin keeping ageing effects to a minimum.  And this mister bottle is a unique sprayer that micronizes the water nutrient for maximum absorbsion into the skin.</li>
            <li> I am loving this Optimized H2O spray.&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair every 6 weeks and use my blow dryer and flat iron almost daily. I have noticed my hair hasn&#x27;t been looking the healthiest since I started back coloring it. I normally use products in my hair to prevent heat damage from my blow dryer and flat iron but they always leave my hair feeling oily and unhealthy. I decided to give this a try and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has so many great uses. You can spray it on your skin to plump and tighten while helping to reduce large pores, dark spots and signs of aging. It will also help diminish fine lines and wrinkles which is amazing. It leaves your skin feeling healthy and looking radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spray it in your hair it provides instant moisture and helps fight dry, limp, frizzy and thinning hair. I live in Florida and it helps reduce the frizziness in my hair from this high humidity. I have bought very expensive hair products in the past that promised to eliminate frizziness and they never did. And it doesn&#x27;t cause any product build-up unlike most other products on the market. But this product actually works which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is made with all nature ingredients and they do not test it on animals which is a plus in my book. My best friend is a hair stylist at a top end salon and she swears by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Optimized for making an amazing product. You have just made a life long customer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This product was received at low cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.

            <li> I&#x27;m In LOVE with this product! I use it every morning on my face and hair. Great for after my workouts to detox my skin and hydrate my hair. I keep mine in the fridge for a clean cool mist.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this on the face!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I love this spray (and my husband does too!)... I am on my second bottle already.  It leaves my hair shiny and soft and my face refreshed.  I like that it does not oil my hair up.  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle for the price...</li>
            <li> I love the satisfied products</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with this product! It has worked wonders for both my skin and my hair. I am plagued with a dry, itchy scalp. My hair is naturally wavy and tends to frizz no matter what. This product, however, is wonderful. After washing my hair, I spray it close to my scalp and then all over, using my fingers to spread the product through my hair. After blow drying, my hair feels sleek and smooth, yet not greasy like I&#x27;ve experienced with other products. It also helps to provide moisture to my scalp and keep the itching at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love using this product to reactivate my styling aids. In the middle of a humid day, my hair will often start to frizz. I can spritz this product throughout my hair and smooth everything back out. It doesn&#x27;t add weight to my hair or give a sticky feel. It just dries beautifully and makes my hair look just-styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using this product for my hair, I&#x27;ve also been using it as a facial mist. It&#x27;s refreshing! I spray it on my face after washing, after applying makeup, or even when my makeup just needs a little freshen up in the middle of the day. It give a youthful, dewy glow. Because it&#x27;s a light mist, there is also no issue with it causing my makeup to cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product provides a wide variety of nutrients that are essential to both skin and hair, including Biotin. It is also free of harsh chemicals. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient, multi-purpose solution to dry skin, dry hair, and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;m not sure what it does. it doesn&#x27;t take out tangles but I guess it&#x27;s supposed to put vitamins into my hair. still trying it and hope to see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to purchase more! Trying to grow hair out and I really love it so far.</li>
            <li> very good for use instead any hair spray</li>
            <li> I tried this Optimized H20 and at first was pretty skeptical about it&#x27;s claims because it is water! However, this product has brought life back into my dull hair and I have used this spray on freshly sunburnt skin and it has kept my skin hydrated and healthy since using it.  I like the style of the bottle. The label is nice and the bottle is clear. The squirt nozzle is nice for getting product dispensed evenly.  It absorbs super quick into hair and skin.  I found that spraying this on the ends of my hair before I flat iron my hair, keeps it smoother and straighter longer, and also acts as a heat protectant when the iron is placed directly ontop of my hair after it&#x27;s been sprayed onto it. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is more shiny. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this in the future.  *FTC DISCLAIMER: This product was complimentary in exchange for my honest review.*</li>
            <li> Feels great &amp; refreshing after surfing!!</li>
            <li> It make my face such as baby skin.</li>
            <li> By far the best product I have ever used for my hair.    I&#x27;ve always dealt with an itchy scalp and untameable hair as long as I can remember, and Optimized H20 remedies both without the incessant use of harsh chemicals.  Just a few sprays in the morning when I brush my hair and its left looking good, and better yet, feeling great.  I even spray on my face sometimes when I&#x27;m  outside for some natural UV protection and as a nice refresher :)...  Leaves my skin feeling great.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a natural solution for styling and revitalizing their hair and scalp.</li>
