            <li>I&#x27;ve checked the bottle and box side-by-side with the perfume my mom originally purchased at the department store.</li>

            <li>It stays with you and just makes you feel special.</li>

            <li>I have loved Red since it first hit the shelves!</li>
            <li>I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased at a retail store, was very strong and old smelling.</li>
            <li>Really nice and such a bargain.</li>
            <li>It gets my mojo running early in the evening and at top speed at the end.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it smells fresh.</li>
            <li>This gift set had a generous size bottle of perfume, so I&#x27;m sure it will last my mother a good long time.  </li>
            <li>I received this perfume right away</li>
            <li>I found this and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Your price is right.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be buying the exact set again very soon!</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift and the fragrance is outstanding and lasting.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>RED is a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>its not a heavy scent, light and fragrant but not over whelming.</li>
            <li>It seems that there are many fans of Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills besides my wife.  </li>
            <li>Red was my favorite scent</li>
            <li>I have missed this perfume and I&#x27;m glad it is back.  </li>
            <li>my mom uses it all the time, its her favorite spray and especially lotion.</li>
            <li>although I loved the original fragrance which did subtly linger for hours, the product I received does not.</li>
            <li>I can buy the imitation at Walmart for $8.00, and have better luck than this!</li>
            <li>I bought this for an early Christmas gift for my mom and she loves it!!!!</li>
            <li>Have used RED for years; Love the scent; doesn&#x27;t have the chemical scent like most other fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It is a classic fragrant that still turn heads!</li>
            <li>My father doesn&#x27;t have a computer, so every year when he wants to get a perfume set for my mother</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The price on this is so much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills has been her favorite perfume since the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is becoming harder to find therefore</li>
            <li>the delviery was a little long but as far as the product it great</li>
            <li>Not only is this wonderful perfume half the price it usually is at department stores, it comes with the 6.7oz body lotion too!</li>
            <li>Oh, and this is definitely the real deal, ladies!</li>
            <li>I payed 3 times this much for Red in a department store and it didn&#x27;t have the bonus cream like this one.</li>
            <li>this was old.  </li>
            <li>I really like Red</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it in the department stores but at least I can still buy it on line.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and had sent directly to the recipient&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li>A strong perfume for those who are active and are out all day long.  </li>
            <li>A very nice, long lasting scent that is still subtle enough not to overwhelm.  </li>
            <li>I had this happen with other scents in the past, so knew that possibility existed, but loving this fragrance</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find this set any more, so</li>
            <li>Red is such a soft scent it is not overbearing.</li>

            <li> I had this happen with other scents in the past, so knew that possibility existed, but loving this fragrance</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find this set any more, so</li>
            <li> Red is such a soft scent it is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Red for a long time.  </li>
            <li> She, too, has worn Red, exclusively, for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li> Layer it under the perfume so that the perfume lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger on the skin for very long.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected no surprises prompt delivery would order again</li>
            <li> The 3.0oz EDT alone cost her almost $60 the last time she purchased it, which was quite a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I was not able to send  to my friend for Christmas because the cologne was starting to turn rancid,  I am using it as a room spray.</li>
            <li> Red can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> However, it has become increasingly HARD to find.</li>
            <li> Been using this for at least 8 to 10 years...</li>
            <li> Color is deep, scent is off - very &amp;#34;alcoholic&amp;#34; - Very disappointed that it&#x27;s so bad, and i have no option to return it.</li>
            <li> This is one perfume I will never get tired Waring it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has become increasingly hard to find in our area and is extremely expensive to boot.</li>
            <li> This is a scent that goes from  casual  to a night on the town.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed when it was taken off the market.  </li>
            <li> When I sprayed it, the smell was HORRIBLE!!!</li>

            <li> Just what I expected no surprises prompt delivery would order again</li>
            <li> Bought it for my moms he loveeees it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I started buying this item years ago in stores and now buy it on line.</li>
            <li> Great purchase and delivered on time</li>
            <li> I received this set just days within ordering it. Was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product and a very low price. This is a wonderful combination.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it...for her, not for me :-)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that low price of the package deal.  She was most appreciative.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. The price was right and it smells fresh. The one I purchased at a retail store, was very strong and old smelling. I&#x27;ve been wearing it since it arrived.Thank you.</li>
            <li> the delviery was a little long but as far as the product it great</li>
            <li> This smells terrific on my wife - good pheromones! &amp;lt;VBG&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is something she likes to wear - However, it has become increasingly HARD to find. Dillard&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, etc. have stopped carrying the Giorgio Red product - and SAMS CLUB doesn&#x27;t carry the lotion. Amazon has a good price a perfume set that was commonly available six years ago.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume right away and I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.  Excellent packing to protect item.  Thank you !!</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift to someone who has always loved Red and she was very pleased-- smelled like the original.</li>
            <li> The scent is just as I remember. It is lovely.</li>
            <li> Arrived several days before it was scheduled.  That actually made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Really nice and such a bargain. So much better than buying from a department store.</li>
            <li> I payed 3 times this much for Red in a department store and it didn&#x27;t have the bonus cream like this one. I will definitely buy here again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my standard for years!! Love Giorgio...</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCES. I&#x27;M REALLY GLAD  I FOUND A GOOD DEAL ON THIS PURCHASE. JUST WHAT I NEEDED AND LIKE.</li>
            <li> Since my 50th birthday I worn this fragrance. It always meets with many compliments and has &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; along with me. Still absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It is still the same wonderful product it has been for years....at an even better price.</li>
            <li> this was old.  Color is deep, scent is off - very &amp;#34;alcoholic&amp;#34; - Very disappointed that it&#x27;s so bad, and i have no option to return it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife&#x27;s birthday.  She loves this product.  I plan to purchase this for her in the future often.</li>
            <li> I get this for my mother she love it</li>
            <li> I cannot give it a rating because I purchased it for a gift.  Hope the receiver is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. glad I could still buy it.</li>
            <li> Red is one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever worn.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found it, not knowing it was discontinued, I had been checking everywhere for it.  My hubby always loves it when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is the only purfume I wear. I go through it quickly. This set was perfect for such a great price. I will be buying the exact set again very soon!</li>
            <li> A very nice, long lasting scent that is still subtle enough not to overwhelm.  Been buying &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; for several years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and the fragrance is outstanding and lasting.  I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> My father doesn&#x27;t have a computer, so every year when he wants to get a perfume set for my mother I do the searching and ordering for him and then have it sent to his house.  It works out great, because I always find a good deal on perfume sets and it&#x27;s so convenient to be able to ship directly to him so he can wrap the gift.  This gift set had a generous size bottle of perfume, so I&#x27;m sure it will last my mother a good long time.  It arrived at his home fairly quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> A strong perfume for those who are active and are out all day long.  This perfume will last and it has a pleasant fragrance where you get people asking about what perfume you are wearing.</li>
            <li> I really like Red and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is one the best fragrances for me during the winter months! It is a classic fragrant that still turn heads! I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Product came very timely and was in great shape.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an early Christmas gift for my mom and she loves it!!!! so happy!</li>
            <li> Great gift set!  Purchased multiple times.</li>
            <li> RED is a lovely scent. I used to be able to buy it in the department stores but at least I can still buy it on line. Thanks</li>
            <li> Its smell like channel perfumes and esti louder&lt;br /&gt;Very good price with very good perfume&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Been using this for at least 8 to 10 years... its not a heavy scent, light and fragrant but not over whelming.</li>
            <li> My wife had been out for awhile and was wanting some Red.  I found this and the price was right.  Just got it and am happy.</li>
            <li> was a gift and well received.</li>
            <li> great product-fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas. Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills has been her favorite perfume since the early 90&#x27;s. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly hard to find in our area and is extremely expensive to boot. The 3.0oz EDT alone cost her almost $60 the last time she purchased it, which was quite a few years ago. Thank goodness for Amazon! Not only is this wonderful perfume half the price it usually is at department stores, it comes with the 6.7oz body lotion too! The lotion is rich and creamy with the same great scent as the EDT. Layer it under the perfume so that the perfume lasts twice as long. Oh, and this is definitely the real deal, ladies! I&#x27;ve checked the bottle and box side-by-side with the perfume my mom originally purchased at the department store. It IS Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills and I really can&#x27;t wait to see my mom&#x27;s face light up when she unwraps her gift this Christmas! There&#x27;s only one Red and this is it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this fragrance...one of her favorites and the lotion is very light for the body which she loves</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service from Seller. Price is excellent, as well.</li>
            <li> I have loved Red since it first hit the shelves! It is becoming harder to find therefore I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and get the lotion and shower gel too. Red is such a soft scent it is not overbearing. The quality last all day. I always get compliments on &amp;#34;how good i smell&amp;#34; when I wear Red. To me... It&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not able to send  to my friend for Christmas because the cologne was starting to turn rancid,  I am using it as a room spray.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for an all time lover of this fragrance. She loves it as always.</li>
            <li> It seems that there are many fans of Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills besides my wife.  She, too, has worn Red, exclusively, for a very, very long time.  I&#x27;d say she&#x27;s passed the 20 year mark already.  We&#x27;re so happy that Amazon has choices at reasonable prices.  My wife just doesn&#x27;t trust the kiosks at the mall...  We just purchased another two boxes for her.  There once was a holiday set that included these plus body powder and body wash.  Would be nice to find one of those!</li>
            <li> Awesome... So glad they still make it.</li>
            <li> this is my  favorite. Have used it  for years. Your price is right.</li>
            <li> Red was my favorite scent so I was disappointed when it was taken off the market.  Was delighted to be able to make this after-market purchase until I used the product the first time.  The scent does not linger on the skin for very long.  I had this happen with other scents in the past, so knew that possibility existed, but loving this fragrance I took a chance on its still being good.  Chose the 2-star rating because, although I loved the original fragrance which did subtly linger for hours, the product I received does not.</li>
            <li> This is a scent that goes from  casual  to a night on the town. It stays with you and just makes you feel special.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, good buy.</li>
            <li> This is one perfume I will never get tired Waring it.</li>
            <li> Have used RED for years; Love the scent; doesn&#x27;t have the chemical scent like most other fragrances.  This is the only perfume I like and you only need a very tiny spritz which lasts all day.Very pleasant.  The price on this is so much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have missed this perfume and I&#x27;m glad it is back.  It isn&#x27;t for everyone but try it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product, using for many years.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend for Christmas</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this perfume arrived at my door! Once I opened it, I was impressed with the size of the bottle &amp; lotion. When I sprayed it, the smell was HORRIBLE!!! It reminded me of moth balls. I can buy the imitation at Walmart for $8.00, and have better luck than this! Never again.</li>
            <li> Le Air de Temps better.  It gets my mojo running early in the evening and at top speed at the end.</li>
            <li> Gave as a present. She seemed pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and had sent directly to the recipient&#x27;s home. It was a nice surprise and they thought this item was discontinued!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see the size of this bottle! and lotion too, This is my signature perfume have been wearing it over 20 years. I was happy with price and extra lotion.</li>
            <li> my mother love it! i was a gift for her and i am very happy with the purchase, its a excelent perfume</li>
            <li> Good price on a nice selection of perfume.  Shipped in good package to tprevent breakage.  Would recomment to any one.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfumes and a great price</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Red for a long time.  My husband has purchased it many times for me, and I am often complimented on the scent when I wear it.  People almost always ask what perfume I am wearing.  The lotion is a MUST HAVE - maybe the best part of the set.  It is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It is very hard to find this set any more, so I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon.  I was so happy to find it that I ordered more than one set for myself--just in case!</li>
            <li> Red can be hard to find.I have used it for along time This was a requested gift by a friend  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This will never go out of style it is absolute vintage for those of us who have timeless class &amp; exceptional taste!</li>
            <li> Great and great price.</li>
            <li> Gift: Grandmother loves it, great price</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes. The product price was very reasonable and it arrived within the estimated time frame. I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> my mom uses it all the time, its her favorite spray and especially lotion. its a good product and its always delivered on time. i recommend to those who love or like Giorgio  Beverly hils product.</li>
