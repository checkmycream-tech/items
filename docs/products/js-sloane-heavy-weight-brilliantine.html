            <li>, it&#x27;s reshape able</li>
            <li>but well worth it, exceptional hold.</li>
            <li>I find it works best with barely dry hair.  </li>
            <li>so you just can re-style it without applying more, it wash out so easy with water and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash out</li>
            <li>The hold is strong and lasts.  </li>
            <li>This product holds well, and had a nice matte shine, but the smell is easily one of the most nauseating of the pomades that I&#x27;ve tried his far.</li>
            <li>If you want to use little product with a great shine and hold this is the stuff for you!  </li>
            <li>It is more then others but it beyond worth it.</li>
            <li>Super strong hold</li>
            <li>It holds on strong and rare to find a pomade that has a smooth smell.</li>
            <li>This product is good enough to straighten everything out and keep the hair in place.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use shampoo your hair will look very conditioned, and to make things better...</li>
            <li>This is the best pomade anyone could ever try, it&#x27;s so easy to apply especially in towel dry hair, it gives you hold throughout the day</li>
            <li>this pomade will allow me to have a very clean combover that looks as if my hair was straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that works best for my hair and gives the look (The closest as possible) that I would want to achieve.    </li>
            <li>Excellent, this water base smells great and you can reactivate and reform your hair to desired look.</li>
            <li>I personally love the way that this product is easy to tease my hair with it makes my pomp with more volume than any other one an it keeps a long shine for a while and keep my hair in place</li>
            <li>then i&#x27;m sure you must use an extra amount of pomade to try and give the look you would want...</li>
            <li>ALWAYS BE SURE TO PUT THE LID BACK ON because the water will evaporate</li>
            <li>I find it works much better on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for people with thick hair</li>
            <li>Price wise, it is a little higher than other pomades available out there</li>
            <li>and it holds really well..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 star because it holds my hair really well</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll ruin the whole jar.</li>
            <li>Also--I noticed that some people reviewed it by saying they had thick hair with great experiences...be advised that that not everyone has the same level of hair thickness as yours...</li>
            <li>Decided to switch my hair style to a classic &#x27;gentleman&#x27; cut and was recommended to use a pomade instead of hair wax and gel.</li>
            <li>The final result is a nice shine without the wet look.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The texture of the pomade itself is glittery with a light pink color.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice (or at least to me).</li>
            <li>The scent is a musky, classic, old school scent.  </li>
            <li>Very strong hold and thick consistency.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other pomades from Imperial, Uppercut, and Admiral but this heavyweight is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how much you use, you can go from a shellac-like slick to a lightly waxed/mud texture.</li>
            <li>Probably not recommended if you&#x27;re one of those who can easily go through a tub of pomade within a few weeks considering the price</li>
            <li>It holds up very well and will last me 2 months.</li>
            <li>for people with such hair, you must come to the realization that as your hair gets longer, it may become more difficult to achieve a hair style that&#x27;s more suitable for people with straight hair (thin or thick).    </li>
            <li>I have coarse, thick, wavy hair and only freeze gels have ever been able to tame my hair, except for this product which also sets up fairly hard but washes out with water just like gel, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to try other pomades, but when I hear that people with thick coarse wavy hair has had better experiences with the pomades that I tried and did not like..</li>
            <li>I use a bit more than average because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend has super thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is not that long, but since I have so much of it...when it starts to grow past a certain length..it can longer pomp up and slick straight the way i would want it to.  </li>

            <li> and there&#x27;s still half a tub left.</li>
            <li> Soft and thick from the start.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> I use a fraction of the amount compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other pomades and others don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> this product is definitely not worth me buying again.  </li>
            <li> Been a big fan of this stuff and have been using it for at least 6-12 months.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse wavy hair rocking a comb over fade.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with flakes nor breakouts on my forehead due to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the layrite gel that I previously use.</li>
            <li> I noticed this takes less with a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like hair gel on stereroids and no flaky mess.</li>
            <li> If the hold is broken, a wet comb usually corrects any issues but maybe without the same level of hold.  </li>
            <li> It will last all day in a tough environment.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this pomade if you have thick wavy hard to control hair and want to achieve that Mad Man look.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a slick side-part, and this product kept everything in place, even after running in windy weather.</li>
            <li> for my hair type this product NOT GOOD, if you have slightly curly hair ,stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse..wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick coarse...wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> to them it might be thick...</li>
            <li> I have ungodly thick and untamable hair, but this product gave me the hold ans shine I needed.</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency, its orange/ pinkish and sparkly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>

            <li> I have coarse, thick, wavy hair and only freeze gels have ever been able to tame my hair, except for this product which also sets up fairly hard but washes out with water just like gel, and it smells good.  I strongly recommend this pomade if you have thick wavy hard to control hair and want to achieve that Mad Man look.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have over 30 pomades and this is by far the best water soluble pomade on the market. Wonderful manly floral smell with great shine. The glitter in this goes so well with the las vegas casino lights it&#x27;s ridiculous I was a walking disco ball. All you need is this iron society and star wax clay and you have it all the best in matte, oil, and water based pomades</li>
            <li> I personally love the way that this product is easy to tease my hair with it makes my pomp with more volume than any other one an it keeps a long shine for a while and keep my hair in place and it&#x27;s easy to wash out I love it and recommend It to anyone trying to get that retro look:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just giving 4 starts because this is a really good quality product but It doesn&#x27;t work with my type of hair when the comments says It should.The smell is great. Maybe the best of all the pomades out there. It work as a cologne. It&#x27;s really nice. I will keep using It for a while because I already paid for it. It&#x27;s not the best hold but I can use it for some relax days.</li>
            <li> This is my fancy pomade, great shine good hold. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more from it.</li>
            <li> I love this brilliantine. Just started to use it and it holds really well.. It will last all day in a tough environment.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the layrite gel that I previously use. I noticed this takes less with a stronger hold. It also smells nice (or at least to me).</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse..wavy hair.  I have REALLY thick coarse...wavy hair.  My hair is not that long, but since I have so much of it...when it starts to grow past a certain length..it can longer pomp up and slick straight the way i would want it to.  I have tried Layrite (strongest hold), Imperial (strongest hold), American crew (strongest hold), Suavecito (regular &amp; firme/strong hold)...I&#x27;ve also used some Murray&#x27;s but that s*** just brought the waves out even more.    JS sloan has a very strong smell that I am not fond of...this product is definitely not worth me buying again.  It may be good for peole with thin to somewhat thick hair...if you have really thick hair &amp; coarse wavy hair then i&#x27;m sure you must use an extra amount of pomade to try and give the look you would want...but this product has an overpowering smell...i feel like my coworkers can smell it when I&#x27;m talking to them.    I&#x27;ve wanted to try other pomades, but when I hear that people with thick coarse wavy hair has had better experiences with the pomades that I tried and did not like..i&#x27;d figure there was no use in wasting my money.    I always keep on going back to Suavecito firme/strong hold.    It&#x27;s the only thing that works best for my hair and gives the look (The closest as possible) that I would want to achieve.    for people with such hair, you must come to the realization that as your hair gets longer, it may become more difficult to achieve a hair style that&#x27;s more suitable for people with straight hair (thin or thick).    Even so, I&#x27;d recommend Suavecito firme/strong hold...it&#x27;s a very good price for a good product.    Also--I noticed that some people reviewed it by saying they had thick hair with great experiences...be advised that that not everyone has the same level of hair thickness as yours...to them it might be thick...but to you it might not..    I feel that I may have a thicker set of coarse/wavy hair...I&#x27;m going back to Suvaceto.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and rarely find products that hold my hair the way i like it.   This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used.   Heavyweight is the way to go</li>
            <li> JS Sloane is one of my top 3 favorites for a water based pomade.  The scent is a musky, classic, old school scent.  Something like you would think your grandfather wore.  The hold is strong and lasts.  It does give you helmet head but I have not found a water based that doesn&#x27;t.  A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit! If you want to use little product with a great shine and hold this is the stuff for you!  I&#x27;ve used Shiner Gold and Suavacito and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the hold and shine of this product. I have thick coarse wavy hair rocking a comb over fade. This product is good enough to straighten everything out and keep the hair in place.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fresh scent!!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling pomade with excellent hold. I find it works much better on dry hair. I use a bit more than average because I have thick hair. I&#x27;m glad this is for sale on amazon now.</li>
            <li> Decided to switch my hair style to a classic &#x27;gentleman&#x27; cut and was recommended to use a pomade instead of hair wax and gel. My barber friend suggested getting JS Sloane Brilliantine. I&#x27;m giving this 5 star because it holds my hair really well and the smell of the pomade is really really nice. The texture of the pomade itself is glittery with a light pink color. Gives your hair great shine! Price wise, it is a little higher than other pomades available out there but personally, I feel the quality is there. Probably not recommended if you&#x27;re one of those who can easily go through a tub of pomade within a few weeks considering the price but I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 months now and there&#x27;s still half a tub left.</li>
            <li> I wear my medium fine hair with a comb over pompadour and this pomade provides the best styling and scent I have found.  I have tried several other pomades from Imperial, Uppercut, and Admiral but this heavyweight is my favorite.  I find it works best with barely dry hair.  If my hair is too damp, I have to use a blow dryer to assist with lift and retention.  I am able to achieve a nice pomp with this product.  The final result is a nice shine without the wet look.  If the hold is broken, a wet comb usually corrects any issues but maybe without the same level of hold.  I have not had any issues with flakes nor breakouts on my forehead due to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Pricey but well worth it, exceptional hold.</li>
            <li> Very strong hold and thick consistency. It does harden just like all water-based pomade.</li>
            <li> Been a big fan of this stuff and have been using it for at least 6-12 months. I switched over from Shiner Gold to the JS Sloane and haven&#x27;t looked back. Soft and thick from the start. Depending on how much you use, you can go from a shellac-like slick to a lightly waxed/mud texture. Love the smell, love the consistency, love the packaging.... ALWAYS BE SURE TO PUT THE LID BACK ON because the water will evaporate and you&#x27;ll ruin the whole jar.</li>
            <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Pretty good for people with thick hair</li>
            <li> It holds on strong and rare to find a pomade that has a smooth smell.</li>
            <li> I have ungodly thick and untamable hair, but this product gave me the hold ans shine I needed. I used this for a slick side-part, and this product kept everything in place, even after running in windy weather. No joke. This product didn&#x27;t budge. I would definitely recommend for thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product holds well, and had a nice matte shine, but the smell is easily one of the most nauseating of the pomades that I&#x27;ve tried his far.</li>
            <li> for my hair type this product NOT GOOD, if you have slightly curly hair ,stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, this water base smells great and you can reactivate and reform your hair to desired look. Super strong hold, it&#x27;s like hair gel on stereroids and no flaky mess.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best pomade I have ever used! I have very thick curly hair n this pomade will allow me to have a very clean combover that looks as if my hair was straight. It is more then others but it beyond worth it. The quality is there!  I use a fraction of the amount compared to other brands. I have had mine for 2 months n still have some left. It has a thick consistency, its orange/ pinkish and sparkly. It smells great and my wife loves the way it smells! It&#x27;s a great product! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Best Pomade money can buy. Add JS Sloane Top Coat!!!</li>
            <li> Boyfriend has super thick hair. This stuff molds it just the way he wants and it isn&#x27;t hard. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is the best pomade anyone could ever try, it&#x27;s so easy to apply especially in towel dry hair, it gives you hold throughout the day, it&#x27;s reshape able so you just can re-style it without applying more, it wash out so easy with water and If you don&#x27;t use shampoo your hair will look very conditioned, and to make things better... It has the best smell out of all the pomades I&#x27;ve tried and god knows I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other pomades and others don&#x27;t compare. It holds up very well and will last me 2 months.I highly recommend this product.</li>
