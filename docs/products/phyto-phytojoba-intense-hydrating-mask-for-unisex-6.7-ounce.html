            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>I read great reviews on this product so I bought it and tried about 4 times.</li>
            <li>Have been using is a couple of times a month with great results.</li>
            <li>It makes a difference and smells great.</li>
            <li>I use this product and it&#x27;s great for your hair.</li>
            <li>Very Good detangles, and has nice orange blossom fragrance</li>
            <li>Product is good, just costly for the size.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product and I  recommend this.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Try the masque by Biolage for something more effective that&#x27;s a comparable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair masques and most are much more effective than this.</li>
            <li>This product is OK.  </li>
            <li>Most people probably won&#x27;t want to use this every day</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the body and shine this product has helped produce in my hair.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very healthy and shiny and super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish they would come up with a better package, however, as it is not shower friendly with the screw top lid.</li>
            <li>it probably was to strong</li>
            <li>My hair is not damaged or tinted, its fine, so its not like my hair is a basket case.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not super impressed.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling hydrated and sliky smooth.</li>
            <li>After my hair had a chance to grow out I was so pleased to see I have soft curles more body and no tangles.  </li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner, it washes out easily and leaves my hair feeling soft, not dry.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and has a lovely citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Sometime you just read the reviews and jump into action :)  </li>
            <li>Maybe, if the price is right.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair soft and fresh but so does a cheap bottle of Pantene.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that&#x27;s been chemically treated, and it makes my hair soft but not overly conditioned.</li>
            <li>The goal of using the mask is to improve your hair, not to lose it... and with continuous use of this one - just such a thing may happen :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the mask, reading some of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few years and love the way it makes my hair feels!  </li>
            <li>I find I only need to shampoo every three days and use a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I could really tell a difference after I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping my hair a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and really lke it, but I believe what I received was an out of date product.</li>
            <li>No doubt it can make hair \\&quot; very soft\\&quot; temporarily -</li>
            <li>I have straight hair.</li>
            <li>My gray hair has become very managalble these days.  </li>
            <li>I use this twice a week in between other Phyto conditioners and is always my favorite.  </li>
            <li>, a month later I left it for AN HOUR, to see if it will work better, but it has left me somehow dissapointed.</li>
            <li>In desperation, I tried this mask and left it in for a while... when I washed it out, my hair had gone from a dry chunk of frizz to lusciously smooth and soft and silky...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and it never fails.</li>
            <li>This makes it so soft and controllable.</li>
            <li>at the cost of general intoxication of the body.</li>
            <li>The Phytojoba Intense Hydrating Mask leaves my hair so soft and healthy-feeling, never leaves residue or weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>Tried this on my hair only once so far and my hair feels slightly smoother and stood up to humidity pretty well.  </li>

            <li> Then I towel dry and use it again.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry (from being over processed), this was recommended by my hairdresser, when my hair started to break everytime</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling as if it had a heavy film and straightening factor.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s conditioning but won&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and when I&#x27;m with my family in Greece during the summers, the combination of Mediterranean sun and salt at the beach makes my hair a dry, frizzy, impossible-to-untangle mess.</li>
            <li> It did felt thicker and softer afterwards, but not as thick or shinier as other hair masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I got a different prodcut than the one i ordered, however with Phyto products you never go wrong.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a bit expensive), but for a hair emergency, it can work miracles on seriously dry, damaged hair.</li>

            <li> I read great reviews on this product so I bought it and tried about 4 times. I&#x27;ve left it 10 minutes once, a month after I left it for the same 10 minutes with a thermal hat, a month later I left it for AN HOUR, to see if it will work better, but it has left me somehow dissapointed. My hair is not damaged or tinted, its fine, so its not like my hair is a basket case. It did felt thicker and softer afterwards, but not as thick or shinier as other hair masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product is OK.  I&#x27;ve used it for the past 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m not super impressed.  I have dry curly hair and I need a product that can keep in the moisture.  It does leave my hair soft and fresh but so does a cheap bottle of Pantene.  Everyone is different.  Would I purchase this product again?  Maybe, if the price is right.</li>
            <li> I got a different prodcut than the one i ordered, however with Phyto products you never go wrong. They are all amaizing!</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and when I&#x27;m with my family in Greece during the summers, the combination of Mediterranean sun and salt at the beach makes my hair a dry, frizzy, impossible-to-untangle mess. In desperation, I tried this mask and left it in for a while... when I washed it out, my hair had gone from a dry chunk of frizz to lusciously smooth and soft and silky... what a lifesaver!  Most people probably won&#x27;t want to use this every day (it&#x27;s a bit expensive), but for a hair emergency, it can work miracles on seriously dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Product is good, just costly for the size.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going bald until I saw this mentioned on The Doctors.  I gave it a try but left it in instead of rinsing it out.  After my hair had a chance to grow out I was so pleased to see I have soft curles more body and no tangles.  The next day when I shower I don&#x27;t shampoo just rinse Phytojoba out.  Then I towel dry and use it again.  I find I only need to shampoo every three days and use a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I could really tell a difference after I used it. Have been using is a couple of times a month with great results.</li>
            <li> I switch between several lines yet always come back to this one for my highlighted hair. It makes a difference and smells great. Wish they would come up with a better package, however, as it is not shower friendly with the screw top lid.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that&#x27;s been chemically treated, and it makes my hair soft but not overly conditioned. It&#x27;s really helping my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried every line of hair products and nothing compares to Phyto.  The Phytojoba Intense Hydrating Mask leaves my hair so soft and healthy-feeling, never leaves residue or weighs my hair down. I use this twice a week in between other Phyto conditioners and is always my favorite.  A must-have!</li>
            <li> Tried this on my hair only once so far and my hair feels slightly smoother and stood up to humidity pretty well.  It also didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and has a lovely citrus scent. I have only used it twice but well defiantly be using it weekly</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and it never fails. It&#x27;s conditioning but won&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> These products are the best for my hair, and I have a lot of hair. This makes it so soft and controllable. I swear by this product!</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling as if it had a heavy film and straightening factor.  I wanted shine and a bounce&lt;br /&gt;Wrong product for me</li>
            <li> The mask has a stale smell to it and no fragrance at all.  I have used this product before and really lke it, but I believe what I received was an out of date product.</li>
            <li> Very Good detangles, and has nice orange blossom fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair masques and most are much more effective than this. I left the product on my hair for almost 10 minutes and didn&#x27;t notice any difference afterward. It was as if I hadn&#x27;t even conditioned my hair that day. Try the masque by Biolage for something more effective that&#x27;s a comparable price.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product and I  recommend this. It made my hair very healthy and shiny and super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I just recommend to let it stay longer than the recommended instructions. I let it on my hair for 45 minutes and wrapped my hair with aluminum foil, to produce heat.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. This is a great conditioner, it washes out easily and leaves my hair feeling soft, not dry.</li>
            <li> Sorry it made my hair hard ..not sure it has to much protein ..I&#x27;ll use I again as the directions say 5 mins .. I  left it for 20 mins it probably was to strong so it tangle my hair uhaa!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see next go around.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry (from being over processed), this was recommended by my hairdresser, when my hair started to break everytime I brushed my hair out at night.  I will definately keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years and love the way it makes my hair feels!  Great Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the mask, reading some of the positive reviews. Sometime you just read the reviews and jump into action :)  I should have looked into list of ingredients before! No doubt it can make hair \\&quot; very soft\\&quot; temporarily - at the cost of general intoxication of the body. It loaded with all kinds of PARABENS:&lt;br /&gt;PROPYLPARABEN : (Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Ecotoxicology, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity)&lt;br /&gt;Ceteareth-20 : (Enhanced skin absorption)&lt;br /&gt;BUTYLPARABEN : (Biochemical or cellular level changes, Data gaps, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption)&lt;br /&gt;ISOBUTYLPARABEN : (Biochemical or cellular level changes, Data gaps, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption)&lt;br /&gt;LINALOOL : (Allergies/immunotoxicity)&lt;br /&gt;ETHYLPARABEN : (Endocrine disruption)&lt;br /&gt;METHYLPARABEN : (Biochemical or cellular level changes, Endocrine disruption)&lt;br /&gt;PHENOXYETHANOL : (Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive) )&lt;br /&gt;DIMETHICONE : (Ecotoxicology)&lt;br /&gt;CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE : (Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity)&lt;br /&gt;SULISOBENZONE BENZOPHENONE 4 : (Enhanced skin absorption, Endocrine disruption, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs))&lt;br /&gt;PROPYLENE GLYCOL : (Enhanced skin absorption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Organ system toxicity)&lt;br /&gt;TETRASODIUM EDTA : (Enhanced skin absorption, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental working group  their website (e  w  g  dot  org ) - google them - rates that product 8 out of 10 harmful/ toxic scale. ( 1 is the cleanest, 10 is the dirtiest).&lt;br /&gt;my personal opinion, I would stay away from anything \\&quot;...paraben\\&quot; and EDTA. So, I instantly returned that hair mask. The goal of using the mask is to improve your hair, not to lose it... and with continuous use of this one - just such a thing may happen :)</li>
            <li> I use this product and it&#x27;s great for your hair. It leaves it feeling hydrated and sliky smooth. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have bought several tubs of this hydrating mask for my hair and also for a friend to try. I love it! It makes my hair shiny and sleek. I have straight hair. Untangles too, no need for conditioner besides.</li>
            <li> My gray hair has become very managalble these days.  I am pleased with the body and shine this product has helped produce in my hair.</li>
