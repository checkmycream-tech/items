            <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is herbal and planty, as opposed to floral, so it makes it really refreshing.</li>
            <li>Pevonia is my favorite face wash, I have been using it for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Love this product and all Pevonia face products.  </li>

            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in my overall skin tone, still can&#x27;t say it helps 100% with keeping the oil at bay, but it&#x27;s very good stuff!!</li>
            <li>The cleanser is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and love the product!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps an oilier skin type may enjoy this.  </li>
            <li>MANY THANKS!</li>
            <li>clean after use.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I rarely, if ever, get break outs.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product from other suppliers before and I have made repeat purchases because it is good.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no draw back to this product, as the quality and efficiency of it makes the price more than fair.</li>
            <li>Was worried about whether this item from Amazon was a second or was old, since the price was so good.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh yet not dried out.  </li>
            <li>When I am consistent with the Phyto-Gel cleanser, it is short-term.</li>
            <li>If you want to find out more about my daily routine and which products i use, just let me know.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>So while the picture shows the short bottle with the lid on the bottom, I am glad that I received the bottle with the pump, which leads me to believe the product hasn&#x27;t been sitting on a shelf forever.</li>
            <li>On time shipping and, brand new!!</li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly, but gently.</li>
            <li>The product really stretches...</li>
            <li>A bit of foam, but not too much.</li>
            <li>Gentle on face.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser, but I can&#x27;t tell if its any different from any other.</li>
            <li>This gets my face clean but doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; it for future breakouts.</li>
            <li>i bought this cleanser after getting a full facial at a spa where they use Pevonia products.</li>
            <li>I have oily/sensitive skin and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pevonia products for years and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product without hesitation...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need a lot to get a nice, thick foam.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the product removes makeup and eye-makeup completely, without stinging the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night with a little face cleansing brush and it leaves my skin feeling so clean</li>
            <li>I have used several Pevonia products for couple of years now, and while it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne completely, at least my skin feels good and is not too dry nor oily</li>
            <li>The best part about this is that it is all natural and does not have any nasty acne meds in it, but still works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I have some acne usually, and pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and this is the same product I have recently ordered directly from Pevonia @</li>
            <li>My skin changes periodically and I suddenly have minor adult acne.</li>
            <li>You only use a very small amount and it gets your skin so clean.  </li>

            <li> It totally cleans my makeup off my skin without stripping it or irritating it.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to find Pevonia products in my area since our local spa stopped carrying them.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the product in the picture, a tall bottle with a pump, but received the short, no pump, version.&lt;br /&gt;:(.</li>

            <li> My Dermatologist suggest that I use this product, and gave me a sample.  I use it morning and night with a little face cleansing brush and it leaves my skin feeling so clean, I follow it with the mattifying moisturizer.  I have noticed a huge difference in my overall skin tone, still can&#x27;t say it helps 100% with keeping the oil at bay, but it&#x27;s very good stuff!!</li>
            <li> i bought this cleanser after getting a full facial at a spa where they use Pevonia products. This is a good cleanser, but I can&#x27;t tell if its any different from any other.</li>
            <li> Every time I stray from using Pevonia, I end up going back! I love this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t take off all of my eye make up and sometimes I wash my face twice at night, but I haven&#x27;t found a cleaner, or line, that I like better. I have oily/sensitive skin and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> works wonders&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> A little too &#x27;tingly&#x27; for my skin type.  Perhaps an oilier skin type may enjoy this.  I do like the way&lt;br /&gt;the product removes makeup and eye-makeup completely, without stinging the eyes.  Skin feels&lt;br /&gt;squeeky clean after use.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because they use it when I get facials. I like it very much, you don&#x27;t need a lot to get a nice, thick foam. Please note that the product packaging does not look like this. It is in a pump bottle which I prefer. It totally cleans my makeup off my skin without stripping it or irritating it.  I think I will purchase the larger size next time and refill the container I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pevonia products for years and highly recommend them. The cleanser is light and refreshing. It cleans thoroughly, but gently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years. My skin changes periodically and I suddenly have minor adult acne. When I am consistent with the Phyto-Gel cleanser, it is short-term. I&#x27;ve experimented with other products (ie, cheaper) and always return to it. It requires just a small amount for daily use, so it lasts for months. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have some acne usually, and pretty sensitive skin. I had been using other all natural cleansers, but found that my face was still broken out often. I started using this because of a facial I got with these products. The woman who did the facial for me gave me some samples and after a week I found that my skin had zero blackheads, was far less oily, and was much less prone to breakouts. The best part about this is that it is all natural and does not have any nasty acne meds in it, but still works like a charm. Also, the smell is really nice. It is herbal and planty, as opposed to floral, so it makes it really refreshing. I use two pumps daily and have had the same bottle for months. The product really stretches... I have only used half of the bottle! There is absolutely no draw back to this product, as the quality and efficiency of it makes the price more than fair.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin but i can&#x27;t use just acne products because it makes my skin too dry. So when i went to my local spa to get a facial, the lady suggested this brand. I have used several Pevonia products for couple of years now, and while it doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne completely, at least my skin feels good and is not too dry nor oily so I&#x27;m very happy about it. If you want to find out more about my daily routine and which products i use, just let me know.</li>
            <li> Great product. No issues with anything. I works as advertized. I would recommend this product to anyone that has an interest in it.</li>
            <li> Got what I wanted when I wanted it was exactly perfect.........</li>
            <li> On time shipping and, brand new!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling, and washes well. My face do not feel tight after washing it. A bit of foam, but not too much.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely be buy again. Pevonia is my favorite face wash, I have been using it for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser.  It was recommended to me by an Aesticitan.  I tend to be quite oily and acne prone.  I like the performance of this cleanser but think I would try the Acne line if I had to do it again.  This gets my face clean but doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; it for future breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it arrived in a timely manner! MANY THANKS!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and love the product!  This is the only thing that has remove the Sebaceous Hyperplasia on my forehead!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who loves this line of products. SHE LOVED IT!!!! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product without hesitation...</li>
            <li> I ordered the product in the picture, a tall bottle with a pump, but received the short, no pump, version.&lt;br /&gt;:(.</li>
            <li> I have used this same face wash since I was 15 y/o (I&#x27;m now 30!) and I rarely, if ever, get break outs.  It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh yet not dried out.  Although it&#x27;s a bit pricey, the bottle lasts forever because it&#x27;s concentrated and you only use a little each wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product and all Pevonia face products.  Gentle on face.  You only use a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; or two, so the bottle lasts several months.  Highly recommend.  I am unable to find Pevonia products in my area since our local spa stopped carrying them.  So I was happy to find Pevonia products available through Amazon.  Will re-order as needed.</li>
            <li> I love it.  You only use a very small amount and it gets your skin so clean.  It suds a little. I like that. Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> best cleanser have used it for years  highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have bought this product from other suppliers before and I have made repeat purchases because it is good. However the photo shown on your web site was different to the package I received which is deceptive.</li>
            <li> I received the 6.8 ounce Phyto-Gel Cleanser in the bottle with a pump (which is the packaging currently being used by Pevonia). I have been using it for a week or so and this is the same product I have recently ordered directly from Pevonia @ $41/bottle. Was worried about whether this item from Amazon was a second or was old, since the price was so good. So while the picture shows the short bottle with the lid on the bottom, I am glad that I received the bottle with the pump, which leads me to believe the product hasn&#x27;t been sitting on a shelf forever.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price!</li>
