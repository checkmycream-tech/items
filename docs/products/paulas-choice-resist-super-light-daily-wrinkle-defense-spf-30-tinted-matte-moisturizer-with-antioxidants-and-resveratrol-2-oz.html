            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use foundation, so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect to wear to the gym because it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li>and this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>awesome.</li>
            <li>The best!!!  </li>
            <li>All of PC&#x27;s products are excellent.</li>
            <li>This is perfect.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just flat-out awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>And the tint to it matches my very fair complection and balances out any leftover redness that my cleanser can&#x27;t control.</li>
            <li>For years now I have not found the perfect combination for routine beauty care and this is amazing!</li>
            <li>I can wear every day and it is a beautiful primer for under makeup - TRULY BEAUTIFUL PRIMER.  </li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>It is a great 1-step product - you get SPF and a &amp;#34;me, but better&amp;#34; complexion.</li>
            <li>How often is a product so great that you&#x27;ll do that?</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t greasy and does a great job moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great multi-tasker.</li>
            <li>does amazing things for my skin!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not working that good for me.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with their performance.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says, protecting my skin while giving it a great finish!</li>
            <li>I love finding all in one products!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Good stuff, definitely very light</li>
            <li>Paula&#x27;s Choice is an amazing and affordable line of no frills items for skin care.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing sunscreen and putting anything on over it is</li>
            <li>I bought this product (through the Paula&#x27;s Choice website) and have really liked it.  </li>
            <li>This whole line of products is really amazing!!</li>
            <li>This is a great tinted moisturizer for those of us with fair, sensitive, acne-prone, combination, aging skin.</li>
            <li>It really gives  my skin a beautiful and healthy glow without looking shiny or oily.  </li>
            <li>Price-aside, I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-lightly tinted, so there&#x27;s no white cast&lt;br /&gt;-Works as an awesome makeup primer</li>
            <li>I love the idea</li>
            <li>It is great for fair skin only but results in a ghostly sheen when my skin is more sun kissed.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>one thing about this product that will make it to work better is to shake the container before each use.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m sticking with three stars because once I rescued the situation with another moisturizer on top</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it protects my skin well and doesn&#x27;t break me out, my two requirements in a face spf.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product is just the perfect touch to smooth out the wrinkles and all the other imperfections on my face.  </li>
            <li>Paula&#x27;s choice products have been great for my skin in the past and I&#x27;m delighted to have found this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great daily sunscreen</li>
            <li>This product is a fantastic 4 in 1, transparent color, light moisturizer, antioxidant, and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Works great on oily Tzone, but I need a different product on the rest of my skin because it&#x27;s over drying.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly but you have to look at yourself in the mirror when applying or else</li>
            <li>that it goes on easily and provides full coverage.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>thanks to anyone who uses it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great, it goes on smooth, a little goes a long way, once it is absorbed, it mattifies your face, which is great for me, I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and is just the right color for me.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and leaves your combination skin smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to most sunscreens for the face.</li>
            <li>so I do a light moisturiser first, then apply this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The tint and texture is extremely light (lotion, not a gel); making it very easy to blend in especially when I&#x27;m rushing out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Not too many of them out there that can match up to this; given nearly all of them are too greasy, break me out, or turn me into an oompa loompa.</li>
            <li>physical sunscreen, which is great for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No breakouts, skin is soft and smooth and NOOO SUNBURN!  </li>
            <li>I usually purchase from Paula&#x27;s Choice directly but was happy to find it here!</li>
            <li>I usually order direct from the Paula&#x27;s Choice website and am very happy to see her products here.</li>
            <li>and I have adult acne and this super light moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with very oily t-zone.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>but this one is VERY matte.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Most days i skip foundation as the coverage is sheer and natural looking</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I like that it is rated highly,</li>
            <li>so you may want to get this in the summer and opt for something a little more moisturizing in the winter.</li>
            <li>It does flow out of the tube rather freely, causing some waste of the product --- but I&#x27;m learning to be more careful with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new moisturizer for a while and decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great light base for makeup.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s SPF plus amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>so I found myself regularly over pouring at first</li>
            <li>Many pros, very few cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really made my skin feel amazing, it kind of had a weird thick texture putting it on</li>
            <li>Not a good idea when you live where the sun&#x27;s rays are very strong.  </li>
            <li>This sunblock quickly absorbs, stays put, and provides a great base for additional makeup.</li>
            <li>Because the tint is a little light for my skin tone I follow up with a darker powder.  </li>
            <li>I wish the packaging clearly stated that this is a TINTED product.</li>
            <li>While on vacation a few weeks ago it was the only &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; I wore and was so pleased how natural it looked while still giving coverage and evening out my skin.</li>
            <li>Big fan of Paula products, but this one is really chalky.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have rather oily but sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li>At first it felt dry</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change about this particular product is it needs to come in 3-4 skin tone options.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for anti-aging moisturizer, with SPF, for oily skin</li>
            <li>but just enough to cover and smooth out freckles, under eyes, and slight redness.</li>
            <li>I use to get super shiny after a few hours of wear but this amazing moisturizer is a fantastic base for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I used to skip using moisturizer completely because at the end of the day my skin would look shiny and gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ashamed I paid this much for a tiny bottle of super light spf. :(</li>
            <li>I am extremely sun sensitive, a redhead, have sensitive skin in general and have a history of melanoma.  </li>
            <li>Slight white color when first applied but goes away after rubbing it in.</li>

            <li> I am extremely sun sensitive, a redhead, have sensitive skin in general and have a history of melanoma.  </li>
            <li> Slight white color when first applied but goes away after rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint is that it comes out of the tube VERY fast</li>
            <li> Frankly, I only expected a sun block.  </li>
            <li> To avoid this, start applying it from the middle of your face outwards, not the other way around, just like you would with a foundation.</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;m currently using four other Paula&#x27;s Choice products.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin in some areas, bumps on my forehead</li>
            <li> but in fact I still have to wear a moisturizer under it or it looks a bit dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I found this moisturizer too dry, after I put it on, my face feels itchy and very dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves the face very dry.</li>
            <li> I only wish I could buy it locally and for a little less $.</li>
            <li> If  my face occasionally appears somewhat pale, it can be corrected with powder or blusher.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other suncreens</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cover blemishes and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Not sure about &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; them as I use other products in association with this to manage any hyperpigmentation/acne scarring I may have (notably other PC products - their BHA).</li>
            <li> Also for comparison I have slightly olive skin.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of coverage.</li>
            <li> I looked a little like something undead.</li>
            <li> so I mix it with a little of her resist oil booster and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I do wipe my brows because it collects there and will look a little orange if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I was cutting my older tubes up to get to the product!  </li>
            <li> Works well on my wife&#x27;s skin, no burning or excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s how all matte sun blocks work or not,</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try something else from this line.</li>
            <li> And it protects my skin - so there&#x27;s hardly anything to cover up now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was a bogus batch or the other reviewers are crazy or what, but this was not light at all - it felt sticky and sat on my face all day - it was tinted like makeup but didn&#x27;t cover any imperfections.</li>
            <li> When I put it on this morning after washing my face, it dried into a dusty film across my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells like fermenting apples with maybe a touch of honey and coconut, and having to reapply every two hours is just ridiculous.</li>

            <li> Price-aside, I love this product. I only wish I could buy it locally and for a little less $. This is a great tinted moisturizer for those of us with fair, sensitive, acne-prone, combination, aging skin. Not too many of them out there that can match up to this; given nearly all of them are too greasy, break me out, or turn me into an oompa loompa. For me, it does not leave a horrible orange cast on my face, nor does it oxidize throughout the day (which would otherwise cause an orange tinge later). The tint and texture is extremely light (lotion, not a gel); making it very easy to blend in especially when I&#x27;m rushing out the door in the morning. No pilling, clumping, or streaking. This eliminates the need to apply sunblock or foundation to my face. This 2oz bottle, with daily use (dime size or smaller), will typically last me 4-6 weeks. So I guess cost-wise that&#x27;s not so bad. Because it is a tinted moisturizer, don&#x27;t expect make-up level coverage. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, so this is my version of foundation. It won&#x27;t cover blemishes and dark spots. Not sure about &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; them as I use other products in association with this to manage any hyperpigmentation/acne scarring I may have (notably other PC products - their BHA).</li>
            <li> Many pros, very few cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Pure physical sunscreen, which is great for my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;-lightly tinted, so there&#x27;s no white cast&lt;br /&gt;-Works as an awesome makeup primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;super-light&amp;#34; as the title says. It feels like a foundation rather than disappearing into my skin. After a while I got used to that, though.&lt;br /&gt;-Not water-resistant, which could be a problem for those sweaty summer days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great daily sunscreen and I would recommend this to anyone. Also for comparison I have slightly olive skin. The tint may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Leonardo&#x27;s wife. I have combination skin with very oily t-zone. I found this moisturizer too dry, after I put it on, my face feels itchy and very dry. I would recommend to mix it with another moisturizer to balance this effect. I love the idea but it&#x27;s not working that good for me.</li>
            <li> Yes. Oh my goodness yes. I was looking for a tinted moisturizer with spf protection that didn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin break out (Tall order!). I have dry skin in some areas, bumps on my forehead (I think just clogged pores, they&#x27;re not zits... I don&#x27;t know what they are but they&#x27;re GONE NOW!!), and I tend to break out around the corners of my mouth and chin. This stuff really made my skin feel amazing, it kind of had a weird thick texture putting it on (I was worried it was going to cause my skin to break out immediately). However, after using it for several days and exfoliating my forehead, the bumps are gone!! It&#x27;s a great light base for makeup. I don&#x27;t like to use foundation, so this is perfect. Evens everything out, and the tinted part blended to my skin tone. Love it so much.</li>
            <li> This product is a fantastic 4 in 1, transparent color, light moisturizer, antioxidant, and sunscreen. Paula&#x27;s Choice is an amazing and affordable line of no frills items for skin care. The only thing I would change about this particular product is it needs to come in 3-4 skin tone options. It is great for fair skin only but results in a ghostly sheen when my skin is more sun kissed.</li>
            <li> Works well on my wife&#x27;s skin, no burning or excessive dryness. Very gentle and leaves your combination skin smooth and not oily. Perfect to wear to the gym because it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. This whole line of products is really amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works great on oily Tzone, but I need a different product on the rest of my skin because it&#x27;s over drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for anti-aging moisturizer, with SPF, for oily skin and this is PERFECT. For years now I have not found the perfect combination for routine beauty care and this is amazing! I have very oily skin and I have adult acne and this super light moisturizer does amazing things for my skin! My skin is no longer oily when I wear make-up! I use to get super shiny after a few hours of wear but this amazing moisturizer is a fantastic base for my skin. At first it felt dry and I thought it was going to make my skin flaky then oily but it didn&#x27;t! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would address a faint age spot, but does not seem to be designed for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I cannot stop talking about this product!! It does exactly what it says, protecting my skin while giving it a great finish! AND no sunscreen smell! While on vacation a few weeks ago it was the only &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; I wore and was so pleased how natural it looked while still giving coverage and evening out my skin. I have oily, acne prone skin and have had no breakouts using this. The only minor complaint is that it comes out of the tube VERY fast so I found myself regularly over pouring at first so just keep that in mind until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more moisturizing so it could be a one step and go, but in fact I still have to wear a moisturizer under it or it looks a bit dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s SPF plus amazing coverage. I no longer feel the need to cake on foundation and concealer. And it protects my skin - so there&#x27;s hardly anything to cover up now anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just awesome.</li>
            <li> The best!!!  All of PC&#x27;s products are excellent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great, it goes on smooth, a little goes a long way, once it is absorbed, it mattifies your face, which is great for me, I have oily skin.  I love finding all in one products!</li>
            <li> OMG. The answer. If you don&#x27;t like a ton of cover up in the summer. This is perfect. I use this as my cover up. Just a little bit of coverage.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product (through the Paula&#x27;s Choice website) and have really liked it.  I have oily/normal skin and this did not cause breakouts.  Nor did it make my face shiny or oily.  I&#x27;ve just bought my second tube.  If you buy from the Paula&#x27;s Choice site and use my refer a friend code, we each get $10: http://goo.gl/ZBGQF4.</li>
            <li> This sunblock quickly absorbs, stays put, and provides a great base for additional makeup. After looking for a mineral sunblock that wasn&#x27;t greasy, I think I&#x27;ve finally ended my search. Paula&#x27;s choice products have been great for my skin in the past and I&#x27;m delighted to have found this one.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen.  Not oily at all. Slight white color when first applied but goes away after rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Leaves the face very dry. Not sure if that&#x27;s how all matte sun blocks work or not, but this one is VERY matte.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  It goes on so smoothly and is just the right color for me.  I am of an age that &#x27;regular&#x27; make up does not look well on me any longer.  This product is just the perfect touch to smooth out the wrinkles and all the other imperfections on my face.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I wish the packaging clearly stated that this is a TINTED product. I use it as a BB cream that&#x27;s a bit darker than my skin color in the winter and a bit lighter in the summer. The texture is divine, albeit a bit drying on my skin. It goes on smoothly but you have to look at yourself in the mirror when applying or else you will end up with patches of color in your hairline and around the face. To avoid this, start applying it from the middle of your face outwards, not the other way around, just like you would with a foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have dry skin so I do a light moisturiser first, then apply this sunscreen. Most days i skip foundation as the coverage is sheer and natural looking but just enough to cover and smooth out freckles, under eyes, and slight redness. It is a great 1-step product - you get SPF and a &amp;#34;me, but better&amp;#34; complexion.</li>
            <li> Big fan of Paula products, but this one is really chalky. Even putting it on my moisturized hand as a test makes my hand look white.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I find that I do not need to put anything else on my face after applying this.  It really gives  my skin a beautiful and healthy glow without looking shiny or oily.  It is matte but not drying or &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.  It is an amazing sunscreen and putting anything on over it is will just spoil it!  I have gone through about 3 or 4 tubes of this stuff and even apply it to my neck and chest.  I usually purchase from Paula&#x27;s Choice directly but was happy to find it here! Try this and you will probably never want to stop using it...it was out of stock last year and I was cutting my older tubes up to get to the product!  How often is a product so great that you&#x27;ll do that?</li>
            <li> Everything was as stated.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have rather oily but sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other suncreens but they left my face looking shiny and irritated. So, I went without. Not a good idea when you live where the sun&#x27;s rays are very strong.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try... This stuff is just flat-out awesome.  No shine, no irritation.  Blocks the sun&#x27;s rays well. Because the tint is a little light for my skin tone I follow up with a darker powder.  It works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked so well I&#x27;m currently using four other Paula&#x27;s Choice products.  I am very satisfied with their performance.  I usually order direct from the Paula&#x27;s Choice website and am very happy to see her products here.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, definitely very light so you may want to get this in the summer and opt for something a little more moisturizing in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sun sensitive, a redhead, have sensitive skin in general and have a history of melanoma.  This stuff is magic.  I have tried it all - ALL.  I can wear every day and it is a beautiful primer for under makeup - TRULY BEAUTIFUL PRIMER.  No breakouts, skin is soft and smooth and NOOO SUNBURN!  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to most sunscreens for the face. I&#x27;m so impressed with this product.  No reaction at all. I am anxious to try something else from this line.</li>
            <li> This might be the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased anywhere. I&#x27;m not sure if mine was a bogus batch or the other reviewers are crazy or what, but this was not light at all - it felt sticky and sat on my face all day - it was tinted like makeup but didn&#x27;t cover any imperfections. It smells like fermenting apples with maybe a touch of honey and coconut, and having to reapply every two hours is just ridiculous. I&#x27;m ashamed I paid this much for a tiny bottle of super light spf. :(</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t greasy and does a great job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I only expected a sun block.  Bit this product makes my skin feel hydrated and also evens out the tone.  Great multi-tasker.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily skin and I used to skip using moisturizer completely because at the end of the day my skin would look shiny and gross. But now that I&#x27;ve found PC&#x27;s lightweight moisturizer I haven&#x27;t had any issues, my skin feels softer and hydrated without the oily sheen at the end of my day. And the tint to it matches my very fair complection and balances out any leftover redness that my cleanser can&#x27;t control. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> As someone with a history of facial skin cancer, skin protection is of paramount importance.  I like that it is rated highly, that it goes on easily and provides full coverage.  If  my face occasionally appears somewhat pale, it can be corrected with powder or blusher.  It does flow out of the tube rather freely, causing some waste of the product --- but I&#x27;m learning to be more careful with that.</li>
            <li> So far so good! one thing about this product that will make it to work better is to shake the container before each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new moisturizer for a while and decided to try this one. I was attracted to its no animal testing and its suitability for combination skin. When I put it on this morning after washing my face, it dried into a dusty film across my skin. Rather than diminishing imperfections, it enhanced them. I looked a little like something undead. However, I&#x27;m sticking with three stars because once I rescued the situation with another moisturizer on top, things were a little less grim. I&#x27;ll continue to give this product a try until it runs out, and then I may not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this from paulaschoice.com not amazon. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I like so I mix it with a little of her resist oil booster and it works like a charm. It&#x27;s tinted but not like you&#x27;d think- it just evens out the white sheen it would otherwise leave. I do wipe my brows because it collects there and will look a little orange if I don&#x27;t. Most importantly, it protects my skin well and doesn&#x27;t break me out, my two requirements in a face spf. I think it&#x27;s a little expensive for two ounces but it It&#x27;s cheaper through the regular website and they hook you up with samples too-there&#x27;s always specials running so I recommend looking around before you order. If you use my link you&#x27;ll get $10 off your order at paulaschoice.com. I get a credit too, so thanks to anyone who uses it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://goo.gl/cm5pjq&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
