            <li> PERENNIAL WINNER--THE WOMEN STILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The best and nothing less!!! You must use this wisely young men. Along with this scent comes much responsibility. Respect the scent. Honor thine women. Enjoy the ride,</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Smells fantastic and long lasting....</li>
            <li> I own JPG and JPG2, both fantiastic. This one, however, is a bit lighter than the original which is nice. Has a sweet vanilla aroma to it which makes it a nice date cologne, wouldnt bust this one out at dinner though bit to heavy. Please stick to one spray, two make for this puppy will last you through the night! Fellas the ladies love this scent just as much as JPG original</li>
            <li> The company that sold this gave me a FAKE. Yes they gave me imitation cologne. And you are probably wondering how I know that it was fake, well it was because I have had this cologne for almost 3 years and when they sent me whatever was in their bottle it basically smelled like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances by far</li>
            <li> Smells like Christmas</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a fragrance that better complimented me (I want to smell edible).  After being a 22 year Lagerfeld user, I was ready for a change.  This is the fragrance that I will hopefully be wearing for the rest of my life...it&#x27;s just that good!</li>
            <li> One of the most awsome smelling cologne on the market drives my girlfriend crazy doesn&#x27;t want me to where it without her being around lol been looking for it for years seller was quick on the shipping love it will order more in the futuree</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I just wish it was stronger.</li>
            <li> I have this product before and I missed it so I looked at amazon to see if I can find one, and im happy that they have it here. I love the smell of it, its not the kind of fragrance that you will encounter everytime that&#x27;s why I love it, its very sophisticated and fancy smell  - just don&#x27;t apply too much, it lasted the whole day in just a very small spray.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful aroma! Think vanilla meeting brown sugar. Formerly, it was only available in Europe. This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Technically water... Not a good purchase. DO NOT BUY THIS. Scam all the way... Looks fake and it probably is...</li>
            <li> RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my husband, this is the only one I want him to wear. I use it also, and it smells awesome on me too. This seems to work with all body chemistrys, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Verry happy with my purchase ,like always&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ,I will be back soon</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS GOOD, BUT THE ALMOST TEN DOLLARS SHIPPING WAS EXHORBITANT.  NO ONE ASKED FOR EXPRESS OR PRIORITY MAIL SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it here as shops stop carrying it, but does not smell like the original, even the colour is so diferent!! FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell for men and women. This is my favourite perfume i got it as a gift few years back from my girlfriend she got the 2 back to back bottles for both of us. The smell is too sexy you can eat yourself after wearing this!! Would recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great fragrance</li>
            <li> Amazing sent for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;Formal&amp;#34; cologne. I wear it to all formal/business events. It&#x27;s subtle and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cologne</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast delivery.  It&#x27;s not strong as people says, it&#x27;s warm, sexy and powerful. Just Gaultier 2 😏</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS vanilla-based scent from master perfumer F. Kurkjian (creator of Le Male)....I have no idea why this was discontinued but I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s worth every penny and is class personified in a perfume.  if you like vanilla based cologne&#x27;s, this is a must-have for your collection.  EDP concentration means it&#x27;ll last all day.  10/10. Shipped quickly and securely by Amazon (sold by Amazon).  We can&#x27;t say enough in regard to how easy and fun this was, not to mention how much money we saved by going with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this scent on a co-worker and it was so nice, I bought a bottle for my husband. The scent lasts all day and is not musky or overpowering, just delicious! Plus, the bottle is huge. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This fragrance gets me compliments all the time. I&#x27;m a believer! I love this stuff and would recommend it highly to others!</li>
            <li> Smells good, its a perfume that i had liked a couple years back, glad i found it.</li>
            <li> Rough vanilla scent. Pleasant...? maybe... at some point. vanilla dominates in this one, but not that type of vanilla I like. They could have made it a bit more classier with some kind of &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; note to make it less harsh... Overall - it&#x27;s okay, good longevity, but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this fragrance totally blind, without ever having experienced it before, and I am endlessly happy with it! It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little bit like Jean Paul, Le Male... But not a lot. It replaces some of the dank, dark sexiness of Le Male with lighter, fruitier notes, making it amenable to the lady-wearer. Me? It&#x27;s my bed-scent. I wear it where poison we be obtrusive, and/or during the day.&lt;br /&gt;It is good, good, good. So good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you like Jean Paul Le Male on your man, you&#x27;ll like this on yourself. -And for the boys, since I do find this fragrance truly unisex...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good fit for say, a Spring afternoon, when you just wanna kick back w/ a beer at the lake... And do not plan to be charming pants off women-folk. At least not until later in the day;P</li>
            <li> Love it, it´s simple I love this perfume and has a very reasonable price! I bought it for my brother and I must have one too</li>
            <li> This is my twice Gaultier that i bought within 6 month. Was really concerned about if it was original or replica. Very proud of the prodcut and best price I can find anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Women love this scent. not overpowering smooth and semi sweet fragrance that will have her a a over you.</li>
