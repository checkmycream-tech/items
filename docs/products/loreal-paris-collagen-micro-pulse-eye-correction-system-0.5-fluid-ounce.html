            <li>This is the best eye cream EVER!  </li>
            <li>The vibration is very impressive.</li>
            <li>One of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Saw some of the great reviews for this one, so thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>The idea and concept of it is great</li>
            <li>I have not seen any great benefits from the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Great design.</li>
            <li>It is also GREAT as a all over face massager/toner &amp; for helping skin care products penetrate.</li>
            <li>I think the vibrations from the massager help with circulation and getting things flowing again - great idea by L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>This time I took before, during and after pictures which I am going to try to post, and if I am successful, you can judge for yourself.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>If felt good.  </li>
            <li>but like I said, it did feel good.  </li>
            <li>Hello, good morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she says she did not see any good results after using 2 months.</li>
            <li>The cream felt good on skin but no help with the eye area.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition, And in good time.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any diference, but the micor - pulse was a good design.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try at this great price!!</li>
            <li>you the BEST RESULTS ; )</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great price too.</li>
            <li>anyway, as I use the pulsator, I notice it kind of \\&quot;irons out\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and was given a sample of this product in exchange for my honest opinions of the products pros and cons.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s not greasy, has kind of a firming effect, so can be used morning under makeup or at night.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice though, it just didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li>was that it feels nice going on, does not look or feel greasy and it does not have any scent.</li>
            <li>What I like about the cream was that it feels nice going on, does not look or feel greasy and it does not have any scent.</li>
            <li>Trust me this cream really does work, awesome job L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Effective 4 skin care.</li>
            <li>Great price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The pulsing action is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>The pulse vibration &amp; cream formula are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at releaving puffiness &amp; darkness above/below the eye (even more so when used after allergy eye drops &amp;/or nasal decongestent since these products reduce pressure in this area).</li>
            <li>It make my eye area feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t pleased with it.</li>
            <li>BUT I have found another use for it that I love.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator.  </li>
            <li>While the cream itself applies smoothly and is a nice product, I have to wonder what the vibrating cap is for.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the cream and the micro pulse are superb and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>and this creates all kinds of lovely lines.)</li>
            <li>it makes them look better for the time being.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>It also makes the cream penetrate into the skin more.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>This gets rid of the bags better than anything I have ever used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely interesting..</li>
            <li>I found that cucumbers do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>, otherwise it would just stretch my skin in the eye area even more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
            <li>but what it did was creating more.</li>
            <li>work mostly nights</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d have been better off putting a ball on the end where the product comes off</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t see any changes, but it&#x27;s nice and light for use at bedtime</li>
            <li>Perhaps, an anti-aging under eye product would work better.</li>
            <li>The pricing in excellent an the effects are noticeable after 2 weeks of daily treatment.</li>
            <li>Product easy and safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy, the vibrator at the top does nothing to help spread the stuff in</li>
            <li>and so far I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li>Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye costs $19.99 and is available at most drugstores like CVS and Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Either way I do like the product and the cream lasts a good while because you do not have to use much.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S EASY  TO USE</li>
            <li>The mico-pulse is too strong and seems damaging instead of therapeutic.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in my fine lines for the month I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I see improvement at the beginning of the day but as the day wears on, horizontal fine lines and bags return.</li>
            <li>It felt great and was a nice way to start my day with a little pampering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics, but this product is not a must have for me.</li>
            <li>I received this free from BzzAgent to try.</li>
            <li>It felt cheap even though I spend 20 bucks on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Bzz agent so received this product for free to try out.</li>
            <li>I received this item for free as a BzzzAgent to sample.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because while the lotion is a nice product, the product as a whole doesn&#x27;t do what it says its supposed to.</li>
            <li>Why did they have to discontinue such a great product?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried and my eyes feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>this part of the device is made like a cheap toy.</li>
            <li>The cream does not go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>When I get home from work I get into comfortable clothes, wash off my makeup and use this cream and mini-massager to relax and un-puff my eyes -</li>
            <li>For reference: I&#x27;m a young lady with fair skin, so you can almost see under my skin, who works the night shift and falls asleep around 3am while waking around noon.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I like the vibrations and cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, 4 stars because I chose to use some time and got very good results in the eye area and my dark circles diminished.</li>
            <li>However, I did notice I got a significant increase in headaches during the time I used it.</li>
            <li>serum spread easily and absorbed well into my skin.</li>
            <li>The metallic ball is fun to use and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>The metallic ball is soothing to the skin because it&#x27;s so cool to the touch.     </li>
            <li>I will try using an intense eye serum and applying this eye cream over top.     </li>
            <li>Even if the massager is just a novelty part of the product, which is what I thought in the beginning, it is still cool.</li>
            <li>Even if the massager is just a novelty part of the product, which is what I thought in the beginning, it is still cool.</li>
            <li>cream is nice, smooth, non irritating and does a great job filling in the spots</li>
            <li>The thing was a good price considering several websites sell them for higer than 20 and change.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is fragrance free and very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Bought it with the hope to reduce my very first wrinkle (I&#x27;m 23 btw)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure whether the product reduces the lines, but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t too exciting -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that it is worth the retail price of $19.99, I would purchase the product again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that it is worth the retail price of $19.99, I would purchase the product again</li>
            <li>The actual product is nice.  </li>
            <li>seen a very positive review on Amazon and this caused me to want to try</li>
            <li>It dispenses just right.     </li>
            <li>The difference was not drastic right away</li>
            <li>- just got to remember to use it in the right direction</li>
            <li>have tried many, many eye creams, and this is the first one that&#x27;s worked for both un-puffing and lightening the dark circles -</li>
            <li>and I really had no bad issues with the eye cream and no allergic reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really had no bad issues with the eye cream and no allergic reaction to it.    </li>
            <li>The cream itself is soft and it glides on easily.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Loreal for make such a nice product.</li>
            <li>This two step under eye treatment definitely gives great results if it is used on a consistent and regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I have a very good sleep schedule and am never overly stressed or tired</li>
            <li>But this too, left me wanting more.     </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and really love how the micro pulse reduces fluid in the undereye area.  </li>
            <li>bought the ROC product first.  </li>
            <li>It really works and the eye cream is non irritant!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye cream</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>The skin surrounding my eyes is now extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The skin surrounding my eyes is now extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first time .</li>
            <li>Looks like it works first week out.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my eyes exactly with the direction</li>
            <li>I will be back for more, when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Most regular stores don&#x27;t sell them in bulk like that.</li>
            <li>Loreal, go back to the original formula, Please!</li>
            <li>Loreal makes very high quality products at very affordable prices.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>Really helps with under and around the eye.  </li>
            <li>I doubt I would pay this much for something like this.  </li>
            <li>Using the micro pulse applicator is very rejuvenating.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating roller for the eye area is very relaxing, you can feel it increase circulation in the eye area and see immediate results.  </li>
            <li>really receive two products in one.  </li>
            <li>Micro-Pulse is a gentle massager that leaves your eyes feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really see them.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really have bags under my eyes or puffiness.</li>
            <li>I am very dissappointed about the experience.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I felt that it really didn&#x27;t do anything to improve my eyes.</li>
            <li>-(&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal makes some wonderful beauty and cosmetics products, but I&#x27;m afraid this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li>The vibrator thing does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>Did I really expect a miracle?</li>
            <li>it did absolutely nothing to me...</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>Not really too much of a surprise, most products don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>the plus side: I have very sensitive skin and suffer with atopic dermatitis and eczema, and the one thing I can say about this product is that it was very gentle on my skin and caused no allergic reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I love the micro pulse and would use it with other creams.  </li>
            <li>When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better.  </li>
            <li>but it just created more wrinkles for me, maybe due to the auto-massage mode.</li>
            <li>By putting a tiny piece of paper folded in half under the battery, it met the connection perfectly and I was able to finish the cream, and finish an another eye cream that I had a little left until my new L&#x27;Oreal eye product arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The product is fine, and I noticed a certain tightness right away after it dried up.  </li>
            <li>Now, I use the product maybe once a day, since im lazy, and it still does a nice job keeping the circles at bay.</li>
            <li>Its OK still have dark marks under my eye but helps....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better as something that fills in the wrinkles and creases than it is at reducing puffiness or reducing dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Now please create something for dark spots on the face better known as \\&quot;</li>
            <li>Less darkening under eye area and a smoother more vibrate look in the eye area.</li>
            <li>That seems to be working better, but it&#x27;s been less than a week.</li>
            <li>I found that this eye cream went on smoothly, absorbed fast and my entire eye area felt mositurized.  </li>
            <li>At 67, I am very fortunate to have few lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I did try to request to have it return, but it is worth it to spend extra $6.95 shipping to return it.</li>
            <li>I am not even faithfully using it every day, but it is helping firm and smooth this area!  </li>
            <li>I loved this product, I always have puffy, tired eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is something new.</li>
            <li>I got a chance to try this new L&#x27;Oreal product for myself this week courtesy of a website called Bzzagent ([...]).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product comes with a vibrating cap that is supposed to help reduce fine lines, wrinkles and dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li>The cream is non greasy, and makes the area feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the cream formula doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has been my experience with sensitive skin that collagen agravates it and causes breakouts!</li>
            <li>the 5th is removed for the silly, bulky rattling thing on the end.  :P</li>
            <li>It is absorbed very fast and the little massage thingy is neat</li>
            <li>and always before an important event when I need a little lift under the eye.  </li>
            <li>The lines are much softer and don&#x27;t feel like an actual slice in my face.</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried so far has.</li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive to eye products, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with this cream.  </li>
            <li>I used this product mostly hoping to get rid of or at least make my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes temporarily disappear.</li>
            <li>AND MAKES MY SKIN  FEEL SOFT AND  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the &amp;#34;micro-pulse massager&amp;#34; seems to be nothing more than a gimmick (at least, to me) - it&#x27;s supposed to reduce under eye bags and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>so you can just roll it on directly.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;micro-pulsation\\&quot; is nothing more than a small silver rounded tip that barely vibrates.</li>
            <li>But I purchased this because it seemed like it could be a good product, and at $14 on Amazon, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive of a risk to take.</li>
            <li>After just over 2 months of using the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse Correction System, I would say that my condition has improved up to a 5 and it still is slowly getting better.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating end, used from inner to outer corners of the eyes (repeat more than once), is supposed to help flush the excess fluid down the lymphatic system.  </li>
            <li>After only a few days of using the first time I bought it even my husband took notice that my dark circles were not so prominent.  </li>
            <li>The product had no negative side effects such as stinging, peeling or redness.</li>
            <li>The product had no negative side effects such as stinging, peeling or redness.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it was just new packaging, but the formula is different.</li>
            <li>This is not the original product line that I have purchased in the past..</li>
            <li>Not bad as long as you are careful not to get it inside your eyes!</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for the long term benefits if I can develop the discipline to use it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a minute or two for each complete treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty severe dark circles</li>
            <li>It barely worked this time.</li>
            <li>Barely moves.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t  make my eye area worse, but I have not noticed any noticeable changes.</li>
            <li>The vibrations were nice, but seemed silly.</li>
            <li>Been using this product consistently for about 3 months, and i don&#x27;t see even a slight change.</li>
            <li>for my results:  Generally I give a hair/skin product at least 2 full months to see any results.  </li>
            <li>I am 34 years old and so far I have no real wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I find it VERY soothing for tired eyes, facial muscle stress/tension, mild stress/sinus headaches.</li>
            <li>like the pulse part, but don&#x27;t really see a difference of my dark circles after a month of use</li>
            <li>I notice it is now easier to conceal the circles, I use less concealer and they cover much easier.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used the micro-pulse, I only used it on one side for comparison.  </li>
            <li>feels ok if your eyes are tired after a long day though.</li>
            <li>My main eye problem is the dark circles and this product</li>
            <li>Combined with applying the cream as directed, it was a pure waste of $16 and 5 minutes of my day.</li>
            <li>Not too much, not too little.</li>

            <li> I think the vibrations from the massager help with circulation and getting things flowing again - great idea by L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> This time I took before, during and after pictures which I am going to try to post, and if I am successful, you can judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li> Good Product.  </li>
            <li> If felt good.  </li>
            <li> but like I said, it did feel good.  </li>
            <li> Hello, good morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she says she did not see any good results after using 2 months.</li>
            <li> The cream felt good on skin but no help with the eye area.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition, And in good time.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any diference, but the micor - pulse was a good design.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the try at this great price!!</li>
            <li> you the BEST RESULTS ; )</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great price too.</li>
            <li> anyway, as I use the pulsator, I notice it kind of \\&quot;irons out\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and was given a sample of this product in exchange for my honest opinions of the products pros and cons.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not greasy, has kind of a firming effect, so can be used morning under makeup or at night.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice though, it just didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li> was that it feels nice going on, does not look or feel greasy and it does not have any scent.</li>
            <li> What I like about the cream was that it feels nice going on, does not look or feel greasy and it does not have any scent.</li>
            <li> Trust me this cream really does work, awesome job L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Effective 4 skin care.</li>
            <li> Great price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The pulsing action is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> The pulse vibration &amp; cream formula are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at releaving puffiness &amp; darkness above/below the eye (even more so when used after allergy eye drops &amp;/or nasal decongestent since these products reduce pressure in this area).</li>
            <li> It make my eye area feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t pleased with it.</li>
            <li> BUT I have found another use for it that I love.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator.  </li>
            <li> While the cream itself applies smoothly and is a nice product, I have to wonder what the vibrating cap is for.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think the cream and the micro pulse are superb and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> and this creates all kinds of lovely lines.)</li>
            <li> it makes them look better for the time being.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> It also makes the cream penetrate into the skin more.  </li>
            <li> Its ok.  </li>
            <li> This gets rid of the bags better than anything I have ever used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely interesting..</li>
            <li> I found that cucumbers do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> , otherwise it would just stretch my skin in the eye area even more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
            <li> but what it did was creating more.</li>
            <li> work mostly nights</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d have been better off putting a ball on the end where the product comes off</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t see any changes, but it&#x27;s nice and light for use at bedtime</li>
            <li> Perhaps, an anti-aging under eye product would work better.</li>
            <li> The pricing in excellent an the effects are noticeable after 2 weeks of daily treatment.</li>
            <li> Product easy and safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy, the vibrator at the top does nothing to help spread the stuff in</li>
            <li> and so far I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye costs $19.99 and is available at most drugstores like CVS and Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Either way I do like the product and the cream lasts a good while because you do not have to use much.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S EASY  TO USE</li>
            <li> The mico-pulse is too strong and seems damaging instead of therapeutic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in my fine lines for the month I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I see improvement at the beginning of the day but as the day wears on, horizontal fine lines and bags return.</li>
            <li> It felt great and was a nice way to start my day with a little pampering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics, but this product is not a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to try.</li>
            <li> It felt cheap even though I spend 20 bucks on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Bzz agent so received this product for free to try out.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free as a BzzzAgent to sample.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because while the lotion is a nice product, the product as a whole doesn&#x27;t do what it says its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Why did they have to discontinue such a great product?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and my eyes feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> this part of the device is made like a cheap toy.</li>
            <li> The cream does not go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> When I get home from work I get into comfortable clothes, wash off my makeup and use this cream and mini-massager to relax and un-puff my eyes -</li>
            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m a young lady with fair skin, so you can almost see under my skin, who works the night shift and falls asleep around 3am while waking around noon.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I like the vibrations and cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, 4 stars because I chose to use some time and got very good results in the eye area and my dark circles diminished.</li>
            <li> However, I did notice I got a significant increase in headaches during the time I used it.</li>
            <li> serum spread easily and absorbed well into my skin.</li>
            <li> The metallic ball is fun to use and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> The metallic ball is soothing to the skin because it&#x27;s so cool to the touch.     </li>
            <li> I will try using an intense eye serum and applying this eye cream over top.     </li>
            <li> Even if the massager is just a novelty part of the product, which is what I thought in the beginning, it is still cool.</li>
            <li> Even if the massager is just a novelty part of the product, which is what I thought in the beginning, it is still cool.</li>
            <li> cream is nice, smooth, non irritating and does a great job filling in the spots</li>
            <li> The thing was a good price considering several websites sell them for higer than 20 and change.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is fragrance free and very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Bought it with the hope to reduce my very first wrinkle (I&#x27;m 23 btw)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure whether the product reduces the lines, but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t too exciting -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that it is worth the retail price of $19.99, I would purchase the product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that it is worth the retail price of $19.99, I would purchase the product again</li>
            <li> The actual product is nice.  </li>
            <li> seen a very positive review on Amazon and this caused me to want to try</li>
            <li> It dispenses just right.     </li>
            <li> The difference was not drastic right away</li>
            <li> - just got to remember to use it in the right direction</li>
            <li> have tried many, many eye creams, and this is the first one that&#x27;s worked for both un-puffing and lightening the dark circles -</li>
            <li> and I really had no bad issues with the eye cream and no allergic reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really had no bad issues with the eye cream and no allergic reaction to it.    </li>
            <li> The cream itself is soft and it glides on easily.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Loreal for make such a nice product.</li>
            <li> This two step under eye treatment definitely gives great results if it is used on a consistent and regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I have a very good sleep schedule and am never overly stressed or tired</li>
            <li> But this too, left me wanting more.     </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and really love how the micro pulse reduces fluid in the undereye area.  </li>
            <li> bought the ROC product first.  </li>
            <li> It really works and the eye cream is non irritant!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first day I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye cream</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> The skin surrounding my eyes is now extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The skin surrounding my eyes is now extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first time .</li>
            <li> Looks like it works first week out.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my eyes exactly with the direction</li>
            <li> I will be back for more, when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Most regular stores don&#x27;t sell them in bulk like that.</li>
            <li> Loreal, go back to the original formula, Please!</li>
            <li> Loreal makes very high quality products at very affordable prices.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Really helps with under and around the eye.  </li>
            <li> I doubt I would pay this much for something like this.  </li>
            <li> Using the micro pulse applicator is very rejuvenating.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating roller for the eye area is very relaxing, you can feel it increase circulation in the eye area and see immediate results.  </li>
            <li> really receive two products in one.  </li>
            <li> Micro-Pulse is a gentle massager that leaves your eyes feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really see them.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really have bags under my eyes or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am very dissappointed about the experience.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I felt that it really didn&#x27;t do anything to improve my eyes.</li>
            <li> -(&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal makes some wonderful beauty and cosmetics products, but I&#x27;m afraid this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li> The vibrator thing does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> Did I really expect a miracle?</li>
            <li> it did absolutely nothing to me...</li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Not really too much of a surprise, most products don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> the plus side: I have very sensitive skin and suffer with atopic dermatitis and eczema, and the one thing I can say about this product is that it was very gentle on my skin and caused no allergic reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I love the micro pulse and would use it with other creams.  </li>
            <li> When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better.  </li>
            <li> but it just created more wrinkles for me, maybe due to the auto-massage mode.</li>
            <li> By putting a tiny piece of paper folded in half under the battery, it met the connection perfectly and I was able to finish the cream, and finish an another eye cream that I had a little left until my new L&#x27;Oreal eye product arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The product is fine, and I noticed a certain tightness right away after it dried up.  </li>
            <li> Now, I use the product maybe once a day, since im lazy, and it still does a nice job keeping the circles at bay.</li>
            <li> Its OK still have dark marks under my eye but helps....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better as something that fills in the wrinkles and creases than it is at reducing puffiness or reducing dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Now please create something for dark spots on the face better known as \\&quot;</li>
            <li> Less darkening under eye area and a smoother more vibrate look in the eye area.</li>
            <li> That seems to be working better, but it&#x27;s been less than a week.</li>
            <li> I found that this eye cream went on smoothly, absorbed fast and my entire eye area felt mositurized.  </li>
            <li> At 67, I am very fortunate to have few lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I did try to request to have it return, but it is worth it to spend extra $6.95 shipping to return it.</li>
            <li> I am not even faithfully using it every day, but it is helping firm and smooth this area!  </li>
            <li> I loved this product, I always have puffy, tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is something new.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try this new L&#x27;Oreal product for myself this week courtesy of a website called Bzzagent ([...]).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product comes with a vibrating cap that is supposed to help reduce fine lines, wrinkles and dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> The cream is non greasy, and makes the area feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the cream formula doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has been my experience with sensitive skin that collagen agravates it and causes breakouts!</li>
            <li> the 5th is removed for the silly, bulky rattling thing on the end.  :P</li>
            <li> It is absorbed very fast and the little massage thingy is neat</li>
            <li> and always before an important event when I need a little lift under the eye.  </li>
            <li> The lines are much softer and don&#x27;t feel like an actual slice in my face.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve tried so far has.</li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to eye products, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with this cream.  </li>
            <li> I used this product mostly hoping to get rid of or at least make my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes temporarily disappear.</li>
            <li> AND MAKES MY SKIN  FEEL SOFT AND  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the &amp;#34;micro-pulse massager&amp;#34; seems to be nothing more than a gimmick (at least, to me) - it&#x27;s supposed to reduce under eye bags and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> so you can just roll it on directly.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;micro-pulsation\\&quot; is nothing more than a small silver rounded tip that barely vibrates.</li>
            <li> But I purchased this because it seemed like it could be a good product, and at $14 on Amazon, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive of a risk to take.</li>
            <li> After just over 2 months of using the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse Correction System, I would say that my condition has improved up to a 5 and it still is slowly getting better.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating end, used from inner to outer corners of the eyes (repeat more than once), is supposed to help flush the excess fluid down the lymphatic system.  </li>
            <li> After only a few days of using the first time I bought it even my husband took notice that my dark circles were not so prominent.  </li>
            <li> The product had no negative side effects such as stinging, peeling or redness.</li>
            <li> The product had no negative side effects such as stinging, peeling or redness.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it was just new packaging, but the formula is different.</li>
            <li> This is not the original product line that I have purchased in the past..</li>
            <li> Not bad as long as you are careful not to get it inside your eyes!</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for the long term benefits if I can develop the discipline to use it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a minute or two for each complete treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty severe dark circles</li>
            <li> It barely worked this time.</li>
            <li> Barely moves.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t  make my eye area worse, but I have not noticed any noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> The vibrations were nice, but seemed silly.</li>
            <li> Been using this product consistently for about 3 months, and i don&#x27;t see even a slight change.</li>
            <li> for my results:  Generally I give a hair/skin product at least 2 full months to see any results.  </li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and so far I have no real wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I find it VERY soothing for tired eyes, facial muscle stress/tension, mild stress/sinus headaches.</li>
            <li> like the pulse part, but don&#x27;t really see a difference of my dark circles after a month of use</li>
            <li> I notice it is now easier to conceal the circles, I use less concealer and they cover much easier.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the micro-pulse, I only used it on one side for comparison.  </li>
            <li> feels ok if your eyes are tired after a long day though.</li>
            <li> My main eye problem is the dark circles and this product</li>
            <li> Combined with applying the cream as directed, it was a pure waste of $16 and 5 minutes of my day.</li>
            <li> Not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t contain appreciable amounts of any active compounds, which is disappointing since I think L&#x27;Oreal really could do better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old male and I purchased this for the sole purpose of dark circles that I&#x27;ve had since I was about 12.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28yrs old with dark circles, I</li>
            <li> It says to apply small dots of the cream under my eyes and to gently pat the cream in.</li>
            <li> This facial products should be use for a long time until you see any results</li>
            <li> The pulse strength becomes inconsistant, &amp; finally, too weak to do anything useful.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review until I gave the product enough time to do what it claims, but I just do not see any difference - the dark circles are still the same</li>
            <li> I used the micro-pulse attachment one time, but saw how it was tugging at the skin under my eyes, and since that could be detrimental long term, I resorted to using the serum w/o the micro-pulse attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it long because all it was, was a vibrating stick.</li>
            <li> but I still apply creams because I would like to keep wrinkles away as long as I can.</li>
            <li> The deep marks that run from my nose to the sides of my mouth have gotten deeper over the years, I think mostly due to gravity.</li>
            <li> It seems to help reduce the puffiness for a bit, my eyes get puffy again but it could be because they only get puffy due to allergies.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li> with 2 weeks I saw a big difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I started off using this as directed and my dark circles were actually fading, to my surprise.</li>
            <li> So my dark circle causes may be different from others causes.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye total eye correction system is a 2 step product that promises to fade dark under-eye circles and wrinkles while eliminating puffiness and bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am constantly trying every home remedy and \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; eye cream that is created in an attempt to combat the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had massive sinus surgery, &amp; have allergies, insomnia, &amp; hereditary dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> This actually helps reduce my dark shadows.</li>
            <li> The original was a cream base and very concentrated and this is a lotion.</li>
            <li> I typically spend more on my eye creams and I was skeptical that something in this price range would work as well as what I typically purchase.   </li>
            <li> on a scale of 1 - 10, with the number 1 being the best, and 10 the worst, my purple eye circles and eye bags were probably an 8, due to my age, countless hours on the computer, late nights and rubbing my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The Garnier worked better, the puffiness wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad, though the circles were still dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks now and the results are minimal.</li>
            <li> I was curious about it and wondered how it would work with the pulsing device.  </li>
            <li> Not much  improvement.  </li>
            <li> You can refill the tube w cream of choice when empty too.</li>
            <li> It needs to be made so that only the battery comes out, &amp; the curcuit connector piece w wires &amp; control button are firmly secured to prevent damage to the curcuit.&lt;br /&gt;Wishing</li>
            <li> Lots of bulk for no real payoff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful ladies.</li>
            <li> The difference was subtle, but I absolutely saw a slight reduction in puffiness, creases, and dark circles under the treated eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the lotion though, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It did not sting my skin like other products have.     </li>
            <li> Continued to use the product but never really saw any change to my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on one eye with the Garnier on the other for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The Garnier was thrown in the drawer with the other failures.  </li>
            <li> There is never any stinging, burning or any irritation regarding your eyes, a problem that I have had with other eye</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of the other reviews on this product, I just had to comment.  </li>
            <li> What you get in the package is a tube that contains .5 fl oz of eye cream on one side and a micro pulse massager on the other.</li>
            <li> I hadnt expected much since I&#x27;d tried other treatments before that failed.</li>
            <li> The cream&#x27;s active ingredients are Erasyl which helps minimize dark circles and Collagen which smooths wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My dark circles and puffiness are still there.  </li>
            <li> so I think the dark circles must be hereditary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the dark circles under my eyes are already lightening up.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it didn&#x27;t 100% make my dark circles go away.  </li>
            <li> These days who can afford expensive creams, this product really delivers.</li>
            <li> This is designed to combat puffiness with the vibrating end, and dark circles with the cream.  </li>
            <li> They are not so dark that I cannot cover them with concealer</li>
            <li> Hope it work for the puffiness and dark circle under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any all-around under eye smoothness as the product promises (I also took a pic the day I started and compared it with a pic I just took today after almost 2 weeks use - no difference between the two pics at all, unfortunately).  </li>
            <li> I work with two 20&amp;#34; computer monitors in my face all day, which leads to eye fatigue, dark circles and puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> I received a broken, old, mildew battery, opened box package.</li>
            <li> less that a week and a half my purplish dark under eye circles started to lighten.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the bags under my eyes are the size of your typical piece of carry-on luggage.  </li>
            <li> but it was a slight improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was a slight improvement.    </li>
            <li> and yes, the dark circles were a little bit lighter.</li>
            <li> It seems to make them a little less noticeable and severe.</li>
            <li> this product definitely reduces thin lines and dark circles, it just needs time till the effect appears and must use everyday</li>
            <li> I use the massager when my eyes are puffy which usually happens due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I use it especially when I&#x27;m tired and need a lift.</li>
            <li> I know that I will continue to use this, but it has been harder to find of late.</li>
            <li> The product seems gimmicky to me.</li>
            <li> Returned after only 1 use - made the bags under my eyes worse.</li>
            <li> nice eye cream does reduce puffiness, but wtf is up with that stupid vibrator at the other end?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small &amp; portable.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER; once the battery case is opened, the control button &amp; metal piece that completes the curcuit fall out, are VERY DIFFICULT get back into the case properly.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo is doing something!  </li>
            <li> A lot of those who gave this a bad review don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s for, so they certainly don&#x27;t have the issue that this is designed to correct.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles have decreased a little.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, the darkness has faded, the small lines at the corners of my eyes have lessened and within 30 minutes of use, the puffiness is almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, some quite expensive, and have gone back to this.  </li>
            <li> It adds a lot of length to the package and it sounds like 3 small BB style balls rattling around inside it.  </li>
            <li> have really bad dark circles under my eyes which is probably due to working very long hours on the computer</li>
            <li> Instead of getting rid of puffy eyes, it made mine much worse and gave me dark circles.</li>
            <li> The battery in the micro-pulse lasts approximately two months before it starts running down.  </li>
            <li> These two things work together to revitalize tired dark and dull eyes.</li>
            <li> Does not work  at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Negative:    </li>
            <li> This gives you the same results as cold compresses but in seconds instead of minutes.  </li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I have been obsessed for years with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have learned the hard way to avoid it!</li>
            <li> it looks like a sex toy, and i felt really dumb massaging my eye socket with it</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> and they get even worse when I lose sleep which is quite often since I suffer from insomnia.</li>
            <li> My poor eyes experience a lot of eyestrain and it shows.</li>
            <li> SHARE this secret with all your friends.</li>
            <li> so my eyes get too tired...</li>
            <li> also relieves the &#x27;tired eyes ache&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have those things, but I&#x27;d still be wary of using it.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not managed to use it twice a day as recommended to start seeing long-term results.  </li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable to use it, I feel  it is fake.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations :</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s silly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry!</li>
            <li> If I have any wrinkles they are very faint</li>
            <li> I suffer from bad seasonal allergies and my eyes always look puffy this time of year.  </li>
            <li> i have bad under eyes and was looking forward for this product</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars for making me feel stupid.</li>
            <li> One thing that is slightly annoying is the fact that the applicator sometimes turns off when I am using it, from the vibrations.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I notice that in the morning when the lines around my eyes are the worst</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not the original product line that I have purchased in the past.. This is something new. I was hoping that it was just new packaging, but the formula is different. The original was a cream base and very concentrated and this is a lotion. Did not live up to it&#x27;s expectations. Loreal, go back to the original formula, Please!</li>
            <li> this product definitely reduces thin lines and dark circles, it just needs time till the effect appears and must use everyday</li>
            <li> It has been my experience with sensitive skin that collagen agravates it and causes breakouts! Have learned the hard way to avoid it!</li>
            <li> It is opened when I received it! If i have enough time, I WILL DEFINITELY return it back! I&#x27;m angry!</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to try. I used the micro-pulse attachment one time, but saw how it was tugging at the skin under my eyes, and since that could be detrimental long term, I resorted to using the serum w/o the micro-pulse attachment.&lt;br /&gt;The serum spread easily and absorbed well into my skin. It was compatible with my cosmetics, and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in my fine lines for the month I&#x27;ve been using it. The formula isn&#x27;t too exciting - it doesn&#x27;t contain appreciable amounts of any active compounds, which is disappointing since I think L&#x27;Oreal really could do better. I&#x27;m a huge fan of L&#x27;Oreal cosmetics, but this product is not a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I have been obsessed for years with the dark circles under my eyes. I have tried numerous products with no results. Saw some of the great reviews for this one, so thought I would try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and I don&#x27;t see one tiny bit of difference in the appearance of my under eye area. However, I did notice I got a significant increase in headaches during the time I used it. Stopped using it - no headaches. It does have warnings on the box about not using the product if you have migraines, sinusitis, etc. I didn&#x27;t have those things, but I&#x27;d still be wary of using it.     The \\&quot;micro-pulsation\\&quot; is nothing more than a small silver rounded tip that barely vibrates. Combined with applying the cream as directed, it was a pure waste of $16 and 5 minutes of my day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it long because all it was, was a vibrating stick. I don&#x27;t know, I just wasn&#x27;t pleased with it. It felt cheap even though I spend 20 bucks on it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of this.  It seems to help a bit.  The metallic ball is fun to use and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> Does not work  at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years on and off. At 67, I am very fortunate to have few lines or wrinkles. I&#x27;m not really sure whether the product reduces the lines, but it sure feels good. I use it especially when I&#x27;m tired and need a lift.BUT I have found another use for it that I love. The deep marks that run from my nose to the sides of my mouth have gotten deeper over the years, I think mostly due to gravity. I have been using this product intermittently for nine months, and here I do see a difference. The lines are much softer and don&#x27;t feel like an actual slice in my face. I know that I will continue to use this, but it has been harder to find of late. Walgreens doesn&#x27;t have it in-store or on-line. Amazon is the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried so far has. But this too, left me wanting more.     There were some positives:    1. It did not sting my skin like other products have.     2. The product is easy to dispense. Not too much, not too little. It dispenses just right.     3. The metallic ball is soothing to the skin because it&#x27;s so cool to the touch.     4. The pulsing action is AWESOME! That&#x27;s the best part. In fact, it was so soothing, I held it on my eyes for longer than the prescribed time of 3-4 minutes. It feels like a mini massage for the eyes.     Negative:    5. It doesn&#x27;t work. I still have dark circles under my eyes. Which is a big deal.     My search continues because Loreal Micropulse just did not work for me.       *This product was received as part of my Bzagent status.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for the last three weeks.  Unfortunately, I have not managed to use it twice a day as recommended to start seeing long-term results.  I do, however, see immediate results when I use it in the morning and evening.  The first few times I used the micro-pulse, I only used it on one side for comparison.  The difference was subtle, but I absolutely saw a slight reduction in puffiness, creases, and dark circles under the treated eye.  The cream itself is soft and it glides on easily.  I tend to be sensitive to eye products, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with this cream.  I have high hopes for the long term benefits if I can develop the discipline to use it twice a day.  It only takes a minute or two for each complete treatment.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll continue to use it when I can and always before an important event when I need a little lift under the eye.  I did receive my full-size sample as a BzzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Really helps with under and around the eye.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, I always have puffy, tired eyes.  I used it last night and woke up this morning and I felt so refreshed. No puffiness at all.  Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Bzz agent so received this product for free to try out. I doubt I would pay this much for something like this.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks now and the results are minimal. The idea and concept of it is great and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t  make my eye area worse, but I have not noticed any noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator.  Using the micro pulse applicator is very rejuvenating.  It make my eye area feel very smooth.  I have not seen any great benefits from the eye cream.  My dark circles and puffiness are still there.  The cream applies and absorbs well.  Does not irritate my eyes.  Bottom line, I love the micro pulse and would use it with other creams.  I will try using an intense eye serum and applying this eye cream over top.     I received this product to try and review.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference in my skin after use.</li>
            <li> This product swelled my eyes. Instead of getting rid of puffy eyes, it made mine much worse and gave me dark circles. The mico-pulse is too strong and seems damaging instead of therapeutic.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzz Agent and received Loreal Collagen Micro-Pulse(tm) Eye as a Bzz Campaign.  I was very impressed by the product.  The vibrating roller for the eye area is very relaxing, you can feel it increase circulation in the eye area and see immediate results.  Less darkening under eye area and a smoother more vibrate look in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free as a BzzzAgent to sample. This product comes with a vibrating cap that is supposed to help reduce fine lines, wrinkles and dark circles under your eyes. While the cream itself applies smoothly and is a nice product, I have to wonder what the vibrating cap is for. I used this product for 6 weeks and noticed no difference in my under eye circles, lines or wrinkles. The product seems gimmicky to me. I gave it 3 stars because while the lotion is a nice product, the product as a whole doesn&#x27;t do what it says its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Not great.  The massager quit running before the product ran out.  Continued to use the product but never really saw any change to my dark circles.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have just started using my second tube, and I must say, I like using it. The puffiness under my eyes is gone. The dark circles have decreased a little. I think the crepe under my eyes is also reduced. I also like the way the pulse feels under my eyes. The cream is non greasy, and makes the area feel very soft. One thing that is slightly annoying is the fact that the applicator sometimes turns off when I am using it, from the vibrations. But it has lasted well past my first tube, so that&#x27;s a plus. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old male and I purchased this for the sole purpose of dark circles that I&#x27;ve had since I was about 12. I have a very good sleep schedule and am never overly stressed or tired so I think the dark circles must be hereditary. But I purchased this because it seemed like it could be a good product, and at $14 on Amazon, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive of a risk to take. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the dark circles under my eyes are already lightening up.</li>
            <li> I received Loreal Collagen Micro Pulse from Bzz agent to review.  I have been using it for a month and really love how the micro pulse reduces fluid in the undereye area.  I suffer from bad seasonal allergies and my eyes always look puffy this time of year.  This gives you the same results as cold compresses but in seconds instead of minutes.  I use it twice a day and will continue using it.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it didn&#x27;t 100% make my dark circles go away.  But in all fairness I have yet to find a cream in any price range to do this.  Overall, I think the cream and the micro pulse are superb and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Loreal makes very high quality products at very affordable prices.  These days who can afford expensive creams, this product really delivers.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream EVER!  After only a few days of using the first time I bought it even my husband took notice that my dark circles were not so prominent.  Now that&#x27;s how you know something works - when you husband takes notice.  Why did they have to discontinue such a great product?  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I used this product mostly hoping to get rid of or at least make my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes temporarily disappear. I use the cream and pulsator in the morning when I wake up and at night before I go to bed as the instructions say. I notice that in the morning when the lines around my eyes are the worst (I think when I sleep on my side I smoosh my face and this creates all kinds of lovely lines.) anyway, as I use the pulsator, I notice it kind of \\&quot;irons out\\&quot; my lines. It seems to make them a little less noticeable and severe. I don&#x27;t know that it is a permanent solution, but I like that it makes them look better for the time being.  I am a BzzAgent and was given a sample of this product in exchange for my honest opinions of the products pros and cons.</li>
            <li> I received this product to try from bzz agent. I was curious about it and wondered how it would work with the pulsing device.  I typically spend more on my eye creams and I was skeptical that something in this price range would work as well as what I typically purchase.   I was pleasantly suprised.  I found that this eye cream went on smoothly, absorbed fast and my entire eye area felt mositurized.  I did not have any issues with the pulser.  I actually enjoyed it.  If felt good.  I don&#x27;t know what affect using it had on the eye cream but like I said, it did feel good.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> like the pulse part, but don&#x27;t really see a difference of my dark circles after a month of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48, have chronic insomnia, work at a computer all day and don&#x27;t drink enough water.  That being said, the bags under my eyes are the size of your typical piece of carry-on luggage.  Over the last six months, I&#x27;ve tried four types of \\&quot;anti-puff\\&quot;, \\&quot;anti-dark circles\\&quot; and \\&quot;serums\\&quot;:  ROC Retinol Correction Eye Cream, Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roll-On, Clinique All About Eyes Serum and last month, I bought and tried L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye Correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ROC product first.  I followed all the directions and used it every day.  I saw no change at all.  Then I got the Garnier product.  It seemed to work somewhat.  When I got the trial size Clinique product, I used the Garnier on one eye and the Clinique on the other, just to see which product worked better.  The Garnier worked better, the puffiness wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad, though the circles were still dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on shopping trip at Ulta, looking for eye makeup remover, I stumbled on the L&#x27;Oreal product.  It was around $12 and I had a 50% off of any product coupon.  I&#x27;ve been using it on one eye with the Garnier on the other for two weeks.  The Garnier was thrown in the drawer with the other failures.  This product works.  After two weeks, the darkness has faded, the small lines at the corners of my eyes have lessened and within 30 minutes of use, the puffiness is almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product consistently for about 3 months, and i don&#x27;t see even a slight change. I&#x27;m 28yrs old with dark circles, I</li>
            <li> I kept this in the fridge and would use it every morning.  It felt great and was a nice way to start my day with a little pampering.  However - the results - I&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li> Thanks Loreal for make such a nice product. Great design. Easy to use and great price too. This facial products should be use for a long time until you see any results but this one...with 2 weeks I saw a big difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This two step under eye treatment definitely gives great results if it is used on a consistent and regular basis.  I use it twice a day every day, and I only spend one minute per eye each session.&lt;br /&gt;Your really receive two products in one.  The micro-pulse eye massager and the cream. The eye cream is fragrance free and very gentle.  There is never any stinging, burning or any irritation regarding your eyes, a problem that I have had with other eye creams.&lt;br /&gt;The Micro-Pulse is a gentle massager that leaves your eyes feeling refreshed.  The battery in the micro-pulse lasts approximately two months before it starts running down.  The cream lasted me a week longer, so although they state not to replace the battery, I did replace it with a button battery #AG13 357.  By putting a tiny piece of paper folded in half under the battery, it met the connection perfectly and I was able to finish the cream, and finish an another eye cream that I had a little left until my new L&#x27;Oreal eye product arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Now for my results:  Generally I give a hair/skin product at least 2 full months to see any results.  If in that time I don&#x27;t see any results, I give up on the product because I don&#x27;t think that it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;In less that a week and a half my purplish dark under eye circles started to lighten.  At the 3 week mark, there was a definite tightening in the saggy eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;Now on a scale of 1 - 10, with the number 1 being the best, and 10 the worst, my purple eye circles and eye bags were probably an 8, due to my age, countless hours on the computer, late nights and rubbing my eyes.  After just over 2 months of using the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse Correction System, I would say that my condition has improved up to a 5 and it still is slowly getting better.  This time I took before, during and after pictures which I am going to try to post, and if I am successful, you can judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> nice eye cream does reduce puffiness, but wtf is up with that stupid vibrator at the other end? it looks like a sex toy, and i felt really dumb massaging my eye socket with it, i felt that it belonged on another place of my body so i tossed it. I give this product 3 stars for making me feel stupid.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe dark circles and I will be the first to admit that I tend to get lazy when it comes to following a routine.  I started off using this as directed and my dark circles were actually fading, to my surprise. I hadnt expected much since I&#x27;d tried other treatments before that failed. Now, I use the product maybe once a day, since im lazy, and it still does a nice job keeping the circles at bay. I will admit I stopped using this product for a couple weeks, and the circles came back with a vengeance. For reference: I&#x27;m a young lady with fair skin, so you can almost see under my skin, who works the night shift and falls asleep around 3am while waking around noon. So my dark circle causes may be different from others causes.</li>
            <li> It really works and the eye cream is non irritant!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye Correction System produced no visible results in my case after using the system for six weeks</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of the other reviews on this product, I just had to comment.  A lot of those who gave this a bad review don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s for, so they certainly don&#x27;t have the issue that this is designed to correct.  The vibrating end is for UNDER-EYE BAGS AND PUFFINESS, and it works!  This is designed to combat puffiness with the vibrating end, and dark circles with the cream.  The vibrating end, used from inner to outer corners of the eyes (repeat more than once), is supposed to help flush the excess fluid down the lymphatic system.  It also makes the cream penetrate into the skin more.  It works for me!  I noticed after just one use that my under eye bags are diminished.  I have tried everything, some quite expensive, and have gone back to this.  Also it&#x27;s not greasy, has kind of a firming effect, so can be used morning under makeup or at night.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL FOR ME.  IT&#x27;S EASY  TO USE AND MAKES MY SKIN  FEEL SOFT AND  LOOK 10 YEARS YOUNGER</li>
            <li> Not much  improvement.  Its ok.  Circles still there as are the lines.  Oh well, it&#x27;s not for everyone.  The cream is nice though, it just didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li> I received this product to sample through bzzagent.com and so far I am happy with my results. I do not have wrinkles yet but I still apply creams because I would like to keep wrinkles away as long as I can. I do have some under eye circles and bother me. They are not so dark that I cannot cover them with concealer but they still bother me. I have been using the cream on my eyes and it has helped with the circles. I notice it is now easier to conceal the circles, I use less concealer and they cover much easier. I use the massager when my eyes are puffy which usually happens due to allergies. It seems to help reduce the puffiness for a bit, my eyes get puffy again but it could be because they only get puffy due to allergies. Either way I do like the product and the cream lasts a good while because you do not have to use much.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye total eye correction system is a 2 step product that promises to fade dark under-eye circles and wrinkles while eliminating puffiness and bags under the eyes. I got a chance to try this new L&#x27;Oreal product for myself this week courtesy of a website called Bzzagent ([...]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye costs $19.99 and is available at most drugstores like CVS and Walgreens. What you get in the package is a tube that contains .5 fl oz of eye cream on one side and a micro pulse massager on the other. These two things work together to revitalize tired dark and dull eyes. The cream&#x27;s active ingredients are Erasyl which helps minimize dark circles and Collagen which smooths wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really bad dark circles under my eyes which is probably due to working very long hours on the computer and they get even worse when I lose sleep which is quite often since I suffer from insomnia. My poor eyes experience a lot of eyestrain and it shows. I am constantly trying every home remedy and \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; eye cream that is created in an attempt to combat the dark circles under my eyes. I am 34 years old and so far I have no real wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes. If I have any wrinkles they are very faint and you can&#x27;t really see them. I also don&#x27;t really have bags under my eyes or puffiness. My main eye problem is the dark circles and this product promises to fix that so I thoroughly tested it out and here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye cream I followed the instructions exactly. It says to apply small dots of the cream under my eyes and to gently pat the cream in. After that I used the micropulse massager over the cream as directed. After treating both eyes I checked them out in the mirror and noticed that the skin around my eyes appeared to be smoother and yes, the dark circles were a little bit lighter. The difference was not drastic right away and it was probably only noticeable to me but it was a slight improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With continued use my eyes actually looked brighter and younger, I looked well rested even when I wasn&#x27;t. The skin surrounding my eyes is now extremely soft and smooth. The product had no negative side effects such as stinging, peeling or redness. I have very sensitive skin and I really had no bad issues with the eye cream and no allergic reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the cream was that it feels nice going on, does not look or feel greasy and it does not have any scent. I am undecided as to if it is the cream that works or the massager or both but whichever it is, the point is, that the product does work. Even if the massager is just a novelty part of the product, which is what I thought in the beginning, it is still cool. I&#x27;d say that it is worth the retail price of $19.99, I would purchase the product again and I&#x27;d recommend it to others.and it was probably only noticeable to me but it was a slight improvement.

            <li> I bought 15 of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Collagen Micro-Pulse Eye Correction System, 0.5-Fluid Ounce.  I have thought to send them to my friends as gifts. But  when I used one of them last week, I found there are two problems.&lt;br /&gt;1. The touch plastic button is broken.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Eye cream contains too water. It is uncomfortable to use it, I feel  it is fake. It is very different from what I have ever used before.&lt;br /&gt; I wrote to the seller and told them the problem,they let me replace them,but when I asked them how to do ,they never wrote back to me again. I am very dissappointed about the experience.This is the first time .</li>
            <li> SHARE this secret with all your friends. This gets rid of the bags better than anything I have ever used</li>
            <li> The vibration is very impressive. I&#x27;ve tried and my eyes feel comfortable. Hope it work for the puffiness and dark circle under my eyes. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have owned mine for 2ish yrs &amp; 2 battery changes. I had massive sinus surgery, &amp; have allergies, insomnia, &amp; hereditary dark eye circles. The pulse vibration &amp; cream formula are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at releaving puffiness &amp; darkness above/below the eye (even more so when used after allergy eye drops &amp;/or nasal decongestent since these products reduce pressure in this area). It is also GREAT as a all over face massager/toner &amp; for helping skin care products penetrate. I find it VERY soothing for tired eyes, facial muscle stress/tension, mild stress/sinus headaches. You can refill the tube w cream of choice when empty too. It&#x27;s also small &amp; portable.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER; once the battery case is opened, the control button &amp; metal piece that completes the curcuit fall out, are VERY DIFFICULT get back into the case properly. The pulse strength becomes inconsistant, &amp; finally, too weak to do anything useful. I feel like this part of the device is made like a cheap toy. This is the only portable pulse product I have found. It needs to be made so that only the battery comes out, &amp; the curcuit connector piece w wires &amp; control button are firmly secured to prevent damage to the curcuit.&lt;br /&gt;Wishing you the BEST RESULTS ; )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely interesting.. I felt that it really didn&#x27;t do anything to improve my eyes. The vibrations were nice, but seemed silly. I now use a different product.</li>
            <li> ...but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations :-(&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal makes some wonderful beauty and cosmetics products, but I&#x27;m afraid this is not one of them.  I waited to write this review until I gave the product enough time to do what it claims, but I just do not see any difference - the dark circles are still the same and I don&#x27;t see any all-around under eye smoothness as the product promises (I also took a pic the day I started and compared it with a pic I just took today after almost 2 weeks use - no difference between the two pics at all, unfortunately).  Additionally, the &amp;#34;micro-pulse massager&amp;#34; seems to be nothing more than a gimmick (at least, to me) - it&#x27;s supposed to reduce under eye bags and puffiness.  I found that cucumbers do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side: I have very sensitive skin and suffer with atopic dermatitis and eczema, and the one thing I can say about this product is that it was very gentle on my skin and caused no allergic reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, and I noticed a certain tightness right away after it dried up.  It is absorbed very fast and the little massage thingy is neat - just got to remember to use it in the right direction, otherwise it would just stretch my skin in the eye area even more.  Not bad as long as you are careful not to get it inside your eyes!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference at all.  The cream does not go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.  The vibrator thing does absolutely nothing.  I don&#x27;t know why this surprises me, being it was only $10.  Did I really expect a miracle?</li>
            <li> Looks like it works first week out.  One of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Product easy and safe to use.  Twice daily use for two weeks and seeing no improvement yet.  Will continue until product used up.</li>
            <li> it did absolutely nothing to me... i use it and nothing. i used it for weeks and still nothing.. i have bad under eyes and was looking forward for this product WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!! dont even bother buyingthis product.. you will be disappointed</li>
            <li> It barely worked this time.</li>
            <li> Hello, good morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow responses to questions from the satisfaction survey, 4 stars because I chose to use some time and got very good results in the eye area and my dark circles diminished. I&#x27;m enjoying the product and indicate to all people who like to treat the skin.</li>
            <li> I put this on my eyes exactly with the direction but it just created more wrinkles for me, maybe due to the auto-massage mode. Bought it with the hope to reduce my very first wrinkle (I&#x27;m 23 btw) but what it did was creating more.</li>
            <li> my mother says it does not work for her. she says she did not see any good results after using 2 months. IDK</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. The cream felt good on skin but no help with the eye area.</li>
            <li> I received a broken, old, mildew battery, opened box package. I did try to request to have it return, but it is worth it to spend extra $6.95 shipping to return it. I rather to throw it into my trash can.</li>
            <li> This actually helps reduce my dark shadows.</li>
            <li> The micro pulse feels like a massage. Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> No change after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Its OK still have dark marks under my eye but helps....work mostly nights so my eyes get too tired...</li>
            <li> Did not see any noticeable difference, really felt like I wasted $$ on this product.</li>
            <li> I work with two 20&amp;#34; computer monitors in my face all day, which leads to eye fatigue, dark circles and puffy eyes.  When I get home from work I get into comfortable clothes, wash off my makeup and use this cream and mini-massager to relax and un-puff my eyes - it works.  I use a liberal amount of the cream and use the massager for 1-2 minutes under each eye (slowly, back and forth) - not the 10 seconds, outward only, as recommended in the description.  I have very sensitive skin and the cream formula doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many eye creams, and this is the first one that&#x27;s worked for both un-puffing and lightening the dark circles - also relieves the &#x27;tired eyes ache&#x27;.  I think the vibrations from the massager help with circulation and getting things flowing again - great idea by L&#x27;Oreal.  I will be back for more, when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Lines around my mouth disappered before my eyes. Love this product. I have tried everything, but will only use L&#x27;Oréal from now on</li>
            <li> muy bueno el producto y llego a tiempo, muy responsable el vendedor, me gusta el producto, sin más que decir</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the built-in vibrator helps but the cream does lessen the appearance of the puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The actual product is nice.  It&#x27;s better as something that fills in the wrinkles and creases than it is at reducing puffiness or reducing dark circles.  I prefer Garnier for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pulse.. well it&#x27;s silly. It adds a lot of length to the package and it sounds like 3 small BB style balls rattling around inside it.  Barely moves.  They&#x27;d have been better off putting a ball on the end where the product comes off so you can just roll it on directly.  Lots of bulk for no real payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is nice, smooth, non irritating and does a great job filling in the spots you want it to.  So for that 4 stars... the 5th is removed for the silly, bulky rattling thing on the end.  :P</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition, And in good time.  The product just didn&#x27;t work for my eye bags.  Not really too much of a surprise, most products don&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ve just switched to Avon&#x27;s Anew Pro 2-part eye cream.  That seems to be working better, but it&#x27;s been less than a week.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion but the micro-pulse unit broke after the second use, so I can&#x27;t comment on it working. I&#x27;m still using the lotion though, a little goes a long way.  However, I don&#x27;t see any changes, but it&#x27;s nice and light for use at bedtime</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, the vibrator at the top does nothing to help spread the stuff in feels ok if your eyes are tired after a long day though. Have not notied a difference in any way for the bags under my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for ways to minimize under eye bags at my age (70). After reading customer reviews, I was hoping this product does the trick but I&#x27;ve come to realize that with age and gravity, all things sag. I see improvement at the beginning of the day but as the day wears on, horizontal fine lines and bags return. Perhaps, an anti-aging under eye product would work better. It&#x27;s worth the try at this great price!!</li>
            <li> The pricing in excellent an the effects are noticeable after 2 weeks of daily treatment. notice that you have to use daily cream too.</li>
            <li> The thing was a good price considering several websites sell them for higer than 20 and change. Most regular stores don&#x27;t sell them in bulk like that. I received them faster than the day estimated also.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any diference, but the micor - pulse was a good design.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am soon to be 65, and had given up on my under eye area.  This little gizmo is doing something!  I am not even faithfully using it every day, but it is helping firm and smooth this area!  Now, I want to use it all over my face.  LOL.</li>
            <li> Returned after only 1 use - made the bags under my eyes worse.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I like the vibrations and cream</li>
            <li> Trust me this cream really does work, awesome job L&#x27;Oreal. Now please create something for dark spots on the face better known as \\&quot; Hyper-pigmentation\\&quot;,thank you.</li>
            <li> Effective 4 skin care. Ordered 4 my wife.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and my eyes, bags actually tripled in size!?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d seen a very positive review on Amazon and this caused me to want to try the product.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disapointed. Be careful ladies.</li>
