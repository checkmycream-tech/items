    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent powder brush.  </li>
            <li>But the UBU brush still works wonderfully for face powder, and the bristles just feel great against my skin!  </li>
            <li>, I tried this for blush, and this was the perfect size for it!  </li>
            <li>this is a very good affordable brush.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It looks great</li>
            <li>Attractive.</li>
            <li>Great for setting your foundation or throwing on some bronzer.</li>
            <li>and she said this is a great brush for blending it into her s</li>
            <li>This is a great powder brush.  </li>
            <li>A bright brush looks great on your dressing table and it&#x27;s a treat to carry in your make up bag.</li>
            <li>The size is also good for all over powder application</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good all over face brush for applying powder, bronzer, and/or</li>
            <li>This brush does a good job at applying powder.</li>
            <li>it’s a good deal.</li>
            <li>, it feels good on my face,&amp;#34; she said.</li>
            <li>My wife loved this brush.</li>
            <li>We both recommend this brush because it is certainly a good buy at the selling price.</li>
            <li>This brush is best used for macro application of powders over large areas of face and body.</li>
            <li>Product is spread evenly and smoothly, and the brush feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is huge!</li>
            <li>Mine has not fallen apart like so many others have, so I can&#x27;t complain about the construction.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it was more durable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; could be anything. :)</li>
            <li>The handle is a nice length and the brush feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the performance given the budget price (currently $10).</li>
            <li>The look is girly and cute, however I imagine that the bleaching and dyeing will not enhance the longevity of the product&#x27;s brush</li>
            <li>This is an okay brush.</li>
            <li>This powder brush is HUGE and provides nice, even coverage.</li>
            <li>It provides great even coverage and doesn&#x27;t require that much powder.  </li>
            <li>I spend most of my time in a doctors office</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will stop shedding hairs and that it just needs to be used more.</li>
            <li>The brush as a whole has a great look and feel to it with the handle feeling great in my hands, and very ergonomic when I put on makeup with it.  </li>
            <li>I have had some brushes where I&#x27;ve used a lot more powder than I intended</li>
            <li>If its for a &#x27;cute&#x27; factor, well, then I guess the product may not be aimed at my age group, but hey, women above the age of 25 like good brushes too!</li>
            <li>I use it for my covering powder and so far it has been great.</li>
            <li>Good performance for a very inexpensive mass-market brush.</li>
            <li>It did have a strong plastic smell from the packaging it came in.  </li>
            <li>It definitely smooths makeup on just right, and delivers the best performance I&#x27;ve seen in a brush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely not a brush you want to use for anything that requires precision, but for something you&#x27;re applying all over like powder, this would be a beautiful brush to use.</li>
            <li>My wife liked this brush at first, but then realized it wasn&#x27;t too practical.</li>
            <li>While this brush is not as soft and economic as the brand I regularly use, it&#x27;s a very good brush at a very good price.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a fine choice for an inexpensive makeup brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, glide&#x27;s right over one&#x27;s face and does a great job distibuting the powder - no clumps anywhere.</li>
            <li>It also works well as a buffer to smooth out existing powder highlighter and bronzer applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sue this one to apply the shimmery type powder and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a great brush, and definitely beats the competition in softness!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems like a nice brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The product description states that it&#x27;s made of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristles, though it doesn&#x27;t elaborate on exactly what these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristles are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>You can keep the brush in the reusable bag to help keep in clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping it in the resealable bag to keep it clean and in tact.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice make up brush, the bristles are soft and the brush itself is comfortable to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, very nice for loose powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible fluffy and plush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a wonderfully soft brush, but just note to keep some glue handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a wonderfully soft brush, but just note to keep some glue handy.</li>
            <li>Super soft and dense bristles with amazing product pick up.</li>
            <li>Easy handling, easy use, it did not take as much powder as my old brush which i love.</li>
            <li>With that I did lower my four star rating to a three, and went out to get some super glue.  </li>
            <li>With that I did lower my four star rating to a three, and went out to get some super glue.  </li>
            <li>It really does have a strong odor when taking it out of the bag.</li>
            <li>The UBU brush is quite a bit larger than the one I had been using, but much softer with a pleasant silky feeling.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get precision from a brush this big, but it&#x27;s great to have the quick coverage this brush offers.</li>
            <li>I like the bright pink bristles, too.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it was pink</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and overall good value.</li>
            <li>I got this since I thought itd be useful to apply some powder for photos.</li>
            <li>This makeup brush is soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>She mostly uses Bare Minerals makeup</li>
            <li>You can easily pay four times that for a brush this size with natural bristles.</li>
            <li>find a short handle such as this preferable as it is easy to maneuver when you are working on your own face.</li>
            <li>One more positive is that it&#x27;s easy to spot in your makeup bag thanks to those big pink bristles. :)</li>
            <li>So pretty.  </li>
            <li>Pink coloring also adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller brush that does a better job applying those exactly where I want it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hot pink color is a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one kind of keeps the product on the surface and allows you to apply evenly with not much wasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a really pretty brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;super softy&amp;#34; and most definitely not &amp;#34;extra large&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The first thing that struck me was the smell.</li>
            <li>I assumed it was just first time use</li>
            <li>It applies my blush effectively and is soft enough (I have a softer brush from e.l.f. mineral cosmetics).</li>
            <li>It is super soft.</li>
            <li>simply because it seemed like the brush sucked it up, but the UBU puts the fine powder straight on without any issues.  </li>
            <li>The photo doesn&#x27;t really do this brush justice.</li>
            <li>, this feels much nicer, and for the price</li>
            <li>The handle is also made of a very cheap-feeling plastic, though that&#x27;s not a surprise given the budget price</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like how it works and the end result.</li>
            <li>This brush seems to spread it out evenly and without using much.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and dense with an almost firm feel to it, which I like because it makes it easier to control the powder application.</li>
            <li>and it regained its nice fluffy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I store it upright in a wire basket and it doesn&#x27;t get bumped or have other toiletries stored on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Because of the pink color, it&#x27;s easy to see how much you have picked up.  </li>
            <li>Is not as soft as I thought it would be and bristles fell out on first use.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this super &amp;#34;softy&amp;#34; -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially the brush had a moderate chemical scent to it - like acetate - but that has dissipated after washing once in a mild detergent.</li>
            <li>I like how it covers my entire face, quickly.</li>
            <li>The UBU Super Soft Extra Large Power brush is, indeed, very, very soft!  </li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>The pink is bright and catchy and I haven&#x27;t had a need to wash it yet, which differs from my other brushes.</li>
            <li>I was able to snap it back in place and it seemed secure, but every other use or so the handle falls back out again.</li>
            <li>The natural bristles really make a difference when im applying bronzer and gives me an even coverage.</li>
            <li>, I first tried it with my Clinque loose powder, and found that it works flawlessly, although to me, personally, it&#x27;s a little on the small side for powdering the face.  </li>
            <li>and i decided to use my new brush.</li>
            <li>Apparently it wasn&#x27;t glued very well.  </li>
            <li>I actually thought I was really going to like the pink; it seems so cute and different and girly.  </li>
            <li>I really like to use natural-bristle brushes, but WHY the addition of the hot pink dyes to the natural bristles?  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s my personal opinion as I do like to use those massively large brushes that powders a quarter of your face in once sweep.  </li>
            <li>Brush is soft and extra large as described.</li>
            <li>This is a bit of a larger brush than I am used to, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li>This powder brush uses natural bristles and states &amp;#34;use</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and perform well with powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are the star attraction though with their amazingly soft bristles that feel like a baby bird is brushing against your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles lost yet after using quite frequently.</li>
            <li>I always wash my brushes every month (or regularly if I use the brush with makeup that leaves a heavy coating), and this one dried very quickly, and I can tell it will last a good long while!  </li>
            <li>And, of course, the hot pink color only adds a little spice to the really cute look of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is hard to see the makeup, because I can&#x27;t apply enough on the brush.&amp;#34; She says this is good for real powdery makeup, but not for less powdery blushers and so</li>
            <li>The reason for four stars is because some of the hairs came off first time and second time and third time using it.</li>
            <li>Its taking awhile to get used to the hot pink color, however.  </li>
            <li>This is a large, dome-shaped brush used for applying loose powder and bronzer to the face and body.</li>
            <li>I washed it with a gentle face soap, blotted the excess water with a paper towel and let it dry overnight (standing upright)</li>
            <li>Think soft kitten fur, and you only have an inkling of how soft this brush is.  </li>
            <li>I am using the UBU Large and Soft Powder Brush to apply loose facial powder.</li>
            <li>so I could see it clearly before I left the house.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who likes a soft texture when applying their powder.</li>
            <li>It is soft but left bristles on my face after use.  </li>
            <li>I did not find this brush extra soft.</li>
            <li>The handle is thick enough to hold easily without dropping.</li>
            <li>I experienced only a minimal amount of shedding, about the same as my (way too expensive) kabuki-style brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles smell a little funny.</li>
            <li>;  First impression was that it&#x27;s a big brush and very PINK!</li>
            <li>I also had a few flyaway bristles with the first wash, but it hasn&#x27;t shed since.</li>
            <li>Like all the other reviews, the main thing about this brush is the smell.</li>
            <li>but I found it a little too large for applying blush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, but to me, not super soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She does say she likes the little bag, it comes with a lot, but will probably not use it too much.</li>
            <li>At least with a brown blush you can see the pink on the bristles, so you have a sense of what you&#x27;re about to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the brush is fine for the price.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> One more positive is that it&#x27;s easy to spot in your makeup bag thanks to those big pink bristles. :)</li>
            <li> So pretty.  </li>
            <li> Pink coloring also adds a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller brush that does a better job applying those exactly where I want it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hot pink color is a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one kind of keeps the product on the surface and allows you to apply evenly with not much wasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a really pretty brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;super softy&amp;#34; and most definitely not &amp;#34;extra large&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first thing that struck me was the smell.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was just first time use</li>
            <li> It applies my blush effectively and is soft enough (I have a softer brush from e.l.f. mineral cosmetics).</li>
            <li> It is super soft.</li>
            <li> simply because it seemed like the brush sucked it up, but the UBU puts the fine powder straight on without any issues.  </li>
            <li> The photo doesn&#x27;t really do this brush justice.</li>
            <li> , this feels much nicer, and for the price</li>
            <li> The handle is also made of a very cheap-feeling plastic, though that&#x27;s not a surprise given the budget price</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like how it works and the end result.</li>
            <li> This brush seems to spread it out evenly and without using much.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and dense with an almost firm feel to it, which I like because it makes it easier to control the powder application.</li>
            <li> and it regained its nice fluffy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I store it upright in a wire basket and it doesn&#x27;t get bumped or have other toiletries stored on top of it.  </li>
            <li> Because of the pink color, it&#x27;s easy to see how much you have picked up.  </li>
            <li> Is not as soft as I thought it would be and bristles fell out on first use.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this super &amp;#34;softy&amp;#34; -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially the brush had a moderate chemical scent to it - like acetate - but that has dissipated after washing once in a mild detergent.</li>
            <li> I like how it covers my entire face, quickly.</li>
            <li> The UBU Super Soft Extra Large Power brush is, indeed, very, very soft!  </li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> The pink is bright and catchy and I haven&#x27;t had a need to wash it yet, which differs from my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I was able to snap it back in place and it seemed secure, but every other use or so the handle falls back out again.</li>
            <li> The natural bristles really make a difference when im applying bronzer and gives me an even coverage.</li>
            <li> , I first tried it with my Clinque loose powder, and found that it works flawlessly, although to me, personally, it&#x27;s a little on the small side for powdering the face.  </li>
            <li> and i decided to use my new brush.</li>
            <li> Apparently it wasn&#x27;t glued very well.  </li>
            <li> I actually thought I was really going to like the pink; it seems so cute and different and girly.  </li>
            <li> I really like to use natural-bristle brushes, but WHY the addition of the hot pink dyes to the natural bristles?  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s my personal opinion as I do like to use those massively large brushes that powders a quarter of your face in once sweep.  </li>
            <li> Brush is soft and extra large as described.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a larger brush than I am used to, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li> This powder brush uses natural bristles and states &amp;#34;use</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and perform well with powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles themselves are the star attraction though with their amazingly soft bristles that feel like a baby bird is brushing against your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles lost yet after using quite frequently.</li>
            <li> I always wash my brushes every month (or regularly if I use the brush with makeup that leaves a heavy coating), and this one dried very quickly, and I can tell it will last a good long while!  </li>
            <li> And, of course, the hot pink color only adds a little spice to the really cute look of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is hard to see the makeup, because I can&#x27;t apply enough on the brush.&amp;#34; She says this is good for real powdery makeup, but not for less powdery blushers and so</li>
            <li> The reason for four stars is because some of the hairs came off first time and second time and third time using it.</li>
            <li> Its taking awhile to get used to the hot pink color, however.  </li>
            <li> This is a large, dome-shaped brush used for applying loose powder and bronzer to the face and body.</li>
            <li> I washed it with a gentle face soap, blotted the excess water with a paper towel and let it dry overnight (standing upright)</li>
            <li> Think soft kitten fur, and you only have an inkling of how soft this brush is.  </li>
            <li> I am using the UBU Large and Soft Powder Brush to apply loose facial powder.</li>
            <li> so I could see it clearly before I left the house.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who likes a soft texture when applying their powder.</li>
            <li> It is soft but left bristles on my face after use.  </li>
            <li> I did not find this brush extra soft.</li>
            <li> The handle is thick enough to hold easily without dropping.</li>
            <li> I experienced only a minimal amount of shedding, about the same as my (way too expensive) kabuki-style brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles smell a little funny.</li>
            <li> ;  First impression was that it&#x27;s a big brush and very PINK!</li>
            <li> I also had a few flyaway bristles with the first wash, but it hasn&#x27;t shed since.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews, the main thing about this brush is the smell.</li>
            <li> but I found it a little too large for applying blush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft, but to me, not super soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She does say she likes the little bag, it comes with a lot, but will probably not use it too much.</li>
            <li> At least with a brown blush you can see the pink on the bristles, so you have a sense of what you&#x27;re about to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the brush is fine for the price.  </li>
            <li> She has spent hundreds of dollars on similar brushes and paid several times what this one sells for.  </li>
            <li> Because this is such a fluffy, soft brush, I won’t use it to apply blush and would be careful with bronzer.</li>
            <li> Long handles are preferable for makeup artists who stand at a distance from their client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the fibers are natural (animal hair) they have been bleached white and then dyed bright shocking pink.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the brush handle fell out of the black &amp;#34;socket&amp;#34; when I first took it out of the bag.</li>
            <li> This brush is big, fluffy, and suited to use with loose powder, mineral powder makeup, and bronzers.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up looking clownish because there was just too much pink blush on my brush when I put it on my face, but there was no way to tell because of the pink color of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Some bristles fall out when used, leaving pink “hairs” in my bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why pink?</li>
            <li> But as it turns out, I really prefer my dark brown brushes, because it turns out that with the pink, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to tell how much blush I&#x27;ve put on the brush.</li>
            <li> Other than the pink color</li>
            <li> The bristles are very tight and none have come over with daily usuage.  </li>
            <li> but it does have a smell that I have not encountered with other makeup</li>
            <li> Can be used for powders and other things.</li>
            <li> Ugh, I would never get any other brushes from this company again.</li>
            <li> I must say i was skeptical about this brush at first.</li>
            <li> However me and my fiance were going out with two other couples</li>
            <li> Until it happened two other times.</li>
            <li> the pink little strings I find all around me after I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a large (2 ¾\\&quot;) domed, natural fiber, shocking pink brush with a fairly short (4 ¼\\&quot;) handle.</li>
            <li> less powder.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The color is a decidedly unnatural shocking pink, which I think is kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one negative was that this brush had a strong and unpleasant odor to it when I took it out of its plastic pouch.</li>
            <li> Did not find it as described as extra large either,I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> So sad this brush doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> SO I&#x27;m throwing it away and lowering the rating to a two-star (just because I used it for a little bit.)</li>
            <li> Darn brush has started to shed heavily.</li>
            <li> Pink is cute if you like pink, but to me it&#x27;s unnecessary and may be the reason for the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> The package was a little difficult to get to open</li>
            <li> I used it or the past month for stage makeup for a play I was doing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the dye of the bristles or what, but it just smells!</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my wife because she is literally addicted to beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell remains thoroughly unpleasant even after washing, and the brush sheds like mad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the smell too bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what I expected. Is not as soft as I thought it would be and bristles fell out on first use.</li>
            <li> Crappy quality brush. As soon as I took it out of he cover the bristles were shedding uncontrollably. Even when applying powder the bristles come off on your face and while cleaning the brush. Had to throw the brush away after one week because it was unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I actually thought I was really going to like the pink; it seems so cute and different and girly.  But as it turns out, I really prefer my dark brown brushes, because it turns out that with the pink, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to tell how much blush I&#x27;ve put on the brush. I&#x27;ve ended up looking clownish because there was just too much pink blush on my brush when I put it on my face, but there was no way to tell because of the pink color of the brush.  At least with a brown blush you can see the pink on the bristles, so you have a sense of what you&#x27;re about to put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the brush is fine for the price.  It&#x27;s not super-soft but not offensively scratchy, either. Mine has not fallen apart like so many others have, so I can&#x27;t complain about the construction.  Other than the pink color, it&#x27;s a fine choice for an inexpensive makeup brush.</li>
            <li> The photo doesn&#x27;t really do this brush justice. It&#x27;s incredible fluffy and plush. It feels luxurious on my skin. it&#x27;s definitely not a brush you want to use for anything that requires precision, but for something you&#x27;re applying all over like powder, this would be a beautiful brush to use. I like the bright pink bristles, too.</li>
            <li> So pretty.  So sad this brush doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.  Some bristles fall out when used, leaving pink “hairs” in my bathroom sink.  I didn&#x27;t find the smell too bad but it does have a smell that I have not encountered with other makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the bag it comes it.  You can keep the brush in the reusable bag to help keep in clean. The size is also good for all over powder application but I found it a little too large for applying blush.  Just wish it was more durable.</li>
            <li> This brush has the softest bristles I have ever used in a makeup brush. I love it. Pink coloring also adds a nice touch. This is a bit of a larger brush than I am used to, but I still really like it. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who likes a soft texture when applying their powder.</li>
            <li> This powder brush uses natural bristles and states &amp;#34;use less powder.&amp;#34;  First impression was that it&#x27;s a big brush and very PINK! The package was a little difficult to get to open and I had to pull it by the bristles to get it out. The bristles smell a little funny. I&#x27;d like to know what they are made from. &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; could be anything. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this super &amp;#34;softy&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s soft, but to me, not super soft. It seems to be a good all over face brush for applying powder, bronzer, and/or shimmer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for blush because it&#x27;s just so big. The handle is thick enough to hold easily without dropping. One more positive is that it&#x27;s easy to spot in your makeup bag thanks to those big pink bristles. :)</li>
            <li> This brush does a good job at applying powder. Product is spread evenly and smoothly, and the brush feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially the brush had a moderate chemical scent to it - like acetate - but that has dissipated after washing once in a mild detergent. I also had a few flyaway bristles with the first wash, but it hasn&#x27;t shed since.</li>
            <li> I am using the UBU Large and Soft Powder Brush to apply loose facial powder. The UBU brush is quite a bit larger than the one I had been using, but much softer with a pleasant silky feeling. The handle is a nice length and the brush feels comfortable in my hand. With a couple of strokes of the brush, my face is done. Because this is such a fluffy, soft brush, I won’t use it to apply blush and would be careful with bronzer. I have a smaller brush that does a better job applying those exactly where I want it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the brush I had been using for powder, this feels much nicer, and for the price it’s a good deal. The hot pink color is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note: I’ve noticed some reviewers have had problems with shedding bristles and wonder if there might be a quality control issue with some of the brushes as mine has not lost any bristles and I’ve used it almost every day.</li>
            <li> My wife liked this brush at first, but then realized it wasn&#x27;t too practical. &amp;#34;It looks great, it feels good on my face,&amp;#34; she said. &amp;#34;But when I try to apply make up with the brush it is hard to see the makeup, because I can&#x27;t apply enough on the brush.&amp;#34; She says this is good for real powdery makeup, but not for less powdery blushers and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does say she likes the little bag, it comes with a lot, but will probably not use it too much.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell remains thoroughly unpleasant even after washing, and the brush sheds like mad. Pink is cute if you like pink, but to me it&#x27;s unnecessary and may be the reason for the nasty smell. I&#x27;ll seek a different powder brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and extra large as described. I used it for translucent powder. I think it would be too big for bronzer or blush.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this brush. High quality. Attractive. Works well.  Goes on well.  Can be used for powders and other things.</li>
            <li> This is a large, dome-shaped brush used for applying loose powder and bronzer to the face and body. The product description states that it&#x27;s made of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristles, though it doesn&#x27;t elaborate on exactly what these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristles are. The color is a decidedly unnatural shocking pink, which I think is kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brush for several weeks and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the performance given the budget price (currently $10). You can easily pay four times that for a brush this size with natural bristles. I experienced only a minimal amount of shedding, about the same as my (way too expensive) kabuki-style brush. The brush is nice and dense with an almost firm feel to it, which I like because it makes it easier to control the powder application. I washed it with a gentle face soap, blotted the excess water with a paper towel and let it dry overnight (standing upright) and it regained its nice fluffy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative was that this brush had a strong and unpleasant odor to it when I took it out of its plastic pouch. I don&#x27;t know if the odor was from the pouch (which did smell also) or the brush itself, but this is something that the manufacturer should address. I let it air out for two days before I used it - you should not have to do that, even with a bargain priced item like this. The handle is also made of a very cheap-feeling plastic, though that&#x27;s not a surprise given the budget price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Good performance for a very inexpensive mass-market brush. The manufacturer needs to address the odor issue, which is the only thing that makes me hesitant to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a large (2 ¾\\&quot;) domed, natural fiber, shocking pink brush with a fairly short (4 ¼\\&quot;) handle. This brush is best used for macro application of powders over large areas of face and body. It also works well as a buffer to smooth out existing powder highlighter and bronzer applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the fibers are natural (animal hair) they have been bleached white and then dyed bright shocking pink. The look is girly and cute, however I imagine that the bleaching and dyeing will not enhance the longevity of the product&#x27;s brush fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find a short handle such as this preferable as it is easy to maneuver when you are working on your own face. Long handles are preferable for makeup artists who stand at a distance from their client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush washes well in shampoo or dish washing liquid and holds its shape after air drying.</li>
            <li> It is soft but left bristles on my face after use.  The good thing is that it was pink so I could see it clearly before I left the house.</li>
            <li> Excellent powder brush.  The bristles are very tight and none have come over with daily usuage.  The brush is very soft, glide&#x27;s right over one&#x27;s face and does a great job distibuting the powder - no clumps anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time. It is super soft. Reasonable price and overall good value. Have been using it about 1-2 times per week for months and the bristles are still holding out. Great for setting your foundation or throwing on some bronzer.</li>
            <li> This brush is big, fluffy, and suited to use with loose powder, mineral powder makeup, and bronzers. You won&#x27;t get precision from a brush this big, but it&#x27;s great to have the quick coverage this brush offers. The bristles are soft and perform well with powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with extended use, I saw no bristle loss or weakening of the connection between the brush and handle.  The brush washes well and keeps its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why pink? It&#x27;s fun! A bright brush looks great on your dressing table and it&#x27;s a treat to carry in your make up bag.</li>
            <li> This is an okay brush. It applies my blush effectively and is soft enough (I have a softer brush from e.l.f. mineral cosmetics). My biggest complaint is that the brush handle fell out of the black &amp;#34;socket&amp;#34; when I first took it out of the bag. I was able to snap it back in place and it seemed secure, but every other use or so the handle falls back out again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife because she is literally addicted to beauty products.  She has spent hundreds of dollars on similar brushes and paid several times what this one sells for.  She loves it.  She mostly uses Bare Minerals makeup and she said this is a great brush for blending it into her s*** and cheeks.  We both recommend this brush because it is certainly a good buy at the selling price.</li>
            <li> EDIT: Darn brush has started to shed heavily. I&#x27;m pissed at al the pink little strings I find all around me after I use it. SO I&#x27;m throwing it away and lowering the rating to a two-star (just because I used it for a little bit.) Buy Shany brushes instead, like I did.  __________________ While this brush is not as soft and economic as the brand I regularly use, it&#x27;s a very good brush at a very good price. The pink is bright and catchy and I haven&#x27;t had a need to wash it yet, which differs from my other brushes. This one kind of keeps the product on the surface and allows you to apply evenly with not much wasting. It does say it&#x27;s made in China, which I wish I would have known before getting it. But if that&#x27;s no big deal to you this is a very good affordable brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched everywhere for a proper powder brush. I sue this one to apply the shimmery type powder and it is fantastic. I like how it covers my entire face, quickly. It&#x27;s also a really pretty brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;super softy&amp;#34; and most definitely not &amp;#34;extra large&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Super soft and dense bristles with amazing product pick up. The natural bristles really make a difference when im applying bronzer and gives me an even coverage. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this since I thought itd be useful to apply some powder for photos. However, the glue used to apply the bristles was pretyt low quality. I tapped it against the sink before I used it and a third of the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> This brush is huge! I was intending for this to me a blush brush, but I ended up using it for powder all over because it is so big. The first thing that struck me was the smell. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the dye of the bristles or what, but it just smells! I literally had to wash the brush 2 times before I even used it. After the first few uses, the bristles started falling out! Ugh, I would never get any other brushes from this company again.</li>
            <li> This powder brush is HUGE and provides nice, even coverage. I really like how it works and the end result.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder brush.  I used it or the past month for stage makeup for a play I was doing.  It provides great even coverage and doesn&#x27;t require that much powder.  Because of the pink color, it&#x27;s easy to see how much you have picked up.  I&#x27;ve been keeping it in the resealable bag to keep it clean and in tact.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I must say i was skeptical about this brush at first. I use liquid and powder make up however i use make probably one to three times a month. I spend most of my time in a doctors office so I do not use makeup or wear perfume when im at work. However me and my fiance were going out with two other couples and i decided to use my new brush. Easy handling, easy use, it did not take as much powder as my old brush which i love. This brush seems to spread it out evenly and without using much. The reason for four stars is because some of the hairs came off first time and second time and third time using it. I assumed it was just first time use and that was it. Until it happened two other times. I&#x27;m hoping it will stop shedding hairs and that it just needs to be used more. Other than that it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> The UBU Super Soft Extra Large Power brush is, indeed, very, very soft!  The brush as a whole has a great look and feel to it with the handle feeling great in my hands, and very ergonomic when I put on makeup with it.  The bristles themselves are the star attraction though with their amazingly soft bristles that feel like a baby bird is brushing against your face.  Seriously.  Think soft kitten fur, and you only have an inkling of how soft this brush is.  And, of course, the hot pink color only adds a little spice to the really cute look of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the actual use of the brush, I first tried it with my Clinque loose powder, and found that it works flawlessly, although to me, personally, it&#x27;s a little on the small side for powdering the face.  But that&#x27;s my personal opinion as I do like to use those massively large brushes that powders a quarter of your face in once sweep.  But the UBU brush still works wonderfully for face powder, and the bristles just feel great against my skin!  Next up, I tried this for blush, and this was the perfect size for it!  It definitely smooths makeup on just right, and delivers the best performance I&#x27;ve seen in a brush.  I have had some brushes where I&#x27;ve used a lot more powder than I intended simply because it seemed like the brush sucked it up, but the UBU puts the fine powder straight on without any issues.  I also tried this with an iridescent face shimmer, which, again, works like a charm! This is definitely a great brush, and definitely beats the competition in softness!  I always wash my brushes every month (or regularly if I use the brush with makeup that leaves a heavy coating), and this one dried very quickly, and I can tell it will last a good long while!  Totally recommend this brush, as it truly does its job, and the softness alone will have you buying the rest of the set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while, imagine my surprise when the brush actually fell off from the handle.  Apparently it wasn&#x27;t glued very well.  With that I did lower my four star rating to a three, and went out to get some super glue.  It&#x27;s still a wonderfully soft brush, but just note to keep some glue handy.With that I did lower my four star rating to a three, and went out to get some super glue.

            <li> This makeup brush is soft and lovely. I use it for my covering powder and so far it has been great. I&#x27;ve only had it shed once and it was because my cat was playing with it - he likes it, too.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews, the main thing about this brush is the smell. It really does have a strong odor when taking it out of the bag. And it lingers for a while. I used this for applying blush and it works well. It&#x27;s soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles lost yet after using quite frequently.</li>
            <li> This is a nice make up brush, the bristles are soft and the brush itself is comfortable to hold in your hand.  It did have a strong plastic smell from the packaging it came in.  But I let it sit out for several days before using it and it the odor was gone by that time.  I have not had a problem with the bristles falling out or the handle coming apart.  I store it upright in a wire basket and it doesn&#x27;t get bumped or have other toiletries stored on top of it.  It&#x27;s seems like a nice brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I did not find this brush extra soft. Did not find it as described as extra large either,I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, very nice for loose powder.  Its taking awhile to get used to the hot pink color, however.  I really like to use natural-bristle brushes, but WHY the addition of the hot pink dyes to the natural bristles?  (I&#x27;m guessing that the bristles are bleached anyway prior to being used...)  If its for a &#x27;cute&#x27; factor, well, then I guess the product may not be aimed at my age group, but hey, women above the age of 25 like good brushes too!</li>
