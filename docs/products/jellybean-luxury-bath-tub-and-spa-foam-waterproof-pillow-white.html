            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The greatest issue is that the suction cups will not stick to the tub.</li>
            <li>Waterproof Pillow - Black]]This product is very good.</li>
            <li>and this item is still in great shape.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve yet to find one that has great suction.  </li>
            <li>Happy Reader</li>
            <li>This one was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>material and cushioning are good.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for my tub.</li>
            <li>I like this bath pillow, feels very good, comfortable and pliable.  </li>
            <li>And I should mention that it&#x27;s comfortable, feeling quite cushy and plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t think of much good to say about this product.</li>
            <li>If the suction cups stayed in &amp; stuck more securely it would be a perfect pillow.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality and comfortable</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t quite give a fifth star because the cover has kind of rotated around the &amp;#34;stuffing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>shape and appearance are nice.  </li>
            <li>It looks good, feels good and arrived quickly to my doorstep.  </li>
            <li>Works great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it IS very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Still very comfortable.</li>
            <li>this is a very comfortable spa pillow</li>
            <li>This pillow is nice because it doesn&#x27;t hold mold or bacteria and is fairly comfortable but the suction cups do not work as well as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was the suction is not the greatest</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t prevent you from using the pillow, but it would be a tad more cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to do that it has worked out</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many before and this one for now seems to work.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have that comfy, &#x27;fall in love with it,&#x27; feel.  </li>
            <li>Pillow needs to be \\&quot;fuller\\&quot;, thicker and more pillow-like for comfort.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many bath pillows.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t deflate that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I noticed it has a nice texture and the foam had nice give to it,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get moldy or gross and is perfect for making leaning against my tub comfortable and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It attaches well, is a good shape and is pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable than the blow-up ones and stays cleaner.</li>
            <li>but I will say that it is the most comfortable bath pillow I have had.</li>
            <li>This pillow &#x27;sticks&#x27; just fine to the back, and provides a real nice head-rest when having a soak in the tub.  </li>
            <li>It is still the best pillow I have used despite these other issues.</li>
            <li>Easily washable</li>
            <li>These detach fairly easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews that said it won&#x27;t stick, or tears up easily....</li>
            <li>Stays adhered and yet is easily detached.</li>
            <li>I gave my wife this bath pillow some time ago and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It looks great in my tub- very clean and simple.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for about a month</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s waterproof, it sticks just fine, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>great fit for my neck in a tub that doesn&#x27;t have a big rim</li>
            <li>and I thought it was comfortable.</li>
            <li>Feels fabulous on the neck and holds well.</li>
            <li>The design was not as comfortable and it looks.</li>
            <li>: The Swissco has a perforated skin, which I found it comfortable.</li>
            <li>Material is sturdy, comfortable, and mildew proof.</li>
            <li>Does turn color on edges after a couple of years, but other than that, it&#x27;s ideal for bath use.</li>
            <li>It is clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you own a clawfoot, you know many of the accessories you can get for more modern tubs won&#x27;t always work in an old clawfoot.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found this pillow and love it!</li>
            <li>so it stays clean.  </li>
            <li>my curved tub back, the Swissco works better and feels more comfortable.</li>
            <li>For my curved tub back, the Swissco works better and feels more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before ordering and did use the super glue trick to keep the suction cups in place.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>This one looks like a nice (and not ugly) bath pillow, but it simply does not perform as hoped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t expect a foam pillow to defy the laws of physics, so I can&#x27;t complain that it isn&#x27;t useful for underwater (lumbar) support</li>
            <li>For those of us who take a lot of baths, we know there are two problems with pillows: popping holes in the blow up kind AND suction cups that actually hold the pillow to the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>These suction cups actually pop out of the pillow which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t rip when there is a lot of movement</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It was a better design but not as soft.  </li>
            <li>and I put it right away in the tub</li>
            <li>The shape of the pillow to this link is actually designed to conform to your neck and head better.    </li>
            <li>Maybe it needs some of that hot water heat and it will stick to the tub.</li>
            <li>I use this pillow in my hot tub</li>
            <li>If I had to replace it I would buy this one again because it is soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>A couple months ago, I had my first ever bout with sciatica - a humbling experience.</li>
            <li>first pillow is this JellyBean Luxury Tub &amp; Spa Foam Waterproof Pillow&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>If you take frequent baths, this is a good investment in your long term comfort.  </li>
            <li>More expensive than the cheap blow up pillows, but as with most things -- you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>the back suction cups pop out too easily though.  </li>
            <li>The JellyBean has three large suction cups.</li>
            <li>If you have a tub w/ a sloped back, I&#x27;m sure it is fine as a head cushion, but my old pillow was much thicker and actually supported my neck/head while lying in the tub.  </li>
            <li>The suctions work great and the pillow doesn&#x27;t move behind me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this pillow for anyone that likes to relax in the tub!</li>
            <li>The suction cups fit into recessed areas on the back of the pillow and are removable.</li>
            <li>but they really don&#x27;t have the stay put quality</li>
            <li>Size and shape are very accommodating.</li>
            <li>Very durable too.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>she likes it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get mold, it&#x27;s soft and is just the right size.</li>
            <li>This sounds okay, perhaps for cleaning, except for one major flaw -- they simply will NOT stay attached to the pillow.</li>
            <li>It still works fine though, and has not developed any mold.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups can pull out of the back, but I think that is by design so that you can clean underneath them.  </li>
            <li>You simply apply a couple of drops of super glue to each suction cup and that will hold them in place with the pillow.</li>
            <li>Not what I was hoping for and will keep looking for something more similar to my last one.</li>
            <li>the only thing that could make this product better is if it wasn&#x27;t so flat.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little pillow.  </li>
            <li>I actually love turning it vertical (straight up and down) and having it cover a larger portion of my neck and head.</li>
            <li>On a flat dry surface, the Jellybean may have better suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On a flat dry surface, the Jellybean may have better suction.    </li>
            <li>Comfy pillow, but suction cups on the back started popping off after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this pillow because it is soft &amp; has no hard edges.</li>
            <li>If you like long soaks, this is a cheap present to yourself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size, not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the suction cups to hold it onto the bath aren&#x27;t actually attached to the pillow, and they come out very easily, but don&#x27;t \\&quot;plug\\&quot; back in as easily.  </li>
            <li>If you take a bath weekly or even less, this pillow would most likely serve your needs.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable, but the suction cups popped out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>It was also comfortable, but had just a little \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to the skin when I pulled away.</li>
            <li>Wipe down with soap and water to clean.</li>
            <li>Smaller than desirable and not as comfortable as expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still firm and comfortable under my head in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>Because of the tub&#x27;s slanting back, I could not lay back comfortably without back pain.</li>
            <li>far she has had no problem</li>
            <li>Worth about $1.99 - certainly not over $20.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s going back, my only question is, do I actually give this to my wife?  </li>
            <li>I found myself constantly reattaching the suction cups (which are not always that easy to re-insert into the recessed areas, by the way), only to find myself needing to do it again a short time later.</li>
            <li>I have had my pillow for about 1 and half yaers and the suction cups have not separated ever since I put the super glue on them.</li>
            <li>It does from time to time looses its suction but that is to be expected and doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as others have mentioned.    </li>
            <li>Constructed of dense foam for a good cushion with 3 suction cups to hold in place and small enough to tuck away in a small drawer.</li>
            <li>Hi,   I opened the box (this is suppose to be a present for my beautiful wife) and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is firm and reminds me of a pillow that would be in a hot tub.  </li>
            <li>The stick is not enough to be uncomfortable, though, and the quality of the vinyl used is superior to the standard blow-up bath pillows I&#x27;ve used in the past for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUCTION: The Swissco has 8 small suction cups which are securely attached to the pillow.</li>

            <li> You simply apply a couple of drops of super glue to each suction cup and that will hold them in place with the pillow.</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for and will keep looking for something more similar to my last one.</li>
            <li> the only thing that could make this product better is if it wasn&#x27;t so flat.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little pillow.  </li>
            <li> I actually love turning it vertical (straight up and down) and having it cover a larger portion of my neck and head.</li>
            <li> On a flat dry surface, the Jellybean may have better suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a flat dry surface, the Jellybean may have better suction.    </li>
            <li> Comfy pillow, but suction cups on the back started popping off after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this pillow because it is soft &amp; has no hard edges.</li>
            <li> If you like long soaks, this is a cheap present to yourself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size, not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the suction cups to hold it onto the bath aren&#x27;t actually attached to the pillow, and they come out very easily, but don&#x27;t \\&quot;plug\\&quot; back in as easily.  </li>
            <li> If you take a bath weekly or even less, this pillow would most likely serve your needs.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable, but the suction cups popped out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> It was also comfortable, but had just a little \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to the skin when I pulled away.</li>
            <li> Wipe down with soap and water to clean.</li>
            <li> Smaller than desirable and not as comfortable as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still firm and comfortable under my head in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> Because of the tub&#x27;s slanting back, I could not lay back comfortably without back pain.</li>
            <li> far she has had no problem</li>
            <li> Worth about $1.99 - certainly not over $20.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s going back, my only question is, do I actually give this to my wife?  </li>
            <li> I found myself constantly reattaching the suction cups (which are not always that easy to re-insert into the recessed areas, by the way), only to find myself needing to do it again a short time later.</li>
            <li> I have had my pillow for about 1 and half yaers and the suction cups have not separated ever since I put the super glue on them.</li>
            <li> It does from time to time looses its suction but that is to be expected and doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as others have mentioned.    </li>
            <li> Constructed of dense foam for a good cushion with 3 suction cups to hold in place and small enough to tuck away in a small drawer.</li>
            <li> Hi,   I opened the box (this is suppose to be a present for my beautiful wife) and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is firm and reminds me of a pillow that would be in a hot tub.  </li>
            <li> The stick is not enough to be uncomfortable, though, and the quality of the vinyl used is superior to the standard blow-up bath pillows I&#x27;ve used in the past for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUCTION: The Swissco has 8 small suction cups which are securely attached to the pillow.</li>
            <li> This pillow is rather flat and does not give any support to your neck if you are using it in a standard bathtub.  </li>
            <li> At first I had a hard time getting it to stay in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Optimum placement would be on a tub that has a flat or gently-sloped lip, which is what ours has.</li>
            <li> The JellyBean has a flat vinyl surface.</li>
            <li> This provides a tiny ledge for your head, but absolutely no neck support.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it this will work over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I have had neck and back injuies and this surpasses the comfort of any other pillow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of the same material as found on a boat seat, albeit slightly softer.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I was very specific in what I was looking for: A bath pillow for a small person whose tub(S) are too long).</li>
            <li> Swissco Bath and Spa Pillow with Suction Cups]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that these two pillows would be much of a muchness for use on the lower back, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This one truly doesn&#x27;t attract the black mold, but may discolor to a yellowish color after a long use</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about this product and the biggest problem was that the suction cups kept coming apart from the pillow.</li>
            <li> If you are buying a bath pillow to support your head, there may be no difference, other than price, between these pillows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any of the problems other people speak of.  </li>
            <li> Even cleaned the area with wet cloth and tried to re-attach it, kept on falling down.</li>
            <li> I have bought, easily, 6 bath pillows in the last few months and have always been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I just had a ridiculously unnecessary condescending conversation with a woman who called back four days later.  </li>
            <li> Because once I got it wet a little</li>

            <li> I would pay for this pillow w/ shipping &amp; delivery charges around $20.95 just because its not worth $29.95  I got the pillow yesterday</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the suction cups come off &amp; sometimes it slides around.</li>
            <li> however after 5 minutes, I noticed the pillow was fell down.</li>
            <li> I kept on pressing on the pillow to attach it to the tub, kept on falling down.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t falling down.</li>
            <li> The pillow itself is of high quality, but it has turned out to be useless as a bath pillow because the suction cups do not stay attached to the pillow.  </li>
            <li> NOT A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER ORIENTED COMPANY&gt;</li>
            <li> It is pretty small (as another reviewer said), and in my opinion, it&#x27;s cold.  </li>
            <li> With all said, I would probably still prefer this pillow simply due to the non-popping and bacteria repelling qualities!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product due to the reviews and price of the foam pillow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now late July of 2013</li>
            <li> What do I mean by that?  </li>

            <li> Comfy pillow, but suction cups on the back started popping off after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t expect a foam pillow to defy the laws of physics, so I can&#x27;t complain that it isn&#x27;t useful for underwater (lumbar) support--wish I could find something like that.  And, if the designers wanted to add a loop somewhere so that it could be hung out of the way between baths, that would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it IS very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have bought, easily, 6 bath pillows in the last few months and have always been disappointed.  I am so glad I finally found this pillow and love it! I don&#x27;t have to blow the thing up, worry about it losing air, smooshing to nothing behind my neck and head, etc...The suctions work great and the pillow doesn&#x27;t move behind me.  Also, it is firm and reminds me of a pillow that would be in a hot tub.  I would highly recommend this pillow for anyone that likes to relax in the tub!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t think of much good to say about this product. When it first arrived, I noticed it has a nice texture and the foam had nice give to it, and I thought it was comfortable. Then the disappointment started...&lt;br /&gt;I attached it to the tub using the provided suction cups. The suction cups fit into recessed areas on the back of the pillow and are removable. This sounds okay, perhaps for cleaning, except for one major flaw -- they simply will NOT stay attached to the pillow. I found myself constantly reattaching the suction cups (which are not always that easy to re-insert into the recessed areas, by the way), only to find myself needing to do it again a short time later. However, I&#x27;d paid for the thing and was determined to keep trying, so I used it off and on for a month. By the end of the month, the pillow was malformed, and the suction cups were as fickle as ever. I finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to you? Keep looking. This one looks like a nice (and not ugly) bath pillow, but it simply does not perform as hoped. Mine is literally going in the trash. :-(</li>
            <li> I am a person who takes a bath almost every night and have been searching for a bath pillow that will stand up to daily use.  This pillow is nice because it doesn&#x27;t hold mold or bacteria and is fairly comfortable but the suction cups do not work as well as I had hoped.  For those of us who take a lot of baths, we know there are two problems with pillows: popping holes in the blow up kind AND suction cups that actually hold the pillow to the bathtub.  These suction cups actually pop out of the pillow which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t rip when there is a lot of movement but they really don&#x27;t have the stay put quality I was looking for.  If you take a bath weekly or even less, this pillow would most likely serve your needs.  With all said, I would probably still prefer this pillow simply due to the non-popping and bacteria repelling qualities!!!</li>
            <li> Going back through Amazon purchases, trying to look up an item, and saw that I purchased this back in 2011.  It&#x27;s now late July of 2013 and this item is still in great shape.  The vinyl surface has never mildewed or torn.  It&#x27;s still firm and comfortable under my head in the bathtub.  If you like long soaks, this is a cheap present to yourself.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> Suction cups pull off and don&#x27;t stay in place. Expensive for inferior product. material and cushioning are good. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> I gave my wife this bath pillow some time ago and it is still going strong.  I didn&#x27;t quite give a fifth star because the cover has kind of rotated around the &amp;#34;stuffing&amp;#34; some.  It still works fine though, and has not developed any mold.  The suction cups can pull out of the back, but I think that is by design so that you can clean underneath them.  It might be a little small, if you want a larger one you should keep looking, but all in all it has worked well for us.</li>
            <li> More expensive than the cheap blow up pillows, but as with most things -- you get what you pay for.  If you take frequent baths, this is a good investment in your long term comfort.  Feels fabulous on the neck and holds well. Doesnt absorb water, so never gets smelly! Wipe down with soap and water to clean.</li>
            <li> Does turn color on edges after a couple of years, but other than that, it&#x27;s ideal for bath use.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001KO7Q2 JellyBean Luxury Bath Tub &amp; Spa Foam Waterproof Pillow - Black]]This product is very good. Comfortable and easy to clean.I enjoy it very much. I read other reviews about this product and the biggest problem was that the suction cups kept coming apart from the pillow. Well I found a solution to that problem. You simply apply a couple of drops of super glue to each suction cup and that will hold them in place with the pillow. I have had my pillow for about 1 and half yaers and the suction cups have not separated ever since I put the super glue on them.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it is supposed to. It attaches well, is a good shape and is pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for use in my bathtub.  It is more comfortable than the blow-up ones and stays cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I received this pillow.  I had already had a bad experience with ordering a spa pillow from another company through Amazon.  This one was a pleasant surprise.  It&#x27;s great quality and comfortable and I believe it&#x27;s not going to turn moldy after using it for a while.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was the suction is not the greatest but I&#x27;ve yet to find one that has great suction.  It&#x27;s worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the only thing that could make this product better is if it wasn&#x27;t so flat. I also have this suction pillow in the below link (pillow D).  It was a better design but not as soft.  The shape of the pillow to this link is actually designed to conform to your neck and head better.    [...]</li>
            <li> I would pay for this pillow w/ shipping &amp; delivery charges around $20.95 just because its not worth $29.95  I got the pillow yesterday and I put it right away in the tub however after 5 minutes, I noticed the pillow was fell down. I kept on pressing on the pillow to attach it to the tub, kept on falling down. Even cleaned the area with wet cloth and tried to re-attach it, kept on falling down. So I shall see! Maybe it needs some of that hot water heat and it will stick to the tub.Because once I got it wet a little it wasn&#x27;t falling down.So my only disappointment-wasn&#x27;t sticking to the tub.</li>
            <li> Nice design. Size and shape are very accommodating. Very durable too. And I should mention that it&#x27;s comfortable, feeling quite cushy and plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optimum placement would be on a tub that has a flat or gently-sloped lip, which is what ours has. Two medium-sized suction cups hold the pillow in place. Note, though, that they would not work well if you try to stick them to a textured surface, such as tile or granite. That wouldn&#x27;t prevent you from using the pillow, but it would be a tad more cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> At first I had a hard time getting it to stay in place. Once I was able to do that it has worked out OK. I have tried so many before and this one for now seems to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this pillow for my wife as a Christmas stocking stuffer.  The pillow itself is of high quality, but it has turned out to be useless as a bath pillow because the suction cups do not stay attached to the pillow.  The design of the knob-and-socket suction cup attachments seems to be entirely faulty.</li>
            <li> I use this pillow in my hot tub and I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t get moldy or gross and is perfect for making leaning against my tub comfortable and relaxing.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the price.  I would not buy this pillow again.  The suction cups pop out not only when the pillow is in use but even when you&#x27;re trying to pop them back in.  Very annoying.  Worth about $1.99 - certainly not over $20.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply looking for a pillow to cushion the space between me and the bath.  I just had a ridiculously unnecessary condescending conversation with a woman who called back four days later.  She could not answer any question. She could not be bothered.  I was very specific in what I was looking for: A bath pillow for a small person whose tub(S) are too long). aShe just kept referring me to her website.  Their outgoing message left during the day, implied that they were gone weeks ago and would be back on July 5.  NOT A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER ORIENTED COMPANY&gt;</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product due to the reviews and price of the foam pillow but I went and purchased anyway.    LOVE IT. It&#x27;s perfect. Doesn&#x27;t get mold, it&#x27;s soft and is just the right size. It does from time to time looses its suction but that is to be expected and doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as others have mentioned.    Pro tip: I actually love turning it vertical (straight up and down) and having it cover a larger portion of my neck and head.</li>
            <li> Hi,   I opened the box (this is suppose to be a present for my beautiful wife) and was disappointed.  It&#x27;s made of the same material as found on a boat seat, albeit slightly softer.  It is pretty small (as another reviewer said), and in my opinion, it&#x27;s cold.  What do I mean by that?  It just doesn&#x27;t have that comfy, &#x27;fall in love with it,&#x27; feel.  I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s going back, my only question is, do I actually give this to my wife?  If I do she&#x27;ll probably think I bought it from big lots or Kolh&#x27;s in the dollar bin.  That&#x27;s the actually problem with it... it doesn&#x27;t have that 22.95 feel... it&#x27;s got the 6.99 feel.</li>
            <li> Pillow is not all its cooked up to be. It will, not stick to the tub[[ASIN:B0001KO7PI White JellyBean Luxury Bath/Spa Pillow for Indoor/Outdoor]]</li>
            <li> I like this bath pillow, feels very good, comfortable and pliable.  Easily washable so it stays clean.  My only complaint is that the suction cups to hold it onto the bath aren&#x27;t actually attached to the pillow, and they come out very easily, but don&#x27;t \\&quot;plug\\&quot; back in as easily.  This is annoying as I would like to have it held in place, but it doesn&#x27;t work out that way.  Still very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace another foam pillow that I have had for several years.  This pillow is rather flat and does not give any support to your neck if you are using it in a standard bathtub.  If you have a tub w/ a sloped back, I&#x27;m sure it is fine as a head cushion, but my old pillow was much thicker and actually supported my neck/head while lying in the tub.  This provides a tiny ledge for your head, but absolutely no neck support.  Not what I was hoping for and will keep looking for something more similar to my last one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she uses it in her bath. Made of a durable plastic for water use.</li>
            <li> Product is overpriced. Smaller than desirable and not as comfortable as expected. Pillow needs to be \\&quot;fuller\\&quot;, thicker and more pillow-like for comfort.</li>
            <li> Holding up well in the water with no leak issues or breaks in the seams. Not inflatable so you know, it has foam inside. Wish it was a little bigger. Took off the suction cups as they just got in the way of moving around. Your millage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.  The suction cups did not hold well in the tub.  The design was not as comfortable and it looks.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, but the suction cups popped out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to clean. This one truly doesn&#x27;t attract the black mold, but may discolor to a yellowish color after a long use</li>
            <li> great fit for my neck in a tub that doesn&#x27;t have a big rim</li>
            <li> This bath pillow simple doesn&#x27;t work. The suction cups do not hold it to the tub. It slips and slides and pops up when you lay back on it.</li>
            <li> shape and appearance are nice.  the back suction cups pop out too easily though.  You can stick them back in.  I don&#x27;t know it this will work over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It looks great in my tub- very clean and simple. The greatest issue is that the suction cups will not stick to the tub. I&#x27;ve tried a dozen times, and it inevitably falls to the bottom of the tub when there is no water, or floats away until I get in when there is. I want it to stick in the same place so I can just leave it there. It&#x27;s driving me crazy that it won&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  Constructed of dense foam for a good cushion with 3 suction cups to hold in place and small enough to tuck away in a small drawer.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my tub. this is a very comfortable spa pillow and I would recommend it be purchased again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife last Christmas.  It worked fine for about a month but then the suction started to give out.  Its constantly sliding all over the our Jacuzzi tub.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before ordering and did use the super glue trick to keep the suction cups in place. It is clean and comfortable. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this pillow one day but I will say that it is the most comfortable bath pillow I have had. I have had my whirlpool tub for twelve years now. I have gone through many bath pillows. None of them had the comfort of this one. ALL of the others split open, molded and did not hold up for over six months. I have had neck and back injuies and this surpasses the comfort of any other pillow.</li>
            <li> I like this pillow because it is soft &amp; has no hard edges. My only complaint is that the suction cups come off &amp; sometimes it slides around. It is still the best pillow I have used despite these other issues. If the suction cups stayed in &amp; stuck more securely it would be a perfect pillow. If I had to replace it I would buy this one again because it is soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago, I had my first ever bout with sciatica - a humbling experience. One pleasure this malady affected was my ability to relax in a tub. Because of the tub&#x27;s slanting back, I could not lay back comfortably without back pain. My solution was to get a bath pillow that would support my lower back. This review is for my experience concerning back comfort in the tub. If you are buying a bath pillow to support your head, there may be no difference, other than price, between these pillows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bath pillows to try out. I&#x27;m putting this review on both pillows&#x27; amazon pages, and on each pillow&#x27;s page I&#x27;m adding a photo of the back of that pillow.&lt;br /&gt;The first pillow is this JellyBean Luxury Tub &amp; Spa Foam Waterproof Pillow&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0001KO7PI JellyBean Luxury Bath Tub &amp; Spa Foam Waterproof Pillow - White]]&lt;br /&gt;and the second is the Swissco Bath and Spa Pillow&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0021LL1MM Swissco Bath and Spa Pillow with Suction Cups]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that these two pillows would be much of a muchness for use on the lower back, but I was wrong. I found that there was a difference when the pillows were used against my back and under the waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE: The JellyBean pillow is an inch wider than the Swissco, but this did not make a difference to my comfort. The Swissco is an inch longer than the JellyBean, but also did not make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE: The Swissco has a perforated skin, which I found it comfortable. The JellyBean has a flat vinyl surface. It was also comfortable, but had just a little \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to the skin when I pulled away. The stick is not enough to be uncomfortable, though, and the quality of the vinyl used is superior to the standard blow-up bath pillows I&#x27;ve used in the past for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUCTION: The Swissco has 8 small suction cups which are securely attached to the pillow. I couldn&#x27;t pry one off with my thumb. The JellyBean has three large suction cups. These detach fairly easily. I was testing below the waterline. The Swissco stayed put before, during and after the bath. The JellyBean detached as soon as I leaned forward and floated up on the water. The middle suction cup came off of the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my curved tub back, the Swissco works better and feels more comfortable. On a flat dry surface, the Jellybean may have better suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Readerbefore, during and after the bath. The JellyBean detached as soon as I leaned forward and floated up on the water. The middle suction cup came off of the pillow.    For my curved tub back, the Swissco works better and feels more comfortable. On a flat dry surface, the Jellybean may have better suction.    Happy Reader</li>
            <li> If you own a clawfoot, you know many of the accessories you can get for more modern tubs won&#x27;t always work in an old clawfoot.  This pillow &#x27;sticks&#x27; just fine to the back, and provides a real nice head-rest when having a soak in the tub.  It&#x27;s a nice size, not too big, not too small.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews that said it won&#x27;t stick, or tears up easily.... To me it seems to be made from sturdy material, it&#x27;s waterproof, it sticks just fine, easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve not had any of the problems other people speak of.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Helps a standard tub feel like a spa. Material is sturdy, comfortable, and mildew proof. Stays adhered and yet is easily detached.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little pillow.  It looks good, feels good and arrived quickly to my doorstep.  It looks like it will stand the test of time too - it won&#x27;t deflate that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter ans she likes it very much&lt;br /&gt;So  far she has had no problem</li>
