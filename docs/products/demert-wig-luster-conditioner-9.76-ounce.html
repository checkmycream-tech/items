            <li>But either way, it works great!</li>
            <li>Works great as advertised, I just wish the conditioner effect lasted longer!</li>
            <li>I was very happy &amp; one can goes along way.</li>
            <li>I have one Remy wig and one synthetic, and I feel this works best on the synthetic.</li>
            <li>All of them have been excellent.  </li>
            <li>I think it leaves a bit of residue, but it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Best wig conditioner for the buck!</li>
            <li>This product is very good</li>
            <li>it makes my wigs so beautiful after I spray them &amp;does help with the tangels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t have any gigantic tangles.</li>
            <li>Works great on all of my synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a product called \\&quot;Happy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on my own hair, and it works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioning spray on my synthetic wigs for years and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I can say that I&#x27;ve experienced with Demert wig luster conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the way that Demert Wig Luster conditions and makes the wigs hair feel and look.</li>

            <li>I contacted the seller and they were very kind and courteous to resolving any issues I had with the product.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this spray makes the hair feel softer and gives it a beautiful natural shine and luster.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Works best on real hair and not synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>so I must find ways to extend the life of the wigs I own.</li>
            <li>and it detangles my weaves also, and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ok for helping to comb out wigs that are tangled, but I find children&#x27;s spray conditioner works just as well, honestly.</li>
            <li>as far as synthetics are concerned, it works great!</li>
            <li>It smelled better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>My wig was look better than  before I&#x27;ve spray it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the bother of these products.</li>
            <li>It came on time, perfectly packaged &amp; it only takes a little&lt;br</li>
            <li>For human hair, I like Silky Strands the best, which is sold at Sally beauty supply.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this spray on my wigs for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is an item that I recommended people buying.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>So much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE demert wig shampoo</li>
            <li>It gives them a wondeful sheen and a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This spray is easy to apply and makes storing the wig a snap.</li>
            <li>It really lives up to its name adding a believable luster &amp; nice conditioning.  </li>
            <li>It makes the wig smell, feel, and look good as new.</li>
            <li>Great product, thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Its a very light lanolin spray, but it is very handy for conditioning and untangling long wigs.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>arnt always cheap</li>
            <li>This is keeping them clean and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>Great product I will definitely re-order soon.</li>
            <li>I buy wig spray for two main reasons: to condition my wigs and to give them a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>It conditions very well and keep your pieces looking brand new and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is an aerosol because it&#x27;s much easier to control the amount one puts on their hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to be a bit frizzy when the weather is humid, and this conditioner helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Thank-you so much!!</li>
            <li>; looking or heavy &amp; the pleasant smell is light</li>
            <li>You just spray it on your whole wig and it gives it a nice fresh look that&#x27;s soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t get rid of any huge tangles (&gt;2in diameter) at the bottom of the wig, especially if the tangles look more like tumbleweeds.</li>
            <li>Brought a nice shine back to synthetic wig after washing.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price and lives up to the claims on the product.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I like for the spray to have a nice smell especially since I&#x27;m using it on synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I found that if I used this right before combing it does help a lot.</li>
            <li>The product works very well for wigs and really makes them nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to spray a lot to give your  but its great for bringing old units back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Part of the reason is because it&#x27;s aerosol, so it&#x27;s very good at reaching knots that have amassed on the inner layers on the wig (the &amp;#34;bird nest&amp;#34;), which isn&#x27;t so much of a problem with human hair.</li>
            <li>There may be others out there as good or better but for me; why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was always told to get rid of the synthetic hair if it even starts to nap up so quickly then go out and buy a new on.</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner spray for human hair not synthetic the only reason I say that is it leaves your wigs looking and feeling oily</li>
            <li>I own 4 wigs and have used this so far on the 3 that are human hair.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used this I love it, it makes any wig last longer, if you&#x27;re a dancer live by this!</li>
            <li>This wig hair spray is a pretty decent product for use on your wigs.</li>
            <li>I just spray it on and the wig looks natural and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The when I went to style the wig, the style wouldn&#x27;t hold very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I do not like the spray because unlike the name of the spray, it provides no luster, shine, or sheen to hair and it smells like straight alcohol which is a turnoff.  </li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear wigs on a regular basis, so I cannot honestly say how much build up would occur when using this product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This is not really conditioner- more like a hair spray.</li>
            <li>Where the shampoo leaves wigs feeling crunchy and frizzy, this smooths and softens wigs back to their original lustre.</li>
            <li>Product works fine, took quite a long time to be delivered</li>
            <li>This was something that I was really concerned about, however there&#x27;s NO reason to worry about it happening with this particular brand!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far my experience with this item has been positive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend spraying this outside, because the scent is just unbelievably overpowering, and that can&#x27;t be a good thing to breathe!</li>
            <li>I straightened my wig and it killed it, but this made it look so much better.</li>
            <li>I find it takes out frizz and static and isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice a difference on my new wig at all.</li>
            <li>It leaves your wigs feeling soft and natural and really helps bring out their colors.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that makes synthetic hair come back as close to it&#x27;s original shape as possible.</li>
            <li>I combined it with an oil free wig shine spray, and it really helps the wig hairs that would have become hard and brittle.</li>
            <li>What I like about this spray is that it is not heavy</li>
            <li>It does work and well on old wigs.</li>
            <li>Makes the volume and shine pop and really brings back the curl to my pieces.</li>
            <li>I would be completely lost with out this product..</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would keep it soft.</li>
            <li>I care for 8 wigs in total as a cosplayer and I rely on this after a few wears for brushing :)</li>
            <li>Only need a quick spritz for natural looking results so a can lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>First off, I tried this on a long, tangled Kanekalon wig and a long Halloween wig.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is actually higher quality than the typical Halloween wig and cost about $60 as a point of reference.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use this, but this only seems to dry out  my hair (natural and synthetic).</li>
            <li>I just really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a spray can, and it goes everywhere, so I would say, don&#x27;t use it in a little bathroom.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it will revive old, dull synthetic hair, but for me I think it&#x27;s helping to keep my add-ons from becoming dull in the 1st place.</li>
            <li> /&gt; The only reason I didn&#x27;t add a fifth star is because I&#x27;ve only used the product in a limited amount.</li>
            <li> generally apply Demert every other day or as needed.  </li>
            <li> Short bursts, don&#x27;t get the wig soaking wet.</li>
            <li> The aerosol allows for long sweeps across the hair making even coats.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner did almost nothing to either remove existing small snarls or prevent new ones.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed this on my long length wig, mostly at the bottom to keep it from tangling so badly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on dry hair and wet hair</li>
            <li> and you look like your hair is greasy, so a little goes a very long way, and one can will last for eons.  </li>
            <li> This product, along with careful handling and haircutting/trimming etc DOES JUST THAT.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, it is extremely inexpensive compared to other wig conditioners.</li>
            <li> then only negative is that it is aerosol</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried a few other &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; sprays and they make the hair look oily and</li>
            <li> I also apply it after the hair has been shampooed and still slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and the results are &amp;#34;noticeable!&amp;#34;  From dull to shine!  </li>
            <li> Again, I might be missing something, but this does not seem to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not really anything negative</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or shiney residue on the wig  or wigs.</li>
            <li> It helped a lot in detangling human hair after washing without leaving it so glossy it looked fake.  </li>

            <li> I had quite an ordeal getting this stuff. I was sent Nail stuff instead by mistake and it took forever for them to get me my correct order. Once I got it, I used it on a wig I was working on. The when I went to style the wig, the style wouldn&#x27;t hold very well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok for helping to comb out wigs that are tangled, but I find children&#x27;s spray conditioner works just as well, honestly.</li>
            <li> First off, I tried this on a long, tangled Kanekalon wig and a long Halloween wig. I also tried it on an untangled Kanekalon wig and a Hannah Montana wig ($7 at wal-mart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It instantly made the hair easier to comb. The hair was softer and straighter afterwards. It smelled better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t get rid of any huge tangles (&gt;2in diameter) at the bottom of the wig, especially if the tangles look more like tumbleweeds. It&#x27;ll only get rid of the tangle if it&#x27;s not too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A confused bee kept coming over when I was spraying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT &#x3D; It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t have any gigantic tangles. It makes the wig smoother and prettier. My advice is that you spray it on the wig the moment you get it out of the bag. That way, you can avoid any big tangles.</li>
            <li> I got this to help repair a wig that is badly damaged and it helped some but mainly just makes them shine again</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use this, but this only seems to dry out  my hair (natural and synthetic). I&#x27;ve tried it on dry hair and wet hair and it&#x27;s all the same. Again, I might be missing something, but this does not seem to work.</li>
            <li> I always use this on my wigs after every wear for my princess business. I take the time to use as DIRECTED. Short bursts, don&#x27;t get the wig soaking wet. It works wonders on wigs you might think ruined. Keep your wigs from getting ruined before they get ruined! Use it after every wear! Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It makes the wig smell, feel, and look good as new.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely necessary accompaniment to the shampoo. Where the shampoo leaves wigs feeling crunchy and frizzy, this smooths and softens wigs back to their original lustre. I just really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a spray can, and it goes everywhere, so I would say, don&#x27;t use it in a little bathroom. But either way, it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on both synthetic and human hair wigs.  It helped a lot in detangling human hair after washing without leaving it so glossy it looked fake.  Brought a nice shine back to synthetic wig after washing.  I would recommend to all wig users.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. You just spray it on your whole wig and it gives it a nice fresh look that&#x27;s soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> Without this conditioner, getting the wig to untangle was a pain the butt.  This spray is easy to apply and makes storing the wig a snap.</li>
            <li> I straightened my wig and it killed it, but this made it look so much better. It also worked for tangles. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that makes synthetic hair come back as close to it&#x27;s original shape as possible. I found that if I used this right before combing it does help a lot. I combined it with an oil free wig shine spray, and it really helps the wig hairs that would have become hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, ruined my wig. My wig was look better than  before I&#x27;ve spray it. Now, my wig it&#x27;s like hit by humidity, I&#x27;ve wish I never sprayed my wig,</li>
            <li> Works great as advertised, I just wish the conditioner effect lasted longer!</li>
            <li> It works, smells good too. I spray it on my wigs and it makes them feel softer and   looks shiny.</li>
            <li> Works best on real hair and not synthetic wigs. Synthetic wigs still tangle and hard to brush out even with the looper brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the bother of these products. After taking/advice from stylist, friends, and ect... I was always told to get rid of the synthetic hair if it even starts to nap up so quickly then go out and buy a new on. They probably knew about this brand beofreI even found out and were just being jerks about it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of cosplay wigs &amp; I hate to have to brush out the tangles because these&lt;br /&gt;Wigs arnt always cheap so I bought this. It came on time, perfectly packaged &amp; it only takes a little&lt;br /&gt;to help with the matting. I was very happy &amp; one can goes along way. I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> I have one Remy wig and one synthetic, and I feel this works best on the synthetic. Part of the reason is because it&#x27;s aerosol, so it&#x27;s very good at reaching knots that have amassed on the inner layers on the wig (the &amp;#34;bird nest&amp;#34;), which isn&#x27;t so much of a problem with human hair. It isn&#x27;t that it doesn&#x27;t work on human hair - it does - but it does wonders for synthetics. For human hair, I like Silky Strands the best, which is sold at Sally beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Good spray for shine.  A little goes a long way. Good size  can. Fast delivery, last a long time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Product works fine, took quite a long time to be delivered</li>
            <li> It came very fast and was packaged very well. I contacted the seller and they were very kind and courteous to resolving any issues I had with the product. The product works very well for wigs and really makes them nice and soft and shiny. Thank-you so much!!</li>
            <li> Works great on all of my synthetic wigs. I wear them just when I am growing my short hair out and in the weird stage. This is keeping them clean and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference in using this on wigs.</li>
            <li> I have tried three of the Demert Products for wigs.  All of them have been excellent.  I will reorder them again.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford a big wig collection so I must find ways to extend the life of the wigs I own. This product, along with careful handling and haircutting/trimming etc DOES JUST THAT. It is worth the price and lives up to the claims on the product.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner spray for human hair not synthetic the only reason I say that is it leaves your wigs looking and feeling oily</li>
            <li> I buy wig spray for two main reasons: to condition my wigs and to give them a nice sheen.  Additionally, I like for the spray to have a nice smell especially since I&#x27;m using it on synthetic hair.  Well, I do not like the spray because unlike the name of the spray, it provides no luster, shine, or sheen to hair and it smells like straight alcohol which is a turnoff.  The only benefit is that it slightly conditions but considering the other drawbacks, it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a product called \\&quot;Happy Hair\\&quot; or \\&quot;Lanolin Perfection\\&quot;, but I could find neither one.  After doing some research online, I happened across this product called Demert Wig Luster Conditioner.  Just like the brands I was searching for, this is an aerosol conditioner that also contains Lanolin.  I love the fact that it is an aerosol because it&#x27;s much easier to control the amount one puts on their hair.  Too much and you look like your hair is greasy, so a little goes a very long way, and one can will last for eons.  I&#x27;ve been using this product on my own hair, and it works wonderfully!  My hair tends to be a bit frizzy when the weather is humid, and this conditioner helps tremendously.  I will definately be purchasing it again (if I can still find it by the time I need another can).</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product. nothing else compares to this brand. then only negative is that it is aerosol so it is not good for the eco system but it works like a charm. It conditions very well and keep your pieces looking brand new and smelling great.</li>
            <li> My sister loves the wig. I am going to buy her another like it but with a different short style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray on my wigs for many years. It gives them a wondeful sheen and a nice fresh smell. There may be others out there as good or better but for me; why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
            <li> Great product I will definitely re-order soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is an item that I recommended people buying. This was definitely the site to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioning spray on my synthetic wigs for years and it works great.  What I like about this spray is that it is not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  I also like the coverage aerosol spray provides.  The aerosol allows for long sweeps across the hair making even coats.  Best of all, this spray makes the hair feel softer and gives it a beautiful natural shine and luster. Ive tried a few other &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; sprays and they make the hair look oily and fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally apply Demert every other day or as needed.  I also apply it after the hair has been shampooed and still slightly damp.  You really don&#x27;t need to spray a lot to give your  but its great for bringing old units back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not really anything negative I can say that I&#x27;ve experienced with Demert wig luster conditioner.  I have not used it on human hair, so I can not attest to how it works in that scenario and as far as synthetics are concerned, it works great!</li>
            <li> I own 4 wigs and have used this so far on the 3 that are human hair. I find it takes out frizz and static and isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has synthetic wigs. It leaves your wigs feeling soft and natural and really helps bring out their colors. Also, it is extremely inexpensive compared to other wig conditioners. My only issue with this product is one of the cans I ordered arrived with a damaged lid.</li>
            <li> Its a very light lanolin spray, but it is very handy for conditioning and untangling long wigs. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and the results are &amp;#34;noticeable!&amp;#34;  From dull to shine!  From ratty to smoother!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It works well and gas a good smell however when I opened it the lid (?) was all shattered there was tape around it to protect the lid but it did not work</li>
            <li> This product is very good it makes my wigs so beautiful after I spray them &amp;does help with the tangels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this I love it, it makes any wig last longer, if you&#x27;re a dancer live by this!</li>
            <li> I have a synthetic wig with a lot of snarls.  It is actually higher quality than the typical Halloween wig and cost about $60 as a point of reference.  This conditioner did almost nothing to either remove existing small snarls or prevent new ones.  Furthermore, this aerosol came in a simple box with no packing and it took forever to arrive.  I&#x27;m amazed it did not explode in transit, but still feel the shipping was careless.</li>
            <li> It does work and well on old wigs.</li>
            <li> Product smells pleasent and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on anything it lands on beyond the wig. Makes the volume and shine pop and really brings back the curl to my pieces. I care for 8 wigs in total as a cosplayer and I rely on this after a few wears for brushing :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  So much better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.  It really lives up to its name adding a believable luster &amp; nice conditioning.  Not &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; looking or heavy &amp; the pleasant smell is light so it doesn&#x27;t compete w/my perfume.  Have had no problem w/accumulation either.  Only need a quick spritz for natural looking results so a can lasts a long time. Don&#x27;t know if it will revive old, dull synthetic hair, but for me I think it&#x27;s helping to keep my add-ons from becoming dull in the 1st place.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for synthetic hair. I just spray it on and the wig looks natural and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the way that Demert Wig Luster conditions and makes the wigs hair feel and look. I would be completely lost with out this product..</li>
            <li> it gives my wig shine,conditions  and it detangles my weaves also, and it smells really nice. i actually got compliments on my hair alot</li>
            <li> This wig hair spray is a pretty decent product for use on your wigs. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or shiney residue on the wig  or wigs. This was something that I was really concerned about, however there&#x27;s NO reason to worry about it happening with this particular brand!&lt;br /&gt; The only reason I didn&#x27;t add a fifth star is because I&#x27;ve only used the product in a limited amount. I don&#x27;t wear wigs on a regular basis, so I cannot honestly say how much build up would occur when using this product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is not really conditioner- more like a hair spray. I didnt notice a difference on my new wig at all. I was hoping this would keep it soft.</li>
            <li> This product does make the wig lustrous, without adding a fake shine.  I sprayed this on my long length wig, mostly at the bottom to keep it from tangling so badly.  It does work well, and it&#x27;s a big can for the price.  I would definitely recommend spraying this outside, because the scent is just unbelievably overpowering, and that can&#x27;t be a good thing to breathe!</li>
            <li> I think it leaves a bit of residue, but it works wonderfully. So far my experience with this item has been positive. It&#x27;s what I needed for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I LOVE demert wig shampoo but this conditioning spray is horrible, gives the texture of hairspray to the wig.  Do not use under any circumstances!!</li>
            <li> Best wig conditioner for the buck!</li>
