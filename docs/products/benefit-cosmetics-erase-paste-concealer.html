    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years, and it&#x27;s still the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power and find that also after an hour</li>
            <li>Its perfect for under eyes</li>
            <li>and it looks absolutely flawless.  </li>
            <li>This product matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase.  </li>
            <li>The stuff does NOT budge (comes off great with cleanser though).</li>
            <li>It had great coverage, blended well</li>
            <li>but I got this tip from Birchbox and it works great.</li>
            <li>and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I definitely experienced an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>then a fine all over dusting of Hello Flawless powder.</li>
            <li>It is fairly pigmented, and is the creamiest concealer i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>&quot; the color was really good for my yellowish undertones.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>this concealer is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I heard that Erase Paste was amazing</li>
            <li>but honestly you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at a time.</li>
            <li>Covers my dark circles wonderfully and makes me look much more bright and awake, BUT it is rather greasy and needs to be set with powder or make-up setting spray.</li>
            <li>Ok, here we go, I first used this product from one of my girlfriends and totally loved it , so i decided to get my own</li>
            <li>I truly love this cream and I am over 60.</li>
            <li>Not only that but the thickness of the product was perfect for all day/night wear.  </li>
            <li>Love the creamy ness and it doesnt crease:)</li>
            <li>and I could layer it and build better coverage for hiding darker spots.</li>
            <li>I really love Benefit products.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my appearence.  </li>
            <li>Great product really covers and stays on</li>
            <li>The price is great and the shipping is fast...</li>
            <li>I bought a concealer brush to be able to blend well.  </li>
            <li>I iced my eyes most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Else, hold out for a more thorough</li>
            <li>Nice, though it immediately settled into fine lines, even finished with a light powder.</li>
            <li>Not the best for chronic dark circles...but better than most.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that in photographs the light doesn&#x27;t pick up on my concealer anymore like it used to.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Covers easily with just a itsy bitsy bit and pat it on.  </li>
            <li>The Benefits Cosmetics paste is perfect for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>It settles in to every fine line and doesn&#x27;t blend at all.</li>
            <li>Erase Paste comes recommended for neutralizing bluish tints under the eye and smoothing fine lines while not settling into them.  </li>
            <li>fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super!  </li>
            <li>(It is also available on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>Also good for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This concealer works better for me that any others, it works great for covering my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I was worried about using this paste at first because I have very oily skin, but buffing it on with Sephora&#x27;s concealer brush sets the paste nicely.  </li>
            <li>You just need to lightly swipe a finger across the line and it smooths right out though.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many the last few years and this one is the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Cons: doesn&#x27;t have good staying power, settles into fine lines, only 3 shades to choose from and are pink-toned, high end price-wise</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and does the best job possible concealing dark circles.</li>
            <li>sister used to work for Benefit and gave me a container of this about 6 months ago, 25 years after my concealer hunt as a 10 year old began :)</li>
            <li>It smelled like freshly melted crayons.</li>
            <li>I ended up going to Sephora which is right by my house, knowing they sold Benefit products.  </li>
            <li>on Saturday night i felt an itch under my right eye.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and helps cancel out the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that the concealer is bit too soft and mushy, so you kinda have to apply alot to get really good coverage.  </li>
            <li>If you have many creases or wrinkles then buy some white cream before using.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this product it was an addition to a sample pack that I had purchased that had \\&quot;girl meets pearl\\</li>
            <li>My first thought was \\&quot;WHOA</li>
            <li>I have to say it was love at second sight</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty pricey in my opinion).</li>
            <li>Pros: nicely pigmented, very creamy and blendable, alittle goes a long way  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  glad I tested this at my local Sephora &amp; didn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>my Erase Paste lasts that much longer.&lt;br /&gt;Happy concealing!</li>
            <li>only thing that I don&#x27;t love is that it tends to settle into under eye creases.</li>
            <li>I have under eye circles that need some coverage and Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste is the ONLY product out there I have found that not only has good coverage, but also blends in well without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>will most definitely be returning this concealer in hopes of finding one that actually neutralizes the bluish tints without looking like fine crazing around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This concealer did an amazing job covering up my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Just as effective and costs a fraction less.</li>
            <li>This product settled into every little fine line around my eyes &amp; I don&#x27;t have that many that are obvious , but this found them and actuated them &amp; made them more obvious !!</li>
            <li>&quot; (all I really wanted was the girl meets pearl travel size for my makeup bag)</li>
            <li>This product really does work to use for coverage of skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>I usally moisturize well before applying any sort of concealor, and that worked very well.</li>
            <li>Then gently pat with ring finger until blended into the skin</li>
            <li>I really do like this product</li>
            <li>this stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;Also, check to see what you are allergic to.</li>
            <li>The paste is very creamy and goes on like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>what i received was not of same quality as store bought; did not recieve in original packaging; makes me doubt if imitatation or defective</li>
            <li>It covers more than just dark area under my eyes</li>
            <li>Coverage was good, and my circles were less noticeable, so long as it is well blended and set with powered.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen - Punta Gorda, Fl</li>
            <li>: Lancome&#x27;s Maquicomplet Complete Coverage Concealer worked out better for me, but it&#x27;s also more expensive.</li>
            <li>It looked dewy throughout the day, mostly because I don&#x27;t usually use much powder.</li>
            <li>Live in Florida</li>
            <li>I have pretty hardy skin, but I feel like if I used it all the time, it would definitely lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this concealer, as it&#x27;s touted as the go-to cover up for dark circles around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I looked ten years older!</li>
            <li>Once I blended and got my powder foundation on it was seamless.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a concealer that looks natural and</li>
            <li>far, I have used it every time i go out</li>
            <li>After a couple of hours it turned completely cakey.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you are young and/or do not have the concern of under eye shadowing or lines, this may work well.</li>
            <li>if you have yellow/olive undertones (like I do), be wary as the color may not be a good match.    </li>
            <li>Better coverage of dark circles than previously used concealers but product is very cakey.</li>
            <li>This covers dark circles, acne, and scars super well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the constant search for the perfect concealer to cover my dark undereye circles, and unfortunately i&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li>I only needed a bit of product to cover my huge, horrendous, hereditary dark circles that used to take mounds of concealer to cover.</li>
            <li>and i ordered the exact same thing i used from my friend, but big surprise when i got it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty tan and yellow, so it was obvious that the color did not match my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful with how much you try to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once that cleared up, my friends immediately noticed a difference in my dark circles but couldn&#x27;t quite figure out, at first, what was different!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Certain intolerances (even slight ones and not flat out allergic reaction foods) to foods will also cause dark circles that you think are purely hereditary!</li>
            <li>I rubbed it against my fingers to warm it up, like the other reviews suggested, but it was still very thick.</li>
            <li>was to cancel out the dark circles (not to be used for blemishes) and the product was to be applied by dabbing movements really working it around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps cover the dark spots under my eyes as well as the redness from blemishes.</li>

            <li> It also takes a while for it to dry enough before you can put on your foundation.</li>
            <li> For the past week, I&#x27;ve been applying ointments, taking Claritin, allergy eye drops, and today my eyes are almost back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I thought with it being so creamy that it wouldn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and end up looking cakey; I was wrong, after an hour</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super!  This does not cause creases as a few have stated. If you have many creases or wrinkles then buy some white cream before using. If you have wrinkles always cover with white cream . Never fill them with med concealer it will make them deeper...This is the best concealer I have ever used. I would recommend buying lighter than usual. I truly love this cream and I am over 60. Either the price has went up since I last purchased this or Sephora sells it cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years, and it&#x27;s still the best on the market.  Goes on smoothly and does the best job possible concealing dark circles. Also good for people with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m prone to breakouts from common ingredients in cosmetics but never had a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> I have under eye circles that need some coverage and Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste is the ONLY product out there I have found that not only has good coverage, but also blends in well without looking cakey. I used to use lancome maquicomplet but it wasn&#x27;t enough coverage. This product is less expensive and is worth every penny!     Word of warning I tried the same product in the tube and it was NOT the same coverage, stick to this round container product.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product it was an addition to a sample pack that I had purchased that had \\&quot;girl meets pearl\\&quot; (all I really wanted was the girl meets pearl travel size for my makeup bag) I thought I&#x27;d just give it a whirl and see how it worked out.  My first thought was \\&quot;WHOA this is way too thick and WAY too PINK!\\&quot; I thought maybe I just got the complete wrong color so I tossed it aside.  I usually use \\&quot;stay don&#x27;t stray\\&quot; for my concealer.  However I was on their website a few weeks later and came across a \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; video for erase paste.  Then I figured out the the melon undertone to the product was to cancel out the dark circles (not to be used for blemishes) and the product was to be applied by dabbing movements really working it around the eye area.  So I gave it another shot. Once I tried this it worked gloriously I only needed a bit of product to cover my huge, horrendous, hereditary dark circles that used to take mounds of concealer to cover. Once I blended and got my powder foundation on it was seamless. Not only that but the thickness of the product was perfect for all day/night wear.  The stuff does NOT budge (comes off great with cleanser though). What&#x27;s even better is that in photographs the light doesn&#x27;t pick up on my concealer anymore like it used to.  I have to say it was love at second sight and i&#x27;ll never question Benefit again.</li>
            <li> Not the best for chronic dark circles...but better than most.</li>
            <li> This product really does work to use for coverage of skin discoloration. Would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> didnt work at all. too expensive for no positive results, and also is kind of oily for any type of skin. not recomended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the constant search for the perfect concealer to cover my dark undereye circles, and unfortunately i&#x27;m still looking. I&#x27;d heard lots of praise for Benefit Erase Paste, and i figured i&#x27;d take the plunge (it&#x27;s pretty pricey in my opinion). It is fairly pigmented, and is the creamiest concealer i&#x27;ve ever used. I thought with it being so creamy that it wouldn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and end up looking cakey; I was wrong, after an hour or so it does and accentuates those lines. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power and find that also after an hour or so I have to reapply. I will say that even though it&#x27;s on the pricey side ($26 for 0.15 oz), you do get what you pay for in that you only need to use the tiniest amount, so I can see this one little pot lasting a very long time. Also, there are only 3 colors to choose from, and the medium color (which is closest to my color match-wise) is rather pink-toned, so if you have yellow/olive undertones (like I do), be wary as the color may not be a good match.    Pros: nicely pigmented, very creamy and blendable, alittle goes a long way  Cons: doesn&#x27;t have good staying power, settles into fine lines, only 3 shades to choose from and are pink-toned, high end price-wise</li>
            <li> Its perfect for under eyes but I also use it at eyelid primer before I put eye shadow on. Love the creamy ness and it doesnt crease:)</li>
            <li> Saw this on pinterest and the comments had me believing this was the miracle I&#x27;d been looking for. Very disappointed. Was really thick and didn&#x27;t cover as it claimed it would.</li>
            <li> Better coverage of dark circles than previously used concealers but product is very cakey. If you don&#x27;t blend well it will get into creases.</li>
            <li> This covers dark circles, acne, and scars super well. The only problem I have with it is that it tends to look cakey especially under the eyes so you have to be careful with how much you try to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the easiest way to apply it is with your fingers. Since it is so thick, brushes tend to leave streaks throughout it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you only need to use the tiniest amount when you apply it, this little jar will last you FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the benefit I ordered. it was very pink . it did not mention that the concealor had a pink tone. it is of no use to me</li>
            <li> My only tiny complaint is that this product is described as a brighting camouflage. It is not a camouflage product like those used in the theater and for people trying to hide scars or tatoos.  For that you need a heavy duty product from Kryolan, or a similar manufacturer. This is a thick product.  I usally moisturize well before applying any sort of concealor, and that worked very well. It had great coverage, blended well and I could layer it and build better coverage for hiding darker spots. It looked dewy throughout the day, mostly because I don&#x27;t usually use much powder. In another review, someone had mentioned that it made her skin look dry. If you have dry skin (and ladies - let&#x27;s face it, as we age...our skin is only getting drier)this product may look sort of cakey. But it need not if you moisterize properly. I really love Benefit products. This is another winner in my book.</li>
            <li> what i received was not of same quality as store bought; did not recieve in original packaging; makes me doubt if imitatation or defective</li>
            <li> Ok, here we go, I first used this product from one of my girlfriends and totally loved it , so i decided to get my own and i ordered the exact same thing i used from my friend, but big surprise when i got it, I applied it on my face and it doesnt look the same, the color is different, like it is a few shades lighter,and it doesnt feel the same, the texture of it is different, so I hate to say it but it is not it is supposed to be</li>
            <li> This concealer works better for me that any others, it works great for covering my dark circles. I&#x27;ve tried so many the last few years and this one is the best for me.  It takes a little practice applying it, otherwise it can be tough to blend but I got this tip from Birchbox and it works great. If you &amp;#34;cook&amp;#34; your concealer. By &amp;#34;cooking&amp;#34; I mean after applying foundation, you use your ring finger and pat it on and leave it- don&#x27;t blend just let it sit under eyes for 7-15 minutes while you do your hair or brows something. Then gently pat with ring finger until blended into the skin and I like to set mine with a blotting powder and then a fine all over dusting of Hello Flawless powder. and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every concealer on the planet for my dark circles.  I heard that Erase Paste was amazing so I ordered it and gave it a try.  I tried applying it with my fingers and had some trouble getting the cream the blend.  I ended up going to Sephora which is right by my house, knowing they sold Benefit products.  I asked a sales associate how she recommend I apply this concealer.  She sold me the \\&quot;Sephora Collection Pro Airbrush Concealer\\&quot; brush and it made all the difference in the world.  (It is also available on Amazon).  She showed me how to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; the concealer into the skin with the brush and it looks absolutely flawless.  I was worried about using this paste at first because I have very oily skin, but buffing it on with Sephora&#x27;s concealer brush sets the paste nicely.  For anyone applying it with their fingers, I recommend purchasing this brush.  I swirl a tiny bit (a little goes a long way) onto my concealer brush, and then apply it by moving the brush in circles under and around my eye.  I have gotten so many compliments on my appearence.  Hope this helps! Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> Great product really covers and stays on</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Use it all over my face.  Live in Florida and it covers the brown freckels.  Highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen - Punta Gorda, Fl</li>
            <li> This concealer did an amazing job covering up my dark circles. My only issue was that the concealer is bit too soft and mushy, so you kinda have to apply alot to get really good coverage.  It also takes a while for it to dry enough before you can put on your foundation.</li>
            <li> This product is not a great concealer, if you do have a bad dark circles it&#x27;ll not hide it very well</li>
            <li> The Benefits Cosmetics paste is perfect for my dark circles. This product matches my skin tone perfectly. I have been searching for a concealer that looks natural and this concealer is my favorite! I got the medium color. I will continue to use this product forever. I recommend this product to Amazon&#x27;s customers. The price is great and the shipping is fast...</li>
            <li> This product settled into every little fine line around my eyes &amp; I don&#x27;t have that many that are obvious , but this found them and actuated them &amp; made them more obvious !! I looked ten years older! I&#x27;m  glad I tested this at my local Sephora &amp; didn&#x27;t buy it so I didn&#x27;t have to deal w/ returning it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product It covers more than just dark area under my eyes It also covers blemishes or discoloration</li>
            <li> I like some benefit cosmetics but something about this is all wrong. It settles in to every fine line and doesn&#x27;t blend at all. I&#x27;ve never been hAppier with then less-than-perfect skin I have!</li>
            <li> I started using concealer in 5th grade. I had hereditary dark circles that actually came with a line on the skin that differentiated them b/w my cheek and themselves, they were so bad.&lt;br /&gt;My sister used to work for Benefit and gave me a container of this about 6 months ago, 25 years after my concealer hunt as a 10 year old began :)&lt;br /&gt;God send! For those long-time circle suffers who have been self conscious and never go out w/o makeup b/c of your circles this stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;Also, check to see what you are allergic to. Pollen, trees, foods, etc. Certain intolerances (even slight ones and not flat out allergic reaction foods) to foods will also cause dark circles that you think are purely hereditary! I figured mine out and it turned out my \\&quot;hereditary dark circles\\&quot; were 75% processed food allergy related. Once that cleared up, my friends immediately noticed a difference in my dark circles but couldn&#x27;t quite figure out, at first, what was different!&lt;br /&gt;Now my Erase Paste lasts that much longer.&lt;br /&gt;Happy concealing!</li>
            <li> I checked out this product in the store before buying it so I knew i was a Medium. Product is the same as sold as retailers. It is also a little cheaper depending on the store.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have used it every time i go out and it really helps cover the dark spots under my eyes as well as the redness from blemishes. I would recommend this product. However, I wish it was cheaper. The amount you get is very minimal but honestly you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at a time. I use a q-tip size amount or less total each time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a concealer that is blend-able, lite weight and works under eyes as well as on breakouts. This one does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this multiple times and it lasts forever (approx 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is that it tends to settle into under eye creases. You just need to lightly swipe a finger across the line and it smooths right out though.</li>
            <li> I purchased the tiny container of Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste on a whim at Ulta&#x27;s checkout. It was $10 in the &#x27;medium&#x27; color. I did some research on it afterwards, and learned that it only came in three colors to begin with. I swatched it on my hand and realized that it was way too pink for my skin. I&#x27;m pretty tan and yellow, so it was obvious that the color did not match my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the coloring a problem with the erase paste, the texture and smell definitely put me off. It was very, very, very thick, as the name may have tipped off. I rubbed it against my fingers to warm it up, like the other reviews suggested, but it was still very thick. The smell was also offputting. It smelled like freshly melted crayons. The smell, coupled with the texture definitely turned me off to this product. I have pretty hardy skin, but I feel like if I used it all the time, it would definitely lead to breakouts. I would not recommend this. I returned it a day after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It covers every flaw I need to cover its expensive but worth it. I may not purchase again due to the fact it was expensive.</li>
            <li> This product definitely does its job! Covers my dark circles wonderfully and makes me look much more bright and awake, BUT it is rather greasy and needs to be set with powder or make-up setting spray.</li>
            <li> Bought this on 11/27  for my hereditary dark circles.  A little goes a long way. I bought a concealer brush to be able to blend well.  Coverage was good, and my circles were less noticeable, so long as it is well blended and set with powered.  I did have to touch up and re-blend because it does settle a bit in lines.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day but I used it on the 29th and on dec 1.  on Saturday night i felt an itch under my right eye.  i woke up to ugliest puffiness.  I iced my eyes most of the day.  i used it again on sunday (because it just hadn&#x27;t dawned on me that it was the concealer that was causing my issues.  On monday the itching and puffiness was even worse.  I thought maybe it was seasonal allergies, but i have never experienced symptoms like that.  I thought it might be another product, but i didn&#x27;t discontinue using that product, only the concealer.  For the past week, I&#x27;ve been applying ointments, taking Claritin, allergy eye drops, and today my eyes are almost back to normal.  I definitely experienced an allergic reaction.  I bought a drug store brand concealer In the meantime and used it today without a reaction.  I also returned this product.  A shame too, because it was not cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and helps cancel out the dark circles under my eyes. I think it&#x27;s way over priced though and will look for a less expensive comparable on the market. I know there has to be an equivalent out there some where.  2 years later: Yes, I found an equivalent, the salmon paste from Korea sold here on Amazon. Just as effective and costs a fraction less.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this concealer, as it&#x27;s touted as the go-to cover up for dark circles around the eyes. Erase Paste comes recommended for neutralizing bluish tints under the eye and smoothing fine lines while not settling into them.  I found it doesn&#x27;t cover eye circles and it definitely settles into fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using \\&quot;Fair,\\&quot; the color was really good for my yellowish undertones.  The paste is very creamy and goes on like a lotion.  Nice, though it immediately settled into fine lines, even finished with a light powder. After a couple of hours it turned completely cakey. Eyeliner and mascara on bottom lashes didn&#x27;t bleed into it, though, which is a switch from other creamier concealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be returning this concealer in hopes of finding one that actually neutralizes the bluish tints without looking like fine crazing around my eyes. Perhaps if you are young and/or do not have the concern of under eye shadowing or lines, this may work well. Else, hold out for a more thorough option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Lancome&#x27;s Maquicomplet Complete Coverage Concealer worked out better for me, but it&#x27;s also more expensive.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. It did nothing to &#x27;erase&#x27; anything. In fact, it made everything worse. For that amount of money, for a tiny bottle of the stuff, it should have worked. But no.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just as advertised.  Covers easily with just a itsy bitsy bit and pat it on.  DO not rub. Lasts all day and no greasy look.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and noticed the jar was plastic and not glass. The formula is very thin and lacks high pigment like the real stuff. Took it to the real benefit and they verified it is FAKE! Do NOT buy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.  Quick delivery,</li>
    </ol>
