            <li>I got this because I had not been able to find a good eye liner brush that didn&#x27;t make me want to throw it against the wall.</li>
            <li>Nice, quality eyeliner brush.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Thanks sigma:):)</li>
            <li>Thank you! :-) :-)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone mostly beginners</li>
            <li>I would like to purchase more brushes for this line.</li>
            <li>Such a great quality brush!</li>
            <li>I bought 3 more</li>
            <li>Looking forward to purchasing more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>This is authentic sigma.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great shipped fast</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE ...</li>
            <li>I ordered the sigma one hoping this one would pack on colors much better</li>
            <li>This brush is better than MAC&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail when it was supposed to, meaning it arrived on time, love the packaging</li>
            <li>Love using this for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It also does ok for lining with a bit of eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>it is perfect for applying gel liner and last forever, I recommend it to anyone looking for a gel liner brush!</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>you will love it :)</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this brush -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I can find a use for it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got</li>
            <li>they are much better (yet cheaper) than sephora brand eye pencils</li>
            <li>eyebrows are looking so much better while using this brush, as they provide a nice, even, precise shape.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to purchase an authentic Sigma E65, this is not it.</li>
            <li>She was very excited about receiving this brush.</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be pretty good.</li>
            <li>this little brush is great for eye liner and great for using with powder eye brow applications.</li>
            <li>Now, I assumed that these brushes would be on par (maaaybe a tad bit better) with the cheap brushes that I have always bought.</li>
            <li>Once product builds up on the bristles, you will not be able to get precise lines.</li>
            <li>have very sparse brows, and needed a good, well made reliable brow brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the perfect thickness for drawing in my eyebrows in a really quick flash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great brush- super fast shipping</li>
            <li>True to detail description!</li>
            <li>its so easy to use on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>Makes applying eyeliner easy</li>
            <li>but when I do, this brush makes it SO easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy now</li>
            <li>It makes eyeliner application so easy, all you do is tap the brush where you want to apply your liner.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best brush, hands down.</li>
            <li>great brush super soft works well!</li>
            <li>I needed a new eyeliner brush and this one seemed like a good price.  </li>
            <li>It gives a fine line.</li>
            <li>This is a FANTASTIC brush to use with gel eyeliner, it has changed the way I do my eyeliner--goes on so easily and evenly now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to splurge on brushes, but as someone who enjoys a &#x27;rockabilly&#x27; look, a fine angled brush is a necessity.</li>
            <li>For some people this may be fine, but I bought this brush for use with Anastasia dipbrow, and I prefer a thinner brush.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order some more!</li>
            <li>The brush has a great angle to use it as an eyeliner brush and its very hard so the lines are great.  </li>
            <li>The perfect little brush for my needs.</li>
            <li>I definitely get great use on it.</li>
            <li>I use everyday and it is holding up great!</li>
            <li>Works great for tightlining the upper eyelids too.</li>
            <li>A bit larger than what I expected/needed but great for applying powder to eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more very soon. :)</li>
            <li>That said I think this particular brush design has many more affordable dupes available.</li>
            <li>This brush makes it super easy to apply the liner, and I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try a cat liner with it.</li>
            <li>Makes everything go on super smooth.</li>
            <li>I recieved my order super fast!!!</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially perfect for doing a winged eyeliner look because you can get a clean wing without smudging or getting too thick.</li>
            <li>Anyways, after really using this brush for a few days and wiping it clean with a baby wipe in between uses, it is so precise at the tip and perfect!</li>
            <li>I produces a fine straight line and makes  a wing easy.  </li>
            <li>Not what I was expecting, BUT pleasently surprised at how much I liked this brush.</li>
            <li>First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!</li>
            <li>so I assume it&#x27;s worthy of 5 stars</li>
            <li>If you need a quick way to apply cream eyeliner, then this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>Although the shipping is free coming from Amazon, it is better to just pay the shipping fee and purchase it directly from Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Good brush for detailed, sharp liner.  </li>
            <li>This brush is easy to use, and makes putting eyeliner on much faster</li>
            <li>Definitely 100x better than the brush that comes with the liner!</li>
            <li>Just discovered them recently and hoping they will help me to be better at make up application!</li>
            <li>They are both good quality and get the shop done precisely, but sigma is half the price, therefore it gets my vote.</li>
            <li>always clean this brush after each use with a gentle face wash (like Ceravie) to keep it clean but hydrated.</li>
            <li>Because let&#x27;s be honest, everyone looks better with a little eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush for eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a thin line as a base.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more precise liner, go for the smaller Sigma E06.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li>/think about it more (synthetic vs natural)  to figure it out&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how thin it is great if you use Anastasia Dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li>Better than my MAC angled brushes which never seemed to be precise enough for</li>
            <li>It is the shortest angle brush I have been able to find so far, which I like because I like to use them for winged liner</li>
            <li>By far my favorite brushes are by Sigma.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch..</li>
            <li>If on a budget I would save money to use towards a more unique sigma brush such as the E25, there is no substitute for that one.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness.  </li>
            <li>I learned from them about an online blogger, and she was right.  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>After washing, dry with a smooth cloth and pull up from the metal edge on the handle (which is called the ferrule) to the top of the bristles; flattening and reshaping the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great for putting on gel eyeliner or getting eye shadow in a small spot.</li>
            <li>It works so well for brows because its small and allows to get a great shape with control.</li>
            <li>I feel like I went from novice to expert in about one week on drawing a very fine line on my upper lids.</li>
            <li>My old one comes to a point at the end which makes it easy to apply gel liner.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it is able produce good results for close-to-the-lash thin lines, which is my preferred look.</li>
            <li>and I have such great control that it&#x27;s no problem getting it exactly the same on both eyes.</li>
            <li>This brush is a bit soft and arrived with a huge chunk taken out of the side.</li>
            <li>first time I got it threw the mail</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thin eyebrows!</li>
            <li>so lines are perfectly straight!</li>
            <li>When I first received my e65 I really doubted it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several eyeliner brushes and this one is definitely my favorite for applying gel.</li>
            <li>review: This is my first sigma brush.  </li>
            <li>This one is very tiny which makes it perfect for someone with small eyebrows like mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll likely buy more brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li>I am in love with all of my Sigma brushes and this one isn&#x27;t any different!</li>
            <li>If Sigma could make another brush specifically for applying a thicker line of eyeliner with the same thickness in the handle (for better control), it probably would be a winner.</li>
            <li>Better hunting next time</li>
            <li>This brush is not thin enough to make a very fine line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the typical thin line brush and it was always a challenge to get that perfect flick, but this brush makes it so easy!</li>
            <li>Glad I spent a little bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li>Makes a very thin, absolutely PERFECT line...</li>
            <li>I was using another angled brush from sephora for many years and it was taking me so long to do my liner and thought maybe if I change brushes things would be quicker</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty stiff (in a good way, rather than an unpleasant one) and this brush is excellent for applying cream eyebrow products and (I assume) gel or powder eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I use MAC&#x27;s blacktrack gel fluid line and this brush makes the application so easy.</li>
            <li>it has also retained it shape very well.</li>
            <li>gave it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a really well made brush, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a real Sigma E65.</li>
            <li>cuz I really like it and use it though.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bend easier</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This brush makes putting on my gel eyeliner SO much easier than the brush the eyeliners come with.</li>
            <li>and it gets the job done very well .</li>
            <li>A makeup brush staple&lt;br /&gt;**Legit and real 👍&lt;br /&gt;**Hairs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comparable to Mac&#x27;s 263 brush</li>
            <li>This brush  holds and applies gel liner really well.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality product, but i dont know how to use it, thats my problem anyway, my pulse sucks</li>
            <li>, I own an entire collection of Sigma brushes and some I&#x27;ve purchased individually, and none of them came with the engraving on it saying &amp;</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and the size is right in my hand and for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought this to use with gel liner, but it&#x27;s too big for my liking.</li>
            <li>bought one, then threw out all my other angled brushes and bought two more.</li>
            <li>The brush can sometimes feel a little scratchy, but it is great for gel eyeliner (I use it with Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Long Wear Gel Eyeliner).</li>
            <li>What I do like is that the bristles are firm and don&#x27;t bend, so it&#x27;s very easy to control my lines.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more difficult to do a very precise line on the eye.</li>
            <li>It makes such fine lines and the bristles are extraordinarily soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brush, no complaints from the better half about it</li>
            <li>I do like however, the thickness of the handle, as it gives me better control when using my Mac Black Track Eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I came back and bought a second one :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sigma E65 eyeliner brush for gel liners.</li>
            <li>After hearing Jaclyn Hill just raveee about this brush I was expecting something completely amazing, but honestly it&#x27;s pretty much the same as the E.L.F small angle brush you can get for like a dollar.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever wear makeup aside from the quick and easy eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very easy to use and quite small.</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense and hold the right amount of product, and the tip is stiff enough to draw a very fine line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it wet on eyeshadow and it&#x27;s just as precise.</li>
            <li>What can i say, i&#x27;m obsessed with sigma brushes, it works great</li>
            <li>It is much thicker than the brush I purchased directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li>Use this everyday and love the brush.</li>
            <li>Doing a sexy cat eye takes all of a few seconds...</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the brush handle is somewhat longer than I&#x27;m used to, so I knock it into the mirror when I&#x27;m using it, but other than that it is awesome!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to go back 6 or 7 seven times to get my eyeliner right.</li>
            <li>This new one doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new staple in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>but I keep telling myself I need to find something new.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, it holds it&#x27;s shape well, and no shedding.</li>
            <li>very soft 🙌</li>
            <li>I was trying to replace a very old brush I use for applying powdered eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The brush that came with the eyeliner was flat, but with a rounded tip, and I was having a hard time getting a good line with it.</li>
            <li>This brush makes you feel like a professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li>It has completely improved my wing on my liner!</li>
            <li>I have so far used this as an eyebrow brush along with an eyeliner brush!</li>
            <li>I owned this exact brush that I purchased from Sigma&#x27;s website and this is not the same brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thin and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bristles are short enough and firm enough to give great control.</li>
            <li>I also ordered a small tapered blending brush and a flat kabuki and love them both just as much!</li>
            <li>The brush handle is slightly heavy which makes holding the brush easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same quality as the M.A.C brushes, if not better (in my own opinion, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never been so easy to tight line my eye balls!</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking to use it for a cateye look it seems to be too dense/thick to make a super sharp and defined flare.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from a sigma: Extremely soft and durable with no shed.</li>
            <li>The synthetic brush also is just SO soft.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for eyeliner, and it&#x27;s holding up well to frequent use.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the gel liner and it&#x27;s so much faster and easier than my last non-angled brush I got from Smashbox.</li>
            <li>My recent purchase of this brush came so much faster than the estimated delivery date</li>
            <li>my lashes are naturally curled</li>
            <li>Love my small angle!</li>
            <li>It takes this well and the bristles remain flat and straight, completely unfrayed.</li>
            <li>And press the bristles together firmly when wiping clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush due to the price and extremely favorable feedback, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more with the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>On top of ordering my three brushes, they gave me a small blending brush as an extra gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought every liquid liner available and I had trouble with all of them!</li>
            <li>After dabbing it in the pot and wiping the excess gel on the side, the brush is perfectly thin and coated with gel to make crisp, clean lines.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, stiff brush that holds it&#x27;s bristles tight.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this brush is too soft to be effective.</li>
            <li>a cat-eyes look on most days, and this has noticeably decreased the amount I struggle to make my line smooth and small.</li>
            <li>Brush is not stiff enough.</li>
            <li>The brush is small enough to reach your lash and water line for precise application.</li>
            <li>Smaller, tighter bristles, soft.  </li>
            <li>and yet it is soft enough for the under the eye area.  </li>
            <li>You can really make a super thin line.</li>
            <li>The hairs on this brush are tightly compacted, which is exactly waht I wanted in order to have control over the liner.</li>
            <li>Boy I was happy to be dead wrong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nothing that different really from my other eye liner brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a second one now because my first one was getting a little frayed and worn out after over a year of usage.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to control than your typical eyeliner brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine to apply a thin line of eyeliner but takes a lot of reapplying to draw a thicker line.</li>

            <li> I used to think that I honestly just could not &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had not been able to find a good eye liner brush that didn&#x27;t make me want to throw it against the wall.</li>
            <li> Nice, quality eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> If  you need a good angled liner brush I recommend The Crown C225 angled mini linerbrush is small,firm bristles and precise!</li>
            <li> Better than Mac Brush and a good price tooooo.</li>
            <li> Straight lines are perfect.</li>
            <li> I was so excited plus the packaging was great</li>

            <li> I had to purchase a MAC angle brush to be able to do a very fine line.</li>
            <li> Very precise and angled</li>
            <li> I needed a good eyebrow brush, and this was exactly what I needed!</li>

            <li> I love it more than my MAC brush.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Thanks sigma:):)</li>
            <li> Thank you! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone mostly beginners</li>
            <li> I would like to purchase more brushes for this line.</li>
            <li> Such a great quality brush!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 more</li>
            <li> Looking forward to purchasing more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> This is authentic sigma.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great shipped fast</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ...</li>
            <li> I ordered the sigma one hoping this one would pack on colors much better</li>
            <li> This brush is better than MAC&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail when it was supposed to, meaning it arrived on time, love the packaging</li>
            <li> Love using this for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It also does ok for lining with a bit of eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> it is perfect for applying gel liner and last forever, I recommend it to anyone looking for a gel liner brush!</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> you will love it :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this brush -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I can find a use for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got</li>
            <li> they are much better (yet cheaper) than sephora brand eye pencils</li>
            <li> eyebrows are looking so much better while using this brush, as they provide a nice, even, precise shape.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to purchase an authentic Sigma E65, this is not it.</li>
            <li> She was very excited about receiving this brush.</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be pretty good.</li>
            <li> this little brush is great for eye liner and great for using with powder eye brow applications.</li>
            <li> Now, I assumed that these brushes would be on par (maaaybe a tad bit better) with the cheap brushes that I have always bought.</li>
            <li> Once product builds up on the bristles, you will not be able to get precise lines.</li>
            <li> have very sparse brows, and needed a good, well made reliable brow brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the perfect thickness for drawing in my eyebrows in a really quick flash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great brush- super fast shipping</li>
            <li> True to detail description!</li>
            <li> its so easy to use on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Makes applying eyeliner easy</li>
            <li> but when I do, this brush makes it SO easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy now</li>
            <li> It makes eyeliner application so easy, all you do is tap the brush where you want to apply your liner.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best brush, hands down.</li>
            <li> great brush super soft works well!</li>
            <li> I needed a new eyeliner brush and this one seemed like a good price.  </li>
            <li> It gives a fine line.</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC brush to use with gel eyeliner, it has changed the way I do my eyeliner--goes on so easily and evenly now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to splurge on brushes, but as someone who enjoys a &#x27;rockabilly&#x27; look, a fine angled brush is a necessity.</li>
            <li> For some people this may be fine, but I bought this brush for use with Anastasia dipbrow, and I prefer a thinner brush.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to order some more!</li>
            <li> The brush has a great angle to use it as an eyeliner brush and its very hard so the lines are great.  </li>
            <li> The perfect little brush for my needs.</li>
            <li> I definitely get great use on it.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and it is holding up great!</li>
            <li> Works great for tightlining the upper eyelids too.</li>
            <li> A bit larger than what I expected/needed but great for applying powder to eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more very soon. :)</li>
            <li> That said I think this particular brush design has many more affordable dupes available.</li>
            <li> This brush makes it super easy to apply the liner, and I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try a cat liner with it.</li>
            <li> Makes everything go on super smooth.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order super fast!!!</li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially perfect for doing a winged eyeliner look because you can get a clean wing without smudging or getting too thick.</li>
            <li> Anyways, after really using this brush for a few days and wiping it clean with a baby wipe in between uses, it is so precise at the tip and perfect!</li>
            <li> I produces a fine straight line and makes  a wing easy.  </li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, BUT pleasently surprised at how much I liked this brush.</li>
            <li> First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!</li>
            <li> so I assume it&#x27;s worthy of 5 stars</li>
            <li> If you need a quick way to apply cream eyeliner, then this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Although the shipping is free coming from Amazon, it is better to just pay the shipping fee and purchase it directly from Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Good brush for detailed, sharp liner.  </li>
            <li> This brush is easy to use, and makes putting eyeliner on much faster</li>
            <li> Definitely 100x better than the brush that comes with the liner!</li>
            <li> Just discovered them recently and hoping they will help me to be better at make up application!</li>
            <li> They are both good quality and get the shop done precisely, but sigma is half the price, therefore it gets my vote.</li>
            <li> always clean this brush after each use with a gentle face wash (like Ceravie) to keep it clean but hydrated.</li>
            <li> Because let&#x27;s be honest, everyone looks better with a little eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a thin line as a base.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a more precise liner, go for the smaller Sigma E06.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> /think about it more (synthetic vs natural)  to figure it out&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how thin it is great if you use Anastasia Dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> Better than my MAC angled brushes which never seemed to be precise enough for</li>
            <li> It is the shortest angle brush I have been able to find so far, which I like because I like to use them for winged liner</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brushes are by Sigma.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch..</li>
            <li> If on a budget I would save money to use towards a more unique sigma brush such as the E25, there is no substitute for that one.</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness.  </li>
            <li> I learned from them about an online blogger, and she was right.  </li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> After washing, dry with a smooth cloth and pull up from the metal edge on the handle (which is called the ferrule) to the top of the bristles; flattening and reshaping the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great for putting on gel eyeliner or getting eye shadow in a small spot.</li>
            <li> It works so well for brows because its small and allows to get a great shape with control.</li>
            <li> I feel like I went from novice to expert in about one week on drawing a very fine line on my upper lids.</li>
            <li> My old one comes to a point at the end which makes it easy to apply gel liner.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it is able produce good results for close-to-the-lash thin lines, which is my preferred look.</li>
            <li> and I have such great control that it&#x27;s no problem getting it exactly the same on both eyes.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit soft and arrived with a huge chunk taken out of the side.</li>
            <li> first time I got it threw the mail</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin eyebrows!</li>
            <li> so lines are perfectly straight!</li>
            <li> When I first received my e65 I really doubted it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eyeliner brushes and this one is definitely my favorite for applying gel.</li>
            <li> review: This is my first sigma brush.  </li>
            <li> This one is very tiny which makes it perfect for someone with small eyebrows like mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll likely buy more brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li> I am in love with all of my Sigma brushes and this one isn&#x27;t any different!</li>
            <li> If Sigma could make another brush specifically for applying a thicker line of eyeliner with the same thickness in the handle (for better control), it probably would be a winner.</li>
            <li> Better hunting next time</li>
            <li> This brush is not thin enough to make a very fine line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the typical thin line brush and it was always a challenge to get that perfect flick, but this brush makes it so easy!</li>
            <li> Glad I spent a little bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Makes a very thin, absolutely PERFECT line...</li>
            <li> I was using another angled brush from sephora for many years and it was taking me so long to do my liner and thought maybe if I change brushes things would be quicker</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff (in a good way, rather than an unpleasant one) and this brush is excellent for applying cream eyebrow products and (I assume) gel or powder eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I use MAC&#x27;s blacktrack gel fluid line and this brush makes the application so easy.</li>
            <li> it has also retained it shape very well.</li>
            <li> gave it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a really well made brush, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a real Sigma E65.</li>
            <li> cuz I really like it and use it though.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bend easier</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush makes putting on my gel eyeliner SO much easier than the brush the eyeliners come with.</li>
            <li> and it gets the job done very well .</li>
            <li> A makeup brush staple&lt;br /&gt;**Legit and real 👍&lt;br /&gt;**Hairs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comparable to Mac&#x27;s 263 brush</li>
            <li> This brush  holds and applies gel liner really well.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product, but i dont know how to use it, thats my problem anyway, my pulse sucks</li>
            <li> , I own an entire collection of Sigma brushes and some I&#x27;ve purchased individually, and none of them came with the engraving on it saying &amp;</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and the size is right in my hand and for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this to use with gel liner, but it&#x27;s too big for my liking.</li>
            <li> bought one, then threw out all my other angled brushes and bought two more.</li>
            <li> The brush can sometimes feel a little scratchy, but it is great for gel eyeliner (I use it with Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Long Wear Gel Eyeliner).</li>
            <li> What I do like is that the bristles are firm and don&#x27;t bend, so it&#x27;s very easy to control my lines.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more difficult to do a very precise line on the eye.</li>
            <li> It makes such fine lines and the bristles are extraordinarily soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, no complaints from the better half about it</li>
            <li> I do like however, the thickness of the handle, as it gives me better control when using my Mac Black Track Eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I came back and bought a second one :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sigma E65 eyeliner brush for gel liners.</li>
            <li> After hearing Jaclyn Hill just raveee about this brush I was expecting something completely amazing, but honestly it&#x27;s pretty much the same as the E.L.F small angle brush you can get for like a dollar.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear makeup aside from the quick and easy eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very easy to use and quite small.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense and hold the right amount of product, and the tip is stiff enough to draw a very fine line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it wet on eyeshadow and it&#x27;s just as precise.</li>
            <li> What can i say, i&#x27;m obsessed with sigma brushes, it works great</li>
            <li> It is much thicker than the brush I purchased directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and love the brush.</li>
            <li> Doing a sexy cat eye takes all of a few seconds...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush handle is somewhat longer than I&#x27;m used to, so I knock it into the mirror when I&#x27;m using it, but other than that it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to go back 6 or 7 seven times to get my eyeliner right.</li>
            <li> This new one doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new staple in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> but I keep telling myself I need to find something new.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, it holds it&#x27;s shape well, and no shedding.</li>
            <li> very soft 🙌</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace a very old brush I use for applying powdered eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The brush that came with the eyeliner was flat, but with a rounded tip, and I was having a hard time getting a good line with it.</li>
            <li> This brush makes you feel like a professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li> It has completely improved my wing on my liner!</li>
            <li> I have so far used this as an eyebrow brush along with an eyeliner brush!</li>
            <li> I owned this exact brush that I purchased from Sigma&#x27;s website and this is not the same brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thin and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are short enough and firm enough to give great control.</li>
            <li> I also ordered a small tapered blending brush and a flat kabuki and love them both just as much!</li>
            <li> The brush handle is slightly heavy which makes holding the brush easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same quality as the M.A.C brushes, if not better (in my own opinion, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never been so easy to tight line my eye balls!</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking to use it for a cateye look it seems to be too dense/thick to make a super sharp and defined flare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from a sigma: Extremely soft and durable with no shed.</li>
            <li> The synthetic brush also is just SO soft.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for eyeliner, and it&#x27;s holding up well to frequent use.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the gel liner and it&#x27;s so much faster and easier than my last non-angled brush I got from Smashbox.</li>
            <li> My recent purchase of this brush came so much faster than the estimated delivery date</li>
            <li> my lashes are naturally curled</li>
            <li> Love my small angle!</li>
            <li> It takes this well and the bristles remain flat and straight, completely unfrayed.</li>
            <li> And press the bristles together firmly when wiping clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to the price and extremely favorable feedback, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more with the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> On top of ordering my three brushes, they gave me a small blending brush as an extra gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought every liquid liner available and I had trouble with all of them!</li>
            <li> After dabbing it in the pot and wiping the excess gel on the side, the brush is perfectly thin and coated with gel to make crisp, clean lines.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, stiff brush that holds it&#x27;s bristles tight.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this brush is too soft to be effective.</li>
            <li> a cat-eyes look on most days, and this has noticeably decreased the amount I struggle to make my line smooth and small.</li>
            <li> Brush is not stiff enough.</li>
            <li> The brush is small enough to reach your lash and water line for precise application.</li>
            <li> Smaller, tighter bristles, soft.  </li>
            <li> and yet it is soft enough for the under the eye area.  </li>
            <li> You can really make a super thin line.</li>
            <li> The hairs on this brush are tightly compacted, which is exactly waht I wanted in order to have control over the liner.</li>
            <li> Boy I was happy to be dead wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nothing that different really from my other eye liner brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a second one now because my first one was getting a little frayed and worn out after over a year of usage.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to control than your typical eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine to apply a thin line of eyeliner but takes a lot of reapplying to draw a thicker line.</li>
            <li> Not so hard that it is scratchy like so many others, but stiff enough to apply color where it is needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I will say this retains its shape after repeated use and daily cleaning&lt;br /&gt;There is something off about it, ie I have to apply multiple coats of fluidline/or cake eyeliner to get the same results of color payoff and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me the line that I want/resists a bit too much and is too stiff</li>
            <li> I have one that I bought about a year and a half ago, but it&#x27;s getting frayed, so I wanted to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> Firm enough to get tight lines right next to your lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried quite a few brushes, including a high end one like Bobbi Brown, and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t usually do too much for that</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes overall but this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The handle is also really long,</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like my flicks too terribly long.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it so much for my liner because it was a bit too thick, but for eyebrows this is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> It is stiff enough to give a precise line (for drawing individual hairs) but not so stiff that it is hard to use.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply the liner to the brush correctly, the brush will do it&#x27;s job correctly!</li>
            <li> It is much smaller -length-wise - than the Mac angled brush, or any other she has ever used.</li>
            <li> still use it but its not exactly 100% what I was looking for to do winged eyeliner which is why I only gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect eye liner brush, not too thick, not too thin, goes on easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This came with a split in the brush due to careless packaging, so the application process was not as smooth as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> but it has already paid for itself because I can use way less product with the same result.</li>
            <li> Same quality as department store cosmetic counter brushes for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> The brush also makes it easy to make thin or thick (by layering) lines.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a little pricy.</li>
            <li> A little smaller then expected</li>
            <li> its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but even though I hated it I wanted to give it a fair chance because everyone raves about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few other brushes that were too stiff or too soft..</li>
            <li> I use it to add a little liner on the outer half of my eye, and also add eyeliner under my upper lid (to the tightline).</li>
            <li> I ordered both of these brushes due to a YouTube video I saw</li>
            <li> Works well for an eyeliner brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it to create a sharp tip at the end.</li>
            <li> will try out other Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble making a thin straight line like I like to do.</li>
            <li> This one is not as wide and not as thin, so it was hard to get used to at first.  </li>
            <li> The bristles just aren&#x27;t thick and dense enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> There was black shavings from the paint all over.</li>
            <li> i feel like it is slightly overpriced, but i do not regret spending the money on it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that I lost a few bristles off the brush already.</li>
            <li> I use my Maybelline eye studio gel eyeliner in blackest black.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes for way less.</li>
            <li> The tip of the wing comes out a little too chunky, but for tight-lining it might be the works.</li>
            <li> It also has an engraving of some other number or letters, but they are too small to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as narrow as I would like</li>
            <li> I use it to do eye makeup everyday now.</li>
            <li> I am a complete novice at using gel liner, and didn&#x27;t want to purchase a really expensive brush if I was going to give up on the idea.</li>
            <li> It is firm, well constructed and balances well in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given myself a few months to get used to it</li>
            <li> These brushes are made to last, and they are half the cost of expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm and they do not fall out!</li>
            <li> sigma small angle is not in the box but in the invoice</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend $14 on a small brush</li>
            <li> I saw how inexpensive these Sigma brushes were and bought three of them, including the Sigma small angle brush.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used brushes like the e10 and e05 with no luck.</li>
            <li> this one becomes TINY, so thin!</li>
            <li> I tried this Sigma E65 Small Angle brush to do my \\&quot;winged eyeliner\\&quot; and found that it did somewhat well.</li>
            <li> This brush is not authentic.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;spend hundreds of dollars on brushes when I hardly ever wear makeup.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get to the lash line....</li>
            <li> It was way too thick to get my winged eyeliner</li>
            <li> However I would not use this brush for thick lined cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin and stiff that creating and building the gel liner up is effortless.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone who uses a gel eyeliner, anyone who likes a thin line or anyone who likes a thick line..</li>
            <li> These brushes are getting hard to find anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It might work for those who like to app[y eyeliner thinly, but not for those who like a thicker line.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as dramatic.  </li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t skip on the eyelid or bend in the wrong the places.</li>
            <li> And I literally got three for the price of 1 brush at some expensive makeup store.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s fake , i dnt know</li>
            <li> The bristles also separate when you&#x27;re trying to apply liner which makes it very difficult.</li>
            <li> Which of course, ended up also being the worst brushes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the perfect brush for eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a thin line as a base.&lt;br /&gt;Some eyeliner brushes tend to make a thicker line from the start.&lt;br /&gt;This brush allows you the ability to gauge the width of the eyeliner drawn line.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  I&#x27;m still getting use to applying eye liner with this brush.  It is very precise and good quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. Found this to work best with cream or gel products like eye liner.</li>
            <li> Best eye liner brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is great quality at an amazing price.  Will recommend this product, and similar products to everyone!  Will be purchasing similar products immediately!</li>
            <li> This brush is great! The brush is small enough to reach your lash and water line for precise application. Works great with powder eyeliner, haven&#x27;t tried it with gel-liner though. The brush handle is slightly heavy which makes holding the brush easy. Arrived on time and was packaged well. So far I&#x27;m really happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with my Maybelline gel eyeliner. The brush that came with the eyeliner was flat, but with a rounded tip, and I was having a hard time getting a good line with it. This angled brush is perfect! The bristles are short enough and firm enough to give great control. I got an effortless perfect line the first time I used the brush. I highly recommend it for this purpose.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit soft and arrived with a huge chunk taken out of the side. There was black shavings from the paint all over.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for daughter. She was very excited about receiving this brush.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely loving this brush. It is by far the best liner brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great angled bush! I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now, and it hasn&#x27;t shed. it has also retained it shape very well.</li>
            <li> I love it  and i will buy all sigma brush</li>
            <li> does NOT work for gel liner. Brush is not stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gotta love sigma brushes, even if I don&#x27;t always love the price.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for my eyeliner and eyebrows. I love it more than my MAC brush.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this to use with gel liner, but it&#x27;s too big for my liking. I ended up using this to line/smudge my lower lash line. If you&#x27;re looking for a more precise liner, go for the smaller Sigma E06.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still gave it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a really well made brush, just not what I was looking for. The bristles are very soft, it holds it&#x27;s shape well, and no shedding.</li>
            <li> I use it for shaping/applying powder to my eyebrows. It also works as an excellent gel/powder liner brush. It&#x27;s everything you&#x27;d expect from a sigma: Extremely soft and durable with no shed. That said I think this particular brush design has many more affordable dupes available. If on a budget I would save money to use towards a more unique sigma brush such as the E25, there is no substitute for that one. (IMO)</li>
            <li> I chose this brush because it was recommended by a YouTube makeup artist who never uses anything else. I was more than pleased. The brush withstands daily surface cleaning with a makeup brush spray cleaner. This entails a vigorous back and forth motion on a paper towel or cloth to get the finer particles out. It takes this well and the bristles remain flat and straight, completely unfrayed. It lays down a perfect, PERFECT line every time. As long as you apply the liner to the brush correctly, the brush will do it&#x27;s job correctly! I highly recommend the Sigma E65 eyeliner brush for gel liners. I haven&#x27;t used it for anything else but gel liners. Works like a top!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a real Sigma E65. I have one that I bought about a year and a half ago, but it&#x27;s getting frayed, so I wanted to purchase a new one. This one is bigger and the bristles just aren&#x27;t the same. My old one comes to a point at the end which makes it easy to apply gel liner. This new one doesn&#x27;t do that. The bristles also separate when you&#x27;re trying to apply liner which makes it very difficult. I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product..its so easy to use on my eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;The first time I got it threw the mail I was so excited plus the packaging was great&lt;br /&gt;Thanks sigma:):)</li>
            <li> once again i am very very satisfied with my purchase. the quality of the product is excellent and i would recommend to anybody. I will be purchasing more very soon. :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS brush! Perfect for my eyeliner and lets me get into the lash line absolutely perfectly! First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!</li>
            <li> Not as narrow as I would like so it&#x27;s more difficult to do a very precise line on the eye. Using as an eyebrow brush instead.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really liked this brush. It seems to be very easy to use and quite small. It is much smaller -length-wise - than the Mac angled brush, or any other she has ever used.</li>
            <li> After hearing Jaclyn Hill just raveee about this brush I was expecting something completely amazing, but honestly it&#x27;s pretty much the same as the E.L.F small angle brush you can get for like a dollar. I still gave it 4 stars cuz I really like it and use it though. It&#x27;s just nothing that different really from my other eye liner brushes.</li>
            <li> The perfect little brush for my needs.</li>
            <li> Love it!! The brush is soft and the size is right in my hand and for my eyes. I use it to do eye makeup everyday now. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a little pricy.</li>
            <li> Cand  on time. Thank you! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> Great brush, I use it for my Anastasia eyebrow gel and then wipe it off and use it for my gel eyeliner. I definitely get great use on it.</li>
            <li> I ordered both of these brushes due to a YouTube video I saw and I love them already!!!  Perfect for eye liner &amp; for concealer!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin eyebrows! Very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bend easier so lines are perfectly straight! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good brush for detailed, sharp liner.  i feel like it is slightly overpriced, but i do not regret spending the money on it.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect! every girl needs it to draw a cat eye .It draws the line perfectly and easily , really awesome &lt;3</li>
            <li> When I first received my e65 I really doubted it! It was way too thick to get my winged eyeliner how I like it but even though I hated it I wanted to give it a fair chance because everyone raves about it. Anyways, after really using this brush for a few days and wiping it clean with a baby wipe in between uses, it is so precise at the tip and perfect! You can really make a super thin line. Just wanted to share for anyone who doubts this brush like I did :) Give it time! And press the bristles together firmly when wiping clean.</li>
            <li> This a great bush! The bristles are firm and they do not fall out! I use everyday and it is holding up great!</li>
            <li> Works well for an eyeliner brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it to create a sharp tip at the end. The tip of the wing comes out a little too chunky, but for tight-lining it might be the works.</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of stiffness and thickness in the bristles. I&#x27;ve tried several eyeliner brushes and this one is definitely my favorite for applying gel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows, soft yet durable.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I use MAC&#x27;s blacktrack gel fluid line and this brush makes the application so easy. I was using another angled brush from sephora for many years and it was taking me so long to do my liner and thought maybe if I change brushes things would be quicker and I was right. This brush doesn&#x27;t skip on the eyelid or bend in the wrong the places. I would recommend this brush to anyone mostly beginners because applying gel liner with this brush is very simple and you may have an easier time.</li>
            <li> Perfect angle brush. Not so hard that it is scratchy like so many others, but stiff enough to apply color where it is needed.</li>
            <li> Great liner brush. From all the liner brushes I&#x27;ve bought have to say this is the best!! Great for gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I figured I should update my review because I no longer use this brush as a liner brush.  I now use it to fill in my brows and it works GREAT for that.  The bristles are just the right stiffness.  I didn&#x27;t like it so much for my liner because it was a bit too thick, but for eyebrows this is not a problem.  It&#x27;s actually the perfect thickness for drawing in my eyebrows in a really quick flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;previous review: This is my first sigma brush.  I needed a new eyeliner brush and this one seemed like a good price.  My sephora brush is basically falling apart after a year of use.  This one is not as wide and not as thin, so it was hard to get used to at first.  It still gets the job done for my cat eyeliner look but it isn&#x27;t as dramatic.  The handle is also really long, which some people like but I&#x27;m not a fan of.  What I do like is that the bristles are firm and don&#x27;t bend, so it&#x27;s very easy to control my lines.  I would like to purchase more brushes for this line.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner brush is a must if you like using gel eyeliner.  Makes applying eyeliner easy and if you like the winged eye look- this brush makes it effortless.  It&#x27;s the best brush, hands down.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my eyeliner and it is wonderful.  I produces a fine straight line and makes  a wing easy.  Has kept its shape after continued use and washings.  Price is great</li>
            <li> I used to think that I honestly just could not &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; eyeliner. However, I purchased this brush and have been using it to apply &amp;#34;Maybelline Studio Drama&amp;#34; gel eyeliner and it is AMAZING. Speeds up the process and is very precise and creates beautiful lines. I use it to add a little liner on the outer half of my eye, and also add eyeliner under my upper lid (to the tightline). Definitely 100x better than the brush that comes with the liner! Such a great quality brush!</li>
            <li> sigma small angle is not in the box but in the invoice</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner brush. I use it with gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This brush does things I never realized a brush could do. I was hesitant to spend $14 on a small brush but it has already paid for itself because I can use way less product with the same result. It works great with powder as well as gel or liquid. I can&#x27;t brag on this brush enough.</li>
            <li> best brush for eyebrows</li>
            <li> Best gel eyeliner brush that I have tried. This brush works great!</li>
            <li> love it! i use it to put on gel liner its soooo smooth great way to put on liner good job with this brush will purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I am a complete novice at using gel liner, and didn&#x27;t want to purchase a really expensive brush if I was going to give up on the idea. I bought this brush due to the price and extremely favorable feedback, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more with the rave reviews. The hairs on this brush are tightly compacted, which is exactly waht I wanted in order to have control over the liner. This brush makes it super easy to apply the liner, and I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day. I feel like I went from novice to expert in about one week on drawing a very fine line on my upper lids. Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush and fast shipping!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on cake eyeliner.  I bought 3 more so I would not have to worry about finding a good brush for many years!</li>
            <li> I heard about this brand from a YouTube channel. I needed a good eyebrow brush, and this was exactly what I needed! It&#x27;s the perfect size for gel eyeliner or filling in your brows, and holds up well under cleaning. It picks up a good amount of product as well. Will continue to use this brand of brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> this little brush is great for eye liner and great for using with powder eye brow applications. It gives a fine line.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOVE this brush!  I am now a Sigma fan!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear makeup aside from the quick and easy eyeliner and mascara. Because let&#x27;s be honest, everyone looks better with a little eyeliner and mascara. But i have never ever ever invested in quality brushes.  I&#x27;m not going to&lt;br /&gt;spend hundreds of dollars on brushes when I hardly ever wear makeup. So brush shopping for me was the equivalent of me wandering into Sephora and buying the cheapest brushes possible. Which of course, ended up also being the worst brushes possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided it was time for a change. I saw how inexpensive these Sigma brushes were and bought three of them, including the Sigma small angle brush. Now, I assumed that these brushes would be on par (maaaybe a tad bit better) with the cheap brushes that I have always bought. Boy I was happy to be dead wrong. THESE ARE THE BEST BRUSHES I HAVE EVER OWNED. And I literally got three for the price of 1 brush at some expensive makeup store. It&#x27;s never been so easy to tight line my eye balls! Never buying another brand of makeup brush again!</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my Maybelline gel liner. It is a nice, stiff brush that holds it&#x27;s bristles tight. Works great for tightlining the upper eyelids too.</li>
            <li> Great quality!  I believe this is just a good as a MAC brush.  Looking forward to purchasing more Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter.  She loves it.  Glad I spent a little bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li> The best brush for gel liner. Works well with Anastasia pomade dipbrow.</li>
            <li> This angle brush is an excellent quality. It works terrific on brows and for eyeliner application....don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!</li>
            <li> Th!e perfect brush for lining! Makes a very thin, absolutely PERFECT line...no straggly bristles that poke you in the eye! This brush makes you feel like a professional makeup artist!</li>
            <li> Perfect for brows and gel liner. This is a staple for any of us make up savy ladies. Pricing is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> A bit larger than what I expected/needed but great for applying powder to eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Works great for putting on gel eyeliner or getting eye shadow in a small spot. Quality is great and it cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my eyebrows or eyeliner! perfect for both. I actually think I need a second one now!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have 3 MAC eyeliner brushes in various states of use ability (266/263/208)&lt;br /&gt;While I will say this retains its shape after repeated use and daily cleaning&lt;br /&gt;There is something off about it, ie I have to apply multiple coats of fluidline/or cake eyeliner to get the same results of color payoff and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me the line that I want/resists a bit too much and is too stiff&lt;br /&gt;I probably need to look for a smaller brush/think about it more (synthetic vs natural)  to figure it out&lt;br /&gt;I still use it but its not exactly 100% what I was looking for to do winged eyeliner which is why I only gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> This brush makes putting on my gel eyeliner SO much easier than the brush the eyeliners come with. I&#x27;ve purchased a few other brushes that were too stiff or too soft..this is perfect. I don&#x27;t always do a cat tail but when I do, this brush makes it SO easy. I would recommend this brush to anyone who uses a gel eyeliner, anyone who likes a thin line or anyone who likes a thick line..this brush will accomplish whatever look you are going for!</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner brush! I&#x27;ve always had trouble making a thin straight line like I like to do. In the past I&#x27;ve used brushes like the e10 and e05 with no luck. I&#x27;ve bought every liquid liner available and I had trouble with all of them! I use this with gel liner and its perfect! This is authentic sigma. If you are worried about the authenticity go to sigma.com and they have a list of authorized retailers for amazon. Oh its great for making wings too. This makes doing your eyeliner easy if you&#x27;re like me and suck at it!</li>
            <li> Great brush--I&#x27;ve tried others but this is the best.</li>
            <li> great brush super soft works well! its sigma what do you expect!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for applying gel eye liner. It&#x27;s so thin and stiff that creating and building the gel liner up is effortless. It has completely improved my wing on my liner! It makes creating the wing so easily precise!! This brush is a must for anyone who uses gel liner!!!</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC brush to use with gel eyeliner, it has changed the way I do my eyeliner--goes on so easily and evenly now.</li>
            <li> A little smaller then expected but it&#x27;s great shipped fast I got it to use with my brow dip gel and it gets the job done very well . A makeup brush staple&lt;br /&gt;**Legit and real 👍&lt;br /&gt;**Hairs very soft 🙌</li>
            <li> I got this because I had not been able to find a good eye liner brush that didn&#x27;t make me want to throw it against the wall. this one becomes TINY, so thin! Perfect cat-eye every time! Would 100% recommend it!</li>
            <li> The brush has a great angle to use it as an eyeliner brush and its very hard so the lines are great.  Only complaint I have is that I lost a few bristles off the brush already.</li>
            <li> This brush appears to be a legit Sigma brush and is perfect for eyeliner or for sculpting brows. It&#x27;s so good I came back and bought a second one :)</li>
            <li> The most perfect sized angle brush to do gel eyeliner and create that perfect cat eye. I use my Maybelline eye studio gel eyeliner in blackest black. The little brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t the best, so I was on a hunt for the best eyeliner brush. THIS IS IT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it and didn&#x27;t complain. She said it&#x27;s just what she wanted and she will buy again.</li>
            <li> I just discovered Sigma brushes after spending tons of money at Sephora for brushes over the years. Quality brushes for way less. Love it. Hopefully they stand up to the test of time.</li>
            <li> Best brushes, love Sigma products because they keep their shape!</li>
            <li> Works great and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> bought this because of Jaclyn Hill, used it for 6months now, not the best brush for eyeliner.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ... this brush! Perfect line every time</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff (in a good way, rather than an unpleasant one) and this brush is excellent for applying cream eyebrow products and (I assume) gel or powder eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! True to detail description! Applies gel  liners beautifully</li>
            <li> Turned out to work well!</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes overall but this one was a disappointment. I have a similar brush called smudge brush from bhcosmetics which was 1/5th of the cost of this sigma brush. I ordered the sigma one hoping this one would pack on colors much better but nope. I returned it and now just using the bhcosmetics one.</li>
            <li> The perfect brush for eyebrows. I love how thin it is great if you use Anastasia Dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> Love my small angle! Perfect angle for eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Nice, quality eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is better than MAC&#x27;s version.  Smaller, tighter bristles, soft.  Couldn&#x27;t get much better for this kind of eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It came in the mail when it was supposed to, meaning it arrived on time, love the packaging and it&#x27;s just a great product! I have so far used this as an eyebrow brush along with an eyeliner brush! It works PERFECTLY for both! The synthetic brush also is just SO soft. I give this product an A+!</li>
            <li> Love using this for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This brush maybe good for some people for applying gel liner which is what I intended it&#x27;s  use for,but the bristles are a lil too flimsy for my taste.If  you need a good angled liner brush I recommend The Crown C225 angled mini linerbrush is small,firm bristles and precise! This a good brush for filling in brows though..</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush. Firm enough to get tight lines right next to your lashes. Better than my MAC angled brushes which never seemed to be precise enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always clean this brush after each use with a gentle face wash (like Ceravie) to keep it clean but hydrated. Once product builds up on the bristles, you will not be able to get precise lines. After washing, dry with a smooth cloth and pull up from the metal edge on the handle (which is called the ferrule) to the top of the bristles; flattening and reshaping the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one, then threw out all my other angled brushes and bought two more.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! It&#x27;s super thin and easy to use. It&#x27;s a must have for anyone who uses eyeliner gel.</li>
            <li> This brush is a very good stiffness and denseness for gel liner.  It also does ok for lining with a bit of eyeshadow.  It is the shortest angle brush I have been able to find so far, which I like because I like to use them for winged liner but I don&#x27;t like my flicks too terribly long.  All in all I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I&#x27;m using it every day.</li>
            <li> Same quality as department store cosmetic counter brushes for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for eyeliner, and it&#x27;s holding up well to frequent use.  I&#x27;m very happy with my shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, BUT pleasently surprised at how much I liked this brush.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for brow work.  It is firm, well constructed and balances well in my hand.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This came with a split in the brush due to careless packaging, so the application process was not as smooth as I had hoped. Nevertheless, it is able produce good results for close-to-the-lash thin lines, which is my preferred look. However I would not use this brush for thick lined cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> I love this brush it is perfect for applying gel liner and last forever, I recommend it to anyone looking for a gel liner brush!</li>
            <li> Soft brisels, don&#x27;t shed, best brushes you can find, founds this brshes on a makeup tutorial by Camila cohelo. Love them</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my brow pomade because I felt my current brush was maybe a bit too big. This one is very tiny which makes it perfect for someone with small eyebrows like mine. It is stiff enough to give a precise line (for drawing individual hairs) but not so stiff that it is hard to use. I think this is on par with similar MAC brushes I have owned over the years so at this price point I am very impressed. I&#x27;ll likely buy more brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best brush I used for gel liner. I tried quite a few brushes, including a high end one like Bobbi Brown, and nothing compares to this. It&#x27;s so easy now and I have such great control that it&#x27;s no problem getting it exactly the same on both eyes. I&#x27;m not an expert by any means but feel like I am with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and very good for lining the eyes.  I have used lots of others.  This is the best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, no complaints from the better half about it so I assume it&#x27;s worthy of 5 stars, I would of heard about it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Good quality! I would recommend these products to anyone! Love the brush! These brushes are getting hard to find anymore!</li>
            <li> I am in love with all of my Sigma brushes and this one isn&#x27;t any different! Makes everything go on super smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to splurge on brushes, but as someone who enjoys a &#x27;rockabilly&#x27; look, a fine angled brush is a necessity. This brush is the best eyeliner brush I have ever used. It makes such fine lines and the bristles are extraordinarily soft. Definitely a new staple in my make up bag. I use it with Loreal gel liner and it works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve also used it wet on eyeshadow and it&#x27;s just as precise. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> She puts make up on with it. I&#x27;m assuming it works good since she continues to put make up on with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can someone please tell me why there are like a thousand different make up brushes though for reals?</li>
            <li> This is a great, sturdy brush for eye-liner. I use it with the gel liner and it&#x27;s so much faster and easier than my last non-angled brush I got from Smashbox.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect eye liner brush, not too thick, not too thin, goes on easy.&lt;br /&gt;I will try out other Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s fake , i dnt know</li>
            <li> What can i say, i&#x27;m obsessed with sigma brushes, it works great</li>
            <li> Great brush- super fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product, but i dont know how to use it, thats my problem anyway, my pulse sucks</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!  It is perfect for gel eyeliner.  It keeps it&#x27;s shape and yet it is soft enough for the under the eye area.  Sigma brushes are the best!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, awesome for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this. I have seen youtube tutorial videos where people have talked about the Sigma brush and now I know why. It works so well for brows because its small and allows to get a great shape with control. I haven&#x27;t tried it with my eyeliner yet but I don&#x27;t usually do too much for that anyway.. I am excited to try a cat liner with it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace a very old brush I use for applying powdered eyeliner. Unfortunately this brush is too soft to be effective.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for defined cat eye liner and it&#x27;s excellent. It&#x27;s very comparable to Mac&#x27;s 263 brush and I use them both. They are both good quality and get the shop done precisely, but sigma is half the price, therefore it gets my vote.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick way to apply cream eyeliner, then this is the brush for you. It makes eyeliner application so easy, all you do is tap the brush where you want to apply your liner. It is much easier to control than your typical eyeliner brush so it&#x27;s perfect for someone less experienced with the application.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to use, and makes putting eyeliner on much faster cause you don&#x27;t have to stop and fix any mistakes.Keep one in your make-up bag at all times.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brushes are by Sigma.  I learned from them about an online blogger, and she was right.  These brushes are made to last, and they are half the cost of expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and love the brush.</li>
            <li> Best brush you could ever find for gel eye liner. I tried so many and this is the best one out there. Does not shed,&lt;br /&gt;Just great.</li>
            <li> Every Sigma product I own, I LOVE! This brush is great for eyeliner or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes, they are amazing quality and they work even better! My recent purchase of this brush came so much faster than the estimated delivery date and it was in perfect condition! I am getting ready to order some more!</li>
            <li> This brush  holds and applies gel liner really well. I do a cat-eyes look on most days, and this has noticeably decreased the amount I struggle to make my line smooth and small. The bristles are dense and hold the right amount of product, and the tip is stiff enough to draw a very fine line. My only complaint is that the brush handle is somewhat longer than I&#x27;m used to, so I knock it into the mirror when I&#x27;m using it, but other than that it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I got this because I see all the youtube gurus use this and I wanted to try it. Love it !!</li>
            <li> One of the best sigma brushes!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is works really good for gel eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Try this ! you will love it :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush along with the E75 angled brow.  Both are good quality brushes.  They both serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Better than Mac Brush and a good price tooooo.</li>
            <li> I tried this Sigma E65 Small Angle brush to do my \\&quot;winged eyeliner\\&quot; and found that it did somewhat well. The bristles of the brush, for me, are not dense enough to apply my eyeliner. It&#x27;s fine to apply a thin line of eyeliner but takes a lot of reapplying to draw a thicker line. I don&#x27;t like having to go back 6 or 7 seven times to get my eyeliner right. The bristles just aren&#x27;t thick and dense enough to do the job. It might work for those who like to app[y eyeliner thinly, but not for those who like a thicker line. I do like however, the thickness of the handle, as it gives me better control when using my Mac Black Track Eyeliner. If Sigma could make another brush specifically for applying a thicker line of eyeliner with the same thickness in the handle (for better control), it probably would be a winner. But until then, I will go back to using my Mac 266 brush. Just thought I would experiment with a different brush to see what it could offer. Better hunting next time I guess.</li>
            <li> Great service and brush!!</li>
            <li> This brush is not thin enough to make a very fine line. But it&#x27;s a great angle brush for anything else. I had to purchase a MAC angle brush to be able to do a very fine line.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this brush - I saw big youtube tutorialist give it rave reviews for gel liner so I figured it would be pretty good. The brush itself is great quality...but if you&#x27;re looking to use it for a cateye look it seems to be too dense/thick to make a super sharp and defined flare. I&#x27;ve given myself a few months to get used to it but I keep telling myself I need to find something new. The price was right and I&#x27;m sure I can find a use for it but it just doesnt work for a cateye the way I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> This is the best angle brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Perfect for gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for applying eye shadow to eyebrows or powdering eyeliner. I use it every day. Great.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order super fast!!! Like all Sigma brushes this brush is amazing its the perfect brush to do a winged eyeliner look. Sigma never disapoints!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this brush is really amazing goes so nice and blends really easy I always like to do different style and is perfect for everything !!! So happyyyyyyyy thank you Sigma ...... Best brush ever!!</li>
            <li> This is my second E65 from Sigma. I&#x27;ve ordered a second one now because my first one was getting a little frayed and worn out after over a year of usage. The brush can sometimes feel a little scratchy, but it is great for gel eyeliner (I use it with Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Long Wear Gel Eyeliner). After dabbing it in the pot and wiping the excess gel on the side, the brush is perfectly thin and coated with gel to make crisp, clean lines. It&#x27;s especially perfect for doing a winged eyeliner look because you can get a clean wing without smudging or getting too thick. The brush also makes it easy to make thin or thick (by layering) lines.</li>
            <li> Well I use this brush for eyeliner because its just so amazing... Gets so close to my lash lines n my lashes are naturally curled so sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get to the lash line.... I&#x27;m glad I purchased this this brush,, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING! Doing a sexy cat eye takes all of a few seconds... and I have NEVER been good at doing those!</li>
            <li> I love this angle brush, perfect for eyeliner!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch.. they feel great on the face! they are much better (yet cheaper) than sephora brand eye pencils</li>
            <li> I can not even begin to emphasize the love I have for this brush! I&#x27;ve had so many brands of brushes, and sigma is just the best I&#x27;ve come across so far. It&#x27;s the same quality as the M.A.C brushes, if not better (in my own opinion, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sparse brows, and needed a good, well made reliable brow brush. I went with this one hoping and praying it would work for me. I am so pleased with this purchase! I also ordered a small tapered blending brush and a flat kabuki and love them both just as much! On top of ordering my three brushes, they gave me a small blending brush as an extra gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows are looking so much better while using this brush, as they provide a nice, even, precise shape. I also use this brush to dust on eyeshadow and gel liner and it&#x27;s too perfect. I recommend this to everyone who needs a good liner brush!</li>
            <li> Love, Love this brush!  I&#x27;ve seen ladies use this brush for makeup tips on youtube.com and it is just as great as they say it is!</li>
            <li> Love Sigma brushes! Just discovered them recently and hoping they will help me to be better at make up application!</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! However I don&#x27;t prefer to use this for brows. It is a bit on the softer side.</li>
            <li> Jaclyn Hill swears by this brush for creating a perfect winged eyeliner, and she is totally right. I&#x27;d been using the typical thin line brush and it was always a challenge to get that perfect flick, but this brush makes it so easy!</li>
            <li> One of the best on the market. Straight lines are perfect. My liner Looks great!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is not authentic. I owned this exact brush that I purchased from Sigma&#x27;s website and this is not the same brush. It is much thicker than the brush I purchased directly from Sigma. For some people this may be fine, but I bought this brush for use with Anastasia dipbrow, and I prefer a thinner brush. If you are looking to purchase an authentic Sigma E65, this is not it. Although the shipping is free coming from Amazon, it is better to just pay the shipping fee and purchase it directly from Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I own an entire collection of Sigma brushes and some I&#x27;ve purchased individually, and none of them came with the engraving on it saying &amp;#34;patent pending,&amp;#34; like this one does. It also has an engraving of some other number or letters, but they are too small to read.&lt;br /&gt;The brush was sold by b-glowing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST brush for lining the eyes. Very precise and angled just right! Great packaging as well.</li>
