            <li>The pad is the perfect size for those areas.</li>
            <li>I have always used (and been very happy) with Tantowel for sunless tanning.</li>
            <li>I was definitely impressed as these exceeded my expectations.</li>

            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using the glow pads for about a year now and they always produce great results.  </li>
            <li>These glow pads are really great.</li>
            <li>I am completely impressed with how amazing my skin looks each morning after use.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great sunless tan-</li>
            <li>I also use the Alpha Beta Glow Pads for the body (which are just as great)  </li>
            <li>and I can have a great glow.  </li>
            <li>I bought these after great reviews</li>
            <li>but they worked great.</li>
            <li>But besides that this is an excellent product and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this, always gives me a tanned face and neck, no streaks, not the best smell</li>
            <li>They worked amazingly and felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Ordered these based on all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>this product does give good color</li>
            <li>I must note that I have fair skin</li>
            <li>This product was on GMA as the best self tanner available.</li>
            <li>I had tried these in the past,and was delighted to get them for the price that I did.</li>
            <li>I thought I would splurge on these when I was researching good self tanners.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and when I put it on I turned ORANGE.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and</li>
            <li>I had a coupon from Birch Box and decided that since this product had really good reviews (4.5/5), that I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>Great product made my skin glow &amp; pore size better.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>On my skin the color was more orange-ey than the browner &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>Was pleased with product and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li>These glow pads are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise their amazing, i recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it gives my skin an amazing glow</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice.</li>
            <li>it feels nice on the skin...</li>
            <li>The product itself was nice, I just did not care for the size of the applicator.</li>
            <li>A friend even commented and asked if I got some sun over the weekend because I had a nice glowing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly works and doesn&#x27;t have that really dainty smell associated with most sunless tanning options...plus, no shimmer which makes it ideal for male users not wanting to look as if they just came from a strip</li>
            <li>This product is great for travel or just to add a quick glow to your face.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so the natural glow is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t 100% found out how to make these work for me, but this is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve used for my face so far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunless tanning product I have every used.</li>
            <li>They are convenient and easy to use- another added bonus!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>They do clean off makeup and are good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Am going to buy these again for sure.  </li>
            <li>no wrinkles as the sun gives you after years of tanning :-)</li>
            <li>OK for people without freckles.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Love this product and put it on auto ship.  </li>
            <li>Gives great color and not too much color.</li>
            <li>I love the body towelettes too.</li>
            <li>It is always streakfree and flawless, you can apply moisturizer over it for extra evenness and</li>
            <li>Love this stuff .</li>
            <li>Overall I was impressed and will be using these continuously.</li>
            <li>I love the color this makes my face.</li>
            <li>love this product...</li>
            <li>I  like the way they give me a healthy glow and make my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Coloring lasts the better part of two days.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy more once these run out.  </li>
            <li>I would warn that the more often you use the pads,</li>
            <li>I only use one pad a week for a perfect glow for up to 4 days.  </li>
            <li>Now I wake up in the morning and jump in the shower and its nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love these tanning pads for my face.</li>
            <li>and I do have age or sun spots ON MY FACE which said this product would take care of ..not so after using 1 time my spots are darker  and more pronounced as ever</li>
            <li>I love these for my face.  </li>
            <li>I really love these.</li>
            <li>and I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Did a nice clean and even job of giving color.  </li>
            <li>I kind of liked these when my color first started developing...</li>
            <li>I was THRILLED to find them on Amazon for much cheaper, and with a subscription, even MORE cheaper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair and have always been scared of using a self-tanner on my face.</li>
            <li>Product works pretty good</li>
            <li>I looked pretty dang good if I say so myself.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use these for whole-body application (you&#x27;d go through the whole box in one application), but if you want something light for your face, they are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is fairly strong, like most self tanners.</li>
            <li>I really love this product because of the color, but I also love it for how smooth it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate and moisturizer to help the product go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>These pads are easy to use, create great, natural color AND have skin care benefits, all in one.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no streaks.</li>
            <li>easy.</li>
            <li>I used one time only,and i used it very quickly</li>
            <li>So now, I just use regular spray or lotion self tanners on my body and this pad on my face/neck/chest and I stay beautifully sunkissed.    </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice glow, which is exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>The day after I use these, I look too dark, but after about two days and until about day 5 my skin looks amazing with a great sun-kissed glow.  </li>
            <li>so I would say it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>It feels really light on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great way to exfoliate and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in my skin&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li>I love the warm glow that I have after using these, and I feel like it also helps to keep my skin smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>Such a great alternative to the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>What I really enjoy is that they even out the skin tone and reduce the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is great compared to the Dr. Gross website.</li>
            <li>This product was nice to use on my face, it gave me a nice color and glow, but some days before, this autum, i needed to wear a dress, and my legs were to white</li>
            <li>Gross products are top of the line with good results.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get the right application, but worth it!!</li>
            <li>They are great the skin looks more clear, healthy, and younger specially if the pads are use twice a day.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, looks real!!</li>
            <li>One pad is sufficient for your entire face and produce a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>the next morning my face has a wonderful natural glow.</li>
            <li>Since I work full time and have no time to go to the beach / tan / nor did I want to spend money on tanning</li>
            <li>I have tried several self-tanners before, but this product is by far the best and most natural looking of them all.  </li>
            <li>Smell is mild.</li>
            <li>The only reasons why I did not rate it with a 5 stars is because I would love them more if color was darker also they are too pricey.</li>
            <li>It goes on so evenly and is just a mild bronze.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly on your skin</li>
            <li>These really give a fantastic light glow to my face.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got my order in the mail and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve used these several times now, and I&#x27;m always very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>They not only give you a nice, natural tan, but they really are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>This purchase has a very distinct odor and also the cloth has an orange tint ( the one I purchased previously had a pleasant citrus scent and had no color).</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use them as much in the summer though I still do on rainy days because the AHAs and other ingredients make my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li>These are great to give your face a little color</li>
            <li>These are great for keeping a little bit of color during the colder months.</li>
            <li>Great to use after alpha beta peel for a sun kissed glow year round.</li>
            <li>these are definitely worth the $22 a month ladies.</li>
            <li>but it goes away within five minutes and is worth it when it comes to the color and skin care.</li>
            <li>If that is the reason, amazon needs to pull them from the shelf and put fresh ones in their place.</li>
            <li>It does give you a good color but be careful when applying.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind the towelette does get dry pretty quickly and wherever you use it first will be the most tan and more prone to mistakes.</li>
            <li>I get just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>this is a 5 star product hands down the best facial self tanner I have ever used in my life!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning products, and so I was excited to see this product on a recent list of products to try before you die ;).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would look a little more natural with someone that doesn&#x27;t have fair skin like me though.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product, and would recommend to anyone looking to get a warm,natural glow after getting a mild skin peel.</li>
            <li>They are small but do a great job</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked because I thought the color would show up right as I put it on.</li>
            <li>The ONLY way you could probably use this product is if you are already really tan and this would add some kind of glow /</li>
            <li>I thought they were easy to apply and looked natural and even the morning after.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t so much stain your skin, as seem to have a mild chemical reaction.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this product previously from another source and loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved the natural tan color results from the prior purchase</li>
            <li>I have to say they give you a perfect glow that last for a few days.</li>
            <li>Very nice, natural color with no odor and a fast dry.</li>
            <li>I used the product as directed and it turned my face orange the first day.  </li>
            <li>I love the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Glow Pads.  </li>
            <li>Some sunless tanning products have a funny smell, not these.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the best face tanner it has been quite difficult</li>
            <li>this product really works!</li>
            <li>I noticed my face looks better and tighter overall.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times in Sephora, the glow pads were extremely different.</li>
            <li>Overall I really love this product.</li>
            <li>It really does make you glow!</li>
            <li>This light bronze coloring makes no makeup necessary and makes me confident with a bare face.</li>
            <li>Since most self-tanners do not tan my skin well, I applied liberally and didn&#x27;t think much until the next morning.</li>
            <li>The color develops quick and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Just be careful with the application, I had an orange line at the top of my forehead by my hairline, it looked pretty lovely with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, there was a lot of color.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cause any breakouts whatsoever and pretty much every self-tanner I use on my face breaks me out.  </li>
            <li>if you cut them in to the pad is really to small to handle and will not give good coverage</li>
            <li>but as another reviewer has stated, very dark at first but fades to a nice tan.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I have my hair pulled back and use the pad as much into my hair line as possible for a most natural look.  </li>
            <li>and make sure that I use it within that week so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>Looks so natural, I have medium skintone may be too dark for fair skin.</li>
            <li>When I first started ordering this product from amazon, the towelettes were white and very fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a woman in my early 30&#x27;s and do not, nor have I ever had problems with cystic acne, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s from the Dr. Gross</li>
            <li>The pads are a perfect pick me up to give a little glow to your face when your feeling the pale winter blues.</li>
            <li>I will wipe my face with one at night after washing my face, and then go straight to bed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ll see how I like the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>it really washes away fast.  </li>
            <li>color lasts for almost a week (depending on how much you exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast, overnight color.</li>
            <li>dont use one wipe for whole face as would be too much.</li>
            <li>I then apply an eye cream and the Dr. Dennis Gross oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is very pricey but the results do reflect the value of the product.  </li>
            <li>the more careful you need to be about providing your ears and neck with coverage too.  </li>
            <li>Every Thursday night I use it so that the whole weekend</li>
            <li>I dont spend that much money on them.  </li>
            <li>if I use them in the winter, again I get a very orange look.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there is a light oder you will smell</li>
            <li>In addition to the skin clearing benefits of the Alpha-Beta acids in this product, the light glow from the self tanning makes me look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and these have never caused any issues.</li>
            <li>I tear mine in half as to get more \\&quot;bang for my buck\\&quot; like someone else suggested.  </li>
            <li>And if you do use it every other day it goes twice as far :-)</li>
            <li>I get asked about my natural glow in the cooler months so much that I have to give a trial packet out to my friends and students.</li>
            <li>No icky smell, and they don&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  </li>
            <li>Waste of time and money for sure.</li>
            <li>The price is also over the top ----Would suggest passing on this product.... waste of money.</li>
            <li>, I would rather spend the extra money to have them fresh.</li>
            <li>My new obsession.</li>
            <li>Light, impossible to make a mistake, smells food, does not clog pores, nice colour not too dark, very natural, love it</li>
            <li>I use these mainly in the summer when I have a natural glow already from the sun -</li>
            <li>As a very pale 20-something year old with sun damage and acne marks, these pads deal a two pack punch by lightening the sun damage and acne scars over time, while immediately providing a warm and natural glow to my face that cosmetically hides my skin damage.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>but i got some color which was nice but does not stay long about less than 2 days .</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>First off, the pads are SO TINY.</li>
            <li>After washing, apply the first pad and wait a couple of minutes and then use the second pad.  </li>
            <li>is how to apply using wipes and not having funny looking hands where the stuff is washed off of the back of my hands after washing my palms.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like being pale and don&#x27;t like the mess of other self tanners, these are awesome!</li>
            <li>I cut these in half and just used on my face, neck, declate, and it gives a fantastic glow.</li>
            <li>I have used this diligently in the past and ran out, as soon as I started back again and am still thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very reluctant to try new face products, especially when it comes to sunless tanning.  </li>
            <li>I was not tan by any means before, just not really pale.</li>
            <li>it is a clear formula so it wont stain your sheets</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I let my face clear up</li>
            <li>The look is sun kissed natural, would recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural looking glow without streaking or being orange.</li>
            <li>it gives me a natural color.</li>
            <li>They bring out your natural color</li>
            <li>I have used this product once so far, I put it on before bed.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The application is fast, simple, and I never have any streaking or patchy-ness.</li>
            <li>I also want to add that I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend the extra $8 to get the real product next time.</li>
            <li>I allow the product to absorb completely for about 20 minutes before applying Clinique moisturizer and going to bed.</li>
            <li>I am blonde with fair skin, and this looks like i spent the previous day in the sun!  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this product I didnt use it until it was dry</li>
            <li>My skin is pale, I wear &amp;#34;fairly light &amp;#34; bare mineral foundation color</li>
            <li>You can easily get an uneven color if not applied properly.  </li>
            <li>But I keep my beauty routine pretty low maintenance, so if I find these pads easy to use, anyone with common sense will as well!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they give TOO much color to my light skin.  </li>
            <li>The color generally lasts a couple days, depending on how frequently you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Results after the first application are subtle, but noticeable, and  you can adjust the intensity by applying the product more or less frequently.  </li>
            <li>I live in the South and am outside often between walking the dogs, gardening, and working on the pool</li>
            <li>This takes a little getting used to and can be quite potent, so instead of using it every night, I often use it every other night.  </li>
            <li>natural glow that lasts several days.</li>
            <li>These give such a natural looking sun kissed tan.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell this purchase is not the same product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it made it to my house with out busting open.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a self tanner smell a few hours after applying, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>other people have suggested, I cut the pad in half and easily get two applications out of it.  </li>
            <li>I used these for a few days and noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t even cover half of your arm let alone your whole body!</li>
            <li>cause I use on my legs but other than that really like them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little pricey but worth it if you don&#x27;t use daily</li>
            <li>The vendor I choose shipped earlier than expected and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Still have to be careful around ankles and such that you don&#x27;t have too much there.</li>
            <li>and don&#x27;t get in my pores leaving dark pinpoint spots as much as others.  </li>
            <li>It was a very natural glow and these pads are lasting me a long time!</li>
            <li>If you want to get a little darker, use the whole pad and apply two \\&quot;coats\\&quot;.   </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These glow pads are really great.</li>
            <li> I am completely impressed with how amazing my skin looks each morning after use.  </li>

            <li> I also use the Alpha Beta Glow Pads for the body (which are just as great)  </li>
            <li> and I can have a great glow.  </li>
            <li> I bought these after great reviews</li>
            <li> but they worked great.</li>
            <li> But besides that this is an excellent product and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this, always gives me a tanned face and neck, no streaks, not the best smell</li>
            <li> They worked amazingly and felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered these based on all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> this product does give good color</li>
            <li> I must note that I have fair skin</li>
            <li> This product was on GMA as the best self tanner available.</li>
            <li> I had tried these in the past,and was delighted to get them for the price that I did.</li>
            <li> I thought I would splurge on these when I was researching good self tanners.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and when I put it on I turned ORANGE.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and</li>
            <li> I had a coupon from Birch Box and decided that since this product had really good reviews (4.5/5), that I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great product made my skin glow &amp; pore size better.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> On my skin the color was more orange-ey than the browner &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> Was pleased with product and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> These glow pads are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise their amazing, i recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gives my skin an amazing glow</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice.</li>
            <li> it feels nice on the skin...</li>
            <li> The product itself was nice, I just did not care for the size of the applicator.</li>
            <li> A friend even commented and asked if I got some sun over the weekend because I had a nice glowing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truly works and doesn&#x27;t have that really dainty smell associated with most sunless tanning options...plus, no shimmer which makes it ideal for male users not wanting to look as if they just came from a strip</li>
            <li> This product is great for travel or just to add a quick glow to your face.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so the natural glow is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t 100% found out how to make these work for me, but this is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve used for my face so far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanning product I have every used.</li>
            <li> They are convenient and easy to use- another added bonus!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> They do clean off makeup and are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Am going to buy these again for sure.  </li>
            <li> no wrinkles as the sun gives you after years of tanning :-)</li>
            <li> OK for people without freckles.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Love this product and put it on auto ship.  </li>
            <li> Gives great color and not too much color.</li>
            <li> I love the body towelettes too.</li>
            <li> It is always streakfree and flawless, you can apply moisturizer over it for extra evenness and</li>
            <li> Love this stuff .</li>
            <li> Overall I was impressed and will be using these continuously.</li>
            <li> I love the color this makes my face.</li>
            <li> love this product...</li>
            <li> I  like the way they give me a healthy glow and make my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Coloring lasts the better part of two days.</li>
            <li> Plan to buy more once these run out.  </li>
            <li> I would warn that the more often you use the pads,</li>
            <li> I only use one pad a week for a perfect glow for up to 4 days.  </li>
            <li> Now I wake up in the morning and jump in the shower and its nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love these tanning pads for my face.</li>
            <li> and I do have age or sun spots ON MY FACE which said this product would take care of ..not so after using 1 time my spots are darker  and more pronounced as ever</li>
            <li> I love these for my face.  </li>
            <li> I really love these.</li>
            <li> and I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Did a nice clean and even job of giving color.  </li>
            <li> I kind of liked these when my color first started developing...</li>
            <li> I was THRILLED to find them on Amazon for much cheaper, and with a subscription, even MORE cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair and have always been scared of using a self-tanner on my face.</li>
            <li> Product works pretty good</li>
            <li> I looked pretty dang good if I say so myself.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use these for whole-body application (you&#x27;d go through the whole box in one application), but if you want something light for your face, they are great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is fairly strong, like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because of the color, but I also love it for how smooth it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate and moisturizer to help the product go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> These pads are easy to use, create great, natural color AND have skin care benefits, all in one.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no streaks.</li>
            <li> easy.</li>
            <li> I used one time only,and i used it very quickly</li>
            <li> So now, I just use regular spray or lotion self tanners on my body and this pad on my face/neck/chest and I stay beautifully sunkissed.    </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice glow, which is exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> The day after I use these, I look too dark, but after about two days and until about day 5 my skin looks amazing with a great sun-kissed glow.  </li>
            <li> so I would say it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> It feels really light on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great way to exfoliate and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in my skin&#x27;s health.  </li>
            <li> I love the warm glow that I have after using these, and I feel like it also helps to keep my skin smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li> Such a great alternative to the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> What I really enjoy is that they even out the skin tone and reduce the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is great compared to the Dr. Gross website.</li>
            <li> This product was nice to use on my face, it gave me a nice color and glow, but some days before, this autum, i needed to wear a dress, and my legs were to white</li>
            <li> Gross products are top of the line with good results.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get the right application, but worth it!!</li>
            <li> They are great the skin looks more clear, healthy, and younger specially if the pads are use twice a day.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, looks real!!</li>
            <li> One pad is sufficient for your entire face and produce a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> the next morning my face has a wonderful natural glow.</li>
            <li> Since I work full time and have no time to go to the beach / tan / nor did I want to spend money on tanning</li>
            <li> I have tried several self-tanners before, but this product is by far the best and most natural looking of them all.  </li>
            <li> Smell is mild.</li>
            <li> The only reasons why I did not rate it with a 5 stars is because I would love them more if color was darker also they are too pricey.</li>
            <li> It goes on so evenly and is just a mild bronze.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly on your skin</li>
            <li> These really give a fantastic light glow to my face.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got my order in the mail and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used these several times now, and I&#x27;m always very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> They not only give you a nice, natural tan, but they really are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> This purchase has a very distinct odor and also the cloth has an orange tint ( the one I purchased previously had a pleasant citrus scent and had no color).</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use them as much in the summer though I still do on rainy days because the AHAs and other ingredients make my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> These are great to give your face a little color</li>
            <li> These are great for keeping a little bit of color during the colder months.</li>
            <li> Great to use after alpha beta peel for a sun kissed glow year round.</li>
            <li> these are definitely worth the $22 a month ladies.</li>
            <li> but it goes away within five minutes and is worth it when it comes to the color and skin care.</li>
            <li> If that is the reason, amazon needs to pull them from the shelf and put fresh ones in their place.</li>
            <li> It does give you a good color but be careful when applying.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind the towelette does get dry pretty quickly and wherever you use it first will be the most tan and more prone to mistakes.</li>
            <li> I get just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> this is a 5 star product hands down the best facial self tanner I have ever used in my life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning products, and so I was excited to see this product on a recent list of products to try before you die ;).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would look a little more natural with someone that doesn&#x27;t have fair skin like me though.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product, and would recommend to anyone looking to get a warm,natural glow after getting a mild skin peel.</li>
            <li> They are small but do a great job</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked because I thought the color would show up right as I put it on.</li>
            <li> The ONLY way you could probably use this product is if you are already really tan and this would add some kind of glow /</li>
            <li> I thought they were easy to apply and looked natural and even the morning after.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t so much stain your skin, as seem to have a mild chemical reaction.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product previously from another source and loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved the natural tan color results from the prior purchase</li>
            <li> I have to say they give you a perfect glow that last for a few days.</li>
            <li> Very nice, natural color with no odor and a fast dry.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and it turned my face orange the first day.  </li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Glow Pads.  </li>
            <li> Some sunless tanning products have a funny smell, not these.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the best face tanner it has been quite difficult</li>
            <li> this product really works!</li>
            <li> I noticed my face looks better and tighter overall.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times in Sephora, the glow pads were extremely different.</li>
            <li> Overall I really love this product.</li>
            <li> It really does make you glow!</li>
            <li> This light bronze coloring makes no makeup necessary and makes me confident with a bare face.</li>
            <li> Since most self-tanners do not tan my skin well, I applied liberally and didn&#x27;t think much until the next morning.</li>
            <li> The color develops quick and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the application, I had an orange line at the top of my forehead by my hairline, it looked pretty lovely with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, there was a lot of color.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cause any breakouts whatsoever and pretty much every self-tanner I use on my face breaks me out.  </li>
            <li> if you cut them in to the pad is really to small to handle and will not give good coverage</li>
            <li> but as another reviewer has stated, very dark at first but fades to a nice tan.  </li>
            <li> I always make sure I have my hair pulled back and use the pad as much into my hair line as possible for a most natural look.  </li>
            <li> and make sure that I use it within that week so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> Looks so natural, I have medium skintone may be too dark for fair skin.</li>
            <li> When I first started ordering this product from amazon, the towelettes were white and very fresh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman in my early 30&#x27;s and do not, nor have I ever had problems with cystic acne, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s from the Dr. Gross</li>
            <li> The pads are a perfect pick me up to give a little glow to your face when your feeling the pale winter blues.</li>
            <li> I will wipe my face with one at night after washing my face, and then go straight to bed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how I like the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> it really washes away fast.  </li>
            <li> color lasts for almost a week (depending on how much you exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast, overnight color.</li>
            <li> dont use one wipe for whole face as would be too much.</li>
            <li> I then apply an eye cream and the Dr. Dennis Gross oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is very pricey but the results do reflect the value of the product.  </li>
            <li> the more careful you need to be about providing your ears and neck with coverage too.  </li>
            <li> Every Thursday night I use it so that the whole weekend</li>
            <li> I dont spend that much money on them.  </li>
            <li> if I use them in the winter, again I get a very orange look.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there is a light oder you will smell</li>
            <li> In addition to the skin clearing benefits of the Alpha-Beta acids in this product, the light glow from the self tanning makes me look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and these have never caused any issues.</li>
            <li> I tear mine in half as to get more \\&quot;bang for my buck\\&quot; like someone else suggested.  </li>
            <li> And if you do use it every other day it goes twice as far :-)</li>
            <li> I get asked about my natural glow in the cooler months so much that I have to give a trial packet out to my friends and students.</li>
            <li> No icky smell, and they don&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money for sure.</li>
            <li> The price is also over the top ----Would suggest passing on this product.... waste of money.</li>
            <li> , I would rather spend the extra money to have them fresh.</li>
            <li> My new obsession.</li>
            <li> Light, impossible to make a mistake, smells food, does not clog pores, nice colour not too dark, very natural, love it</li>
            <li> I use these mainly in the summer when I have a natural glow already from the sun -</li>
            <li> As a very pale 20-something year old with sun damage and acne marks, these pads deal a two pack punch by lightening the sun damage and acne scars over time, while immediately providing a warm and natural glow to my face that cosmetically hides my skin damage.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> but i got some color which was nice but does not stay long about less than 2 days .</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> First off, the pads are SO TINY.</li>
            <li> After washing, apply the first pad and wait a couple of minutes and then use the second pad.  </li>
            <li> is how to apply using wipes and not having funny looking hands where the stuff is washed off of the back of my hands after washing my palms.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like being pale and don&#x27;t like the mess of other self tanners, these are awesome!</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and just used on my face, neck, declate, and it gives a fantastic glow.</li>
            <li> I have used this diligently in the past and ran out, as soon as I started back again and am still thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very reluctant to try new face products, especially when it comes to sunless tanning.  </li>
            <li> I was not tan by any means before, just not really pale.</li>
            <li> it is a clear formula so it wont stain your sheets</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I let my face clear up</li>
            <li> The look is sun kissed natural, would recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I have a natural looking glow without streaking or being orange.</li>
            <li> it gives me a natural color.</li>
            <li> They bring out your natural color</li>
            <li> I have used this product once so far, I put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The application is fast, simple, and I never have any streaking or patchy-ness.</li>
            <li> I also want to add that I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would much rather spend the extra $8 to get the real product next time.</li>
            <li> I allow the product to absorb completely for about 20 minutes before applying Clinique moisturizer and going to bed.</li>
            <li> I am blonde with fair skin, and this looks like i spent the previous day in the sun!  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product I didnt use it until it was dry</li>
            <li> My skin is pale, I wear &amp;#34;fairly light &amp;#34; bare mineral foundation color</li>
            <li> You can easily get an uneven color if not applied properly.  </li>
            <li> But I keep my beauty routine pretty low maintenance, so if I find these pads easy to use, anyone with common sense will as well!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they give TOO much color to my light skin.  </li>
            <li> The color generally lasts a couple days, depending on how frequently you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Results after the first application are subtle, but noticeable, and  you can adjust the intensity by applying the product more or less frequently.  </li>
            <li> I live in the South and am outside often between walking the dogs, gardening, and working on the pool</li>
            <li> This takes a little getting used to and can be quite potent, so instead of using it every night, I often use it every other night.  </li>
            <li> natural glow that lasts several days.</li>
            <li> These give such a natural looking sun kissed tan.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this purchase is not the same product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it made it to my house with out busting open.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a self tanner smell a few hours after applying, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> other people have suggested, I cut the pad in half and easily get two applications out of it.  </li>
            <li> I used these for a few days and noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t even cover half of your arm let alone your whole body!</li>
            <li> cause I use on my legs but other than that really like them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little pricey but worth it if you don&#x27;t use daily</li>
            <li> The vendor I choose shipped earlier than expected and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Still have to be careful around ankles and such that you don&#x27;t have too much there.</li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t get in my pores leaving dark pinpoint spots as much as others.  </li>
            <li> It was a very natural glow and these pads are lasting me a long time!</li>
            <li> If you want to get a little darker, use the whole pad and apply two \\&quot;coats\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li> The product dried quickly before I went to bed, but the smell definitely lingered for awhile even after it dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else it does besides tan my skin, but the color looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li> I was sort of looking for a tan towel type product and it was similar but not near the size of a tan towel.  </li>
            <li> but this one is totally different, not natural at all.</li>
            <li> It just seemed to make my freckles and other dark spots darker without much tanning to the rest.</li>
            <li> so it comes out a little lighter, it is hydrating and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never applied incorrectly, and the amount of the product on the pad is enough to either swipe across your face once or twice for a really subtle glow, or use until it dries for a really tan face.</li>
            <li> It would roll up and you needed 3 at least per leg as they were very</li>
            <li> I use them at night, a few hours before bed, and wake with even, natural looking (not orange) color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a long time now</li>
            <li> Oh how I love these little suckers!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is not extremely pale though and I heard it doesn&#x27;t work as well on really pale skin.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the small size of the box, surprised at the small size of each packet, and definitely surprised at how small each towelette was, not much different than a standard polaroid</li>
            <li> I use one every other day, or every third day</li>
            <li> It was a little orangey when I woke up in the morning, but after I put my makeup on it looked like I actually had some color to my face instead of just makeup caked on my white face to try and match my tan body.</li>
            <li> - I only wish the glow would last a little longer- fades after 1-2 days</li>
            <li> I apply this with a glove all over the face and neck and continue until the pad is completly dry.  </li>
            <li> Also, made my skin feel taut and dry even with exfoliating before and moisturizing after.</li>
            <li> It washes off very gradually and mine usually lasts about four to six days(Depending on how dark I put it on and how well I keep my face moisturized/exfoliated).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a single streak on my face.</li>
            <li> A single tanning pad is probably 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too dark for my pale skin for year long use, however the color looks natural and goes on with ease.  </li>
            <li> I usually give myself the ole home facial every week and this is a crucial part of it.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> I then put the other half back in the packet and fold it</li>
            <li> Now, I apply VERY carefully and I also cut a packette in half to make it last longer.  </li>
            <li> Also, be careful with application.  </li>
            <li> I was careful to apply evenly and had no problem with streaks.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like the product and would recommend it to anyone who has trouble tanning their face.</li>
            <li> If you want color for a specific event I would recommend using for a few days leading up to the event.</li>
            <li> This product works in a subtle and flattering way to give your skin a natural glow-</li>
            <li> As per previous reviewers, I apply this to TOTALLY dry skin after completing my nightly routine (including brushing my teeth), as the effectiveness of any self tanner will be minimized if it comes into contact with water.</li>
            <li> but you have to apply every other day.  </li>
            <li> Just need to be careful with the color!  </li>
            <li> I use them every other day in the cooler months.  </li>
            <li> A little can go a long way!  </li>
            <li> I use the pads every other day or every two days just depending on if I wash my face once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the quality of the product itself, but it seems that the box was open and used before.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little expensive, but because you don&#x27;t need one every day, they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> I woke up noticeably darker, but it wasn&#x27;t DARK.</li>
            <li> There were faint streaks on my shoulders, but they aren&#x27;t very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it does clog my pores.</li>
            <li> As the day goes on you will notice your skin getting darker (not to dark)</li>
            <li> I cut them in half and use half every other day.  </li>
            <li> and I have to down to a science.  </li>
            <li> I use it down my neck (in the summer), and it always blends.</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t know how the other reviewer did this...reaLLY!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and cut the pads in half, using about every three days except in the summer.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it is too expensive (for me anyway) to use as a daily product</li>
            <li> and that is almost half the price of what Sephora sells them for.</li>
            <li> Cut the sheet in half and use half at a time.  </li>
            <li> Product was as states but packaging was a little odd.</li>
            <li> No make-up required after using them, just a little lip gloss and mascara</li>
            <li> The pads do smell a little like self tanner</li>
            <li> I sucked it up and used a few of the pads on my arms, legs, hands, face, neck, shoulders etc.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week...</li>
            <li> But after a few mishaps, I realized that I just needed a lil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have a full box of them that will go unused :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few years</li>
            <li> Overall I am not happy with this product and will return to tantowels.</li>
            <li> With the last three or four orders the towelettes are yellowed and appear to be expired or outdated</li>
            <li> I usually cut one in half and apply over my face, ears, and neck.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for winter to have legs/arms that just have a hint of tan and not that pale winter skin.  </li>
            <li> so my skin is pale.</li>
            <li> I am really pale</li>
            <li> Will stay pale.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy mine at Sephora but saw them on here for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> The color is not too dark it is subtle.</li>
            <li> I had 3 whole days to stay in door and hide if the results were bad.</li>
            <li> I received a small box of these pads as a sample</li>
            <li> The pads give you noticeable color, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> In the past, self tanners have tended to either clog my pore, streak, or turn me an undesirable color (too orange or too brown).  </li>
            <li> pads were so small and thin...would not order again.  </li>
            <li> I usually put in on in the evening and</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale, with red undertones, so it has always been difficult for me to tan without burning.  </li>
            <li> Also, since the product is not tinted, it&#x27;s hard to tell if your application is even...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad and goes away completely after another shower.</li>
            <li> your face will glow for at least two days.</li>
            <li> I probably use one about once or twice a week with at least 3 days in between.</li>
            <li> I have small thin legs and small hands</li>
            <li> The color is subtle and natural.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> The towels smelled really bad and they were brown, these arent fake pads if you notice the white ones you throw away after using them they turn dark brown after oxidizing in the air over night.  </li>
            <li> I would have sent back but had thrown out the invoice and packing slip so I am stuck with a bad product.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with my results to say the least.</li>
            <li> and the product is no good.</li>
            <li> What had initially disappointed me was that I thought only QVC sold these.. and they&#x27;re $65 plus $6 shipping there...</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the tan is pretty and I&#x27;m very disappointed that my skin responds so poorly to this product.</li>
            <li> and I have a couple that are addicted too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a warming sensation that feels as if you&#x27;ve been in the sun but certainly not troubling or painful.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed as the Dr Dennis Gross  \\&quot;Beta Glow Pad\\&quot; was so tiny that it made it almost impossible to put on skin.  </li>
            <li> so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with streaks, and these pads do not leave an orange hue, like a lot of fake tanners.   </li>
            <li> Maybe I used them wrong</li>
            <li> addicted!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m also allergic to random detergents and a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This stuff is really expensive.  </li>
            <li> but then it turned kinda orange the way all fake tanners do.  </li>
            <li> I dont believe it sits in a temperature controlled warehouse so it sits in the heat and cold</li>
            <li> Once on, the \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Streaked like crazy...</li>
            <li> I looked crazy after using the product, that way</li>
            <li> i am obsessed with these wipes!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was SO DISAPPOINTED with this product!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t awful.</li>
            <li> These ones were horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too dark for my pale skin for year long use, however the color looks natural and goes on with ease.  Make sure to exfoliate and moisturizer to help the product go on smoothly and evenly.  Will buy again for the summer months when I am seeking a deep tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL self-tanning products for the face and then I just gave up because they were all TOO ORANGE.  Then I was in Sephora and a sales lady recommended  these pads.  I love them!!!!  They are *just* enough color and NOT ORANGE at all.  I always make sure I have my hair pulled back and use the pad as much into my hair line as possible for a most natural look.  Am going to buy these again for sure.  Looks great and no wrinkles as the sun gives you after years of tanning :-)</li>
            <li> Great face tanner! Applies evenly and looks great. Smell is mild. The best part is that there is no orange look from product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my face just does not take color well or what but I have tried everything including this product and my face is still ghost white after using it multiple times. It would leave an orange residue around my hairline. Also, it darkens any problem spots on your face. I was not happy with my results to say the least.</li>
            <li> Since I use this only on my face and neck, 1 pad lasts a week if I put it back in the wrapper. Very nice, natural color with no odor and a fast dry.</li>
            <li> I had tried a lot of self tanners for my face. These are excellent...your face will glow for at least two days. I have very fair sensitive skin and large pores. But after using these pads your pores would look smaller...and I even think that I look younger when I use them. It would last around 4 days before next application. The color is not too dark it is subtle. The only reasons why I did not rate it with a 5 stars is because I would love them more if color was darker also they are too pricey. But besides that this is an excellent product and I love it.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and it turned my face orange the first day.  It still has not changed after four days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair and have always been scared of using a self-tanner on my face. I received a small box of these pads as a sample and it took months before I even considered trying them because I was so scared of being left with streaks all over my face.    I applied one pad in circular motions all over my face, neck and chest area before I went to bed and I woke up with a beautiful tan and NOT ONE STREAK!!!!! These are just perfect for your face because they apply the perfect amount of color. I&#x27;ve tried those gradual self tanning moisturizers but I&#x27;d never notice a difference. You will notice a difference after just ONE of these pads. So now, I just use regular spray or lotion self tanners on my body and this pad on my face/neck/chest and I stay beautifully sunkissed.    What had initially disappointed me was that I thought only QVC sold these.. and they&#x27;re $65 plus $6 shipping there... so expensive. I was THRILLED to find them on Amazon for much cheaper, and with a subscription, even MORE cheaper! Trust me.. these are definitely worth the $22 a month ladies.</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Glow Pads.  These are great to give your face a little color AND they have nutrients for your skin, as well. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup so the natural glow is wonderful.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Each wipe is inside ally packaged. It just seemed to make my freckles and other dark spots darker without much tanning to the rest. OK for people without freckles.</li>
            <li> I like these, but have to use with caution. I haven&#x27;t 100% found out how to make these work for me, but this is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve used for my face so far.  They don&#x27;t cause any breakouts whatsoever and pretty much every self-tanner I use on my face breaks me out.  Also, these give a lot of color to my very fair skin.  My only complaint is that they give TOO much color to my light skin.  The day after I use these, I look too dark, but after about two days and until about day 5 my skin looks amazing with a great sun-kissed glow.  Also, be careful with application.  Since most self-tanners do not tan my skin well, I applied liberally and didn&#x27;t think much until the next morning. OMG! My skin was BROWN and STREAKY! There were literally white streaks where I hadn&#x27;t put self-tanner. Now, I apply VERY carefully and I also cut a packette in half to make it last longer.  OVerall, I will rebuy and continue using.  Takes a while to get the right application, but worth it!!</li>
            <li> I love this, always gives me a tanned face and neck, no streaks, not the best smell but it goes away within five minutes and is worth it when it comes to the color and skin care. I continue to repurchase and always will!</li>
            <li> Oh how I love these little suckers!!  I tear mine in half as to get more \\&quot;bang for my buck\\&quot; like someone else suggested.  I then put the other half back in the packet and fold it up- and make sure that I use it within that week so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  I will wipe my face with one at night after washing my face, and then go straight to bed.  I wake up with a glow!  No icky smell, and they don&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  I do think that if I used it too often my face would get an orange tint.  I probably use one about once or twice a week with at least 3 days in between.</li>
            <li> Excellent, Excellent Product.  Goes on easy, looks real!!</li>
            <li> Ordered these based on all the good reviews. I was very surprised at the small size of the box, surprised at the small size of each packet, and definitely surprised at how small each towelette was, not much different than a standard polaroid picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly strong, like most self tanners. The product dried quickly before I went to bed, but the smell definitely lingered for awhile even after it dried. I woke up noticeably darker, but it wasn&#x27;t DARK. It gave me a nice glow, which is exactly what its supposed to do.  One towelette was enough to cover my face, neck, chest, and shoulders. I didn&#x27;t have a single streak on my face. There were faint streaks on my shoulders, but they aren&#x27;t very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how I like the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 4/22/13: I&#x27;ve used these several times now, and I&#x27;m always very pleased with the results. The pads give you noticeable color, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I like them!</li>
            <li> natural glow that lasts several days. not odorless, but the best i&#x27;ve ever found, and i&#x27;ve tried all the nordstrom brands</li>
            <li> Best thing about the glow pads....no streaks.  The look is sun kissed natural, would recommend them to anyone.  No make-up required after using them, just a little lip gloss and mascara and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Product works pretty good and I am satisfied with the results. I would recommend this product and will probably purchase again. Thank you</li>
            <li> These pads work well. I wish they were a little bigger cause I use on my legs but other than that really like them. They don&#x27;t leave lines and go on evenly.</li>
            <li> This product was nice to use on my face, it gave me a nice color and glow, but some days before, this autum, i needed to wear a dress, and my legs were to white, i used these pads and wow! I really loved how it helped me :D</li>
            <li> This product works in a subtle and flattering way to give your skin a natural glow- I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I love these. They are easy to apply. I get just the right amount of color. Some sunless tanning products have a funny smell, not these. My skin feels nice.</li>
            <li> this product does give good color but you have to apply every other day.  it really washes away fast.  if you cut them in to the pad is really to small to handle and will not give good coverage...don&#x27;t know how the other reviewer did this...reaLLY!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! I get asked about my natural glow in the cooler months so much that I have to give a trial packet out to my friends and students. I have olive skin and cut the pads in half, using about every three days except in the summer. I live in the South and am outside often between walking the dogs, gardening, and working on the pool so I can&#x27;t use them as much in the summer though I still do on rainy days because the AHAs and other ingredients make my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> Light, impossible to make a mistake, smells food, does not clog pores, nice colour not too dark, very natural, love it</li>
            <li> Best ever tanning pads. Can&#x27;t wait for winter to have legs/arms that just have a hint of tan and not that pale winter skin.  Love this product and put it on auto ship.  MLF</li>
            <li> Great product. Gives great color and not too much color. I use this instead of make up, just enough color</li>
            <li> this is a 5 star product hands down the best facial self tanner I have ever used in my life! I love the body towelettes too. It is always streakfree and flawless, you can apply moisturizer over it for extra evenness and so it comes out a little lighter, it is hydrating and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Has no scent and leaves no self tanner scent as it is developing&lt;br /&gt;* it is a clear formula so it wont stain your sheets and you can wear it out during the day without looking like you went rolling in the mudd&lt;br /&gt;* it actually does improve your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is when I ordered it from amazon I dont believe it sits in a temperature controlled warehouse so it sits in the heat and cold and the product is no good. The towels smelled really bad and they were brown, these arent fake pads if you notice the white ones you throw away after using them they turn dark brown after oxidizing in the air over night.  It just isnt an item that amazon should be selling unless they can figure out a way to put it in a temperature controlled area.</li>
            <li> I saw a segment about these glow tan pads on The Today Show or some morning show. Since I work full time and have no time to go to the beach / tan / nor did I want to spend money on tanning, I thought this would be the perfect solution. I was so excited when I got my order in the mail and tried it out right away.  First off, the pads are SO TINY. They can&#x27;t even cover half of your arm let alone your whole body! What were they thinking making the pads this size?! A single tanning pad is probably 2&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34;, so a tiny square.  I sucked it up and used a few of the pads on my arms, legs, hands, face, neck, shoulders etc.  The next morning I woke up and looked at my arms and there were streaks EVERYWHERE. Plus, it was noticeably orange and not the tanning / glowing effect that I wanted. I immediately went in my shower trying to rub it off my arms / face and some of it came off, but there was still streaks you could definitely see. The last time I used this product was in June, and I haven&#x27;t touched it since.  The ONLY way you could probably use this product is if you are already really tan and this would add some kind of glow / make the tan last longer? Who knows. Waste of time and money for sure.</li>
            <li> Excellent self tanning pads! Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The pads are a perfect pick me up to give a little glow to your face when your feeling the pale winter blues.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff . It goes on so evenly and is just a mild bronze.</li>
            <li> This review is for the body towelettes, not the face ones. The best thing about these is that they do not give you the orange color! That was my number one concern. My skin is not extremely pale though and I heard it doesn&#x27;t work as well on really pale skin. I was not tan by any means before, just not really pale. Easy to use and no streaks. Keep in mind the towelette does get dry pretty quickly and wherever you use it first will be the most tan and more prone to mistakes. It does smell even after showering next morning but it&#x27;s not too bad and goes away completely after another shower. Overall I was impressed and will be using these continuously.</li>
            <li> I love the color this makes my face. I have a natural looking glow without streaking or being orange. My skin glows and looks healthier. They&#x27;re a little pricey but worth it if you don&#x27;t use daily</li>
            <li> love this product...it feels nice on the skin...I use it a few times a week...it gives me a natural color.</li>
            <li> These glow pads are amazing.  I use one every other day, or every third day and it provides just enough color that I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.  They bring out your natural color so it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re using self-tanner.  They&#x27;re a little expensive, but because you don&#x27;t need one every day, they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I was careful to apply evenly and had no problem with streaks. It was a very natural glow and these pads are lasting me a long time! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> These have been my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; self-tanner resources for my face for years.  After trying another brand of self-tanner towelettes and several creams and gels, I have settled on Dennis Gross Glow Pads.  I cut them in half and use half every other day.  They are darker than some others (I like that!) and don&#x27;t get in my pores leaving dark pinpoint spots as much as others.  I use these in place of foundation and like the fact that there are no problems with accumulation in wrinkles or smearing when sweating.</li>
            <li> I  like the way they give me a healthy glow and make my skin smoother. I will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I like these...I thought they were easy to apply and looked natural and even the morning after.  I didn&#x27;t notice any breakout issues (I have acne-prone skin).  I wouldn&#x27;t use these for whole-body application (you&#x27;d go through the whole box in one application), but if you want something light for your face, they are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The color is subtle and natural.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It dries quickly on your skin (I try to use the pads about an hour before I go to bed).&lt;br /&gt;3.  It feels really light on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.&lt;br /&gt;5. Sometimes I think it hides my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts for almost a week (depending on how much you exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it does clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product once so far, I put it on before bed. At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked because I thought the color would show up right as I put it on. I must note that I have fair skin but my body does tan, unlike my face that is ghostly white because of the products I use for my acne. It was a little orangey when I woke up in the morning, but after I put my makeup on it looked like I actually had some color to my face instead of just makeup caked on my white face to try and match my tan body. Just be careful with the application, I had an orange line at the top of my forehead by my hairline, it looked pretty lovely with my blonde hair. Overall, I do like the product and would recommend it to anyone who has trouble tanning their face. I think it would look a little more natural with someone that doesn&#x27;t have fair skin like me though.</li>
            <li> This product was on GMA as the best self tanner available. (JOKE)  I was VERY disappointed as the Dr Dennis Gross  \\&quot;Beta Glow Pad\\&quot; was so tiny that it made it almost impossible to put on skin.  It would roll up and you needed 3 at least per leg as they were very dry.&lt;br /&gt;  I have small thin legs and small hands and I struggled with it.  Once on, the \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; results were disappointing.  I would have sent back but had thrown out the invoice and packing slip so I am stuck with a bad product. The price is also over the top ----Would suggest passing on this product.... waste of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very reluctant to try new face products, especially when it comes to sunless tanning.  However, I&#x27;ve been using the glow pads for about a year now and they always produce great results.  I use them at night, a few hours before bed, and wake with even, natural looking (not orange) color. They&#x27;re a great way to exfoliate and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in my skin&#x27;s health.  The color generally lasts a couple days, depending on how frequently you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! Best self tanner for the face I&#x27;ve ever tried, they&#x27;ve become an necessity for the winter. However, i find if you use products that have ingredients that often lighten skin (like benzoyl peroxide and lemon) you&#x27;re likely to become blotchy and possibly streaky. If I know I will be using the glow pads I stay away from such products. Otherwise their amazing, i recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I had tried these in the past,and was delighted to get them for the price that I did.Dr. Gross products are top of the line with good results.The vendor I choose shipped earlier than expected and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> These are great for keeping a little bit of color during the colder months. I usually cut one in half and apply over my face, ears, and neck. I only have to do this every two or three days.   If you want to get a little darker, use the whole pad and apply two \\&quot;coats\\&quot;.   I have not had any problems with streaks, and these pads do not leave an orange hue, like a lot of fake tanners.   I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These glow pads are really great. They definitely make you tan, color goes on evenly and fades over the course of a week. They do clean off makeup and are good for my skin. The pads do smell a little like self tanner so I put them on at night.</li>
            <li> worked as promised. easy. doesnt smell at all. fast, overnight color. one wipe does face shoulders and chest. dont use one wipe for whole face as would be too much.</li>
            <li> Truly works and doesn&#x27;t have that really dainty smell associated with most sunless tanning options...plus, no shimmer which makes it ideal for male users not wanting to look as if they just came from a strip club.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t so much stain your skin, as seem to have a mild chemical reaction. It&#x27;s a warming sensation that feels as if you&#x27;ve been in the sun but certainly not troubling or painful. Coloring lasts the better part of two days. One pad is sufficient for your entire face and produce a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I received these in a sample from a beauty sampling company. Absolutely loved the ease of application, and the perfect results every time. I use one pad about every third night all over my face and neck. The application is fast, simple, and I never have any streaking or patchy-ness. I am currently on my second box of 20, and can&#x27;t imagine not using these.</li>
            <li> This takes a little getting used to and can be quite potent, so instead of using it every night, I often use it every other night.  I am completely impressed with how amazing my skin looks each morning after use.  I have used this diligently in the past and ran out, as soon as I started back again and am still thrilled with the results.  After washing, apply the first pad and wait a couple of minutes and then use the second pad.  I then apply an eye cream and the Dr. Dennis Gross oil free moisturizer.  It is very pricey but the results do reflect the value of the product.  And if you do use it every other day it goes twice as far :-)</li>
            <li> These wipes work good,yet for some reason I still noticed a bit of orange tinge to my skin. Maybe I used them wrong I have been searching for the best face tanner it has been quite difficult</li>
            <li> i am obsessed with these wipes!  I thought I would splurge on these when I was researching good self tanners.  These give such a natural looking sun kissed tan.  I am blonde with fair skin, and this looks like i spent the previous day in the sun!  Plan to buy more once these run out.  The color also lasts about 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> I have tried several self-tanners before, but this product is by far the best and most natural looking of them all.  My skin is very pale, with red undertones, so it has always been difficult for me to tan without burning.  In the past, self tanners have tended to either clog my pore, streak, or turn me an undesirable color (too orange or too brown).  But last year I discovered these pads and have been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other people have suggested, I cut the pad in half and easily get two applications out of it.  Results after the first application are subtle, but noticeable, and  you can adjust the intensity by applying the product more or less frequently.  I love the warm glow that I have after using these, and I feel like it also helps to keep my skin smooth and clear.  I would warn that the more often you use the pads, the more careful you need to be about providing your ears and neck with coverage too.  But I keep my beauty routine pretty low maintenance, so if I find these pads easy to use, anyone with common sense will as well!</li>
            <li> I was sort of looking for a tan towel type product and it was similar but not near the size of a tan towel.  It does tan my face but as another reviewer has stated, very dark at first but fades to a nice tan.  The product itself was nice, I just did not care for the size of the applicator.</li>
            <li> I used these for a few days and noticed a difference right away.  I put it on after cleansing and toning and before moisturizing and make-up to get a noticeable glow. If you want color for a specific event I would recommend using for a few days leading up to the event. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it is too expensive (for me anyway) to use as a daily product and I don&#x27;t love the smell (although there are much worse smelling products out there!)</li>
            <li> I received a few of these as a sample in a kit I purchased and they work very well. My skin is pale, I wear &amp;#34;fairly light &amp;#34; bare mineral foundation color so my skin is pale. These really give a fantastic light glow to my face. I cut these in half and just used on my face, neck, declate, and it gives a fantastic glow.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best self-tanner that I&#x27;ve ever tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great sunless tan- this product really works! The color develops quick and is very natural looking. They are convenient and easy to use- another added bonus! Such a great alternative to the tanning bed. They also exfoliate and have anti- aging properties. What I really enjoy is that they even out the skin tone and reduce the appearance of pores. If you are on the fence about trying these... I encourage you to give them a go! I am def. addicted! I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I used one time only,and i used it very quickly but i got some color which was nice but does not stay long about less than 2 days .</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a long time now and I have to down to a science.  I only use one pad a week for a perfect glow for up to 4 days.  Every Thursday night I use it so that the whole weekend I have perfect glowing skin.  After I do my nighly washing a moisturizing I apply this with a glove all over the face and neck and continue until the pad is completly dry.  When I first started using this product I didnt use it until it was dry so my glow wasn&#x27;t coming out.  Now I wake up in the morning and jump in the shower and its nice and smooth.  I noticed my face looks better and tighter overall.  I also use the Alpha Beta Glow Pads for the body (which are just as great)  I recommend these to my friends all the time and I have a couple that are addicted too.  Being that I use one a week I dont spend that much money on them.  Its about $25 for 4-5 months.  cant beat that.  I have nothing but nice things to say about this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I am totally dissatisfied with this purchase. I had purchased this product previously from another source and loved it. This purchase has a very distinct odor and also the cloth has an orange tint ( the one I purchased previously had a pleasant citrus scent and had no color). I loved the natural tan color results from the prior purchase but this one is totally different, not natural at all. As far as I can tell this purchase is not the same product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just need to be careful with the color!  I am fair skinned and when I put it on I turned ORANGE.  But after a few mishaps, I realized that I just needed a lil and I can have a great glow.  I use these mainly in the summer when I have a natural glow already from the sun - if I use them in the winter, again I get a very orange look.</li>
            <li> When I first started ordering this product from amazon, the towelettes were white and very fresh.  They worked amazingly and felt great on my skin. With the last three or four orders the towelettes are yellowed and appear to be expired or outdated (this is a &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; item for me).  Possibly overheated.  Perhaps this is the reason amazon has discounted the price on these boxes.  If that is the reason, amazon needs to pull them from the shelf and put fresh ones in their place. The yellowed towelettes still work but not as well so I guess I will need to find another source, I would rather spend the extra money to have them fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning products, and so I was excited to see this product on a recent list of products to try before you die ;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered them, used them, and voila -- cystic acne. I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I let my face clear up and the tried it again...again...cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman in my early 30&#x27;s and do not, nor have I ever had problems with cystic acne, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s from the Dr. Gross pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the tan is pretty and I&#x27;m very disappointed that my skin responds so poorly to this product. I also want to add that I do have sensitive skin (I&#x27;m also allergic to random detergents and a lot of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have a full box of them that will go unused :(.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gives my skin an amazing glow - I only wish the glow would last a little longer- fades after 1-2 days</li>
            <li> I love these tanning pads for my face. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few years and I like the color it gives me. As the day goes on you will notice your skin getting darker (not to dark) I have to say they give you a perfect glow that last for a few days. I usually buy mine at Sephora but saw them on here for a little cheaper. My skin is pretty sensitive and these have never caused any issues. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there is a light oder you will smell but it isn&#x27;t awful.</li>
            <li> What a great idea! These pads are easy to use, create great, natural color AND have skin care benefits, all in one. The only self tanner I use on my face. You get over 20 in a pack!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a defective batch, but mine don&#x27;t actually tan my face or add color at all.  I am really pale so I would definitely notice.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these after great reviews and I do have age or sun spots ON MY FACE which said this product would take care of ..not so after using 1 time my spots are darker  and more pronounced as ever and it does smell just like all the others.If you have age spots they will be darker...sending this back ASAP</li>
            <li> I would never purchase this product again! I have purchased this product many times in Sephora, the glow pads were extremely different. The ones from Sephora are great! These ones were horrible. I bought from this seller to save money. I would much rather spend the extra $8 to get the real product next time. Also, my package came opened. I was SO DISAPPOINTED with this product!</li>
            <li> In addition to the skin clearing benefits of the Alpha-Beta acids in this product, the light glow from the self tanning makes me look 10 years younger. As a very pale 20-something year old with sun damage and acne marks, these pads deal a two pack punch by lightening the sun damage and acne scars over time, while immediately providing a warm and natural glow to my face that cosmetically hides my skin damage. As per previous reviewers, I apply this to TOTALLY dry skin after completing my nightly routine (including brushing my teeth), as the effectiveness of any self tanner will be minimized if it comes into contact with water. I allow the product to absorb completely for about 20 minutes before applying Clinique moisturizer and going to bed. Overall, I love this product, and would recommend to anyone looking to get a warm,natural glow after getting a mild skin peel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with great results</li>
            <li> I have used these since they came out about two years ago.  I use them every other day in the cooler months.  When I don&#x27;t use them in the summer, my face misses them.  They not only give you a nice, natural tan, but they really are good for your skin.  My face looks smoother, clearer and refreshed.  There is a bit of a self tanner smell a few hours after applying, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I use one pad on my face, neck, chest and arms.  A little can go a long way!  If you don&#x27;t like being pale and don&#x27;t like the mess of other self tanners, these are awesome!</li>
            <li> Streaked like crazy...pads were so small and thin...would not order again.  Will stay pale.  I was very disappointed.  On a positive note, there was a lot of color.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really expensive.  It does give you a good color but be careful when applying.  You can easily get an uneven color if not applied properly.  As for the skincare aspect,  I never had an issue with it so I would say it worked fine.</li>
            <li> This product is great for travel or just to add a quick glow to your face. I usually put in on in the evening and the next morning my face has a wonderful natural glow. Overall I really love this product. The only downfall is that it only lasts about 2 days before it starts to fade.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunless tanning product I have every used. I have fair skin and the color is perfect. I apply it to my face, neck, and decollete. The pad is the perfect size for those areas. These are not for application to your BODY...you will need to purchase the body version of the pads. I use the pads every other day or every two days just depending on if I wash my face once or twice a day. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. It really does make you glow! Also, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! It says to apply in a circular motion...there is a reason for that...even coverage!</li>
            <li> I have always used (and been very happy) with Tantowel for sunless tanning. Saw these &amp; decided to try. On my skin the color was more orange-ey than the browner &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color I was hoping for! Also, made my skin feel taut and dry even with exfoliating before and moisturizing after. Overall I am not happy with this product and will return to tantowels.</li>
            <li> I was worried they&#x27;d make me look orange or streaky but they worked great. I was definitely impressed as these exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Did a nice clean and even job of giving color.  Still have to be careful around ankles and such that you don&#x27;t have too much there.</li>
            <li> Great to use after alpha beta peel for a sun kissed glow year round. Looks so natural, I have medium skintone may be too dark for fair skin.</li>
            <li> I kind of liked these when my color first started developing...but then it turned kinda orange the way all fake tanners do.  Also, since the product is not tinted, it&#x27;s hard to tell if your application is even...which leads to streaks.  I like Fake Bake better.</li>
            <li> This light bronze coloring makes no makeup necessary and makes me confident with a bare face. My new obsession. The texture of the pad smooths before it leaves color. Definitely a staple within the beauty world.</li>
            <li> Good color and not streaky!</li>
            <li> They are great the skin looks more clear, healthy, and younger specially if the pads are use twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great product made my skin glow &amp; pore size better. I would definitely purchase this product again! Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love these for my face.  They are small but do a great job</li>
            <li> I really love these. I have never applied incorrectly, and the amount of the product on the pad is enough to either swipe across your face once or twice for a really subtle glow, or use until it dries for a really tan face. I use it down my neck (in the summer), and it always blends. I really love this product because of the color, but I also love it for how smooth it makes my face feel. I usually give myself the ole home facial every week and this is a crucial part of it. It washes off very gradually and mine usually lasts about four to six days(Depending on how dark I put it on and how well I keep my face moisturized/exfoliated). Finding them on Amazon for like $20 makes them about $1 a piece and that is almost half the price of what Sephora sells them for.</li>
            <li> Product was as states but packaging was a little odd. I&#x27;m surprised it made it to my house with out busting open. Fast delivery. Was pleased with product and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to try the product but the box came open and damaged. I am not sure about the quality of the product itself, but it seems that the box was open and used before. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and I really love this stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure what else it does besides tan my skin, but the color looks like a real tan.  Cut the sheet in half and use half at a time.  it&#x27;s not so simple to apply like that but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it in no time.  The price on Amazon is great compared to the Dr. Gross website.</li>
            <li> Like so many, I was really skeptical about any self tanning products. I had a coupon from Birch Box and decided that since this product had really good reviews (4.5/5), that I&#x27;d give it a try. I waited for Memorial day weekend in case I looked crazy after using the product, that way I had 3 whole days to stay in door and hide if the results were bad. But they weren&#x27;t! I looked pretty dang good if I say so myself. A friend even commented and asked if I got some sun over the weekend because I had a nice glowing tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned that the key to any self tanning wipes is to use circular motions in their application. This truly does help prevent blotching and streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I haven&#x27;t learned yet... is how to apply using wipes and not having funny looking hands where the stuff is washed off of the back of my hands after washing my palms. Le sigh.</li>
