            <li>but the shadows were fine and unharmed.</li>
            <li>very good product arrived before expected though.</li>
            <li>the shadows are highly pigmented, the shadows stay on for a long time and it is great for under 5 dollars.</li>
            <li>It is a much better quality than I expected, very happy with this little purchase!</li>
            <li>They do work better with a decent primer and a decent brush.</li>

            <li>Its pretty basic like a cheap drugstore brand wouldve only gave it 3 stars</li>
            <li>Basically a cheap naked pallet but works just the same.</li>
            <li>its alright, i was expecting a nude colors all has a bit of shimmer and the only matte is the first color.</li>
            <li>I just fixed the packaging with clear tape</li>

            <li> It arrived way earlier then the estimated arrival date ðŸ˜Š . I love it,  it&#x27;s bigger then all my other eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li> I would have thought that this would take quite a while to come but it didn&#x27;t. the shadows are highly pigmented, the shadows stay on for a long time and it is great for under 5 dollars. very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love it! It came 3 weeks before I expected and that made me very happy.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as I thought they would be. They do work better with a decent primer and a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Basically a cheap naked pallet but works just the same. Colors are pigmented and some are matte and others are some what shimmery.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest quality eye shadow. The black ends up on your cheeks due to falling off the brush during application.</li>

            <li> Highly pigmented! LOVE! :)</li>
            <li> Thank you. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Its pretty basic like a cheap drugstore brand wouldve only gave it 3 stars but i gave it 4 because of the shipping. It was supposed to arrive between march 18th-april 1st but it arrived march 3rd</li>
            <li> The shadows don&#x27;t stay on as long as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li> I ordered a palette thinking they were matte eye shadows but they weren&#x27;t. They were shimmery eyeshadows and they didn&#x27;t even say they were shimmery on the description so I automatically thought they were going to be matte.</li>
