            <li>This is my favorite hair spray.</li>
            <li>They charge so much more if you buy it at Beauty shops</li>
            <li>love this brand and the Zero Gravity formula</li>
            <li>Light hold, but holds!</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, I buy it in quantity for this vendor,</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>Makes ordering easy and delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>I prefer a lightweight hairspray for my fine straight hair and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that works perfectly in every way.  </li>
            <li>This hair spray is not sticky, brush-able and gives light hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in humudity and will brush out before bed and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; the next day.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to buy my hairspray, rather than going to the 3 different stores that carry it, just to find out they are out of it.  </li>
            <li>Not too much perfume, never sticky, and a great soft hold.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray, soft, flexible and easy to shape hair style.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this new hair spray.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this hairspray, you&#x27;re missing out on a great product.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>For awhile I had difficulty finding it, so glad to see several merchants who offer this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it starts to leak after a while, makes it really sticky to hold.</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>A new staple for my bridal hair business!</li>
            <li>Great soft hold that adds body to my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have used the white cans of Sebastian Shaper Zero Gravity in the past, and liked this product very much.  </li>
            <li>Not the greatest hair spray I have used but not too bad either.</li>
            <li>I live in an area where I have access to just about any type of hair product that I would like, and for a hairspray I choose Sebastian Zero Gravity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft hold that doesn&#x27;t make you look like you are wearing a hair helmet!</li>
            <li>and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Holds well and not stiff.</li>
            <li>Still leaves hair soft and not stiff.</li>
            <li>This holds very well but can be easily brushed for a restyle.  </li>
            <li>Easy to brush out ; doesn&#x27;t dull hair</li>
            <li>Price wise is a little bit too expensive.</li>

            <li> I have baby-fine, thin hair and this is the only hair spray which helps it hold shape without weighing it down or making it oily in between shampooing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is how this smells now, or if I just got received a bad shipment, but I would NEVER buy this horrible smelling product again!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> It smells HORRIBLE!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for years since my hairdresser recommended it for my hair type.  Not oily or sticky, but yet it holds.  I prefer a lightweight hairspray for my fine straight hair and this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that works perfectly in every way.  For awhile I had difficulty finding it, so glad to see several merchants who offer this product on Amazon.  Makes ordering easy and delivered to my door.</li>

            <li> Great product. Light-weight, not sticky, yet has a great hold</li>
            <li> Best product ever!  It leaves your hair touchable, but holds your hair in place.  I would recommend.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite hair spray. The only one that I have found that keeps your hair in place &amp; is so light,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; not sticky. Can&#x27;t tell you even have it on. They charge so much more if you buy it at Beauty shops too&lt;br /&gt;Hurrah for Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is so sticky. After using it, you can&#x27;t brush or touch your hair or run your fingers through it. Awful. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> love this brand and the Zero Gravity formula</li>
            <li> Love!! Workable. Light hold, but holds! Not sticky. A new staple for my bridal hair business!</li>
