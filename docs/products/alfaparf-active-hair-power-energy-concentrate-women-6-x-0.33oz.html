            <li> Only thing to be aware that on Amazon, the price is tended to go up and down, so I will keep checking when the price is right.</li>
            <li> I switched to Nioxin and my hair is now much thicker and very few bald spots.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short I only use Half a vial each week.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work on my hair which is dry after the summer.</li>
            <li> Today my hair is much healthier and my bald spot is very small!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 months and feel that I lose less hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ALFAPARF Active Hair Power Energy Concentrate along with ALFAPARF shampoo for a few months now and I have noticeably less hair loss.</li>
            <li> but when I have a little bit of hair loss, I buy this.</li>
            <li> I stoped the use for a few months and my hair starter to fall off again.  </li>
            <li> This can help to decrease the hair loss but won&#x27;t help already dried and dead hair that is already falling.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find as not many people have this</li>
            <li> but I am hard pressed to see any difference</li>
            <li> I can use one vial 3 times, since my hair is not that thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like making my hair addicted to anything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for people that have a dramatic hair loss.</li>
            <li> In that case, nothing helps, sorry.</li>

            <li> I am on the second box and have not noticed much change.  Will not be spending any more $$ for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for thin hair.  It helps you adding volume to your hair and since I&#x27;m using it, my hair is no longer falling.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair thicker and shiny.  Recommended  by my former hair dresser, well worth the expense. Since my hair is short I only use Half a vial each week.</li>
            <li> The serum makes my hair puffy (in a good way). I have been using it for almost 2 months and feel that I lose less hair. I bought it from a spa and it costed almost double the price. The person at the spa recommended to use 3 times a week and don&#x27;t wash hair every day. I was so happy that I found it in Amazon! I will use it for some more time to see more results. Only thing to be aware that on Amazon, the price is tended to go up and down, so I will keep checking when the price is right.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing, it does energize the hair, and helps your hair to grow back.  I love it and has already purchased 7 boxes for friends and family.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me for thinning hair. (I&#x27;ve also learned I have hypo-thyroid). I started using it with the shampoo and my hair made a huge turn around. Today my hair is much healthier and my bald spot is very small!!</li>
            <li> The product works really well. My hair looks and feels healthier. Would recommend this product to anyone who is struggling with damaged hair. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly if you have fine or thinning hair. Could see a difference in my hair within a month, still using twice a week and the shampoo twice a week</li>
            <li> Used the product for several weeks before realizing it did nothing for my hair.  I switched to Nioxin and my hair is now much thicker and very few bald spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year and I&#x27;m really please. My hair is growing back (slow but sure..), and I see improvement.  I stoped the use for a few months and my hair starter to fall off again.  So I&#x27;m using it again and is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about this.. don&#x27;t see a difference with my hair. It smells great though.</li>
            <li> This came very prompt and it is exactly what I needed and the price was very good. It was hard to find as not many people have this so I was please to find it. I have used this product before but the package color had been changed. I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Used this twice a week for 6 weeks and saw no benefits. I would not purchase this product ever again</li>
            <li> ALFAPARF Active Hair Power Energy Concentrate Women (6 X 0.33oz) is the best to stop hair loss if it is used the way the box says.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for some time and is very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Luv this product. It work as designed and I really like the results. The cost of this product is a bargain compare to the benefits you can receive</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t like making my hair addicted to anything but when I have a little bit of hair loss, I buy this. It&#x27;s not for people that have a dramatic hair loss. In that case, nothing helps, sorry. But, if you have a seasonal shedding, this is a great way to stop it. Also, it help to overall quality of the hair and I would know that, since my hair has been bleached so many times. If you have a little bit thicker hair and therefore see much more hair falling, don&#x27;t freak out. This can help to decrease the hair loss but won&#x27;t help already dried and dead hair that is already falling. I like that I can use one vial 3 times, since my hair is not that thick.</li>
            <li> Really works!!!! Great smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom. She had problems with hair loss. After using this (even w/o energy shampoo) she said her hair stopped falling and started to grow.</li>
            <li> I have used as recommended, 2 times a week after shampooing. Alfaparf Products are excellent, and this is helping my hair to stop falling. I treat him and daily use emulsion from L&#x27;oreal. everything perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ALFAPARF Active Hair Power Energy Concentrate along with ALFAPARF shampoo for a few months now and I have noticeably less hair loss. My hair seems more dense in the thinning areas. I am very happy with the results of these products.</li>
            <li> Great product for thin hair, love the smell!</li>
            <li> I take this product every time I go to the hairdressers.  My hair feels full, manageable with lots of body!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d better buy another brand. These don&#x27;t work on my hair which is dry after the summer.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I personnaly do not see any improvement.  I have used as directed and would like to think it works but I am hard pressed to see any difference</li>
