    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I wash with either the cucumbers gel cleanser or the cucumber towelettes (which are excellent for in the gym bag or purse for midday grime, working out, camping, roadtrip, etc...).</li>
            <li>They are awesome!!    </li>
            <li>I have never been so impressed!</li>
            <li>Happy to have discovered this product!</li>
            <li>the best of any that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So all in all, this product was a perfect choice for me.    </li>
            <li>To wipes the best!</li>
            <li>These remove everything and leave my skin feeling GREAT!</li>
            <li>These are the best towelettes I have used.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with it, I just wish it was PRIME!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found them to be the best cleaning clothes ever.</li>
            <li>These are awesome.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>Although there are some downfalls with these face wipes they are mostly good!  </li>
            <li>They smell great and help tighten pores.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are great for removing it after a couple hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; #3 - it smells great,</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a great reduction in redness and skin tone.</li>
            <li>and these are great.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re very effective.</li>
            <li>and like everyone said, it was successful at taking off all of my makeup, including eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>A good product, but</li>
            <li>Removes makeup fairly well.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup fairly well.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my skin, but for some reason it burns my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I had tried Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner about a year ago and remembered that I LOVED it, and decided to give something else a try.</li>
            <li>These wipes are good for clarifying and toning the skin.</li>
            <li>And I feel like it did not do a good job cleaning my make up, because the wipes is still \\&quot;clean-looking\\&quot; after I wiped my face (I put on foundation and concealer, but I didn&#x27;t see the color of foundation on the wipes).</li>
            <li>I bought these wipes because I had heard good reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Best of all, they don&#x27;t leave any feeling of residue afterwards, and they leave me feeling clean and refreshed before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They remove my makeup beautifully, and they are CHEAP!</li>
            <li>Although they are all great in their own right, the cucumbers worked best for me.</li>
            <li>If you need a quick wake-up or a midday cleanse, YES TO CUCUMBERS Towelettes are the best!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing product.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes!</li>
            <li>I really do LOVE these cleansing cloths!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>, it should be purified more and additives dissed!</li>
            <li>These babies are great as a refresher, I have oily skin, and they do a great job opening up the pores while moisturizing and have a nice cool refreshing effect.</li>
            <li>and they sounded amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The 10 count is handy for the gym or purse,</li>
            <li>He said he liked it, and this man does not use beauty products.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how effective they are for makeup yet.</li>
            <li>I really liked them but after using them for a while, I started reacting to them.</li>
            <li>The stubborn blackheads on my cheeks have been coming to a head and coming out on its own.</li>
            <li>, so your best bet is going to supermarket and rubbing real cucumber on your face!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li>The wipes smell great, really fresh and floral.</li>
            <li>etc...I will say unless you are religious about sealing the container(s) you are best to put them into a ziplock of some kind to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li>scent is nice, and in my opinion, not too strong, and the cloths are a nice size, so I never have to use more than one.</li>
            <li>It said it was supposed to be soothing for the skin, and I was pretty happy to purchase it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and smells really good for normal skin type..</li>
            <li>the wipes are huge, dont leave your face sticky, and prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li>Btw, even if a product is marketed as being \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, many have some chemicals in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are so refreshing in the morning, instead of washing with soap.  </li>
            <li>these wipes are perfect and essential to  my bedtime routine now.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and I just love them.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love Yes To products.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found this product to be one of the most calming things I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love this skin care line.</li>
            <li>He said it would be OK to use \\&quot;once in a while\\&quot; at the gym.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but these towelettes seem to have it all: cleansing, refreshing and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I also love the Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>And I must say that I love these Yes</li>
            <li>The packaging is also better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It takes off all my makeup while moisturizing my skin, every morning my face is so smooth that sometimes I forget to use my Cetaphil moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I hope everyone has the same awesome experience that  I had!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than bringing along a bottle of face wash, though, since they can leak everywhere.  </li>
            <li>More than that</li>
            <li>Refreshing cucumber smell, doesn&#x27;t burn or irratate skin.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I love that.  </li>
            <li>I could ask more. :-)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;!Women love salads</li>
            <li>and you might get more kisses than usual!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Love these for taking off makeup and grime at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean, wonderful and natural.</li>
            <li>Plus they smell so nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes.they are refreshing and easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and nice.</li>
            <li>They are a great natural alternative to the chemical-laden drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation these wipes bring is incredible, especially if you have just exercised or have been sweating at the time.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve read some bitter and burning reviews on this awesome product.   </li>
            <li>These wipes get ALL my eye makeup off easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the strong smell either.</li>
            <li>They feel cool on the skin, have a refreshing scent and remove all the oil and makeup that I have on my face.</li>
            <li>and that works fine for me.</li>
            <li>These things are huge with a lot of product</li>
            <li>The wipes are huge with lots of \\&quot;juice\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The entire line smells &amp; works great depending on your skin needs.</li>
            <li>and they smell fabulous to boot.</li>
            <li>(Which is important to do at the end of the day!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of smelling like fresh cucumbers, it smelled more like rotten cucumbers stuffed in a sock for couple of years.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Once the redness dispersed I was left with beautiful glowing skin, that felt fresh and invigorated.  </li>
            <li>best thing I&#x27;ve discovered about these is that they calm my skin down.</li>
            <li>That is VERY gentle :)</li>
            <li>They smell so so fresh!      </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more eco-friendly than a disposable product and most likely gives a better clean.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my skin, remove easily all my make up, mascara included, even the water-proof...and my eyes don&#x27;t burn or get irritated!</li>
            <li>You feel refreshed, have clean skin and no clogged pores, soreness from scrubbing like with soap or having to rewash your face after to remove oil or leftover anything like with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t HAVE to soap up, but how in the heck do you feel clean just swiping that on your face?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most pre-moistened towelettes, and this by far is my my favorite.</li>
            <li>I guess I will just clean my kitchen with the rest of them.</li>
            <li>I use them every night to clean off make up and dirt.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find skin care products that work well and tis works GREAT!</li>
            <li>My nose and cheeks started to burn and turn bright red.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any burning, and my face feels cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>They take off makeup with just wiping, they&#x27;re gentle, no oils like most makeup removers.</li>
            <li>My face still felt grimy and full of make-up after using it.  </li>
            <li>I quickly used a Seventh Generation baby wipe to clean everywhere</li>
            <li>and these wipes are so gentle and refreshing to me.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of these and love that they are all natural, which is what drew me to them in the first place.  </li>
            <li>This product seemed ideal, especially after reading the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>They have a mild scent.</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t feel the burn.</li>
            <li>They do a pretty good job of removing eye makeup too, but sometimes I have to use two wipes to clean my entire face.</li>
            <li>I found the moisture level in it just at the right amount, it leaves no burning sensation (unless you find the tingly clean sensation burning).</li>
            <li>[i used to clean my face with burt&#x27;s bees products, and still do occasionally, the wipes are a nice alternative]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty fancy for face wipes, the opening is this tiny solid plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot;, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Just use the pads lightly and do not scrub - that might be why some folks are experiencing a burning sensation - just wipe downward gently.</li>
            <li>I had a sample of these wipes several months ago and liked them.</li>
            <li>The wipes are thick and smooth and feel great.</li>
            <li>However, these wipes are wonderful on the nights when I don&#x27;t think about washing my face until I&#x27;m completely exhausted and the thought of splashing water on my face is almost as repulsive as the thought of getting makeup on my pillow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the first wipe, my face immediately felt cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>They were definitely worth the money, and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job at that and leaves a fresh cucumber-y smell behind.</li>
            <li>; #4 - they leave my face with a fresh, tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li>There is an abundant amount of the cleanser on it &amp; the towelette itself is large enough to clean your face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>There is an abundant amount of the cleanser on it &amp; the towelette itself is large enough to clean your face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>It comes right off.</li>
            <li>but i dont think these are right for me.  </li>
            <li>But who knows, they may be right for you.</li>
            <li>#2 - takes the makeup right off my face, including mascara off my eyelashes</li>
            <li>And the price is all right with me.</li>
            <li>I have been in search of a wipe that will cleanly and GENTLY remove all of my makeup before I wash my face in the sink or shower.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about these Yes to Cucumber Facial Wipes is that they have a cooling effect- not an intense cooling like something with menthol, just a pleasant cool feeling like putting a wet washcloth on your forehead.  </li>
            <li>I believe less is more, cucumber already has many benefits when applied to skin</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use, I keep them right next to Emmy bed andbuse</li>
            <li>I tried Tomatoes first.</li>
            <li>The wipes themselves are thicker than most brands; actually feels like a clothe.</li>
            <li>those all sound natural to you?</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend them. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say, at first, there was burning.  </li>
            <li>I love the Yes to Cucumbers facial wipes.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it I noticed the smell was funky.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just because I was using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I recently bought these face wipes because I was in search of a better product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, im glad i gave these a try</li>
            <li>my skin felt hot and irritated.</li>
            <li>I use them first think in the morning to remove oil and at night to remove make-up.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena wipes is smooth and soft, and it never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was probably because it&#x27;s minty, but there&#x27;s no mint in the product.</li>
            <li>The price has spiked since I bought them first (used to be $6.99)</li>
            <li>I noticed my face started feeling hot.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, after wiping this on my face, for the first time, it burned my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love them and actually much more than my regular facial wash.</li>
            <li>ive been trying out skincare products since forever, in highschool i did perscriptions, i tried neutrogena (honestly like every single product they ever sold, bath and body works, body shop, sea breeze, clean and clear i could go on and on and on...</li>
            <li>right before going to bed, no hanging in front of a sink or intense scrubbing needed.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the BIGGEST wipes I&#x27;ve ever seen, and are more than large enough for everything I need them to do.</li>
            <li>These little towlettes are really convenient and smell good.  </li>
            <li>These leave my skin completely clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>but if you use a light and natural make up line this should work very well -</li>
            <li>Not very much like cucumbers, just very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There are 30 wipes per package, however they are fairly large and do not skimp on the amount of product in them.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t a chemical reaction to other brands.</li>
            <li>Other wipes are great for days when my skin can be dry, but using them too much leaves me oily and i break out.</li>
            <li>and I find these wipes to be really soothing and gentle.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap enough that I&#x27;d recommend the experiment.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the smell and</li>
            <li>I felt like there wasn&#x27;t even much on the towelette in terms of cleanser or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup, and eye makeup</li>
            <li>but my skin burned so much</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for something soothing and gentle, but this formula is not it.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of these, but there is a wierd burning sensation that it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>saves much money)  </li>
            <li>To products have a very synthetic chemically scent.</li>
            <li>I have very \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li>But my friend, who has much tougher skin than I, tried them and thought they stung.</li>
            <li>I keep seeing my results and my friend&#x27;s in the reviews, so it really is a hit or miss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup</li>
            <li>These wipes are very moist, and cleanse while also soothe and tone my skin,as it can also be acne prone.</li>
            <li>They have really helped with that.</li>
            <li>Removes make-up, oil and dirt very well.</li>
            <li>Very convient to throw in a gym/work bag.</li>
            <li>Even if I gently tap it over my face instead of wipe it, it still hurts.</li>
            <li>I really want to like the</li>
            <li>I removed my makeup and went to start getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>The exact opposite was true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly the problem with the formula, if so many people had the same reaction.</li>
            <li>The mask especially I put on and when I rinsed it off it had left an exact outline of bright red skin where the mask was applied.</li>
            <li>There are other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; from this brand, so if you want to smell like a fruit/veggie salad get their carrot body wash, blueberry creme, and top it off with a tomato conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to clean my face with a proper cleanser and water when I can, because I get the feeling</li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for gentle stuff, so when I saw these I was really interested.</li>
            <li>kinda makes it swell in some areas and my face dosnt feel clean after words definitely not gonna buy these again</li>
            <li>Immediately I went to the mirror to discover my face to be bright red and slightly puffy.</li>
            <li>I love dark eye makeup and eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the ingredients or just the fact that the rubbing motion strips my skin and dries it out, but it does remove mascara (washable kind).</li>
            <li>It gets three stars because it takes off my makeup, the wipes actually have enough wetness to them, which I haven&#x27;t found with many other products, and the wipes are a strong quality, not thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li>but they r decent for my chest and shoulders</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Garnier ones...</li>
            <li>I use them to remove my eye makeup as well as my face makeup, and they don&#x27;t make my eyes sting, which I have experienced with a few other brands.</li>
            <li>I love to use these they really refresh your skin, I was lucky to find them at my local walmart (though I found not many walmarts carry these</li>
            <li>My skin is left feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is also strong and not like other cucumber smells.</li>
            <li>Have have very oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing this company and make up cleansing in general.  </li>
            <li>though, they help to soothe red or irritated skin and leave your skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the normal Shesheido wipes</li>
            <li>Yes to cucumber leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed, and it greatly if not completely removes MT acne.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use a towelette in my nighttime routine</li>
            <li>If you wear more heavy duty make up this may not be the product for you</li>
            <li>No icky resedue.</li>
            <li>About 30 minutes ago I used one to remove my normal make up</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find them at my local Wal-Mart and was very tempted to purchase the wipes because I like not having to be bent in half, over a sink, for ten minutes while I&#x27;m washing my face, so obviously these were ideal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Yes to Cucumbers Facial Towelettes&amp;#34; for almost on year and sounds just right to me.</li>
            <li>(normal to super dry skin) I have been using them for a couple days</li>
            <li>I used to use the Neutrogena wipes, but I decided to give this new brand a try when I saw the two $7-$8 deal.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin is new to it, so it takes time to get use to it, but it never did after using for a week.</li>
            <li>They are a little drying, but they leave my skin clean!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get oily an hour later and adding moisturizer would not be needed, but use it lightly anyway especially sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin as well</li>
            <li>I can see how their tingling sensation that they give may irritate very sensitive skin, though,</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can be prone to redness.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be buying other products from this line.</li>
            <li>They both made my skin beet red, hot, and burning.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>turned red, itched, and felt hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>Will make your skin sting and red after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought that I was possibly allergic to something in the product - that&#x27;s how intense the burning was!  </li>
            <li>(I should also note that I would NOT consider my skin overly sensitive; just normal.)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Within seconds of wiping my face with this, my whole face started itching, burning, and generally felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>Not many guys will admit it, but some love shows like Sex in the City, not because they chose to, oh no, its because they connect with their women in their lives.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the last place people think to clean and even the last place people put sunscreen on.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I use these wipes right after coming in the door from a long day at work and school, instead of waiting until bedtime.  </li>
            <li>My eyes were so red and really burning that I just ended up washing my face with my normal cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use these wipes, my face feels soft and smooth despite my blemishes, and the redness tones down.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re prone to dry skin, definitely use a moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;There are an infinite number of similar products out there, and I&#x27;ve used many of them (and was even using in scented baby wipes for a while)</li>
            <li>My face feels clean not weighted down.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I recommend you stay away from this.</li>
            <li>But my skin is extremely sensitive to change, so I decided to stick it out.  </li>
            <li>Yes to cucumbers claims to be for sensitive skin, and also claims to give a soothing and calmness to your face.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using something that claims to be all natural yet still does this to my skin...</li>
            <li>I am a lover of a lot of the YTC line, and for lack of a better term, this product sucks.  </li>
            <li>this product may say hypoallergenic but it&#x27;s not for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No messy peeling or ziplocs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Now i know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And I find they&#x27;re gentle enough to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s no worse than using oxy cleaning pads or similar products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: these aren&#x27;t hypoallergenic or natural, as they claim.</li>
            <li>Maybe the reviewers with sensitive skin will want to try the Blum&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>but my skin became red and very irritated afterward.</li>
            <li>So far, I wouldn&#x27;t change them with others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything in terms of products to tone down the oil in my skin, but none have worked.</li>
            <li>They give my skin a fresh, tingly-clean feeling that leaves me assured I don&#x27;t need to do a double-cleanse (as is the case with other brands of wipes that do not remove all makeup).</li>
            <li>Personally, it&#x27;s a clean cucumber scent that doesn&#x27;t seem too heavy or lingering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other towelettes from other brands and they have never hurt my skin, so I know it isn&#x27;t the rubbing motion hurting it, but instead the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>They definitely don&#x27;t moisturize or do anything other than clean and freshen.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest to not even try these wipes...seeing that majority of people in these reviews have said the same thing.</li>
            <li>and I wait at least ten minutes after coming in from the hot sun before I go wiping my face clean.  </li>
            <li>apparently I mistook acne &amp; unbalanced for oily, when I was just provoking my sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I then took a shower and when I finished my face was back to normal.</li>
            <li>if you have very very sensitive skin i would stay away just because they do tingle a little but for my skin (which i did consider pretty sensitive)</li>
            <li>My pores are large, and my complexion is a patchy red, especially on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Big enough to remove large amounts of makeup  2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different brands of towelettes because they are so much easier to use in my opinion than makeup remover from a bottle.</li>
            <li>The Yes to Carrots is for drier skin, Cucumbers for sensitive to normal, Tomatoes for oily (which it WILL dry you out if you have severely oily skin-as I can attest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the basic regime that would work for my sensitive, temperamental skin.</li>
            <li>No harsh tugging or rubbing on the eyelid is necessary,</li>
            <li>, do you guys have any recommendations on any facial towelettes for sensitive, non burning, products?</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong, and they don&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight like some other brands have.</li>
            <li>I did experience a slight burning sensation at first but with continued use my skin has adapted.</li>
            <li>To skin care line (cucumber &amp; carrots) and the two lines compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li>As a Yes to Carrots lover and user, when I saw the entire line of Yes To... products at my local Target, I knew I had to pick this one up since it was for oily and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I normally have flawless smooth skin, so I&#x27;m very disappointed and distraught that this 98% Natural, Oil-free, non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic has completely ruined my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, or dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling to get rid of my acne since using bare minerals last year, and these finally did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have this unbalanced mess of sensitive, acne prone, t-zone, thus dry &amp; oily, photosensitive (redhead) skin that hasn&#x27;t been working with me very well.</li>
            <li>skin is normally not that sensitive, I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to a face product like this</li>
            <li>so bad it turns bright</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad, because it&#x27;s a seemingly nice combination of natural ingredients.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I wash with either the cucumbers gel cleanser or the cucumber towelettes (which are excellent for in the gym bag or purse for midday grime, working out, camping, roadtrip, etc...).</li>
            <li> They are awesome!!    </li>
            <li> I have never been so impressed!</li>

            <li> the best of any that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> So all in all, this product was a perfect choice for me.    </li>

            <li> These remove everything and leave my skin feeling GREAT!</li>
            <li> These are the best towelettes I have used.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with it, I just wish it was PRIME!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found them to be the best cleaning clothes ever.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Although there are some downfalls with these face wipes they are mostly good!  </li>
            <li> They smell great and help tighten pores.  </li>
            <li> These wipes are great for removing it after a couple hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; #3 - it smells great,</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a great reduction in redness and skin tone.</li>
            <li> and these are great.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re very effective.</li>
            <li> and like everyone said, it was successful at taking off all of my makeup, including eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> A good product, but</li>
            <li> Removes makeup fairly well.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup fairly well.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my skin, but for some reason it burns my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I had tried Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner about a year ago and remembered that I LOVED it, and decided to give something else a try.</li>
            <li> These wipes are good for clarifying and toning the skin.</li>
            <li> And I feel like it did not do a good job cleaning my make up, because the wipes is still \\&quot;clean-looking\\&quot; after I wiped my face (I put on foundation and concealer, but I didn&#x27;t see the color of foundation on the wipes).</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes because I had heard good reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Best of all, they don&#x27;t leave any feeling of residue afterwards, and they leave me feeling clean and refreshed before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They remove my makeup beautifully, and they are CHEAP!</li>
            <li> Although they are all great in their own right, the cucumbers worked best for me.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick wake-up or a midday cleanse, YES TO CUCUMBERS Towelettes are the best!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing product.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes!</li>
            <li> I really do LOVE these cleansing cloths!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> , it should be purified more and additives dissed!</li>
            <li> These babies are great as a refresher, I have oily skin, and they do a great job opening up the pores while moisturizing and have a nice cool refreshing effect.</li>
            <li> and they sounded amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> The 10 count is handy for the gym or purse,</li>
            <li> He said he liked it, and this man does not use beauty products.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how effective they are for makeup yet.</li>
            <li> I really liked them but after using them for a while, I started reacting to them.</li>
            <li> The stubborn blackheads on my cheeks have been coming to a head and coming out on its own.</li>
            <li> , so your best bet is going to supermarket and rubbing real cucumber on your face!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li> The wipes smell great, really fresh and floral.</li>
            <li> etc...I will say unless you are religious about sealing the container(s) you are best to put them into a ziplock of some kind to keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> scent is nice, and in my opinion, not too strong, and the cloths are a nice size, so I never have to use more than one.</li>
            <li> It said it was supposed to be soothing for the skin, and I was pretty happy to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and smells really good for normal skin type..</li>
            <li> the wipes are huge, dont leave your face sticky, and prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li> Btw, even if a product is marketed as being \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, many have some chemicals in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are so refreshing in the morning, instead of washing with soap.  </li>
            <li> these wipes are perfect and essential to  my bedtime routine now.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> and I just love them.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love Yes To products.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found this product to be one of the most calming things I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love this skin care line.</li>
            <li> He said it would be OK to use \\&quot;once in a while\\&quot; at the gym.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but these towelettes seem to have it all: cleansing, refreshing and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I also love the Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> And I must say that I love these Yes</li>
            <li> The packaging is also better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It takes off all my makeup while moisturizing my skin, every morning my face is so smooth that sometimes I forget to use my Cetaphil moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I hope everyone has the same awesome experience that  I had!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than bringing along a bottle of face wash, though, since they can leak everywhere.  </li>
            <li> More than that</li>
            <li> Refreshing cucumber smell, doesn&#x27;t burn or irratate skin.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I love that.  </li>
            <li> I could ask more. :-)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;!Women love salads</li>
            <li> and you might get more kisses than usual!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Love these for taking off makeup and grime at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean, wonderful and natural.</li>
            <li> Plus they smell so nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes.they are refreshing and easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and nice.</li>
            <li> They are a great natural alternative to the chemical-laden drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation these wipes bring is incredible, especially if you have just exercised or have been sweating at the time.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve read some bitter and burning reviews on this awesome product.   </li>
            <li> These wipes get ALL my eye makeup off easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the strong smell either.</li>
            <li> They feel cool on the skin, have a refreshing scent and remove all the oil and makeup that I have on my face.</li>
            <li> and that works fine for me.</li>
            <li> These things are huge with a lot of product</li>
            <li> The wipes are huge with lots of \\&quot;juice\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The entire line smells &amp; works great depending on your skin needs.</li>
            <li> and they smell fabulous to boot.</li>
            <li> (Which is important to do at the end of the day!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of smelling like fresh cucumbers, it smelled more like rotten cucumbers stuffed in a sock for couple of years.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Once the redness dispersed I was left with beautiful glowing skin, that felt fresh and invigorated.  </li>
            <li> best thing I&#x27;ve discovered about these is that they calm my skin down.</li>
            <li> That is VERY gentle :)</li>
            <li> They smell so so fresh!      </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more eco-friendly than a disposable product and most likely gives a better clean.</li>
            <li> They are gentle on my skin, remove easily all my make up, mascara included, even the water-proof...and my eyes don&#x27;t burn or get irritated!</li>
            <li> You feel refreshed, have clean skin and no clogged pores, soreness from scrubbing like with soap or having to rewash your face after to remove oil or leftover anything like with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t HAVE to soap up, but how in the heck do you feel clean just swiping that on your face?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most pre-moistened towelettes, and this by far is my my favorite.</li>
            <li> I guess I will just clean my kitchen with the rest of them.</li>
            <li> I use them every night to clean off make up and dirt.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find skin care products that work well and tis works GREAT!</li>
            <li> My nose and cheeks started to burn and turn bright red.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any burning, and my face feels cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> They take off makeup with just wiping, they&#x27;re gentle, no oils like most makeup removers.</li>
            <li> My face still felt grimy and full of make-up after using it.  </li>
            <li> I quickly used a Seventh Generation baby wipe to clean everywhere</li>
            <li> and these wipes are so gentle and refreshing to me.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of these and love that they are all natural, which is what drew me to them in the first place.  </li>
            <li> This product seemed ideal, especially after reading the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> They have a mild scent.</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t feel the burn.</li>
            <li> They do a pretty good job of removing eye makeup too, but sometimes I have to use two wipes to clean my entire face.</li>
            <li> I found the moisture level in it just at the right amount, it leaves no burning sensation (unless you find the tingly clean sensation burning).</li>
            <li> [i used to clean my face with burt&#x27;s bees products, and still do occasionally, the wipes are a nice alternative]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty fancy for face wipes, the opening is this tiny solid plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot;, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Just use the pads lightly and do not scrub - that might be why some folks are experiencing a burning sensation - just wipe downward gently.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of these wipes several months ago and liked them.</li>
            <li> The wipes are thick and smooth and feel great.</li>
            <li> However, these wipes are wonderful on the nights when I don&#x27;t think about washing my face until I&#x27;m completely exhausted and the thought of splashing water on my face is almost as repulsive as the thought of getting makeup on my pillow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the first wipe, my face immediately felt cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> They were definitely worth the money, and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job at that and leaves a fresh cucumber-y smell behind.</li>
            <li> ; #4 - they leave my face with a fresh, tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li> There is an abundant amount of the cleanser on it &amp; the towelette itself is large enough to clean your face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> There is an abundant amount of the cleanser on it &amp; the towelette itself is large enough to clean your face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> It comes right off.</li>
            <li> but i dont think these are right for me.  </li>
            <li> But who knows, they may be right for you.</li>
            <li> #2 - takes the makeup right off my face, including mascara off my eyelashes</li>
            <li> And the price is all right with me.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a wipe that will cleanly and GENTLY remove all of my makeup before I wash my face in the sink or shower.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about these Yes to Cucumber Facial Wipes is that they have a cooling effect- not an intense cooling like something with menthol, just a pleasant cool feeling like putting a wet washcloth on your forehead.  </li>
            <li> I believe less is more, cucumber already has many benefits when applied to skin</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use, I keep them right next to Emmy bed andbuse</li>
            <li> I tried Tomatoes first.</li>
            <li> The wipes themselves are thicker than most brands; actually feels like a clothe.</li>
            <li> those all sound natural to you?</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend them. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say, at first, there was burning.  </li>
            <li> I love the Yes to Cucumbers facial wipes.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I noticed the smell was funky.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just because I was using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these face wipes because I was in search of a better product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, im glad i gave these a try</li>
            <li> my skin felt hot and irritated.</li>
            <li> I use them first think in the morning to remove oil and at night to remove make-up.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena wipes is smooth and soft, and it never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was probably because it&#x27;s minty, but there&#x27;s no mint in the product.</li>
            <li> The price has spiked since I bought them first (used to be $6.99)</li>
            <li> I noticed my face started feeling hot.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, after wiping this on my face, for the first time, it burned my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love them and actually much more than my regular facial wash.</li>
            <li> ive been trying out skincare products since forever, in highschool i did perscriptions, i tried neutrogena (honestly like every single product they ever sold, bath and body works, body shop, sea breeze, clean and clear i could go on and on and on...</li>
            <li> right before going to bed, no hanging in front of a sink or intense scrubbing needed.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the BIGGEST wipes I&#x27;ve ever seen, and are more than large enough for everything I need them to do.</li>
            <li> These little towlettes are really convenient and smell good.  </li>
            <li> These leave my skin completely clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> but if you use a light and natural make up line this should work very well -</li>
            <li> Not very much like cucumbers, just very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There are 30 wipes per package, however they are fairly large and do not skimp on the amount of product in them.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t a chemical reaction to other brands.</li>
            <li> Other wipes are great for days when my skin can be dry, but using them too much leaves me oily and i break out.</li>
            <li> and I find these wipes to be really soothing and gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap enough that I&#x27;d recommend the experiment.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the smell and</li>
            <li> I felt like there wasn&#x27;t even much on the towelette in terms of cleanser or</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup, and eye makeup</li>
            <li> but my skin burned so much</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something soothing and gentle, but this formula is not it.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of these, but there is a wierd burning sensation that it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li> saves much money)  </li>
            <li> To products have a very synthetic chemically scent.</li>
            <li> I have very \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> But my friend, who has much tougher skin than I, tried them and thought they stung.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing my results and my friend&#x27;s in the reviews, so it really is a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup</li>
            <li> These wipes are very moist, and cleanse while also soothe and tone my skin,as it can also be acne prone.</li>
            <li> They have really helped with that.</li>
            <li> Removes make-up, oil and dirt very well.</li>
            <li> Very convient to throw in a gym/work bag.</li>
            <li> Even if I gently tap it over my face instead of wipe it, it still hurts.</li>
            <li> I really want to like the</li>
            <li> I removed my makeup and went to start getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li> The exact opposite was true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly the problem with the formula, if so many people had the same reaction.</li>
            <li> The mask especially I put on and when I rinsed it off it had left an exact outline of bright red skin where the mask was applied.</li>
            <li> There are other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; from this brand, so if you want to smell like a fruit/veggie salad get their carrot body wash, blueberry creme, and top it off with a tomato conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to clean my face with a proper cleanser and water when I can, because I get the feeling</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for gentle stuff, so when I saw these I was really interested.</li>
            <li> kinda makes it swell in some areas and my face dosnt feel clean after words definitely not gonna buy these again</li>
            <li> Immediately I went to the mirror to discover my face to be bright red and slightly puffy.</li>
            <li> I love dark eye makeup and eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the ingredients or just the fact that the rubbing motion strips my skin and dries it out, but it does remove mascara (washable kind).</li>
            <li> It gets three stars because it takes off my makeup, the wipes actually have enough wetness to them, which I haven&#x27;t found with many other products, and the wipes are a strong quality, not thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> but they r decent for my chest and shoulders</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Garnier ones...</li>
            <li> I use them to remove my eye makeup as well as my face makeup, and they don&#x27;t make my eyes sting, which I have experienced with a few other brands.</li>
            <li> I love to use these they really refresh your skin, I was lucky to find them at my local walmart (though I found not many walmarts carry these</li>
            <li> My skin is left feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is also strong and not like other cucumber smells.</li>
            <li> Have have very oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this company and make up cleansing in general.  </li>
            <li> though, they help to soothe red or irritated skin and leave your skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the normal Shesheido wipes</li>
            <li> Yes to cucumber leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed, and it greatly if not completely removes MT acne.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use a towelette in my nighttime routine</li>
            <li> If you wear more heavy duty make up this may not be the product for you</li>
            <li> No icky resedue.</li>
            <li> About 30 minutes ago I used one to remove my normal make up</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find them at my local Wal-Mart and was very tempted to purchase the wipes because I like not having to be bent in half, over a sink, for ten minutes while I&#x27;m washing my face, so obviously these were ideal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Yes to Cucumbers Facial Towelettes&amp;#34; for almost on year and sounds just right to me.</li>
            <li> (normal to super dry skin) I have been using them for a couple days</li>
            <li> I used to use the Neutrogena wipes, but I decided to give this new brand a try when I saw the two $7-$8 deal.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin is new to it, so it takes time to get use to it, but it never did after using for a week.</li>
            <li> They are a little drying, but they leave my skin clean!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get oily an hour later and adding moisturizer would not be needed, but use it lightly anyway especially sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin as well</li>
            <li> I can see how their tingling sensation that they give may irritate very sensitive skin, though,</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can be prone to redness.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be buying other products from this line.</li>
            <li> They both made my skin beet red, hot, and burning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> turned red, itched, and felt hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Will make your skin sting and red after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that I was possibly allergic to something in the product - that&#x27;s how intense the burning was!  </li>
            <li> (I should also note that I would NOT consider my skin overly sensitive; just normal.)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Within seconds of wiping my face with this, my whole face started itching, burning, and generally felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> Not many guys will admit it, but some love shows like Sex in the City, not because they chose to, oh no, its because they connect with their women in their lives.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the last place people think to clean and even the last place people put sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I use these wipes right after coming in the door from a long day at work and school, instead of waiting until bedtime.  </li>
            <li> My eyes were so red and really burning that I just ended up washing my face with my normal cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use these wipes, my face feels soft and smooth despite my blemishes, and the redness tones down.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to dry skin, definitely use a moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;There are an infinite number of similar products out there, and I&#x27;ve used many of them (and was even using in scented baby wipes for a while)</li>
            <li> My face feels clean not weighted down.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I recommend you stay away from this.</li>
            <li> But my skin is extremely sensitive to change, so I decided to stick it out.  </li>
            <li> Yes to cucumbers claims to be for sensitive skin, and also claims to give a soothing and calmness to your face.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using something that claims to be all natural yet still does this to my skin...</li>
            <li> I am a lover of a lot of the YTC line, and for lack of a better term, this product sucks.  </li>
            <li> this product may say hypoallergenic but it&#x27;s not for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No messy peeling or ziplocs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Now i know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And I find they&#x27;re gentle enough to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s no worse than using oxy cleaning pads or similar products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: these aren&#x27;t hypoallergenic or natural, as they claim.</li>
            <li> Maybe the reviewers with sensitive skin will want to try the Blum&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> but my skin became red and very irritated afterward.</li>
            <li> So far, I wouldn&#x27;t change them with others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything in terms of products to tone down the oil in my skin, but none have worked.</li>
            <li> They give my skin a fresh, tingly-clean feeling that leaves me assured I don&#x27;t need to do a double-cleanse (as is the case with other brands of wipes that do not remove all makeup).</li>
            <li> Personally, it&#x27;s a clean cucumber scent that doesn&#x27;t seem too heavy or lingering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other towelettes from other brands and they have never hurt my skin, so I know it isn&#x27;t the rubbing motion hurting it, but instead the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> They definitely don&#x27;t moisturize or do anything other than clean and freshen.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest to not even try these wipes...seeing that majority of people in these reviews have said the same thing.</li>
            <li> and I wait at least ten minutes after coming in from the hot sun before I go wiping my face clean.  </li>
            <li> apparently I mistook acne &amp; unbalanced for oily, when I was just provoking my sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I then took a shower and when I finished my face was back to normal.</li>
            <li> if you have very very sensitive skin i would stay away just because they do tingle a little but for my skin (which i did consider pretty sensitive)</li>
            <li> My pores are large, and my complexion is a patchy red, especially on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Big enough to remove large amounts of makeup  2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of towelettes because they are so much easier to use in my opinion than makeup remover from a bottle.</li>
            <li> The Yes to Carrots is for drier skin, Cucumbers for sensitive to normal, Tomatoes for oily (which it WILL dry you out if you have severely oily skin-as I can attest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the basic regime that would work for my sensitive, temperamental skin.</li>
            <li> No harsh tugging or rubbing on the eyelid is necessary,</li>
            <li> , do you guys have any recommendations on any facial towelettes for sensitive, non burning, products?</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too strong, and they don&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight like some other brands have.</li>
            <li> I did experience a slight burning sensation at first but with continued use my skin has adapted.</li>
            <li> To skin care line (cucumber &amp; carrots) and the two lines compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li> As a Yes to Carrots lover and user, when I saw the entire line of Yes To... products at my local Target, I knew I had to pick this one up since it was for oily and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I normally have flawless smooth skin, so I&#x27;m very disappointed and distraught that this 98% Natural, Oil-free, non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic has completely ruined my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, or dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to get rid of my acne since using bare minerals last year, and these finally did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have this unbalanced mess of sensitive, acne prone, t-zone, thus dry &amp; oily, photosensitive (redhead) skin that hasn&#x27;t been working with me very well.</li>
            <li> skin is normally not that sensitive, I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to a face product like this</li>
            <li> so bad it turns bright</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because it&#x27;s a seemingly nice combination of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I had read reviews about these for awhile before i bought them mainly because they are a little bit more expensive then others.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough product in one wipe to clean your face, the front of your neck, the back of your neck, and behind your ears.</li>
            <li> I have combination (VERY oily in some areas and VERY dry in others) skin, and this product toned down the oiliness without drying the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> They also stay very moist in their packaging, which in the past I&#x27;ve found to be a big problem even with Korres wipes.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in other reviews, I&#x27;ve significantly paired down my skincare routine to only a few products.</li>
            <li> It did, the only thing it didn&#x27;t take off was my mascara, but since it was water resistant, I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face within seconds of removing my make-up, so the irritation did not last that long.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps me get over my disposable product guilt, with my excuse that I don&#x27;t use them all the time, and they don&#x27;t dry out, so I don&#x27;t have to be in a hurry to use them all!</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smelling a little fragrance-y, but it isn&#x27;t too bad, and it&#x27;s really nice after a workout!</li>
            <li> Now 24 hours later I have this rough itchy rash across my chin.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover flips open and then clicks closed once I am done.</li>
            <li> The burning sensation only lasted about 20 minutes, but after five or six tries, I had to give these up.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel greasy, and as long as I follow up with a bit of water and some moisturizer I don&#x27;t feel dry or burning.</li>
            <li> My skin, especially my face, is extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I get very red, puffy and inflamed due to my medication.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to either switch back to neutrogena ones or using other make up remover.</li>
            <li> And, I was ONLY using other</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the towelettes left a burning sensation so I stopped using them.  </li>
            <li> I bought these cloths because they were cheaper than several other brands.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;ve fallen prey to the notion that I had to use all of these various items to clear &amp; balance up my delicate 30+ face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get breakouts; I&#x27;m not too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> Dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I was buying Blum&#x27;s wipes for sensitive skin on Amazon, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past that stinky patchouli smell, and just my luck</li>
            <li> The acne was a bit flared though, but it went back down after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> the ingredients don&#x27;t seem as pure, but at least I wasn&#x27;t burning up!  </li>
            <li> After this happened I checked other reviews to realize the same thing in other people.</li>
            <li> I decided to look at the back of the package to find five natural organic ingredients followed by several long complicated chemical compounds that I could not even pronounce.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne which used to be extreme, but has since died down over the years.</li>
            <li> Like others, I thought I was going to find some tiny wipe with little product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry my skin out, but I always follow up with my moisturizer because my skin is extremely prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of cleansing wipes, including the high-end brand Korres.  </li>
            <li> I noted that the cloth was rough and the remover was burning my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of my weekend minimal routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added unknown ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I finished with my entire face, I noticed the redness was toned down a bit, and my face felt less oily than it had in ages.</li>
            <li> I personally, with extremely sensitive skin, have not experienced any burning or irritation with this product (using them an average of once a day).</li>
            <li> I personally, with extremely sensitive skin, have not experienced any burning or irritation with this product (using them an average of once a day).</li>
            <li> I really like them as they are the only towelettes that haven&#x27;t broken me out in a rash (seriously, every single brand has).</li>
            <li> Very little residue left from mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have used about every acne/facewash product there is, most leave my skin dry and irritated, not to mention they smell like crap, are a pain in the butt to use.</li>
            <li> Regarding the burning that other reviewers have experience, I can understand how it might bother them.</li>
            <li> That was pretty scary.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin (at least I thought I did!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my face every night, hardly twice a week, so possibly that had something to do with it?</li>
            <li> I never liked facial wipes in the past-Everyone says you should remove your makeup before bed, but I always felt like the wipes were just pushing makeup and impurities all over my face instead of removing them, and then leaving a film.  </li>
            <li> When the weekend comes around and I&#x27;ve had a late night, washing and moisturizing my face is the last thing I want to do.</li>
            <li> People seem to either love or hate these.</li>
            <li> fiance and our room mate like using them too, because it cools their face down and gets rid of the sweat that can irritate their eyes.  </li>
            <li> This calms that down about 75%.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything down to sulfur, sulfa, and sulfate.</li>
            <li> They seem to be going away now, after about half an hour, but I still feel the burn and some itchiness.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bothered trying a facial wipe in years because they&#x27;ve all left my skin sticky and weird.  </li>
            <li> In the past I dealt with chemically enhanced products, but now only deal with organic or all-natural products with a small amount of ingredients or ingredients that I can recognize and are not chemicals.</li>
            <li> I typically use make-up remover cloths from Ponds, Olay, Garnier -- all without a problem.</li>
            <li> So when it comes to personal care some will dare and try things their women buy, hey there is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with taking care of yourself, being a tough guy and using motor oil as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> the least often of all, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure how thorough these with deep-cleaning and hard-to-remove stuff, but they work well enough for me.</li>
            <li> also adore the double-seal on the packet, with a sticky tab and a little plastic door.</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes a little while ago</li>
            <li> I feel a little burning after using them but</li>
            <li> Not sure why this burned or if the other product lines are as harsh.</li>
            <li> I just try to be careful with not rubbing too hard, and then I follow up with a toner to remove any lingering traces.</li>
            <li> Sal (Dead Sea Mineral Salts), Camelia Sinensis Extract (Organic Green Tea Extract), Cucumis Sativus Extract (Organic Cucumber Extract), Benzoic Acid, Parfum/Fragrance, Xanthan Gum, Dehydroacetic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Citric Acid</li>
            <li> They have aloe, green tea and cucumber extracts in them and do not leave my combination oily/dry skin feeling dried out or oily.  </li>
            <li> I use it now for my body because I don&#x27;t want to waste it...</li>
            <li> Within a few seconds of wiping my face with this my forehead, cheeks, and chin all</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just a few days of use</li>
            <li> I was getting sick &amp; tired mostly of the acne.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, OMG the burning was so bad I had to wash my face again.</li>
            <li> The towelette itself is too small.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, though, so I usually try to go ahead and rinse my face after using them, anyway.  </li>
            <li> I suggest buying a small sample pack to see if you like them.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase these because the store ran out of my usual wipes.</li>
            <li> and, I&#x27;m not sure either.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rub too hard, but for some reason my skin feels raw while</li>
            <li> I do not feel dirty or heavy like make up and make up removing residual are present.</li>
            <li> I specifically got this product because it received a low toxin rating on the cosmetic safety database, so needless to say this is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no excuse to go to bed with a dirty face.</li>
            <li> Although these wipes dont leave behind a soapy feeling, they do make my skin feel a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects from these.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that they burn and sting when I use them on the thinner skin on my face, around my eyes, and on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Not effective in removing make up</li>
            <li> It went away within the hour with no lasting side effects, but still, it was a very uncomfortable experience</li>
            <li> (someone mentioned it&#x27;s too dry and weak for her lady-like face and that her dirty husband likes it.</li>
            <li> These wipes irritated my skin so badly they actually caused acne.</li>
            <li> However, after using it a second time, my face was burning so bad</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have never had a bad reaction to anything topical.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m afraid to use other products by this brand that I bought together.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with patches of dry skin on my face for about two months and have been frustrated trying to find a solution.</li>
            <li> I have tough skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was NOT thrilled after I used 2 to take off my makeup before bed.  </li>
            <li> I am on approximately wipe 28</li>
            <li> These towelettes don&#x27;t leave any stickiness behind like the Neutrogena towelettes do.</li>
            <li> They leave behind what others are calling a \\&quot;tingling.\\</li>
            <li> and I must admit it is a game changer.</li>
            <li> -- I don&#x27;t think this product is poorly made, it&#x27;s just not the one for me.</li>
            <li> I know other people have had bad experiences with these, and I think it&#x27;s a matter of skin chemistry --</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the sensitive skin variety that contains that awful scent.  </li>
            <li> and now it is so red like I&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunburn or bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> primer + creamy eyeshadow base + heavily pigmented mineral shadow + waterproof eyeliner + mascara    </li>
            <li> merely washing it off didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The Yes to Cucumbers burned horribly, and as well made my cheek areas blotchy red.  </li>
            <li> I use the towelettes to remove makeup and when I need to freshen up after a workout (or just a dirty day).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I had difficulty putting in my contact lenses afterward -- my eyes were raging like fire, and I had to splash my face with cold water.  </li>
            <li> They burn my eyes like crazy.</li>
            <li> I splashed cold water on my face then grabbed my cleanser and washed.</li>
            <li> I looked like I got a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> buy em and try em, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed for a couple reasons.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the number of reviewers complaining of stinging, heat, redness, etc.!  </li>
            <li> It was so painful!  </li>
            <li> I bought some Sephora brand makeup wipes that were absolutely miserable, so these just made my day!</li>
            <li> Do not buy, it&#x27;s a horrible product!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the basic regime that would work for my sensitive, temperamental skin. I have this unbalanced mess of sensitive, acne prone, t-zone, thus dry &amp; oily, photosensitive (redhead) skin that hasn&#x27;t been working with me very well. I discovered the Yes To line &amp; on a whim decided I&#x27;d give them each a try. Although they are all great in their own right, the cucumbers worked best for me. I \\&quot;uncluttered\\&quot; by collection of various topical scrubs, creams, rx&#x27;s, etc...as I&#x27;ve fallen prey to the notion that I had to use all of these various items to clear &amp; balance up my delicate 30+ face. I was getting sick &amp; tired mostly of the acne. Now it seems this line has solved my problem. I wash with either the cucumbers gel cleanser or the cucumber towelettes (which are excellent for in the gym bag or purse for midday grime, working out, camping, roadtrip, etc...). The entire line smells &amp; works great depending on your skin needs. I will say that the smell has been an issue for some people (in regard to reviews). Smell is subjective. Personally, it&#x27;s a clean cucumber scent that doesn&#x27;t seem too heavy or lingering. But that&#x27;s my opinion. All the products work well with one another. The Yes to Carrots is for drier skin, Cucumbers for sensitive to normal, Tomatoes for oily (which it WILL dry you out if you have severely oily skin-as I can attest. I tried Tomatoes first. A good product, but apparently I mistook acne &amp; unbalanced for oily, when I was just provoking my sensitive skin). There is another line coming out soon, Blueberries for aging skin. As I am in my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ll probably upgrade from Cucumbers to Blueberries when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, they come in this &amp; a 10 count smaller packaging. The 10 count is handy for the gym or purse, etc...I will say unless you are religious about sealing the container(s) you are best to put them into a ziplock of some kind to keep them from drying out. The wipes themselves are thicker than most brands; actually feels like a clothe. There is an abundant amount of the cleanser on it &amp; the towelette itself is large enough to clean your face &amp; neck. Removes makeup fairly well. I personally, with extremely sensitive skin, have not experienced any burning or irritation with this product (using them an average of once a day). I would say if they have there is something within the product itself they must be allergic to. Everyone is different.e a clothe.

            <li> I just used one wipe and like everyone said, it was successful at taking off all of my makeup, including eye liner and mascara. However, my skin started burning and I got some welts/raised lumps... They seem to be going away now, after about half an hour, but I still feel the burn and some itchiness. I specifically got this product because it received a low toxin rating on the cosmetic safety database, so needless to say this is a big disappointment. If you have sensitive skin, I recommend you stay away from this. Wish I had. Btw, even if a product is marketed as being \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, many have some chemicals in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients in these wipes:&lt;br /&gt;Water/Aqua, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sodium Benzoate, Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe Vera), Sea Salt /Maris Sal (Dead Sea Mineral Salts), Camelia Sinensis Extract (Organic Green Tea Extract), Cucumis Sativus Extract (Organic Cucumber Extract), Benzoic Acid, Parfum/Fragrance, Xanthan Gum, Dehydroacetic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do those all sound natural to you? Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! They are a great natural alternative to the chemical-laden drugstore brands. Pack them in your carry-on because they&#x27;re TSA approved for air travel (you don&#x27;t have to put them in a plastic baggie or anything).     I have acne-prone combination skin and I find these wipes to be really soothing and gentle. They do a pretty good job of removing eye makeup too, but sometimes I have to use two wipes to clean my entire face.</li>
            <li> This product seemed ideal, especially after reading the natural ingredients.  Unfortunately, I was NOT thrilled after I used 2 to take off my makeup before bed.  My nose and cheeks started to burn and turn bright red.  I noticed some others had issues with this too.  I highly recommend the Garnier ones...the ingredients don&#x27;t seem as pure, but at least I wasn&#x27;t burning up!  I&#x27;ll be switching back.</li>
            <li> These are so refreshing in the morning, instead of washing with soap.  They smell great and help tighten pores.  If you need a quick wake-up or a midday cleanse, YES TO CUCUMBERS Towelettes are the best!</li>
            <li> ive been trying out skincare products since forever, in highschool i did perscriptions, i tried neutrogena (honestly like every single product they ever sold, bath and body works, body shop, sea breeze, clean and clear i could go on and on and on... but then i read a blog post about these and they sounded amazing and they ARE! if you have very very sensitive skin i would stay away just because they do tingle a little but for my skin (which i did consider pretty sensitive) these wipes are perfect and essential to  my bedtime routine now. the wipes are huge, dont leave your face sticky, and prevent breakouts! and they smell fabulous to boot. buy em and try em, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a wipe that will cleanly and GENTLY remove all of my makeup before I wash my face in the sink or shower. I stumbled upon these at my local Target, checked the ingredients, and picked up a pack. They are awesome!!    I wear on my eyes: primer + creamy eyeshadow base + heavily pigmented mineral shadow + waterproof eyeliner + mascara    These wipes get ALL my eye makeup off easily. I have never been so impressed! No harsh tugging or rubbing on the eyelid is necessary, no burning sensation, no irritation. Plus they smell so nice and clean. I bought some Sephora brand makeup wipes that were absolutely miserable, so these just made my day! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I never liked facial wipes in the past-Everyone says you should remove your makeup before bed, but I always felt like the wipes were just pushing makeup and impurities all over my face instead of removing them, and then leaving a film.  These, however, have restored my faith facial wipes and I have added them to my bedtime routine.  They have aloe, green tea and cucumber extracts in them and do not leave my combination oily/dry skin feeling dried out or oily.  My favorite part about these Yes to Cucumber Facial Wipes is that they have a cooling effect- not an intense cooling like something with menthol, just a pleasant cool feeling like putting a wet washcloth on your forehead.  Because of this, I use these wipes right after coming in the door from a long day at work and school, instead of waiting until bedtime.  I am on approximately wipe 28 and they are just as moist at the end of the package, which is quite the feat for this type of packaging (I believe Neutrogena packages theirs in a similar type of package, but I ALWAYS had problems with those wipe drying out).  Happy to have discovered this product!</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve used several different brands of towelettes because they are so much easier to use in my opinion than makeup remover from a bottle. I really like this brand the best of any that I&#x27;ve used. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong, and they don&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight like some other brands have. I use them to remove my eye makeup as well as my face makeup, and they don&#x27;t make my eyes sting, which I have experienced with a few other brands. I also like that the list of ingredients is short and there&#x27;s nothing mysterious in it.</li>
            <li> Bought these on a whim at CVS when I was looking for something else.  I haven&#x27;t bothered trying a facial wipe in years because they&#x27;ve all left my skin sticky and weird.  These leave my skin completely clean and soft.  I know other people have had bad experiences with these, and I think it&#x27;s a matter of skin chemistry -- I haven&#x27;t had any negative effects from these.  They&#x27;re cheap enough that I&#x27;d recommend the experiment.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of these and I just love them. I&#x27;ll be buying them alot. I love dark eye makeup and eyeliner. I decided to use these wipes and see if it would take my eye makeup off. It did, the only thing it didn&#x27;t take off was my mascara, but since it was water resistant, I&#x27;m not surprised.  I didn&#x27;t get any burning, and my face feels cool and refreshed. It even feels tighter.  I love these. Definitely recommend them. :)</li>
            <li> I have tough skin. I take good care of my skin, but for some reason it burns my skin. I thought it&#x27;d be refreshing. The smell is also strong and not like other cucumber smells. I use it now for my body because I don&#x27;t want to waste it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love Yes To products.  I was surprised to find them at my local Wal-Mart and was very tempted to purchase the wipes because I like not having to be bent in half, over a sink, for ten minutes while I&#x27;m washing my face, so obviously these were ideal.  I absolutely adore the smell and the feel of it going over my face.  [i used to clean my face with burt&#x27;s bees products, and still do occasionally, the wipes are a nice alternative]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, at first, there was burning.  But my skin is extremely sensitive to change, so I decided to stick it out.  Once the redness dispersed I was left with beautiful glowing skin, that felt fresh and invigorated.  Now I don&#x27;t get the burning, but that could just be because I keep them in the fridge and I wait at least ten minutes after coming in from the hot sun before I go wiping my face clean.  I also don&#x27;t wear make-up often, but occasionally I&#x27;ll wear eye liner and mascara.  These wipes are great for removing it after a couple hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiance and our room mate like using them too, because it cools their face down and gets rid of the sweat that can irritate their eyes.  All and all, it&#x27;s got five stars in this family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip-  Don&#x27;t forget the back of your neck, that&#x27;s the last place people think to clean and even the last place people put sunscreen on. There&#x27;s enough product in one wipe to clean your face, the front of your neck, the back of your neck, and behind your ears.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of these wipes several months ago and liked them. I finally bought a pack today from Ulta because they were cheaper than the Ulta brand, had a coupon, were on sale and larger quantity. I thought I had gotten a deal until I got home and tried them. MY FACE WAS ON FIRE! (water helped) I decided to look at the back of the package to find five natural organic ingredients followed by several long complicated chemical compounds that I could not even pronounce.</li>
            <li> I really do LOVE these cleansing cloths! They feel cool on the skin, have a refreshing scent and remove all the oil and makeup that I have on my face.</li>
            <li> I saw these at the store about a week ago on sale so I decided to buy them. Like others, I thought I was going to find some tiny wipe with little product. The exact opposite was true. These things are huge with a lot of product so they&#x27;re very effective. I have combination (VERY oily in some areas and VERY dry in others) skin, and this product toned down the oiliness without drying the rest of my skin. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin as well and I&#x27;ve found this product to be one of the most calming things I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. No burning, redness, etc. I know it says not use on eyes but I still do anyway to remove eye makeup. It comes right off. I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this product! I will most definitely be buying other products from this line.</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty fancy for face wipes, the opening is this tiny solid plastic \\&quot;door\\&quot;, it&#x27;s great! The wipes smell great, really fresh and floral. The wipes are thick and smooth and feel great. They are a little drying, but they leave my skin clean! It leaves your skin smelling a little fragrance-y, but it isn&#x27;t too bad, and it&#x27;s really nice after a workout!</li>
            <li> I love these. They take off makeup with just wiping, they&#x27;re gentle, no oils like most makeup removers. You feel refreshed, have clean skin and no clogged pores, soreness from scrubbing like with soap or having to rewash your face after to remove oil or leftover anything like with makeup remover. I love this skin care line. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin too. Won&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Yes to cucumbers claims to be for sensitive skin, and also claims to give a soothing and calmness to your face. However, I have felt the completely opposite feeling after using this product and the yes to cucumbers face mask. They both made my skin beet red, hot, and burning. After this happened I checked other reviews to realize the same thing in other people. The mask especially I put on and when I rinsed it off it had left an exact outline of bright red skin where the mask was applied. If you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY.  I had to apply witch hazel to stop my face from burning-merely washing it off didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive skin! Within a few seconds of wiping my face with this my forehead, cheeks, and chin all turned red, itched, and felt hot to the touch. It went away within the hour with no lasting side effects, but still, it was a very uncomfortable experience and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using something that claims to be all natural yet still does this to my skin...&lt;br /&gt;This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.  I am a lover of a lot of the YTC line, and for lack of a better term, this product sucks.  Here&#x27;s why:    The towelette itself is too small.  There is zero lather.  I get that it&#x27;s a cleansing towelette and it doesn&#x27;t HAVE to soap up, but how in the heck do you feel clean just swiping that on your face?  I felt like there wasn&#x27;t even much on the towelette in terms of cleanser or whatever it is on there.  My face still felt grimy and full of make-up after using it.  I ended up washing my face with regular face wash after using this.    My husband walked in while I tried it and used it.  He said he liked it, and this man does not use beauty products.  He has been known to use shampoo for hair and body, and body wash for body and hair.  He is not into this stuff.  He said it would be OK to use \\&quot;once in a while\\&quot; at the gym.  I told him he could have the rest.</li>
            <li> I actually have the blueberry and I love it. My face feels clean not weighted down. It doesn&#x27;t get oily an hour later and adding moisturizer would not be needed, but use it lightly anyway especially sunscreen. I look forward to bedtime and waking up I do not feel dirty or heavy like make up and make up removing residual are present.</li>
            <li> I try to clean my face with a proper cleanser and water when I can, because I get the feeling it&#x27;s more eco-friendly than a disposable product and most likely gives a better clean. However, these wipes are wonderful on the nights when I don&#x27;t think about washing my face until I&#x27;m completely exhausted and the thought of splashing water on my face is almost as repulsive as the thought of getting makeup on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, and in my opinion, not too strong, and the cloths are a nice size, so I never have to use more than one. I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup, and eye makeup the least often of all, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure how thorough these with deep-cleaning and hard-to-remove stuff, but they work well enough for me. Best of all, they don&#x27;t leave any feeling of residue afterwards, and they leave me feeling clean and refreshed before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also adore the double-seal on the packet, with a sticky tab and a little plastic door. This definitely helps me get over my disposable product guilt, with my excuse that I don&#x27;t use them all the time, and they don&#x27;t dry out, so I don&#x27;t have to be in a hurry to use them all!</li>
            <li> This is my #1 makeup remover/cleanser. As I&#x27;ve said in other reviews, I&#x27;ve significantly paired down my skincare routine to only a few products. I use the towelettes to remove makeup and when I need to freshen up after a workout (or just a dirty day).&lt;br /&gt;I have acne and rosacea-prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t burn, sting or otherwise irritate my skin. They have a mild scent. I&#x27;ve used them around my eyes without any irritation either. They definitely don&#x27;t moisturize or do anything other than clean and freshen. If you&#x27;re prone to dry skin, definitely use a moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;There are an infinite number of similar products out there, and I&#x27;ve used many of them (and was even using in scented baby wipes for a while) but these towelettes seem to have it all: cleansing, refreshing and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> As a Yes to Carrots lover and user, when I saw the entire line of Yes To... products at my local Target, I knew I had to pick this one up since it was for oily and/or sensitive skin. My skin, especially my face, is extremely oily. I have moderate acne which used to be extreme, but has since died down over the years. My pores are large, and my complexion is a patchy red, especially on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything in terms of products to tone down the oil in my skin, but none have worked. In the past I dealt with chemically enhanced products, but now only deal with organic or all-natural products with a small amount of ingredients or ingredients that I can recognize and are not chemicals. So all in all, this product was a perfect choice for me.    There are 30 wipes per package, however they are fairly large and do not skimp on the amount of product in them. On the first wipe, my face immediately felt cool and refreshed. Once I finished with my entire face, I noticed the redness was toned down a bit, and my face felt less oily than it had in ages. The acne was a bit flared though, but it went back down after a couple of hours. Every time I use these wipes, my face feels soft and smooth despite my blemishes, and the redness tones down. The cooling sensation these wipes bring is incredible, especially if you have just exercised or have been sweating at the time. They were definitely worth the money, and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love the Yes to Cucumbers facial wipes. My skin is left feeling clean and soft. The wipes are huge with lots of \\&quot;juice\\&quot;. The smell is clean, wonderful and natural. I also love the Yes to Carrots shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of cleansing wipes, including the high-end brand Korres.  And I must say that I love these Yes To wipes the best! They&#x27;re the BIGGEST wipes I&#x27;ve ever seen, and are more than large enough for everything I need them to do. They give my skin a fresh, tingly-clean feeling that leaves me assured I don&#x27;t need to do a double-cleanse (as is the case with other brands of wipes that do not remove all makeup). These remove everything and leave my skin feeling GREAT! They also stay very moist in their packaging, which in the past I&#x27;ve found to be a big problem even with Korres wipes. I can see how their tingling sensation that they give may irritate very sensitive skin, though, so use with care.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be good for my sensitive skin. After one use, my face was stinging and very red. I looked like I got a bad sunburn. These wipes irritated my skin so badly they actually caused acne. I would never use these again.</li>
            <li> I only used this God-forsaken wipes because I ran out of my Aveeno ULTRA-CALMING Makeup Removing Wipes. My roommate let me borrow one. OMG as soon as I put it on my face I noted that the cloth was rough and the remover was burning my face. Now 24 hours later I have this rough itchy rash across my chin. I normally have flawless smooth skin, so I&#x27;m very disappointed and distraught that this 98% Natural, Oil-free, non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic has completely ruined my skin. I&#x27;m slathering on some hydrocortisone and praying my face goes back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAY NO to &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Will make your skin sting and red after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is normally not that sensitive, I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to a face product like this before!&lt;br /&gt;I had to stay home to wait until the redness goes away. It&#x27;s clearly the problem with the formula, if so many people had the same reaction. Now I&#x27;m afraid to use other products by this brand that I bought together. ARgh</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and smells really good for normal skin type..it did remove my make-up but my skin burned so much this product may say hypoallergenic but it&#x27;s not for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could get my makeup/foundation off the minute I was out of work and in my car. They serve that purpose well. They don&#x27;t dry my skin out, but I always follow up with my moisturizer because my skin is extremely prone to dryness. These towelettes don&#x27;t leave any stickiness behind like the Neutrogena towelettes do. The packaging is also better than Neutrogena&#x27;s. The plastic cover flips open and then clicks closed once I am done. No messy peeling or ziplocs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant. Not very much like cucumbers, just very clean and fresh. Not soapy smelling. The consistency of the product in the towelettes is watery, they are not soapy or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I&#x27;ve discovered about these is that they calm my skin down. I get very red, puffy and inflamed due to my medication. This calms that down about 75%. I will definitely repurchase. These are the best towelettes I have used.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all. I have sensitive eyes and i was wiping them with these and no sting at all. Very refreshing product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to remove makeup at the end of the day. It does a wonderful job at that and leaves a fresh cucumber-y smell behind. The only problem I had with these wipes is that they don&#x27;t do anything in the way of exfoliating your skin. (Which is important to do at the end of the day!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side though, they help to soothe red or irritated skin and leave your skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the normal Shesheido wipes so I got these wipes because it was on sale for 5.99 at target. It said it was supposed to be soothing for the skin, and I was pretty happy to purchase it. When I first opened it I noticed the smell was funky. Instead of smelling like fresh cucumbers, it smelled more like rotten cucumbers stuffed in a sock for couple of years. When I used it for the first time, OMG the burning was so bad I had to wash my face again. I thought it was just because I was using it for the first time. However, after using it a second time, my face was burning so bad and now it is so red like I&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunburn or bad allergic reaction. Do not buy, it&#x27;s a horrible product!!!</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for gentle stuff, so when I saw these I was really interested. It gets three stars because it takes off my makeup, the wipes actually have enough wetness to them, which I haven&#x27;t found with many other products, and the wipes are a strong quality, not thin and flimsy. My biggest complaint is that they burn and sting when I use them on the thinner skin on my face, around my eyes, and on my cheekbones. I was really hoping for something soothing and gentle, but this formula is not it. I don&#x27;t rub too hard, but for some reason my skin feels raw while and after I use them.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of these, but there is a wierd burning sensation that it leaves on my skin.  I thought that I was possibly allergic to something in the product - that&#x27;s how intense the burning was!  I tried to give them away and 2 friends said they had the same reaction.  Eek!</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes.they are refreshing and easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;great to keep on hand when you just need to refresh your makeup!</li>
            <li> I recently bought these face wipes because I was in search of a better product.  The face wipes i was using before left my face feeling soapy which wasnt what i wanted at all.      I had read reviews about these for awhile before i bought them mainly because they are a little bit more expensive then others.  Finally i just gave in.    I was slightly disappointed for a couple reasons.    1. Although these wipes dont leave behind a soapy feeling, they do make my skin feel a little sticky.  2. They leave behind what others are calling a \\&quot;tingling.\\&quot;  Now i know i have sensitive skin but these just burn.  Mostly around my eyes but its definatly uncomfortable.      Although there are some downfalls with these face wipes they are mostly good!  1. They are so big!  I was expecting to find that these wipes were average/small in size and that is just not the case.  Big enough to remove large amounts of makeup  2. They smell so so fresh!      Overall, im glad i gave these a try but i dont think these are right for me.  But who knows, they may be right for you.</li>
            <li> I love to use these they really refresh your skin, I was lucky to find them at my local walmart (though I found not many walmarts carry these but it doesnt hurt to go in or call saves much money)  and since then I been using them all the time.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve read some bitter and burning reviews on this awesome product.   It works for me! I found the moisture level in it just at the right amount, it leaves no burning sensation (unless you find the tingly clean sensation burning). Maybe because I&#x27;m a man (someone mentioned it&#x27;s too dry and weak for her lady-like face and that her dirty husband likes it. I&#x27;m with you, husband!)  Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with it, I just wish it was PRIME! Guess I&#x27;ll keep getting it from Duane Reade until Amazon primes it.</li>
            <li> Works well for eye makeup removal.  Very little residue left from mascara.  I have used more expensive products that have never quite done the trick.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using these because I noticed when I went to bed my skin felt hot and irritated. Not sure if it&#x27;s the ingredients or just the fact that the rubbing motion strips my skin and dries it out, but it does remove mascara (washable kind). Another drawback is the smell. All of the Yes To products have a very synthetic chemically scent. Not what I expect from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> Yes to cucumber was given to me as a gift and I must admit it is a game changer. I have used about every acne/facewash product there is, most leave my skin dry and irritated, not to mention they smell like crap, are a pain in the butt to use. Yes to cucumber leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed, and it greatly if not completely removes MT acne. I love the ease of use, I keep them right next to Emmy bed andbuse right before going to bed, no hanging in front of a sink or intense scrubbing needed.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with patches of dry skin on my face for about two months and have been frustrated trying to find a solution. I use cetaphil products, facial moisturizer, daily skin moisturizer and cetaphil daily wash. I don&#x27;t wash my face every night, hardly twice a week, so possibly that had something to do with it? And possibly the San Francisco bipolar weather? Anyways, I had tried Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner about a year ago and remembered that I LOVED it, and decided to give something else a try. I chose Yes to Cucumbers facial towelettes over Carrots because of my skin type. I have been using these EVERY night for 2 weeks and my face has healed!!! And it is smoother than ever before! It takes off all my makeup while moisturizing my skin, every morning my face is so smooth that sometimes I forget to use my Cetaphil moisturizer! I am now recommending these products to friends and family and will continue to only use these products! I hope everyone has the same awesome experience that  I had!</li>
            <li> These little towlettes are really convenient and smell good.  I have acne prone skin, though, so I usually try to go ahead and rinse my face after using them, anyway.  It&#x27;s better than bringing along a bottle of face wash, though, since they can leak everywhere.  My husband doesn&#x27;t have the acne problem, so he just wipes with them and goes.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients, and despite others&#x27; reviews about their sensitivity, I figured I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem -- I&#x27;ve used various moist towelettes before and never had a problem.  (I should also note that I would NOT consider my skin overly sensitive; just normal.) I intend to use them not just for face makeup, but for eyes as well.  The Yes to Cucumbers burned horribly, and as well made my cheek areas blotchy red.  More than that, I had difficulty putting in my contact lenses afterward -- my eyes were raging like fire, and I had to splash my face with cold water.  The burning sensation only lasted about 20 minutes, but after five or six tries, I had to give these up.  It&#x27;s too bad, because it&#x27;s a seemingly nice combination of natural ingredients.  But, I haven&#x27;t give up on the brand -- I don&#x27;t think this product is poorly made, it&#x27;s just not the one for me.</li>
            <li> I have very \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin. I don&#x27;t get breakouts; I&#x27;m not too oily or too dry. However, this product made my eyes and face burn when using. I&#x27;ve tried many other towelettes from other brands and they have never hurt my skin, so I know it isn&#x27;t the rubbing motion hurting it, but instead the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most pre-moistened towelettes, and this by far is my my favorite. #1 - no parabens!; #2 - takes the makeup right off my face, including mascara off my eyelashes; #3 - it smells great, no problems for my fragrance-sensitive system; #4 - they leave my face with a fresh, tingling sensation. Regarding the burning that other reviewers have experience, I can understand how it might bother them. I just try to be careful with not rubbing too hard, and then I follow up with a toner to remove any lingering traces.</li>
            <li> People seem to either love or hate these. I really like them as they are the only towelettes that haven&#x27;t broken me out in a rash (seriously, every single brand has). And I find they&#x27;re gentle enough to remove eye makeup. But my friend, who has much tougher skin than I, tried them and thought they stung. I keep seeing my results and my friend&#x27;s in the reviews, so it really is a hit or miss. I suggest buying a small sample pack to see if you like them.</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes a little while ago and I&#x27;ve found them to be the best cleaning clothes ever. I rarely wear makeup so I don&#x27;t know how effective they are for makeup yet. My husband says my face is glowing after using these and I have noticed a great reduction in redness and skin tone. I feel a little burning after using them but nothing I can&#x27;t handle and it&#x27;s no worse than using oxy cleaning pads or similar products.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use a towelette in my nighttime routine but I thought I would change it up.  I love the smell of these and love that they are all natural, which is what drew me to them in the first place.  However, they burn.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup and I felt like I had to rub and rub to get it off.  And watch out for your eyes! I figured since these were for makeup removal they would be save to remove your eye makeup, but no.  My eyes were so red and really burning that I just ended up washing my face with my normal cleanser.  I guess I will just clean my kitchen with the rest of them.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can be prone to redness. These wipes are very moist, and cleanse while also soothe and tone my skin,as it can also be acne prone. They have really helped with that. I did experience a slight burning sensation at first but with continued use my skin has adapted. Other wipes are great for days when my skin can be dry, but using them too much leaves me oily and i break out. These wipes are good for clarifying and toning the skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin so it&#x27;s hard to find skin care products that work well and tis works GREAT! I use e.l.f. cosmetics and the Yes To skin care line (cucumber &amp; carrots) and the two lines compliment each other very well. If you wear more heavy duty make up this may not be the product for you but if you use a light and natural make up line this should work very well - it even removes waterproof mascara. Just use the pads lightly and do not scrub - that might be why some folks are experiencing a burning sensation - just wipe downward gently. If you wear heavier foundations and powder you will do well to pick up th Yes To Carrots make up remover cream... That is VERY gentle :)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything down to sulfur, sulfa, and sulfate. I&#x27;ve been struggling to get rid of my acne since using bare minerals last year, and these finally did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel greasy, and as long as I follow up with a bit of water and some moisturizer I don&#x27;t feel dry or burning. It definitely works for me and has left my face softer in combination with yes to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Removes make-up, oil and dirt very well. Refreshing cucumber smell, doesn&#x27;t burn or irratate skin. No icky resedue. Very convient to throw in a gym/work bag. I use them first think in the morning to remove oil and at night to remove make-up. I definitely recommend this product and will repurchase! 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- BURNING SENSATION&lt;br /&gt;- Dry out your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Not effective in removing make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I choose my product carefully. I used to use the Neutrogena wipes, but I decided to give this new brand a try when I saw the two $7-$8 deal. The Neutrogena wipes is smooth and soft, and it never irritates my skin. When I use this product, it leaves a burning sensation all over on my face for minutes! At first I thought it was probably because it&#x27;s minty, but there&#x27;s no mint in the product. I thought my skin is new to it, so it takes time to get use to it, but it never did after using for a week. It still burns. Even if I gently tap it over my face instead of wipe it, it still hurts. And I feel like it did not do a good job cleaning my make up, because the wipes is still \\&quot;clean-looking\\&quot; after I wiped my face (I put on foundation and concealer, but I didn&#x27;t see the color of foundation on the wipes). Not only it burns my face, but it also drys my skin after using it. I think I&#x27;m going to either switch back to neutrogena ones or using other make up remover.</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes because I had heard good reviews on YouTube. About 30 minutes ago I used one to remove my normal make up that I wear and my face is ON FIRE and is REDDER THAN A TOMATO. I would highly suggest to not even try these wipes...seeing that majority of people in these reviews have said the same thing. Stay away...owwwweee. If I could give this product ZERO stars I definitely would.</li>
            <li> When the weekend comes around and I&#x27;ve had a late night, washing and moisturizing my face is the last thing I want to do. These towelettes make washing my face a piece of cake so there&#x27;s no excuse to go to bed with a dirty face. It&#x27;s part of my weekend minimal routine. The price has spiked since I bought them first (used to be $6.99) so I will be shopping around.</li>
            <li> They burn my eyes like crazy. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with face wipes. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either. I really want to like the Yes To brand but these aren&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;ve used the Yes To Carrots Night cream and that works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase these because the store ran out of my usual wipes. I removed my makeup and went to start getting ready for bed. I noticed my face started feeling hot. Immediately I went to the mirror to discover my face to be bright red and slightly puffy. I freaked! I splashed cold water on my face then grabbed my cleanser and washed. My face still burned and was beet red. I had to use witch hazel to stop the burning. I then took a shower and when I finished my face was back to normal. Wow! I never have had a reaction like that before from using a facial cleanser. That was pretty scary.</li>
            <li> Have have very oily sensitive skin and it Burns my face so bad it turns bright red kinda makes it swell in some areas and my face dosnt feel clean after words definitely not gonna buy these again but they r decent for my chest and shoulders</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these are great. I use them just about every night to take make-up off and they get the job done!</li>
            <li> On my wedding day, I had a mishap with my mascara, and someone gave me a Yes to Cucumbers facial towelette. Within seconds of wiping my face with this, my whole face started itching, burning, and generally felt like it was on fire. I used the same makeup I always use; it was not the makeup/mixture of makeup/ etc-- I know it was the Y2C wipe. I quickly used a Seventh Generation baby wipe to clean everywhere the Y2C wipe had been, and the burning gradually subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these aren&#x27;t hypoallergenic or natural, as they claim. Look up Environmental Working Group&#x27;s info on this company, and remember that the FDA does not have a definition for \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; so companies can slap it on whatever they want.</li>
            <li> I love these! They don&#x27;t sting, leave my skin feeling greasy, or cause acne! They remove my makeup beautifully, and they are CHEAP! These are the only ones I use! Buy these, buy these</li>
            <li> I really liked them but after using them for a while, I started reacting to them. A couple days ago, I used it and got a chemical burn on the side of my face. And, I was ONLY using other Yes To products on my skin (no makeup except mascara) so I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t a chemical reaction to other brands. The burn spot is the size of a nickel, 2 days later still swollen and red.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, the towelettes left a burning sensation so I stopped using them.  Oddly enough though, the facial cleanser didn&#x27;t and I love that.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, or dry (actually it is combination).  Not sure why this burned or if the other product lines are as harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the number of reviewers complaining of stinging, heat, redness, etc.!  I have sensitive skin (at least I thought I did!) and these wipes are so gentle and refreshing to me.  I was buying Blum&#x27;s wipes for sensitive skin on Amazon, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past that stinky patchouli smell, and just my luck, it&#x27;s the sensitive skin variety that contains that awful scent.  Even though the fragrance claims to be a blend, if there&#x27;s one iota of Patchouli in ANYTHING, it overwhelms everything else.  I&#x27;ll take a cucumber scent any day!  I was initially drawn to either of these wipes because they&#x27;re botanical, and don&#x27;t contain parabens.  Maybe the reviewers with sensitive skin will want to try the Blum&#x27;s...if they don&#x27;t mind Patchouli (phew!).</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this company and make up cleansing in general.  I had never thought that I had &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin because, I don&#x27;t ever put things on my face , like foundations, etc.  Oh my goodness, after wiping this on my face, for the first time, it burned my skin.  It was so painful!  My face is now red and, I&#x27;m not sure either.  Any make up guru&#x27;s, do you guys have any recommendations on any facial towelettes for sensitive, non burning, products? Please advise.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I use them every night to clean off make up and dirt. The smell is mild and nice.</li>
            <li> I bought these cloths because they were cheaper than several other brands. I have oily skin and have never had a bad reaction to anything topical. I typically use make-up remover cloths from Ponds, Olay, Garnier -- all without a problem. The Yes to Cucumber cloths did remove my make-up but my skin became red and very irritated afterward. I wash my face within seconds of removing my make-up, so the irritation did not last that long. But it was enough that I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Yes to Cucumbers Facial Towelettes&amp;#34; for almost on year and sounds just right to me. So far, I wouldn&#x27;t change them with others. I love them and actually much more than my regular facial wash. They are gentle on my skin, remove easily all my make up, mascara included, even the water-proof...and my eyes don&#x27;t burn or get irritated! With these ones I can even remove my mascara having my contact lenses on and I won&#x27;t feel any discomfort. What else? Oh Yes, It is a Natual Line and NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS! WONDERFUL! I could ask more. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought these in a pinch because I was out of my burts bees wipes and so were all the stores locally. Boy do I regret it. Just a few days of use and I am horribly broke out. I don&#x27;t care for the strong smell either. Luckily, my local store restocked my regular wipes and I stocked up!</li>
            <li> This product should not be sold. I had an awful reaction to these wipes.  I began itching and any area the wipes came in contact with was itching and red with a rash. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything at all except for these wipes.  Im appalled!  DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
            <li> I bought these towelettes prior to reading the reviews. And once I did, I was anticipating the burn. So I skipped a day of trying them out. Luckily I didn&#x27;t feel the burn. (normal to super dry skin) I have been using them for a couple days and I like them. The stubborn blackheads on my cheeks have been coming to a head and coming out on its own. I just take some tweezers and pull the rest of it out. Amazing. I know its the towelettes because I stopped using my facial washes and toners. I will repurchase since I can only get 2 weeks and a day out of them. And the price is all right with me.</li>
            <li> Not many guys will admit it, but some love shows like Sex in the City, not because they chose to, oh no, its because they connect with their women in their lives. So when it comes to personal care some will dare and try things their women buy, hey there is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with taking care of yourself, being a tough guy and using motor oil as a moisturizer is so uncivilized! These babies are great as a refresher, I have oily skin, and they do a great job opening up the pores while moisturizing and have a nice cool refreshing effect. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, its there when you apply, and gone in minutes . Reason for 4**** is that there are ingredients you don&#x27;t even know how to spell, let alone know what they are. I believe less is more, cucumber already has many benefits when applied to skin (ex. anti- inflammatory properties), it should be purified more and additives dissed! There are other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; from this brand, so if you want to smell like a fruit/veggie salad get their carrot body wash, blueberry creme, and top it off with a tomato conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;Light fragrant&lt;br /&gt;Good oily skin absorption&lt;br /&gt;!Women love salads and you might get more kisses than usual!&lt;br /&gt;Good moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!Distributed only to selected stores, so your best bet is going to supermarket and rubbing real cucumber on your face!&lt;br /&gt;Added unknown ingredients&lt;br /&gt;These towelettes will cling to your ingrown facial hair just like Velcro can(Guys perspective)</li>
            <li> If you compare all of the different boxes, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc, you will find ALL HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!Marketing strategies from your supposed friends at yes.</li>
            <li> Love these for taking off makeup and grime at the end of the day. Pleasant light scent. You&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re in a spa.</li>
