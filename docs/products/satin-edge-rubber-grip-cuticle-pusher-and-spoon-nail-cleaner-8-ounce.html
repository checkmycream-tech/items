            <li>It is perfect for helping you keep your cuticles pushed back and groomed and your nails clean.</li>
            <li>Luckily I really only needed the cuticle pusher, but it didn&#x27;t make me feel very good about the cleanliness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Metal heats up and you are able to smooth and seal the nails.</li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher also has a nail cleaner at the end, Great for scraping off old nail polish too.</li>
            <li>The rubberized grip is perfect since  its harder to grip a pusher when using cuticle oil or lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, not much more to say than that, but I am happy with the product</li>
            <li>Good and very durable</li>
            <li>Sturdy, feels good in your hands, and is very practical.</li>
            <li>Love being able to find exactly what I need at Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not as user friendly as I hoped.</li>

            <li>* Easy to precisely clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>The Satin Edge cuticle pusher was exactly as described, and the tiny spoon is at a perfect angle for self</li>
            <li>However the cuticle pusher works fine.</li>
            <li>I find that ideally, I need some sort of flat piece that&#x27;s pointed at one end - that would really clean out under my nails in one swoop.</li>
            <li>works exactly as in salon, did not even soak the feet, left for 4 min, worked like magic amazing results, loved it</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite nail tool ever!</li>

            <li>The rubber grip lends itself to  a comfortable grip and maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is what I use it for aside from pushing back my cuticles which it wirks great for.</li>

            <li>Professional, solid construction, and functions perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mostly to clean under my nails.</li>
            <li>hand is nice and big, made for a better grip.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really clean them fully because it is too bulky.</li>

            <li>an added benefit, my hands look considerably more refined without the cuticles being overgrown and cracked, so that&#x27;s always a positive in my book.</li>
            <li>I bought it after seeing so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>the pusher end is great to use right before applying color to get it as close to cuticle edge as possible.</li>
            <li>Ok, first thing: Be very gentle when using it!</li>
            <li>Satin Edge is right!</li>
            <li>I use it for gently getting rid of that pesky invisible cuticle before applying my Jamberry wraps and I love the rubber handle.</li>
            <li>Finally, I took a chance, got a quality tool for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good product overall!</li>
            <li>I love the coverage and the sturdiness of the cuticle remover, and the nail cleaner really gets at the gunk.</li>
            <li>It washes well and is superior to wooden sticks or plastic cuticle pushers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use and works 100% better than the ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>In this economy, I can&#x27;t afford to get manicures as much as I&#x27;d like, so I use this Cuticle Pusher, a nail buffer (I recommend the Body Shop Nail Block), cuticle remover (I recommend Creative Nail Cuticle Away), and cuticle moisturizer to finish (I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream).</li>
            <li>I am glad i bought it, very sturdy tool.</li>
            <li>Although this product is a very quality one, well-made, love the rubber grip....</li>
            <li>but I guess it works good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cuticle pusher because it got such good reviews.</li>
            <li>I liked the soft grip</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for pushing back cuticles and the curette helps to remove the pushed back cuticle and clean under the nail.</li>
            <li>pusher part is very smooth and glides over the nail without harming the top of the nail and just pushes the cuticle back.</li>
            <li>It works great and isn&#x27;t too sharp on the edge.</li>
            <li>Excellent for anyone who is serious about nail care.</li>
            <li>works super well and is heavy/quality.</li>
            <li>so I can have a spare and one in my bag for quick nail cleaning.</li>
            <li>I think I paid a grand total of 5 dollars for it, and it was worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>Smooth, effective, and love the black grip!</li>
            <li>highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;used to own one that looks like it, and didn&#x27;t really help push the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Rust resistance would be a nice touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t too much to say about this nail cleaner except that it&#x27;s high quality and is holding up well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very ergonomic ..</li>
            <li>This is a stainless and easy to use instrument.</li>
            <li>All I ever had for a cuticle pusher was a wooden stick, this is so much better!</li>
            <li>The other end works nicely cleaning underneath the nails!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times already and it works like magic getting all the excess dirt out from underneath my nails!</li>
            <li>Oh well, I just washed it really well before using it on my nails and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The pusher part is great and the little scoop part is ah-maaaaze-ing when getting gunk out from under your nails.</li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this great little tool.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool to have handy especially if you do nails for a living.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the tool is stainless steel and resistant to scratching we used a box cutter blade to remove the hard substance and now the tool is perfect.</li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher is amazing, especially if used with a chemical cuticle remover.</li>
            <li>And on the rare occasion that I do a manicure, the cuticle pusher end is great for scraping away excess cuticles and dead skin when using cuticle removing gel.</li>
            <li>get to have, comfortable to use and shipped fast</li>
            <li>Nice piece of nail cleaning item to have in my personal care kit.</li>
            <li>Boy was I pleased and surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li>This item was well worth the price, sturdy</li>
            <li>This is a purchase that has come in handy, especially when I choose to do my nails (in between manicures).</li>
            <li>I used this as soon as I got it, I am not a professional nail artist, but I would consider myself pretty good at painting my nails and giving myself a manicure.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It pushes each cuticle back nice and rounded unlike some that just push part of it at a time.</li>
            <li>Nice solid tool for manicures.</li>
            <li>The handy smaller side with a \\&quot;scoop\\&quot; at the end helps get under the corners of my toes to help me manage any ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li>It is strong enough to easily do the job and it works better if you soak your hands in warm soapy water for a few minutes before doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remover\\&quot; by Sally Hansen, and push back with the broad edge and remove the excess with the spoon edge, wash my hands, add some lotion and my hands look great.</li>
            <li>And the gripper is just right.  </li>
            <li>Use it right after my a.m. shower.</li>
            <li>The spoon size it just right.</li>
            <li>Pushed the gel polish polish right out.</li>
            <li>I use it with Sally Hansen cuticle gel, and it makes a clean, straight cuticle line on each nail.  </li>
            <li>The cuticle pusher really gets the finger nail clean,</li>
            <li>But since then, I have used it for my cuticles and it has really helped keeping my nails clean and neat.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>That this is a professional implement is evident immediately upon opening and becomes more so as you commence using it.</li>
            <li>and this works really well to clean up my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, especially for someone who hasn&#x27;t used a cuticle pusher before.  </li>
            <li>Pushed my cuticles back n removed the cuticle off my nail plate very easy with a cuticle remover.</li>
            <li>/&gt; quickly and in a positive way&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to give myself a manicure so much faster because the pusher is nearly the size of my nail!</li>
            <li>The spoon cleaner is nice, too, but  since I have begun wearing my nails short, I don&#x27;t have as much experience with that end of the device.</li>
            <li>Super fast service too.</li>
            <li>It really digs the crud out from under your nail and it feels nice, oddly enough.</li>
            <li>Having both the pusher and the spoon cleaner-outer in a single tool is nice and efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually really use this tool, it helps clean under the nails where no other tool can reach and also, the cuticle pusher on the other side works great too.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>The grip is super comfortable and it is also great for scraping off the acrylic when removing fake nails.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how I made it this far without this fine tool.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s great for cleaning hard to get areas and wiping off polish/gel from fingers.  </li>
            <li>The grip gives me more control when pushing my cuticles back..</li>
            <li>it is of good quality and it pretty heavy as well.</li>
            <li>I looked at many in the local drug stores, but somehow had the feeling that this one was nicer.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t scrape off tiny pieces of skin so well, it&#x27;s a ok product.</li>
            <li>It makes applying nail polish so much easier and cleaner!</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the prompt service!</li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>They buy all of these items on Amazon as the prices are better than they are in the local beauty shops.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very!</li>
            <li>Use a cuticle softener first.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I have purchased and works better than the first.</li>
            <li>I lost my first one somehow, so I&#x27;ve got another on the way.</li>
            <li>I like the grip, and the pusher works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to get a dedicated tool for this, mostly for use on my toes.  </li>
            <li>They are rougher and tougher to get the nail ready for polish and with this it is a snap!  </li>
            <li>Heavy duty, and good quality.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this tool to anyone who is serious about having great looking nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One end of the cuticle pusher is curved spoon shape and it provides a nice surface to not only gently push back the cuticle but to also help to clean under your nails.</li>
            <li>I must say it was the universally positive reviews of this product that made me order this cuticle pusher.  </li>
            <li>This tool does exactly what it is for and very well.</li>
            <li>I find that these two products really do produce clean, professional results.</li>
            <li>Very heavy and good quality tool.</li>
            <li>The spoon part slips easily under and beside the big toe nails for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>CND Cuticle Away, I can easily remove my cuticles and only need to use my cuticle clippers on occasion now.</li>
            <li>I was using the orange sticks previously, but they didn&#x27;t leave my cuticles looking nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and is sturdy as long as your 13 year old isn&#x27;t using it to dig.</li>
            <li>Smart idea -- that rubber gripper.  </li>
            <li>It really pushes all of the cuticle back and it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to use the other end to clean under the nails, but that hasn&#x27;t worked very well because it&#x27;s too thick to fit under my nails and do a good job.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in a little box by my recliner so it is handy, and I use it often.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty high quality</li>
            <li>Although it seems solidly made and I enjoy the rubber grip, the scraping part is quite large for my finger nails.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s all in one makes it so much easier also.</li>
            <li>it makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>The spoon nail feature is very usefull as well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cuticle pusher and spoon.</li>
            <li>i really like both sides.</li>
            <li>And the cuticle pusher also works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really is.</li>
            <li>the spoon on the end is really going to help me when I&#x27;m digging around ingrown</li>
            <li>Seller was very efficient.</li>
            <li>The tool feels solid and comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li>Thanks item as described</li>
            <li>Very sturdy as well and reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The tip is very well crafted so that it won&#x27;t slip when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>Blade width really speeds cuticle management and comfort.  </li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher ranked very well in their testing.  </li>
            <li>Just be gentle and patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very efficient and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t scrape or damage my nails &amp; is much easier to use because of the rubber grip.  </li>
            <li>never thought I&#x27;d use it so much</li>
            <li>Works really well to get dry/dead skin off of nails/nail areas.</li>
            <li>I seldom get one because my nails don&#x27;t grow very well.</li>
            <li>something that I always ended up doing with others cuticle pushers not matter how gently I did</li>
            <li>I used this on my daughter and myself and it really pushes the cuticle well.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner works very well too.</li>
            <li>VERY  </li>
            <li>THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li>Gentle and multi use.</li>
            <li>The spoon end is smooth and doesn&#x27;t damage the nail when used properly.</li>
            <li>Very well made and I recommend.</li>
            <li>so it covers the whole nail bed.</li>
            <li>I really linke this tool, I do my nails a lot</li>
            <li>A tool that really works for cleaning up nails.  </li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, the scraping part makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I really like this pusher.  </li>
            <li>thanks to this product and others purchased from through Amazon.</li>
            <li>bought this tool for occasional use as a smooth metal cuticle pusher, but it turned out to be indispensable for daily use.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>Some  people may not like that, but really, it seems to be a quality item</li>
            <li>This tool does the job without scratching my nail (unless I add too much pressure, then it does scratch my nail, but that goes without saying).</li>
            <li>The quality of this is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Supposedly stainless steel</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I use this as both a cuticle pushers and to gently scrape away gel polish after an acetone soak.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this one for anyone who wants to take care of their cuticle at home.</li>
            <li>the best thing about it is how its smooth finish means I can use it not only to remove dead cuticle but to push back the living cuticle very effectively without fear of tearing, scraping or cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend soaking your hands or feet first if you are new to it because it makes the cuticle softer and easier to remove</li>
            <li>The rubber grip makes it easy for gripping whether my hand is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The best part of this is the little spoon to get the small debris from under your nails.</li>
            <li>I love the nail scoop on the other end too.  </li>
            <li>Nothing unique about it, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li>I really love this tool to get my cuticles under control both on my hands and my feet (when I can reach them due to edema).  </li>
            <li>This tool is so much better than the other cuticle pushers and nail curette/spoon</li>
            <li>I also love the spoon nail cleaner on the other end.</li>
            <li>However, the other end of the tool, the cleaner, works ok.</li>
            <li>The handle is ribbed and slightly cushioned, so you can get a good grip even with damp hands and the grip is large enough that your hands don&#x27;t cramp.  </li>
            <li>the cuticle pusher is a bit odd, the curvature of it doesn&#x27;t fit my nail properly and hurts a bit when trying to get into the rounded cuticles compared to the more square shape of the tool.</li>
            <li>Holy cow I just love that part.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy, high quality tool.  </li>
            <li>and I hope that is the case, but there was a little pitting in one place on this so clearly not the highest grade steel, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li>I like that this is gentle and effective at getting in areas under the fingernail and toes that are hard to reach.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The metal is also easy to clean, when necessary, and the edges aren&#x27;t too sharp.  </li>
            <li>The ends are soft not hard and is very gentle on your cuticles and under your nail.</li>
            <li>I knew there was something like this out there - sturdy, reliable and can be disinfected too!&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle maintenance has taken on a whole new meaning.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick enough.</li>
            <li>A smaller wooden cuticle pusher works better than this one.</li>
            <li>well made and soft gripping center for non-slip usage.  </li>
            <li>I got this tool mainly because it had the rounded rubber grip and curved cuticle pusher.  </li>
            <li>I bought this tool because I was looking for a decent cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>There were several nail tools similar to this one on Amazon, but I am so glad I ordered this one with the rubber grip.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit cautious about using a metal tool on my nails, because I have had a bunch of not so positive experiences with metal tools at professional nail salons, but I tried this</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The edge is narrow enough to push effectively but smooth enough that it doesn&#x27;t gouge the nail.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool, especially for pushing back the cuticle, and cleaning under the nails  Cushioned grip is a bonus.</li>
            <li>This item is very well made, something like what you would find in a podiatrist office or professional toe nail salon.  </li>
            <li>The orange wood stick was too small and did not get around the cuticle evenly, the plastic one was flimsily and didn&#x27;t really work, and the stone one ended up damaging my cuticles even more.</li>
            <li>In addition to cleaning under finger nails and pushing back cuticules, also useful in scooping creams out of jars.</li>
            <li>I love that this tool does not cut my skin, even though I am heavy handed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap like some of the others, I love the grip on it too.</li>
            <li>Pushes back cuticles and trims out any extra stuff easily.  </li>
            <li>For people who only do it every once in a while, they might not think it is strong enough.</li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher is great for pushing back cuticles painlessly due to its rounded shape versus other square pushers.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this tool now .</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new cuticle pusher and purchased this one based on reviews and price.  </li>
            <li>I found the scooper on the other end to be more useful, but not worth justifying the purchase of the tool.</li>
            <li>Makes nails look like they are professionally done!</li>
            <li>It barely pushes back my cuticles and I end up using my own finger nail and a nail file to push my cuticles down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to handle, made well and has just the right amount of sharpness to scrape away dead skin left on the nailbed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not worth while returning it, but I&#x27;ll use it very rarely.</li>
            <li>When I have my nails long, I find it&#x27;s difficult to get them really clean, and the spoon on this thing is gross but very effective.</li>
            <li>The spoon is kind of pointless, too big to get to dirt</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality tool - the edges are sharp and exact.</li>
            <li>I am not a trained beautician, but I think I have been doing my own nails long enough to know that this tools is just sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually unhappy with the quality of manicure tools, especially ones offered at this price, but this is a very good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool, but in first tries I scratch surface of my nail pretty bad.</li>
            <li>This product is very well made and has a tiny scoop on the nail cleaning end which gets the dirt from under my nails without scribing my nail and is soft on the nail bed.</li>
            <li>Simple product that works really well.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a lot of gunk really stuck against your nail, it will take you a while to get it all out with this, and you won&#x27;t get every last bit.</li>
            <li>As a former manicurist, I&#x27;m very picky about my nail products.  </li>
            <li>It actually works very well.  </li>
            <li>As a former nail biter my cuticles are atrocious but this handy dandy tool is helping me get them into shape :)</li>
            <li>i like this sometimes opposed to rosewood sticks cause of the rounded edge, it&#x27;s more delicate and pushes gentler.</li>
            <li>Works really well at pushing back and removing cuticles.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my deeply curved toe nails without cracking the nails.</li>
            <li>The spoon part is very rounded, so it&#x27;s gentle on your nail without scratching it, but at the same time does the job properly of removing your cuticles.</li>
            <li>It works very well for pushing the cuticles back and scraping the dirt from under my nails, but I do this every day so it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>Not at all like the ones that are used at the salon when I get a professional mani or pedi.</li>
            <li>This works really well and has multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>is completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The small end, great for cleaning under nails and getting last bits of polish from down the sides of nails.</li>
            <li>The little scooper on the other end comes in handy at times</li>
            <li>it nice and sharp to help get off little bits of polish or cuticle and</li>
            <li>Will be added to my pile of other cheap stuff that I don&#x27;t care for but may need in the future.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, well balanced and comfortably held tool for everyday grooming purposes....as essential as that toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find much use for the other tiny cupped end which is supposed to clean under your nails, and it does I guess, just not, I feel, as well as a regular pointed metal nail file.</li>
            <li>The other end is good for pushing back cuticles, but stuff gets stuck in the scooper side because it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been doing using other tools to clean under my nails and to push my cuticle back.</li>
            <li>Super tool that really works, even on hard to mobilize cuticles.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, feels high quality.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a sharp edge, but is strong and durable enough to push back the toughest of cuticles.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I did not inspect it and it had a rough edge on the end</li>
            <li>it was sold as new item and was packaged like new too(though not sealed), but I could see someone&#x27;s fingerprints on it and that was strange</li>
            <li>I am a little clumsy with this step but still get good results using this tool.</li>
            <li>The slight curve fits gently down the nail bed and does a nice job and pushing back softened cuticles.</li>
            <li>I started doing my own nails a few months ago, and I felt that the orange sticks were not really doing the job of pushing my cuticles back far enough for my needs.  </li>
            <li>No sharp edges to scratch or damage my nails.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to without any sharp edges.</li>
            <li>LOVE the little scooper tool on the other end, too.</li>
            <li>I use a small dotting tool to clean under nails.</li>
            <li>and they are soft enough to effortlessly trim away.  </li>
            <li>I would probably spend the extra $$ and try to find a professional cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>It does a professional job of pushing back the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t good quality, came dirty</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; on the slim end is hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>The push back part is not round enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too thick to really clean or get the debris out from under the nail.</li>
            <li>knew this prior to my purchase so wasn&#x27;t sure if hers had broken during transport.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little gizmo, it pushed back my cuticles without damaging my nail bed, and the little scooper side works well to get the gunk out from underneath the nail tip.</li>
            <li>and it is by far better for keeping cuticles in good shape than those awful other tools!</li>
            <li>The small end of this tool is fantastic for this purpose--the metal really scrapes, and the size allows it to reach the small crevices of my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>The end used to push down cuticles works well, but the part used for scooping underneath the nail doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>think about trying to scrape all the sauce off a plate with a rounded spoon), and I can&#x27;t use the long edge because the scoop&#x27;s not pointy and it won&#x27;t go far enough into my nail.</li>
            <li>I would send a little extra next time to get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough for tough toenails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good at removing softened cuticle tissue from the base of the nail after the live cuticle is pushed back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any nail care equipment before, but with climbing and manual labor being rather frequent in my life, coupled with dry winter weather, I needed to figure out what could be done about my cuticles that would creep up my nail bed if I didn&#x27;t use my nails to pull them back in an effort to prevent the cracking and bleeding that often accompany the relentless growth.</li>
            <li>I really like this little gadget</li>
            <li>It saves me so much time because all I do for my manicures is add a little \\&quot;Instant Cuticle</li>
            <li>too dull and not designed to be useful as a gel removal tool</li>
            <li>The pusher is smooth against the nail  at the same time it wages war against run-away, tough cuticles.</li>
            <li>Not too harsh for removing Gel polish and the tiny end is fabulous for getting those little bits of polish or cuticle left on the sides and stuff underneath the nail.</li>

            <li> I would recommend it, for sure.</li>

            <li> It is perfect for helping you keep your cuticles pushed back and groomed and your nails clean.</li>
            <li> Luckily I really only needed the cuticle pusher, but it didn&#x27;t make me feel very good about the cleanliness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Metal heats up and you are able to smooth and seal the nails.</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher also has a nail cleaner at the end, Great for scraping off old nail polish too.</li>
            <li> The rubberized grip is perfect since  its harder to grip a pusher when using cuticle oil or lotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, not much more to say than that, but I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> Good and very durable</li>
            <li> Sturdy, feels good in your hands, and is very practical.</li>
            <li> Love being able to find exactly what I need at Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not as user friendly as I hoped.</li>

            <li> * Easy to precisely clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge cuticle pusher was exactly as described, and the tiny spoon is at a perfect angle for self</li>
            <li> However the cuticle pusher works fine.</li>
            <li> I find that ideally, I need some sort of flat piece that&#x27;s pointed at one end - that would really clean out under my nails in one swoop.</li>
            <li> works exactly as in salon, did not even soak the feet, left for 4 min, worked like magic amazing results, loved it</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite nail tool ever!</li>

            <li> Well-made, sturdy, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great product, the quality is there</li>

            <li> The rubber grip lends itself to  a comfortable grip and maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The small end is great for cleaning under fingernails!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not afraid of breaking it!  </li>
            <li> Pretty safe edges for PVC and plastic models.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, hefty, and most importantly does not scuff my nails.  </li>
            <li> Professional, solid construction, and functions perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to clean under my nails.</li>
            <li> hand is nice and big, made for a better grip.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really clean them fully because it is too bulky.</li>
            <li> and then i have to use something else to clean it</li>

            <li> The cleaner manages to clean without hurting the nail.</li>
            <li> the nail clean  </li>
            <li> I bought this to clean under my nails.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> an added benefit, my hands look considerably more refined without the cuticles being overgrown and cracked, so that&#x27;s always a positive in my book.</li>
            <li> I bought it after seeing so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> the pusher end is great to use right before applying color to get it as close to cuticle edge as possible.</li>
            <li> Ok, first thing: Be very gentle when using it!</li>
            <li> Satin Edge is right!</li>
            <li> I use it for gently getting rid of that pesky invisible cuticle before applying my Jamberry wraps and I love the rubber handle.</li>
            <li> Finally, I took a chance, got a quality tool for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good product overall!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the sturdiness of the cuticle remover, and the nail cleaner really gets at the gunk.</li>
            <li> It washes well and is superior to wooden sticks or plastic cuticle pushers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use and works 100% better than the ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> In this economy, I can&#x27;t afford to get manicures as much as I&#x27;d like, so I use this Cuticle Pusher, a nail buffer (I recommend the Body Shop Nail Block), cuticle remover (I recommend Creative Nail Cuticle Away), and cuticle moisturizer to finish (I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream).</li>
            <li> I am glad i bought it, very sturdy tool.</li>
            <li> Although this product is a very quality one, well-made, love the rubber grip....</li>
            <li> but I guess it works good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cuticle pusher because it got such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I liked the soft grip</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for pushing back cuticles and the curette helps to remove the pushed back cuticle and clean under the nail.</li>
            <li> pusher part is very smooth and glides over the nail without harming the top of the nail and just pushes the cuticle back.</li>
            <li> It works great and isn&#x27;t too sharp on the edge.</li>
            <li> Excellent for anyone who is serious about nail care.</li>
            <li> works super well and is heavy/quality.</li>
            <li> so I can have a spare and one in my bag for quick nail cleaning.</li>
            <li> I think I paid a grand total of 5 dollars for it, and it was worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> Smooth, effective, and love the black grip!</li>
            <li> highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;used to own one that looks like it, and didn&#x27;t really help push the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Rust resistance would be a nice touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t too much to say about this nail cleaner except that it&#x27;s high quality and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very ergonomic ..</li>
            <li> This is a stainless and easy to use instrument.</li>
            <li> All I ever had for a cuticle pusher was a wooden stick, this is so much better!</li>
            <li> The other end works nicely cleaning underneath the nails!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times already and it works like magic getting all the excess dirt out from underneath my nails!</li>
            <li> Oh well, I just washed it really well before using it on my nails and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The pusher part is great and the little scoop part is ah-maaaaze-ing when getting gunk out from under your nails.</li>
            <li> Great little tool.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this great little tool.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool to have handy especially if you do nails for a living.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the tool is stainless steel and resistant to scratching we used a box cutter blade to remove the hard substance and now the tool is perfect.</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is amazing, especially if used with a chemical cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> And on the rare occasion that I do a manicure, the cuticle pusher end is great for scraping away excess cuticles and dead skin when using cuticle removing gel.</li>
            <li> get to have, comfortable to use and shipped fast</li>
            <li> Nice piece of nail cleaning item to have in my personal care kit.</li>
            <li> Boy was I pleased and surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This item was well worth the price, sturdy</li>
            <li> This is a purchase that has come in handy, especially when I choose to do my nails (in between manicures).</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I got it, I am not a professional nail artist, but I would consider myself pretty good at painting my nails and giving myself a manicure.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It pushes each cuticle back nice and rounded unlike some that just push part of it at a time.</li>
            <li> Nice solid tool for manicures.</li>
            <li> The handy smaller side with a \\&quot;scoop\\&quot; at the end helps get under the corners of my toes to help me manage any ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> It is strong enough to easily do the job and it works better if you soak your hands in warm soapy water for a few minutes before doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remover\\&quot; by Sally Hansen, and push back with the broad edge and remove the excess with the spoon edge, wash my hands, add some lotion and my hands look great.</li>
            <li> And the gripper is just right.  </li>
            <li> Use it right after my a.m. shower.</li>
            <li> The spoon size it just right.</li>
            <li> Pushed the gel polish polish right out.</li>
            <li> I use it with Sally Hansen cuticle gel, and it makes a clean, straight cuticle line on each nail.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher really gets the finger nail clean,</li>
            <li> But since then, I have used it for my cuticles and it has really helped keeping my nails clean and neat.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> That this is a professional implement is evident immediately upon opening and becomes more so as you commence using it.</li>
            <li> and this works really well to clean up my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, especially for someone who hasn&#x27;t used a cuticle pusher before.  </li>
            <li> Pushed my cuticles back n removed the cuticle off my nail plate very easy with a cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> /&gt; quickly and in a positive way&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to give myself a manicure so much faster because the pusher is nearly the size of my nail!</li>
            <li> The spoon cleaner is nice, too, but  since I have begun wearing my nails short, I don&#x27;t have as much experience with that end of the device.</li>
            <li> Super fast service too.</li>
            <li> It really digs the crud out from under your nail and it feels nice, oddly enough.</li>
            <li> Having both the pusher and the spoon cleaner-outer in a single tool is nice and efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually really use this tool, it helps clean under the nails where no other tool can reach and also, the cuticle pusher on the other side works great too.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> The grip is super comfortable and it is also great for scraping off the acrylic when removing fake nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I made it this far without this fine tool.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s great for cleaning hard to get areas and wiping off polish/gel from fingers.  </li>
            <li> The grip gives me more control when pushing my cuticles back..</li>
            <li> it is of good quality and it pretty heavy as well.</li>
            <li> I looked at many in the local drug stores, but somehow had the feeling that this one was nicer.</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t scrape off tiny pieces of skin so well, it&#x27;s a ok product.</li>
            <li> It makes applying nail polish so much easier and cleaner!</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt service!</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> They buy all of these items on Amazon as the prices are better than they are in the local beauty shops.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very!</li>
            <li> Use a cuticle softener first.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased and works better than the first.</li>
            <li> I lost my first one somehow, so I&#x27;ve got another on the way.</li>
            <li> I like the grip, and the pusher works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to get a dedicated tool for this, mostly for use on my toes.  </li>
            <li> They are rougher and tougher to get the nail ready for polish and with this it is a snap!  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty, and good quality.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this tool to anyone who is serious about having great looking nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One end of the cuticle pusher is curved spoon shape and it provides a nice surface to not only gently push back the cuticle but to also help to clean under your nails.</li>
            <li> I must say it was the universally positive reviews of this product that made me order this cuticle pusher.  </li>
            <li> This tool does exactly what it is for and very well.</li>
            <li> I find that these two products really do produce clean, professional results.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and good quality tool.</li>
            <li> The spoon part slips easily under and beside the big toe nails for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> CND Cuticle Away, I can easily remove my cuticles and only need to use my cuticle clippers on occasion now.</li>
            <li> I was using the orange sticks previously, but they didn&#x27;t leave my cuticles looking nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it and is sturdy as long as your 13 year old isn&#x27;t using it to dig.</li>
            <li> Smart idea -- that rubber gripper.  </li>
            <li> It really pushes all of the cuticle back and it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use the other end to clean under the nails, but that hasn&#x27;t worked very well because it&#x27;s too thick to fit under my nails and do a good job.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in a little box by my recliner so it is handy, and I use it often.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty high quality</li>
            <li> Although it seems solidly made and I enjoy the rubber grip, the scraping part is quite large for my finger nails.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s all in one makes it so much easier also.</li>
            <li> it makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> The spoon nail feature is very usefull as well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cuticle pusher and spoon.</li>
            <li> i really like both sides.</li>
            <li> And the cuticle pusher also works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really is.</li>
            <li> the spoon on the end is really going to help me when I&#x27;m digging around ingrown</li>
            <li> Seller was very efficient.</li>
            <li> The tool feels solid and comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> Thanks item as described</li>
            <li> Very sturdy as well and reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The tip is very well crafted so that it won&#x27;t slip when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> Blade width really speeds cuticle management and comfort.  </li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher ranked very well in their testing.  </li>
            <li> Just be gentle and patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very efficient and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t scrape or damage my nails &amp; is much easier to use because of the rubber grip.  </li>
            <li> never thought I&#x27;d use it so much</li>
            <li> Works really well to get dry/dead skin off of nails/nail areas.</li>
            <li> I seldom get one because my nails don&#x27;t grow very well.</li>
            <li> something that I always ended up doing with others cuticle pushers not matter how gently I did</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter and myself and it really pushes the cuticle well.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner works very well too.</li>
            <li> VERY  </li>
            <li> THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;</li>
            <li> Gentle and multi use.</li>
            <li> The spoon end is smooth and doesn&#x27;t damage the nail when used properly.</li>
            <li> Very well made and I recommend.</li>
            <li> so it covers the whole nail bed.</li>
            <li> I really linke this tool, I do my nails a lot</li>
            <li> A tool that really works for cleaning up nails.  </li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, the scraping part makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I really like this pusher.  </li>
            <li> thanks to this product and others purchased from through Amazon.</li>
            <li> bought this tool for occasional use as a smooth metal cuticle pusher, but it turned out to be indispensable for daily use.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> Some  people may not like that, but really, it seems to be a quality item</li>
            <li> This tool does the job without scratching my nail (unless I add too much pressure, then it does scratch my nail, but that goes without saying).</li>
            <li> The quality of this is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Supposedly stainless steel</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I use this as both a cuticle pushers and to gently scrape away gel polish after an acetone soak.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this one for anyone who wants to take care of their cuticle at home.</li>
            <li> the best thing about it is how its smooth finish means I can use it not only to remove dead cuticle but to push back the living cuticle very effectively without fear of tearing, scraping or cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend soaking your hands or feet first if you are new to it because it makes the cuticle softer and easier to remove</li>
            <li> The rubber grip makes it easy for gripping whether my hand is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The best part of this is the little spoon to get the small debris from under your nails.</li>
            <li> I love the nail scoop on the other end too.  </li>
            <li> Nothing unique about it, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I really love this tool to get my cuticles under control both on my hands and my feet (when I can reach them due to edema).  </li>
            <li> This tool is so much better than the other cuticle pushers and nail curette/spoon</li>
            <li> I also love the spoon nail cleaner on the other end.</li>
            <li> However, the other end of the tool, the cleaner, works ok.</li>
            <li> The handle is ribbed and slightly cushioned, so you can get a good grip even with damp hands and the grip is large enough that your hands don&#x27;t cramp.  </li>
            <li> the cuticle pusher is a bit odd, the curvature of it doesn&#x27;t fit my nail properly and hurts a bit when trying to get into the rounded cuticles compared to the more square shape of the tool.</li>
            <li> Holy cow I just love that part.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy, high quality tool.  </li>
            <li> and I hope that is the case, but there was a little pitting in one place on this so clearly not the highest grade steel, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like that this is gentle and effective at getting in areas under the fingernail and toes that are hard to reach.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The metal is also easy to clean, when necessary, and the edges aren&#x27;t too sharp.  </li>
            <li> The ends are soft not hard and is very gentle on your cuticles and under your nail.</li>
            <li> I knew there was something like this out there - sturdy, reliable and can be disinfected too!&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle maintenance has taken on a whole new meaning.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick enough.</li>
            <li> A smaller wooden cuticle pusher works better than this one.</li>
            <li> well made and soft gripping center for non-slip usage.  </li>
            <li> I got this tool mainly because it had the rounded rubber grip and curved cuticle pusher.  </li>
            <li> I bought this tool because I was looking for a decent cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> There were several nail tools similar to this one on Amazon, but I am so glad I ordered this one with the rubber grip.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit cautious about using a metal tool on my nails, because I have had a bunch of not so positive experiences with metal tools at professional nail salons, but I tried this</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The edge is narrow enough to push effectively but smooth enough that it doesn&#x27;t gouge the nail.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool, especially for pushing back the cuticle, and cleaning under the nails  Cushioned grip is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This item is very well made, something like what you would find in a podiatrist office or professional toe nail salon.  </li>
            <li> The orange wood stick was too small and did not get around the cuticle evenly, the plastic one was flimsily and didn&#x27;t really work, and the stone one ended up damaging my cuticles even more.</li>
            <li> In addition to cleaning under finger nails and pushing back cuticules, also useful in scooping creams out of jars.</li>
            <li> I love that this tool does not cut my skin, even though I am heavy handed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap like some of the others, I love the grip on it too.</li>
            <li> Pushes back cuticles and trims out any extra stuff easily.  </li>
            <li> For people who only do it every once in a while, they might not think it is strong enough.</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is great for pushing back cuticles painlessly due to its rounded shape versus other square pushers.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this tool now .</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cuticle pusher and purchased this one based on reviews and price.  </li>
            <li> I found the scooper on the other end to be more useful, but not worth justifying the purchase of the tool.</li>
            <li> Makes nails look like they are professionally done!</li>
            <li> It barely pushes back my cuticles and I end up using my own finger nail and a nail file to push my cuticles down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to handle, made well and has just the right amount of sharpness to scrape away dead skin left on the nailbed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth while returning it, but I&#x27;ll use it very rarely.</li>
            <li> When I have my nails long, I find it&#x27;s difficult to get them really clean, and the spoon on this thing is gross but very effective.</li>
            <li> The spoon is kind of pointless, too big to get to dirt</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality tool - the edges are sharp and exact.</li>
            <li> I am not a trained beautician, but I think I have been doing my own nails long enough to know that this tools is just sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually unhappy with the quality of manicure tools, especially ones offered at this price, but this is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool, but in first tries I scratch surface of my nail pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This product is very well made and has a tiny scoop on the nail cleaning end which gets the dirt from under my nails without scribing my nail and is soft on the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Simple product that works really well.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a lot of gunk really stuck against your nail, it will take you a while to get it all out with this, and you won&#x27;t get every last bit.</li>
            <li> As a former manicurist, I&#x27;m very picky about my nail products.  </li>
            <li> It actually works very well.  </li>
            <li> As a former nail biter my cuticles are atrocious but this handy dandy tool is helping me get them into shape :)</li>
            <li> i like this sometimes opposed to rosewood sticks cause of the rounded edge, it&#x27;s more delicate and pushes gentler.</li>
            <li> Works really well at pushing back and removing cuticles.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my deeply curved toe nails without cracking the nails.</li>
            <li> The spoon part is very rounded, so it&#x27;s gentle on your nail without scratching it, but at the same time does the job properly of removing your cuticles.</li>
            <li> It works very well for pushing the cuticles back and scraping the dirt from under my nails, but I do this every day so it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the ones that are used at the salon when I get a professional mani or pedi.</li>
            <li> This works really well and has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> is completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The small end, great for cleaning under nails and getting last bits of polish from down the sides of nails.</li>
            <li> The little scooper on the other end comes in handy at times</li>
            <li> it nice and sharp to help get off little bits of polish or cuticle and</li>
            <li> Will be added to my pile of other cheap stuff that I don&#x27;t care for but may need in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, well balanced and comfortably held tool for everyday grooming purposes....as essential as that toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find much use for the other tiny cupped end which is supposed to clean under your nails, and it does I guess, just not, I feel, as well as a regular pointed metal nail file.</li>
            <li> The other end is good for pushing back cuticles, but stuff gets stuck in the scooper side because it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been doing using other tools to clean under my nails and to push my cuticle back.</li>
            <li> Super tool that really works, even on hard to mobilize cuticles.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, feels high quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a sharp edge, but is strong and durable enough to push back the toughest of cuticles.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I did not inspect it and it had a rough edge on the end</li>
            <li> it was sold as new item and was packaged like new too(though not sealed), but I could see someone&#x27;s fingerprints on it and that was strange</li>
            <li> I am a little clumsy with this step but still get good results using this tool.</li>
            <li> The slight curve fits gently down the nail bed and does a nice job and pushing back softened cuticles.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails a few months ago, and I felt that the orange sticks were not really doing the job of pushing my cuticles back far enough for my needs.  </li>
            <li> No sharp edges to scratch or damage my nails.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to without any sharp edges.</li>
            <li> LOVE the little scooper tool on the other end, too.</li>
            <li> I use a small dotting tool to clean under nails.</li>
            <li> and they are soft enough to effortlessly trim away.  </li>
            <li> I would probably spend the extra $$ and try to find a professional cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> It does a professional job of pushing back the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t good quality, came dirty</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; on the slim end is hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> The push back part is not round enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick to really clean or get the debris out from under the nail.</li>
            <li> knew this prior to my purchase so wasn&#x27;t sure if hers had broken during transport.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little gizmo, it pushed back my cuticles without damaging my nail bed, and the little scooper side works well to get the gunk out from underneath the nail tip.</li>
            <li> and it is by far better for keeping cuticles in good shape than those awful other tools!</li>
            <li> The small end of this tool is fantastic for this purpose--the metal really scrapes, and the size allows it to reach the small crevices of my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> The end used to push down cuticles works well, but the part used for scooping underneath the nail doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> think about trying to scrape all the sauce off a plate with a rounded spoon), and I can&#x27;t use the long edge because the scoop&#x27;s not pointy and it won&#x27;t go far enough into my nail.</li>
            <li> I would send a little extra next time to get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough for tough toenails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good at removing softened cuticle tissue from the base of the nail after the live cuticle is pushed back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any nail care equipment before, but with climbing and manual labor being rather frequent in my life, coupled with dry winter weather, I needed to figure out what could be done about my cuticles that would creep up my nail bed if I didn&#x27;t use my nails to pull them back in an effort to prevent the cracking and bleeding that often accompany the relentless growth.</li>
            <li> I really like this little gadget</li>
            <li> It saves me so much time because all I do for my manicures is add a little \\&quot;Instant Cuticle</li>
            <li> too dull and not designed to be useful as a gel removal tool</li>
            <li> The pusher is smooth against the nail  at the same time it wages war against run-away, tough cuticles.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh for removing Gel polish and the tiny end is fabulous for getting those little bits of polish or cuticle left on the sides and stuff underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> One is the cuticle pusher (gel polish remover), and the other end is small enough to clean under nails.</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so this is borderline too large for my nails.</li>
            <li> Pay attention to that, and this should last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> Quality item that appears will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the flat side but only on dry hands -</li>
            <li> The tool itself is sturdy and I can tell it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great for toes with bad cuticles!</li>
            <li> They are all trying different products and exchanging their ideas about which ones are good, average or bad.  </li>
            <li> My nails are on the smaller side, but they aren&#x27;t abnormally small for an adult female.</li>
            <li> I find the &#x27;spoon&#x27; especially helpful to reach the difficult angle to clean toenails.</li>
            <li> i use the curved side first to push back, then use the little spooned small end to scrape off leftovers.</li>
            <li> I have moderately long nails, and I like to cook a lot...</li>
            <li> Not a professional quality tool</li>
            <li> is not sharp edged, but it is not polished smooth either which means you have to be careful when using it, which I found disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also durable but wipe dry or may rust</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to clean cuticles without a tool, so I needed one.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is so thin that it really digs in and pushes that cuticle back with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> but I appreciate how much less likely it makes me to damage myself with overenthusiastic cleaning than a pointy shape would.</li>
            <li> I was not certain I would use it, but I use it every single week.</li>
            <li> The little spoon end cleans the nail without poking or going to deep into the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I personally find it a little bulky to use.  </li>
            <li> first inspection the tool appeared to have blemishes on the sides of both ends which turned out to be small amounts of a hard substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rubber grip adds a bit of thickness to the barrel  making it easier to hold and keeps the instrument from slipping between my finger and thumb.</li>
            <li> You can use the curved portion on your cuticles but just be careful as you can scratch your nail with the side of the spoon.  </li>
            <li> you do have to be careful to not scratch your nail with this.</li>
            <li> My manicurist used gel polish the last few times I went</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too rough on my nails.</li>
            <li> Well made, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, I only wish the cuticle pusher was a little smaller since I have small nail beds.</li>
            <li> it not very useful for my finger nails</li>
            <li> side is not very useful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for women with both natural, short nails, and women with manicured nails (and bonus points if you can get your man to use it on his dirty nails!)</li>
            <li> this tool is just too sharp.</li>
            <li> the other end</li>
            <li> The cleaner end is to sharp and scratches the underside of the nail</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even care about the other end.</li>
            <li> I also scratch my back with it when I&#x27;m feeling lazy.</li>
            <li> And the rubber grip is a bonus that I hadn&#x27;t seen on other products.</li>
            <li> Initially I was looking for one of those when my usual source stopped carrying them</li>
            <li> I find the pusher to be quite sharp and have cut myself with it a couple of times now which makes me not want to use it.  </li>
            <li> The small tiny scoop will get all the dirt and gunk from underneath your nails.</li>
            <li> I also like the curette on the other end.</li>
            <li> The other end serves as a scoop to get at yuckies  under the nails</li>
            <li> Edges are sharp and almost cut the cuticles.</li>
            <li> but.the nail pusher is too big for my small nails.</li>
            <li> Without it it&#x27;s just like any other cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> the other end of the cuticle spoon</li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher is a lot harder on my cuticles than plastic versions; I think it depends on how sensitive your hands are, but I&#x27;m a delicate flower about it!</li>
            <li> Would absolutely NOT be without it!  </li>
            <li> The other end on this tool</li>
            <li> (Cuticle Pusher) does have a small chip on the left tip, inside corners.</li>
            <li> The pusher just isn&#x27;t made thin enough or \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; enough to do its job.</li>
            <li> If you have short nails like me, it&#x27;s not ideal because the short edge of the scoop will only scrape a small area at a time</li>
            <li> Does its job, but the cuticle pusher edge is a little rough and makes ridges in your nail bed.</li>
            <li> picture)&lt;br /&gt;This makes it a little rough</li>
            <li> I have had fairly expensive manicure sets in the past but nothing has been nearly as useful.  </li>
            <li> Quite thick and doesn&#x27;t get the deeply embedded dirt as well as your average nail file tip can.</li>
            <li> I push the cuticles down then scrape them out.  </li>
            <li> I looked up and down the aisle at every discount store with in a 5 mile radius.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has showed some slight signs of rust, but it&#x27;s probably my fault because I don&#x27;t remember specifically drying it off after I wiped it down.</li>
            <li> The curve on the pusher end is too curved to use on typical nails -</li>
            <li> No chance of breaking this in half.  </li>
            <li> After tooooooooooo many years,I won&#x27;t give my age away, but I finally broke the nasty habit of nail biting.</li>
            <li> I wanted one with a curved point on one end, but was unable to find it; this is doing a decent job as a substitute.</li>
            <li> The other end is a small ball that helps you shape the cuticle and do the finer touch up work.  </li>
            <li> I add a little coconut oil to the cuticle, let it rest a minute then go to work.  </li>
            <li> This feels a little clunky to me and the pusher end could be thinner.  </li>
            <li> Its a neat little tool</li>
            <li> Does scratch nail bed little</li>
            <li> It left deep nasty scratches in the first nail I tried it on.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to push to hard to damage your nail surface.</li>
            <li> I use it to prep my nails before applying my Jamberry wraps and I recommend it to all of my team members and customers who have trouble with wraps lifting around the edges.</li>
            <li> Firm synthetic plastic grip&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have narrow fingers, I guess, compared to &amp;#34;average.&amp;#34; The cuticle scoop is + 3/8&amp;#34; across, which is wider than all of my nails (by the cuticles) save the thumb.</li>
            <li> This is for people with heavy cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Not a cheap product</li>
            <li> This was almost impossible to do with the orange sticks; they didn&#x27;t give a consistent line along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher works well the few times I&#x27;ve used it, even on my small hands.</li>
            <li> Considering I paid less than $2 for this item, it&#x27;s hard to complain.  </li>
            <li> It takes up very little space</li>
            <li> I thought this tool was a bit clumsy to use in that it is rather heavy.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is the small tip end to get underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> Although I straighten the small curved angle at the end of the spoon nail cleaner.</li>
            <li> This tool is just what I needed to help get small deposits out of the corners of my nails.</li>
            <li> And the small cup doesnt work out that well since it gets the yuck stuck</li>
            <li> but I have small nails</li>
            <li> I seriously adore this little tool.</li>
            <li> I think it is too hard of a material to do so.</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I avoided getting a metal cuticle pusher because of all the negative things I&#x27;ve heard it can do to your nails.</li>
            <li> I use cuticle oil / cream on my nail beds at least once a week.</li>
            <li> At $5, this wrong product is not worth my time and money to return....</li>
            <li> I find that it scrapes my actual nail - badly damaging them.</li>
            <li> ; is OK.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the &amp;#34;Spoon Nail Cleaner is not good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical about the shovel-shaped end&#x27;s ability to scrape dead cuticle from my nails (although I use a cuticle removing liquid to soften it).</li>
            <li> However the cuticle pusher is weak.</li>
            <li> It tends to slide over thin cuticles.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and would never buy again.  </li>
            <li> She hated it and said it is not made for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Scraped up my nails so bad, I had to buff the heck out of them to get the little shredded bits of nail off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scoop side gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> As for the cleaning scoop, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely useless!</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to do with an orange stick.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to remove soil from the sides of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes change can be bad.</li>
            <li> so bad ,can not  use in ear,hurt feeling</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It will scrape you nail beds like crazy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate it, don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This mirror has the magnifying disk in a very bad place</li>
            <li> Horrible tool.</li>
            <li> Worst spoon pusher everrrrrr.  </li>
            <li> and I TORE up my nail and scratched it horribly.  </li>
            <li> Awful!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for applying Jamberry Nails. Metal heats up and you are able to smooth and seal the nails. Great nail preper for before apply your Jams.</li>
            <li> Spoon nail cleaner is just fantastic!</li>
            <li> I thought this tool was a bit clumsy to use in that it is rather heavy. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. It does the job!</li>
            <li> I came across this in someone&#x27;s review on Amazon for some related product. EXCELLENT find! Simple product that works really well.</li>
            <li> Works well.  No sharp edges to scratch or damage my nails.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift, she loves itß</li>
            <li> Perfect and well made</li>
            <li> Love this for easy self manicures. The pointy end is awesome at digging out crud from under the nail. I&#x27;ve used the flat side but only on dry hands - I imagine it would work way better after soaking. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great nail too for regular nails. The issue is when removing gel, the nails are softer&lt;br /&gt;and this tool is just too sharp. Switching to orange wood sticks.</li>
            <li> Does its job, but the cuticle pusher edge is a little rough and makes ridges in your nail bed.</li>
            <li> Great quality, quick shipping.  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Have 4 in total-- one on each floor, one in my travel kit and one in my car. Super tool that really works, even on hard to mobilize cuticles. I like the rubber grip too.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for pushing back cuticles and the curette helps to remove the pushed back cuticle and clean under the nail. The fact that it&#x27;s all in one makes it so much easier also. No searching for 2 separate products and the size is compact also. The rubber grip makes it easy for gripping whether my hand is wet or dry. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any nail care equipment before, but with climbing and manual labor being rather frequent in my life, coupled with dry winter weather, I needed to figure out what could be done about my cuticles that would creep up my nail bed if I didn&#x27;t use my nails to pull them back in an effort to prevent the cracking and bleeding that often accompany the relentless growth. This thing works like a charm! My nails and cuticles feel surprisingly healthy and pain-free after using it just once. I&#x27;m regretful I never thought to look into one of these before, but if you are having similar issues, I would recommend getting this to aid your ailing hands.&lt;br /&gt;As an added benefit, my hands look considerably more refined without the cuticles being overgrown and cracked, so that&#x27;s always a positive in my book.</li>
            <li> Works great and it is easy to grip!</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Professional, solid construction, and functions perfectly.  I&#x27;m very glad I found this one.  It looks like it&#x27;ll last for years.</li>
            <li> Scraped up my nails so bad, I had to buff the heck out of them to get the little shredded bits of nail off. Horrible tool.</li>
            <li> For those touch up moments, it is a great tool.  Great price for a great quality product.  Like the rubber grip too.</li>
            <li> nonetheless awesome nail cleaner. highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;used to own one that looks like it, and didn&#x27;t really help push the cuticle. this one works WONDERFULLY.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Easy to hold and use.  The cuticle pusher and the spoon both work well.</li>
            <li> This tool is of nice quality, has a rubber grip, and the spoon does not scrape or damage the nail.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, and good quality. Will not break any time soon. Nice buy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> good product, great value. it makes my life so much easier. Give it a try and you wont want to use anythingelse.</li>
            <li> Bought it hoping it would help with my mani/pedis. I find that it scrapes my actual nail - badly damaging them.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail tool.  Perfect for keeping your cuticles well groomed and keeping nails clean.  Excellent for anyone who is serious about nail care.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t scratch up the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase manicure/pedicure tools for home use versus having my nails done at a salon.  Very pleased with the quality of this cuticle pusher.  Very high quality, hefty, and most importantly does not scuff my nails.  The spoon nail feature is very usefull as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like the cuticle pusher and spoon. It works well and I&#x27;m happy to use it. It&#x27;s a very good product to use</li>
            <li> Does the job. Comfortable grip. Packaged well. Arrived quick enough.</li>
            <li> Well made. Does what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> The quality of this tool is FANTASTIC!! A good weight in your hand, easy to grip and the tool itself does not scrape your nail bed.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for getting rid of invisible cuticle. I use it to prep my nails before applying my Jamberry wraps and I recommend it to all of my team members and customers who have trouble with wraps lifting around the edges. Excellent tool!</li>
            <li> Best cuticle tool out there.  The grip is super comfortable and it is also great for scraping off the acrylic when removing fake nails.</li>
            <li> No too good not bad either, just ok quality for price</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I ordered my Shellac nail products--my Salon had a somewhat similar tool.  I am greatly pleased with the purchase.  Great quality, affordable price and a much needed tool for those of us who  prefer to do our own manicures.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Much easier now to do my own manicures.  The grip gives me more control when pushing my cuticles back.. Leaves my nails nice and clean.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I love this spoon pusher! I use it for gently getting rid of that pesky invisible cuticle before applying my Jamberry wraps and I love the rubber handle. The small end is great for cleaning under fingernails!</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to clean under my nails. I don&#x27;t push back my cuticles so I did not use that side of the tool at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scoop side gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not perfect. If you have short nails like me, it&#x27;s not ideal because the short edge of the scoop will only scrape a small area at a time think about trying to scrape all the sauce off a plate with a rounded spoon), and I can&#x27;t use the long edge because the scoop&#x27;s not pointy and it won&#x27;t go far enough into my nail. If there&#x27;s a lot of gunk really stuck against your nail, it will take you a while to get it all out with this, and you won&#x27;t get every last bit. I find that ideally, I need some sort of flat piece that&#x27;s pointed at one end - that would really clean out under my nails in one swoop.</li>
            <li> The best part of this is the little spoon to get the small debris from under your nails. the cuticle pusher is a bit odd, the curvature of it doesn&#x27;t fit my nail properly and hurts a bit when trying to get into the rounded cuticles compared to the more square shape of the tool. it is of good quality and it pretty heavy as well. if you have a squared cuticle shape then this could be the tool for you.</li>
            <li> This was a great addition to my pedicure kit. As I don&#x27;t have much time to go to spas, I find that pampering myself is facilitated with this great tool. It gets in every area, and does a wonderful job of keeping my toes gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is amazing, especially if used with a chemical cuticle remover. It doesn&#x27;t have a sharp edge, but is strong and durable enough to push back the toughest of cuticles. I never feel like the pusher is going to injure me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spoon nail cleaner is equally well made. It&#x27;s the perfect size to get under nails, under the corner of toenails even. It can even scrape cuticles that are stuck to your nail without causing injury.</li>
            <li> Just as what it says. &amp;#34;Satin Edge&amp;#34; smooth!.  ALWAYS!, push lightly!  ...  the other end however, I notice it does scratch under the nails. I use a small dotting tool to clean under nails.</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is great for pushing back cuticles painlessly due to its rounded shape versus other square pushers. It&#x27;s also good for scooping up glitter to sprinkle on your nails</li>
            <li> Great price, great tool and great handle. Finally, I took a chance, got a quality tool for a good price. I really like this little gadget, it has a great grip to it. I just hope they don&#x27;t try to change it. Sometimes change can be bad.</li>
            <li> love this product. hand is nice and big, made for a better grip. all roung great pusher. i will order another one for back up.</li>
            <li> The other end is good for pushing back cuticles, but stuff gets stuck in the scooper side because it&#x27;s too small. The rubber grip is nice also.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do a great job of pushing the cuticles</li>
            <li> waaaaay better than an orange stick! i really like both sides. i use the curved side first to push back, then use the little spooned small end to scrape off leftovers. works super well and is heavy/quality.</li>
            <li> great product for cleaning your nails and removing that stubborn &amp;#34;hidden cuticle&amp;#34;  I use this every time I do my nails!</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great nail tool.  I purchased this for application of Jamberry Nail wraps.  Works great.</li>
            <li> All I ever had for a cuticle pusher was a wooden stick, this is so much better! It really pushes all of the cuticle back and it easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tool to have for your manicure and pedicures..  Wish I had one years ago.  It cleans your nails better and quicker than anything I have ever used.  And the cuticle pusher also works very well.  I have had fairly expensive manicure sets in the past but nothing has been nearly as useful.  It is a very sturdy tool with a nice cushiony area to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;This was a great find and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If you are working on your own nails, gel or otherwise, this is a superb tool. I looked at many in the local drug stores, but somehow had the feeling that this one was nicer. It really is. The pointed end is great for scooping out or &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; into crevices. The spatulate end is a good cuticle pusher, or scraper when you&#x27;re trying to remove your gel polish. The textured grip material in the middle is excellent; has a good balance. Just feels solid. I would look for this again, and only this, if I should need another.</li>
            <li> Saving money and using this to do my own manicures!  It is well made, easy to use and clean and it is by far better for keeping cuticles in good shape than those awful other tools!</li>
            <li> As a former manicurist, I&#x27;m very picky about my nail products.  That said, I&#x27;m also concerned about cost. This tool is the perfect blend of the two!  The pusher and spoon work just as they should and it feels stury/well made.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> Good and very durable</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tool to help remove gel polish, and I came across this.  There are two sides to this. One is the cuticle pusher (gel polish remover), and the other end is small enough to clean under nails. And it does a heck of a job! I&#x27;ve been recommending this item to all my girlfriends.  It has a good grip, as well.</li>
            <li> i love this pusher and i haven&#x27;t even used it yet! i do lots of pedicures so I&#x27;m always looking for top equipment to use, and this pusher fits the bill. it is very nice on he fingers, sturdy and the spoon on the end is really going to help me when I&#x27;m digging around ingrown toenails!![[ASIN:B00198ZPU2 Satin Edge Rubber Grip Cuticle Pusher &amp; Spoon Nail Cleaner]]</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good tool for every manicure kit</li>
            <li> Great tool.  It actually works very well.  Seller was very efficient.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy tool. The tool feels solid and comfortable to grip. An added bonus is the small tip end to get underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> What sets this item apart is the quality rubber grip that makes the job easier as it won&#x27;t slip. What a good product, will get one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t scrape off tiny pieces of skin so well, it&#x27;s a ok product. A smaller wooden cuticle pusher works better than this one.</li>
            <li> Great to use with Jamberry nails.</li>
            <li> Thanks item as described</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cuticle pusher. It works great and isn&#x27;t too sharp on the edge. The little scooper on the other end comes in handy at times but I honestly don&#x27;t use it too often.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails a few months ago, and I felt that the orange sticks were not really doing the job of pushing my cuticles back far enough for my needs.  I was a bit cautious about using a metal tool on my nails, because I have had a bunch of not so positive experiences with metal tools at professional nail salons, but I tried this and it is amazing.  I use it with Sally Hansen cuticle gel, and it makes a clean, straight cuticle line on each nail.  This was almost impossible to do with the orange sticks; they didn&#x27;t give a consistent line along the cuticle.  This is very difficult to do with an orange stick.  You also don&#x27;t need to use very much pressure to use this tool which is nice.  You don&#x27;t need to crank it on your fingers (like you do with orange sticks)  I love the nail scoop on the other end too.  The scoop helps get the gunk from under your nails out very easily.  I&#x27;m so happy to say goodbye to the orange sticks forever :)</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I avoided getting a metal cuticle pusher because of all the negative things I&#x27;ve heard it can do to your nails. So, I settled on using orange wood sticks, plastic pushers, and stone cuticle pushers. The orange wood stick was too small and did not get around the cuticle evenly, the plastic one was flimsily and didn&#x27;t really work, and the stone one ended up damaging my cuticles even more. So I finally decided to purchase this one - and I do not regret it. The shape is PERFECT for pushing back the cuticle in one to two swipes. It fits my nail bed perfectly and pushes back evenly. The smaller end also worked great for cleaning under the nail. I use this once a week with the Sally Hansen Cuticle Remover (the blue one) and my cuticles and nails are happy!!! I find that these two products really do produce clean, professional results. It makes applying nail polish so much easier and cleaner! For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool.</li>
            <li> This works well, is comfortable to use, well made.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> too dull and not designed to be useful as a gel removal tool</li>
            <li> I must say it was the universally positive reviews of this product that made me order this cuticle pusher.  I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  The pusher side does a perfect job on my cuticles and the curet/spoon part cleans out debris from under my nails and my cuticles.  This is much better than orange sticks.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very ergonomic .. Great quality. It&#x27;s very easy to hold and maneuver for the price.. It&#x27;s really a good buy</li>
            <li> Love this tool! Well made and easy to use. In addition to cleaning under finger nails and pushing back cuticules, also useful in scooping creams out of jars.</li>
            <li> Nice piece of nail cleaning item to have in my personal care kit. This product is very well made and has a tiny scoop on the nail cleaning end which gets the dirt from under my nails without scribing my nail and is soft on the nail bed.</li>
            <li> I love the rubber grip on this tool. It makes it easier to grip when pushing back cuticles. Very sturdy as well and reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Satin Edge Rubber Grip Cuticle Pusher/Spoon to aide when applying my Jamberry nails.  I use it by holding it in front of a heater to warm it up and then smoothing the nail wrap on my nail to ensure adhesion.  It works great for this purpose.  I love the grip prevents the tool from sliding out of my hands when using.</li>
            <li> lost mine needed a replacement perfect</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Firm synthetic plastic grip&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to precisely clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Rust resistance would be a nice touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t too much to say about this nail cleaner except that it&#x27;s high quality and is holding up well. The tip is very well crafted so that it won&#x27;t slip when you&#x27;re using it. I think this combined with the [[ASIN:B000G686U4 Tweezerman His Stainless Nail Clipper Set]] is the perfect set for guys and girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has showed some slight signs of rust, but it&#x27;s probably my fault because I don&#x27;t remember specifically drying it off after I wiped it down. Pay attention to that, and this should last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot and the rubber grip is a big plus for me. It does it&#x27;s job pretty well. I will purchase one for my sister.</li>
            <li> This is a great cuticle pusher. The other end works nicely cleaning underneath the nails! Thanks for the prompt service!</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher also has a nail cleaner at the end, Great for scraping off old nail polish too. Very Pleased...</li>
            <li> Nothing unique about it, but it definitely works. It&#x27;s solid and the rubber handle helps with holding it. Good product overall!</li>
            <li> Like the way it works!</li>
            <li> I like this tool, good for cuticles and the little side is good for taking guck out the corner of your toenails....yummy!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome tool! Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> The curve on the pusher end is too curved to use on typical nails - The cleaner end is to sharp and scratches the underside of the nail</li>
            <li> I actually really use this tool, it helps clean under the nails where no other tool can reach and also, the cuticle pusher on the other side works great too.  Recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! Gets all my cuticles nice n clean and does a great fabulous job! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this cuticle pusher and under nail cleaner. Good quality and nice rubber grip. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Wonderful pusher doesn&#x27;t scrape my nails at all and even when being heavy handed it doesn&#x27;t not damage the skin around my nail bed!</li>
            <li> Great nail cleaner and cuticle pusher.  Works great, but very strong so don&#x27;t overdo it.  Satin Edge had done a great job with this one.  I carry it in my purse everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the sturdiness of the cuticle remover, and the nail cleaner really gets at the gunk. Both ends are great! :-)</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite nail tool ever! I would buy a 100 in fear of ever losing them. The pusher part is great and the little scoop part is ah-maaaaze-ing when getting gunk out from under your nails. Holy cow I just love that part. The rubber handle is also a nice comfy addition. I seriously adore this little tool. You won&#x27;t regret getting it.</li>
            <li> Blade width really speeds cuticle management and comfort.  The grip is a nice feature. I recommend everyone keep one of these around.</li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher side works without damaging your cuticles and the cleaner side is also very effective.  The rubber grip is great.</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. The rubber grip adds a bit of thickness to the barrel  making it easier to hold and keeps the instrument from slipping between my finger and thumb. I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> nice grip and easy to use</li>
            <li> I got this to use the cuticle pusher end to help remove soak off gel nails. It worked better than I thought it would and was very gentle on my nails. I have a different nail cleaner I prefer to this one, but the cuticle pusher side is great!</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool to have handy especially if you do nails for a living. I don&#x27;t anymore, but still loving having it for when i do my own or a friends.</li>
            <li> I like this. It helps me remove the extra polish next-ed to the nail. The cuticle pusher really gets the finger nail clean,</li>
            <li> I have moderately long nails, and I like to cook a lot...hence, the need for a good nail cleaner.  The small end of this tool is fantastic for this purpose--the metal really scrapes, and the size allows it to reach the small crevices of my fingernails.  The tool itself feels weighty and sturdy, and the rubber grip is a definite plus.  The cuticle pusher works well the few times I&#x27;ve used it, even on my small hands.</li>
            <li> Great pusher. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to without any sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Cuticles Pusher is good (almost too sharp).&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Rubber Grip&amp;#34; is OK.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the &amp;#34;Spoon Nail Cleaner is not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth while returning it, but I&#x27;ll use it very rarely.</li>
            <li> Good craftmanship. well made and soft gripping center for non-slip usage.  easy to clean and does what i need it too.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moFGQIR2PGQHM4]]My wife has gotten the entire family involved in using Gelish nail polishes and UV lamps.  They are all trying different products and exchanging their ideas about which ones are good, average or bad.  They buy all of these items on Amazon as the prices are better than they are in the local beauty shops.  This cuticle pusher ranked very well in their testing.  It has a nice rubberized gripping area that is highly textured and I show a close up of it in my video. It is strong enough to easily do the job and it works better if you soak your hands in warm soapy water for a few minutes before doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One end of the cuticle pusher is curved spoon shape and it provides a nice surface to not only gently push back the cuticle but to also help to clean under your nails. The other end is a small ball that helps you shape the cuticle and do the finer touch up work.  You can use the curved portion on your cuticles but just be careful as you can scratch your nail with the side of the spoon.  Just be gentle and patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product as it is made well and the price is very reasonable.  The spoon tool, shaft and cuticle ball are made of all metal.  This is a durable nail tool and it will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I love it and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> Love this! It takes care of my cuticles and I also use it to iron out mistakes and seal on my nail wraps. Great buy</li>
            <li> Seller was fast with delivery, great product</li>
            <li> Great at home manicure tool! As a former nail biter my cuticles are atrocious but this handy dandy tool is helping me get them into shape :)</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is so comfortable and is the best I have used thus far.  It is so thin that it really digs in and pushes that cuticle back with minimal effort.  I am going to purchase another one for pedicures as well.  The scoop on the end can be used as a curette, nail cleaner and also good to remove excess nail polish from the sides to clean up your manicure.</li>
            <li> i like this sometimes opposed to rosewood sticks cause of the rounded edge, it&#x27;s more delicate and pushes gentler. it&#x27;s also durable but wipe dry or may rust</li>
            <li> Rubber grip keeps sliding but otherwise it works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to do my own shallac nails at home and it works great for that. I would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I&#x27;ve used it numerous times. It washes well and is superior to wooden sticks or plastic cuticle pushers. The slight curve fits gently down the nail bed and does a nice job and pushing back softened cuticles. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to remove soil from the sides of my nails.  This is perfect and also quite ergonomic</li>
            <li> I ordered a Satin Edge Grip Cuticle Pusher and Spoon Nail Cleaner.  I received an Ingrown Toenail File and Cleaner.  I was hoping to use the spoon nail cleaner as soon as I received it.  I can&#x27;t use the ingrown toenail file for the same purpose.  Now I have to go to a nail store to buy one.  At $5, this wrong product is not worth my time and money to return....but it is worth a negative review.  I will not order from this company again!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, especially for someone who hasn&#x27;t used a cuticle pusher before.  I wanted my nails to look healthier so decided I needed to invest in a pusher and this works great.</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle pusher. It gets the job done and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Well-made, sturdy, and comfortable.  A must for removing gel manicures.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product, the quality is there and I like how it feels in my hand. Very easy to use and cleaning is a breeze. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nail maintenance tool.  The little spoon end cleans the nail without poking or going to deep into the nail bed.  The cuticle pusher makes removal of the excess skin a breeze.  This is a must buy if you do your own nails.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. For the cost is an excellent value, and does a good job of what it supposed to do with your nails.</li>
            <li> After reading a LOT of reviews I ordered this cuticle pusher. Boy was I pleased and surprised when it arrived. The quality is so much better than hoped for. It&#x27;s sturdy, it&#x27;s high quality (is that an oxymoron?), the rubber grip handle is great. But it is the pusher end that is just superb. Satin Edge is right! We&#x27;ll see how useful the spoon end is but the nail pusher end is so good I don&#x27;t even care about the other end. Don&#x27;t know how I made it this far without this fine tool. With this tool and OPI Avoplex Cuticle Oil, everyone can have perfect cuticles with little fuss or bother.</li>
            <li> Considering I paid less than $2 for this item, it&#x27;s hard to complain.  The cuticle pusher does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the nail cleaner end arrived corroded.  Luckily I really only needed the cuticle pusher, but it didn&#x27;t make me feel very good about the cleanliness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For under $2 I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This does just what it supposed to do.  And the gripper is just right.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought the BambooMN Disposable Bamboo Manicure Sticks/Cuticle Pushers 15cm, for cuticle pushing I think they work even better than this and I like the fact that you get a ton of them.  I found the scooper on the other end to be more useful, but not worth justifying the purchase of the tool.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little tool to clean your nails and to get that gunk out from under your nails. The cuticle pusher works well also.</li>
            <li> I really love this tool to get my cuticles under control both on my hands and my feet (when I can reach them due to edema).  And the price was excellent!  Love being able to find exactly what I need at Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I was not certain I would use it, but I use it every single week. It does not damage nails like some others.</li>
            <li> The product works great.  It&#x27;s much easier to use and works 100% better than the ones I have used.  My cuticles look great.</li>
            <li> I got too cheap to pay to get my nails done, and figured it&#x27;s cheaper to do them myself.  that meant I needed tools.  this pusher and cleaner works well.  I add a little coconut oil to the cuticle, let it rest a minute then go to work.  I push the cuticles down then scrape them out.  I love that this tool does not cut my skin, even though I am heavy handed.  I like the easy grip on it too.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been doing using other tools to clean under my nails and to push my cuticle back. I also scratch my back with it when I&#x27;m feeling lazy. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Handy and convenient to use. Use it right after my a.m. shower.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of manicure tools and this one is perfect for pushing back cuticles on feet as well as hands.  I love the rubber grip that makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I wanted and more!  The cuticle pusher does the job perfectly, but I especially love the spoon nail cleaner--it&#x27;s great for cleaning hard to get areas and wiping off polish/gel from fingers.  So glad I purchased this item for my nail care.</li>
            <li> Love the cuticle pusher, it&#x27;s gentle and does a great job.  The spoon is kind of pointless, too big to get to dirt that&#x27;s been shoved up between the nail bed and nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! This is my favorite tool! It takes off gel nails, pushes back cuticles and cleans under the nail great! It&#x27;s great quality and a great price! I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> Amazing tool.  I&#x27;ve had others but this one is exceptional..  Smart idea -- that rubber gripper.  It has a larger cuticle pusher which is  especially  Great for your toe cuticles.. That was my plan when I purchased this ( for the toe cuticle)--I am VERY Happy with my decision.. Great Product.</li>
            <li> I have narrow fingers, I guess, compared to &amp;#34;average.&amp;#34; The cuticle scoop is + 3/8&amp;#34; across, which is wider than all of my nails (by the cuticles) save the thumb. As for the cleaning scoop, it&#x27;s useless. Quite thick and doesn&#x27;t get the deeply embedded dirt as well as your average nail file tip can.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  This push is great and the curette works great too. And the rubber grip is a bonus that I hadn&#x27;t seen on other products. All of my fellow nail technicians are uber jealous! And the price is much better than at the beauty supply stores. Thank you Amazon, for once again exceeding my expectations!</li>
            <li> Love it!! The spoon size it just right.Some are to big.</li>
            <li> Great tool for nails and cuticles.  Designed well to get the job done.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love keep one in my purse and one in my nail kit</li>
            <li> The spoon nail cleaner hurts to use under my nails and I can&#x27;t really clean them fully because it is too bulky. Love the rubber grip and the cuticle pusher though.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me remove the leftover of my gel manicure. It did a great job of removing the gel without ruining my nail. But since then, I have used it for my cuticles and it has really helped keeping my nails clean and neat.&lt;br /&gt;The pusher part is very smooth and glides over the nail without harming the top of the nail and just pushes the cuticle back. I use cuticle oil / cream on my nail beds at least once a week. This makes it much easier to keep the nail beds healthy and easy to shape.</li>
            <li> Best pusher ever. The edge is narrow enough to push effectively but smooth enough that it doesn&#x27;t gouge the nail.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this tool--great for manicures.  Cleans up cuticles quickly and easily. Would buy this product again if needed.</li>
            <li> There are weeks even months that will go by in-between my manicures. This is one of my must have tools. It does a great job pushing the cuticles so I can trim them and make my nails look so nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very inexpensive nail cleaners/cuticle pushers for years, the kind that tend to be stamped out of cheap metal and have one square end and one pointed. Initially I was looking for one of those when my usual source stopped carrying them and I&#x27;m very glad to have ordered this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about the shovel-shaped end&#x27;s ability to scrape dead cuticle from my nails (although I use a cuticle removing liquid to soften it). I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. It&#x27;s very efficient and the best thing about it is how its smooth finish means I can use it not only to remove dead cuticle but to push back the living cuticle very effectively without fear of tearing, scraping or cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny spoon end had a learning curve for cleaning under my nails but I appreciate how much less likely it makes me to damage myself with overenthusiastic cleaning than a pointy shape would. It&#x27;s also good at removing softened cuticle tissue from the base of the nail after the live cuticle is pushed back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire tool is solid, weighty and well-made. At the price, I&#x27;m going to order a couple more so I can have a spare and one in my bag for quick nail cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nail tool with the bowl tip. It does a very good job of cleaning debris from under nails. It is strong enough for tough toenails.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.  Grip part helps control. Only reason I gave 4 stars is that upon removing led cured polish, it scraped my nail bed a bit. This was probably my fault b/c I should have used an orange stick to do that. When I used it with CND cuticle remover, it didn&#x27;t scrape my nail bed at all.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This tool does exactly what it is for and very well. It is sturdy with an easy grip.  The price is good.</li>
            <li> The satin edge is great, it really does work without scratching the nails, and its very cheap. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Awesome for cleaning under nails. The spoon pusher is very useful to. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Great cuticle pusher.  The satin edges makes it so you don&#x27;t damage your nails and can&#x27;t cut your skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> As described.  Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be effective.</li>
            <li> you do have to be careful to not scratch your nail with this. Just keep it at a low angle.</li>
            <li> Great nail tool.  Cleaning edge it nice and sharp to help get off little bits of polish or cuticle and the pusher end is great to use right before applying color to get it as close to cuticle edge as possible.</li>
            <li> This tool is very easy to grip and performs well. I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Makes nails look like they are professionally done! Works well with gel nails, pain free, easy to clean after removing gels. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this tool now . Great quality and price. A must have for anyone who does their own manicures.</li>
            <li> works good..happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
            <li> In this economy, I can&#x27;t afford to get manicures as much as I&#x27;d like, so I use this Cuticle Pusher, a nail buffer (I recommend the Body Shop Nail Block), cuticle remover (I recommend Creative Nail Cuticle Away), and cuticle moisturizer to finish (I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream). The result: great looking nails and cuticles that don&#x27;t crack and bleed. The rubber grip makes this product stand out. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This tool is so much better than the other cuticle pushers and nail curette/spoon/scoops I&#x27;ve had.  Doesn&#x27;t scrape or damage my nails &amp; is much easier to use because of the rubber grip.  It&#x27;s nicely made and definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Ok, first thing: Be very gentle when using it! Very! It&#x27;s a great tool, but in first tries I scratch surface of my nail pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Works really well at pushing back and removing cuticles. I use it with Sally Hanson liquid cuticle remover</li>
            <li> Purchased item asadd-on turn out to be an excellent item never thought I&#x27;d use it so much</li>
            <li> This feels a little clunky to me and the pusher end could be thinner.  This is for people with heavy cuticles.  It tends to slide over thin cuticles.</li>
            <li> Although it seems solidly made and I enjoy the rubber grip, the scraping part is quite large for my finger nails. My nails are on the smaller side, but they aren&#x27;t abnormally small for an adult female. I just find the largeness ineffective. I do love the spoon side, so I pair this with a doe-foot plastic pusher to get the most benefit.</li>
            <li> I personally find it a little bulky to use.  But it does serve its purpose and was a described.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cuticle pusher and purchased this one based on reviews and price.  I find the pusher to be quite sharp and have cut myself with it a couple of times now which makes me not want to use it.  I would send a little extra next time to get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> Use this when I do my nails, works great!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cuticle pusher I have ever owned.  It has just enough curve to it and works great on fingernails and toenails.  The rubber grip is also a nice feature and makes it comfortable to hold.  Plus the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> My son broke one of these by bending the tip off and I was lost for a week.  I looked up and down the aisle at every discount store with in a 5 mile radius.  Finally remembered to check amazon and there it was.  Its a neat little tool and I use it every day. Scoop side is perfect for keeping nails clean.  It has a nice weight to it and is sturdy as long as your 13 year old isn&#x27;t using it to dig.</li>
            <li> Does scratch nail bed little</li>
            <li> Great tool for manicures!</li>
            <li> Great for pushing back your nails.  Use a cuticle softener first.  Be careful not to push to hard to damage your nail surface.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, feels good in your hands, and is very practical.</li>
            <li> Worst spoon pusher everrrrrr.  First time I used it, I did not inspect it and it had a rough edge on the end and I TORE up my nail and scratched it horribly.  Awful!!!!  Poor quality and would never buy again.  I will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> Good quality, makes my manicures easy. I got it to help me apply Jamberry nail wraps, since the one they offer costs a lot more. It works for that use, as well as pushing back my cuticles with ease. LOVE the little scooper tool on the other end, too. Makes cleaning beneath my nails a breeze!</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy, high quality tool.  The little scoop thing is awesome at getting out all the grime under my nails, and the cuticle pusher is comfortable and fits my nails well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tool when I do pedicures!</li>
            <li> It works fine. Although I straighten the small curved angle at the end of the spoon nail cleaner.</li>
            <li> so bad ,can not  use in ear,hurt feeling</li>
            <li> Works really well to get dry/dead skin off of nails/nail areas. Solid construction, feels high quality.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I do my nails. I don&#x27;t cut my cuticles so this tool helps me push them back. I soften them with cuticle remover and this tool does the rest.</li>
            <li> What a great tool.  I followed the advice of a reviewer and ordered this with my kerasal purchase.  I like that this is gentle and effective at getting in areas under the fingernail and toes that are hard to reach.  The spoon is the perfect size to push cuticles back too.  I would recommend this and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am using this for cleaning the wording etched in headstone memorials at a cemetery.  It works great for that and does not scratch the stone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to save money by doing my own manicures. I seldom get one because my nails don&#x27;t grow very well. My manicurist used gel polish the last few times I went and I decided I would give it a try myself. Having a clean, smooth nail bed is important for gel adhesion. It is so difficult to clean cuticles without a tool, so I needed one. This is the second one I have purchased and works better than the first. I am a little clumsy with this step but still get good results using this tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool! It pushes your cuticles without damaging your nail plate, something that I always ended up doing with others cuticle pushers not matter how gently I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spoon side it not very useful for my finger nails but it&#x27;s awesome for cleaning under your toe nails.</li>
            <li> I knew there was something like this out there - sturdy, reliable and can be disinfected too!&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle maintenance has taken on a whole new meaning.</li>
            <li> It is the most efficient tool I have ever used to clean under my nails and to push push and care for my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I specifically needed a good cuticle pusher for my neglected fingernails.  This item was well worth the price, sturdy and I&#x27;m not afraid of breaking it!  The rubberized grip is perfect since  its harder to grip a pusher when using cuticle oil or lotion.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so this is borderline too large for my nails. It&#x27;s perfect for all but my pinkies, but it&#x27;ll do.  It works, it&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s a good investment if you take time to do your nails. It&#x27;s a cinch to use, and I recommend using it on softened cuticles or soaked nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for at home manicures.  Very happy with the sturdy design and easy to grip handle.</li>
            <li> Very big and sturdy.  No chance of breaking this in half.  works great and love the spoon scoop on the one side</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough.  I used this on my daughter and myself and it really pushes the cuticle well.  I recommend soaking your hands or feet first if you are new to it because it makes the cuticle softer and easier to remove</li>
            <li> Perfect! Doesn&#x27;t damage the nails and is very comfortable to hold. 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> Great design; easy grip, does a great job</li>
            <li> Very heavy and good quality tool. I&#x27;m usually unhappy with the quality of manicure tools, especially ones offered at this price, but this is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Not a cheap product but it&#x27;s too rough on my nails. The push back part is not round enough.</li>
            <li> That this is a professional implement is evident immediately upon opening and becomes more so as you commence using it. The pusher is smooth against the nail  at the same time it wages war against run-away, tough cuticles. My cuticles seem to be made of some super-world material that defies human intervention, so I am quite happy that I bought this along with Burt&#x27;s Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream. I just massage in the cream and push back the cuticles while I am watching teevee, or reading or gabbing on the phone and they are soft enough to effortlessly trim away.  The rubber grip lends itself to  a comfortable grip and maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the item. The spoon cleaner is nice, too, but  since I have begun wearing my nails short, I don&#x27;t have as much experience with that end of the device.</li>
            <li> This has been the ONLY thing i have cleaned my nails with since I got it. The cuticle pusher is WONDERFUL and works better than others that i&#x27;ve had. The cleaner works very well too. Would recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my big toes on my feet.  The cuticle pusher i do not need, i just use the spoon end.  This item is very well made, something like what you would find in a podiatrist office or professional toe nail salon.  The spoon part slips easily under and beside the big toe nails for cleaning.  I am glad i bought it, very sturdy tool.</li>
            <li> Have been using for awhile now and am happy with quality.  I&#x27;m picky about rusting and it has no rust, and the grip is nice too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I ever lived without this! Great tool for removing gel polish and unwanted cuticles. I would recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times already and it works like magic getting all the excess dirt out from underneath my nails!</li>
            <li> Great handy little nail tool. I bought this because I saw it on a utube nail tutorial where the &amp;#34;teacher&amp;#34; used the scoop end to sprinkle acrylic powder over the top of uncured gelled nails. This is what I use it for aside from pushing back my cuticles which it wirks great for. I don&#x27;t find much use for the other tiny cupped end which is supposed to clean under your nails, and it does I guess, just not, I feel, as well as a regular pointed metal nail file.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t good quality, came dirty</li>
            <li> EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY&lt;br /&gt; VERY  THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt; I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON</li>
            <li> Durable, but it hurts.  I like my orange sticks better.</li>
            <li> Perfect grip. Made to last a lifetime. Love it!</li>
            <li> Gentle and multi use.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh for removing Gel polish and the tiny end is fabulous for getting those little bits of polish or cuticle left on the sides and stuff underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> I got this tool mainly because it had the rounded rubber grip and curved cuticle pusher.  I wanted it primarily to remove shellac and gel nail polish. The happy surprise is the spoon nail cleaner.  It works very well on my deeply curved toe nails without cracking the nails.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is the rubber piece moves out of place.</li>
            <li> The small tiny scoop will get all the dirt and gunk from underneath your nails. This tool is super sturdy, the rubber grip provides nice hold. The cuticle pusher is great because it is curved. This is a purchase that has come in handy, especially when I choose to do my nails (in between manicures).</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It&#x27;s not cheap like some of the others, I love the grip on it too.</li>
            <li> It was like having a salon in my own home!!</li>
            <li> Love this tool. I wear polish every day!! and needed a good tool for cuticle care. The rubber grip makes cleaning and cuticle cleanup a snap. It doesn&#x27;t mark my nails so my polish goes on smoooothly. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This tool works terrific for both managing cuticles and cleaning under the nail edge.  Great find!</li>
            <li> Quality tool, didn&#x27;t scratch my nails.</li>
            <li> Just like the professionals use.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! The rubber grip makes it super easy to handle. The spoon part is very rounded, so it&#x27;s gentle on your nail without scratching it, but at the same time does the job properly of removing your cuticles. Another reason I loved it is because the rubber handle makes it super easy to apply Jamberry wraps. I just heat the metal part, the the rubber handle keeps my fingers safe so I don&#x27;t burn the, then I just smooth out the wraps with the heated metal spoon.</li>
            <li> The end used to push down cuticles works well, but the part used for scooping underneath the nail doesn&#x27;t work very well. It&#x27;s too thick to really clean or get the debris out from under the nail.</li>
            <li> Makes doing my at home mani/pedi a breeze!</li>
            <li> Good well made brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great multi-purpose tool.  The handle is ribbed and slightly cushioned, so you can get a good grip even with damp hands and the grip is large enough that your hands don&#x27;t cramp.  Having both the pusher and the spoon cleaner-outer in a single tool is nice and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal is also easy to clean, when necessary, and the edges aren&#x27;t too sharp.  Great little tool.</li>
            <li> This is a god quality cuticle pusher. It has a nice rubber grip and is easy to hold. I also like the curette on the other end. The spoon end is smooth and doesn&#x27;t damage the nail when used properly.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her work. She hated it and said it is not made for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Good tool ad hoc tool for model arts and crafts.  Nice grip.  Pretty safe edges for PVC and plastic models.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, well balanced and comfortably held tool for everyday grooming purposes....as essential as that toothbrush!  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Loveeee it! Pushed my cuticles back n removed the cuticle off my nail plate very easy with a cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Sturdy tool, nice grip.</li>
            <li> This is a stainless and easy to use instrument. It&#x27;s sturdy and smooth and won&#x27;t cut your cuticle.</li>
            <li> This tool is just what I needed to help get small deposits out of the corners of my nails. The cuticle pusher works well also. I would recommend this tool to anyone who is serious about having great looking nails.</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I got it, I am not a professional nail artist, but I would consider myself pretty good at painting my nails and giving myself a manicure. It works very well for pushing the cuticles back and scraping the dirt from under my nails, but I do this every day so it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. For people who only do it every once in a while, they might not think it is strong enough.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! It is a great tool if you love doing your nails. Very well made and I recommend.</li>
            <li> Another great product.  Use this before all my manicures.</li>
            <li> Perfect cuticle pusher.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this cuticle pusher before and I liked it so well , I ordered one for some of my friends . They liked it as much as I do. It  handles well in the hand because it has a soft barrel for a good grip, as well as having two jobs to do. One end has a wider pusher than most so it covers the whole nail bed. The other end serves as a scoop to get at yuckies  under the nails&lt;br /&gt;Doris Titanic</li>
            <li> Anytime anyone uses my cuticle pusher, they want one. It is so nice to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this some months ago and it has since become an integral part of my nail care routine. The cuticle pusher is the perfect shape to keep my cuticles looking like they were cared for by a professional. After applying a bit of CND Cuticle Away, I can easily remove my cuticles and only need to use my cuticle clippers on occasion now. I also love the spoon nail cleaner on the other end. It is the perfect size to scoop under my finger and toe nails to get the little grubbies out! I cannot recommend this product highly enough!</li>
            <li> I really linke this tool, I do my nails a lot and this works really well to clean up my cuticles.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; on the slim end is hard to clean.  I wanted one with a curved point on one end, but was unable to find it; this is doing a decent job as a substitute.</li>
            <li> I would probably spend the extra $$ and try to find a professional cuticle pusher. (Maybe from a beauty supply store.) This one is just ok. Not at all like the ones that are used at the salon when I get a professional mani or pedi. Yes, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Excellent instrument for a home manicure.</li>
            <li> I had purchased something like this from the store, but this instrument came quickly, nicely packaged and does what it is intended to do.  I no longer have to wait to go to the nail salon to keep my cuticles in check.</li>
            <li> This mirror has the magnifying disk in a very bad place so it obscures the view.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t swivel all the way around so thaat it is a pain to move back and forth.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again-</li>
            <li> This tool is awesome! Works perfect! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!! MUST have!!! The spooning on the tip is perfect!</li>
            <li> Useless. Edges are sharp and almost cut the cuticles. Don&#x27;t use it at all. Got a rebate and I put it in the recycler.</li>
            <li> works exactly as in salon, did not even soak the feet, left for 4 min, worked like magic amazing results, loved it</li>
            <li> Although this product is a very quality one, well-made, love the rubber grip.... the cuticle pusher is fine, the spoon portion of the tool provide a comfortable way to clean under the nails.... although now detailed into the corners of the under nails.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not as user friendly as I hoped. I think my manicurist would do better than me.</li>
            <li> This works really well and has multiple uses. I use it as a cuticle pusher, as well as a tool to remove dirt from beneath my nails. It has also been helpful with removing ingrown toenails!</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle pusher and cleaner.  It does a professional job of pushing back the cuticles.  It pushes each cuticle back nice and rounded unlike some that just push part of it at a time. This one will last forever and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cuticle pusher.  I have a lot of cuticle pushers and they hurt no matter what you do to prepare your cuticles.  This one is painless.  My kids even like their cuticles done with this cuticle pusher.  I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I like the rubber grip but.the nail pusher is too big for my small nails. And the small cup doesnt work out that well since it gets the yuck stuck and then i have to use something else to clean it</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for both nails and toenails!!</li>
            <li> Works great on cuticle.</li>
            <li> to me this is a pro tool I like it&lt;br /&gt;gets the gunk from under nails&lt;br /&gt; quickly and in a positive way&lt;br /&gt;has nice smooth cuticle spoon&lt;br /&gt;improves blood flow at nail&lt;br /&gt;bought for wife but I&#x27;m using&lt;br /&gt;often</li>
            <li> I bought this tool because I was looking for a decent cuticle pusher. The spoon end works just fine and I like the rubber grip a lot! However the cuticle pusher is weak. It barely pushes back my cuticles and I end up using my own finger nail and a nail file to push my cuticles down. The pusher just isn&#x27;t made thin enough or \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; enough to do its job.</li>
            <li> Finally! A tool that really works for cleaning up nails.  I find the &#x27;spoon&#x27; especially helpful to reach the difficult angle to clean toenails. Rubber grip makes it easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate it, don&#x27;t like it. The rubber is what sells this product. Without it it&#x27;s just like any other cuticle pusher. Too cheap to return. Will be added to my pile of other cheap stuff that I don&#x27;t care for but may need in the future.</li>
            <li> It got scratched within a week put big scratches in my nails</li>
            <li> I bought this nail cleaner for when I do my nails with shellac. I like to clean the polish around the edges and this one works well. I am not quite sure and the cuticle pusher. I think it is too hard of a material to do so. When I took shellac off my nails with it, I scratched the nail surface as well. Either way I would still make the purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool, it gets in the corners without pain.  Love it.  I will probably get another one for my sweetheart.</li>
            <li> Not a professional quality tool but I guess it works good enough for the price. Recommend spending more money on a nicer one.</li>
            <li> For what I use it for, this product is perfect. I use it once I have soaked my nails to remove shellac nail polish, to scrape the polish off. It does a great job for that. I was hoping to use the other end to clean under the nails, but that hasn&#x27;t worked very well because it&#x27;s too thick to fit under my nails and do a good job. Need something thinner for that. But that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much, the scraping part makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I really like this pusher.  It&#x27;s comfortable to handle, made well and has just the right amount of sharpness to scrape away dead skin left on the nailbed.  Also, the spoon end is perfect!</li>
            <li> Very strong material. I was surprised at the quality. I use this every week to clean my nails and delivers every time.</li>
            <li> After tooooooooooo many years,I won&#x27;t give my age away, but I finally broke the nasty habit of nail biting. Have been having a ball giving myself manicures and experimenting with all the different colors, instead of trying to hide my hands. I know have healthy attractive cuticles thanks to this product and others purchased from through Amazon.And to think my Kindle introduced us!</li>
            <li> I like the rubber grip on this cuticle pusher.  It helps keep it from slipping and pushing my cuticles back too far. Great tool for the price.  I also like that there is s dotting Tool the other end of the cuticle spoon so you are getting two manicure tools for the price of one!</li>
            <li> Nice solid tool for manicures. Has a nice grip. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose at all. I bought it after seeing so many positive reviews but it&#x27;s completely useless! I think I should just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here, but it&#x27;s a great tool. Really sturdy and the rubber grip is awesome. The scooped end is perfect for gently pushing cuticles back or scraping gel polish after soaking. The small end, great for cleaning under nails and getting last bits of polish from down the sides of nails. Really glad I bought, now hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> I lost my first one somehow, so I&#x27;ve got another on the way. This is a tool no one should be without. I&#x27;m not the kind of girl that keeps my nails perfectly manicured at all times. I&#x27;m a nurse, so I keep my nails short, unpainted, and practical for my job. The \\&quot;spoon\\&quot; end is awesome for painlessly cleaning under fingernails (and toenails, for that matter). It&#x27;s better then a brush, easily washed and sanitized, and allows me to keep my nails presentable and sanitary. And on the rare occasion that I do a manicure, the cuticle pusher end is great for scraping away excess cuticles and dead skin when using cuticle removing gel. And of course it painlessly pushes cuticles into a beautiful shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this tool for occasional use as a smooth metal cuticle pusher, but it turned out to be indispensable for daily use. I highly recommend it for women with both natural, short nails, and women with manicured nails (and bonus points if you can get your man to use it on his dirty nails!)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  Very well made.  Handle is very comfortable.  The spoon does not damage my nails and pushed back my cuticles.  The Nail cleaner gets the rest of the skin the pusher did not push with no damage to my nails.  Again, product feels great in your hand and comfortable to use.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle,manicure tool I have ever had. Love this,as it does not slip out of you hands with use.&lt;br /&gt;Should have bought 2 :-) , but will be a great stocking stuffer for daughters and girl friends. Super fast service too. Thank you :-)</li>
            <li> I like the grip, and the pusher works pretty well.  The cleaner end I don&#x27;t care for, a file still works better under the nail.</li>
            <li> get to have, comfortable to use and shipped fast</li>
            <li> Nice and ergonomically comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Is exactly as described. Quality item that appears will last a long time. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> grip helps hold on to tool.  very nice and effective.  My nails are also cleaner because it will take off excess nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle pusher, it some weight to it, which makes it easier to hold.  The ends are soft not hard and is very gentle on your cuticles and under your nail.</li>
            <li> When I have my nails long, I find it&#x27;s difficult to get them really clean, and the spoon on this thing is gross but very effective. The cuticle pusher is a lot harder on my cuticles than plastic versions; I think it depends on how sensitive your hands are, but I&#x27;m a delicate flower about it!</li>
            <li> This works really well.  The cleaner manages to clean without hurting the nail. The cuticle pusher works well too.  I am going to buy several to keep at work, in my purse, and at home.</li>
            <li> Love the rubber gripper!  Great versitile tool for nails! I use it all the time when doing my gel nails.  The handy smaller side with a \\&quot;scoop\\&quot; at the end helps get under the corners of my toes to help me manage any ingrown toenails.  The flatter scrapper end works well at scraping off the gel nails after they&#x27;ve soaked, and for cuticle pushing.  I use the ends for more things, but you get the idea.  Seems well made and sturdy.  Holds up to what I put it through.  They do have a bit of \\&quot;weight\\&quot; to the, as I said they are sturdy.  Some  people may not like that, but really, it seems to be a quality item and I would expect it to have some weight. It actually helps the process along with what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
            <li> Feels great when I use it and it gets my nails super clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool, especially for pushing back the cuticle, and cleaning under the nails  Cushioned grip is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This professional grade cuticle tool is the best I&#x27;ve seen. The spade tip is perfectly shaped to make pushing back cuticle easy while avoiding injury or unintended tearing.  The pick-tip is also perfectly shaped for its uses.  The grip makes minute control possible.  All in all, a perfect tool for the job.</li>
            <li> A must have in your nailpolish drawer.  I use this every time I do my nails.  Pushes back cuticles and trims out any extra stuff easily.  Dont know how I survived without it all these years.  I do my nails at home consistently....and will replace with another if I ever lose this one!!!</li>
            <li> Love that its a duo cuticle pusher/spoon nail cleaner. Has a good weight to it and fits perfectly in your hand.  I would give it 5 stars, I only wish the cuticle pusher was a little smaller since I have small nail beds.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely NOT be without it!  I use this baby for just about EVERYTHING!!  From cleaning out edges of things I can&#x27;t get out .. reaching goofy places I can&#x27;t reach .. all kinds of things it was never meant to be used for .. as well as a cuticle instrument!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now would not be without it!!  Have repurchased it several times so I have one in numerous places around the house for various tasks never meant for a cuticle instrument .. even use it to maneuver vitamins I can&#x27;t reach!  You&#x27;ll find all kinds of uses .. just use your imagination!!</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge cuticle pusher was exactly as described, and the tiny spoon is at a perfect angle for self abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first inspection the tool appeared to have blemishes on the sides of both ends which turned out to be small amounts of a hard substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the tool is stainless steel and resistant to scratching we used a box cutter blade to remove the hard substance and now the tool is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, not much more to say than that, but I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> This is a must have tool for the DIY manicure. It saves me so much time because all I do for my manicures is add a little \\&quot;Instant Cuticle Remover\\&quot; by Sally Hansen, and push back with the broad edge and remove the excess with the spoon edge, wash my hands, add some lotion and my hands look great. I was using the orange sticks previously, but they didn&#x27;t leave my cuticles looking nice. This tool does the job without scratching my nail (unless I add too much pressure, then it does scratch my nail, but that goes without saying). The tool itself is sturdy and I can tell it will last a very long time. I also do my own shellac manicures and this tool is perfect when removing the polish after having soaked it in acetone.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  The quality of this is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to remove gel nail polish after soaking with acetone.  Wish I had bought one sooner!  Great quality.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to get a dedicated tool for this, mostly for use on my toes.  The cuticle pusher end (larger end) is not sharp edged, but it is not polished smooth either which means you have to be careful when using it, which I found disappointing.  I find that using my fingernails to push back the cuticles on my hands and using orange sticks on my toes is easier and safer, but I hope this will improve with use.  The other end on this tool, the spoon nail cleaner, is excellent - it easily and painlessly gets all the debris from under my toe nails, and can even be used to scrape off a layer of the under surface of the nail if necessary (for example, to remove any staining if you have been stomping grapes recently, lol).  Good length and love the cushion grip handle.  Supposedly stainless steel and I hope that is the case, but there was a little pitting in one place on this so clearly not the highest grade steel, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Terrific tool!!!! Easy to hang on to when I do my nails.</li>
            <li> Where has this tool been hiding all my life? It really digs the crud out from under your nail and it feels nice, oddly enough. Sturdy, works as described. Very fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool, very good quality. I heat it up and use it to help seal my Jamberry wraps. Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my gel nail polish and this works great.  It is pretty high quality and I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool because I have seen my sister in law use it in her nail business. The tool&#x27;s rubber handle makes it very comfortable to use. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I loved it, I recommend it, very good but very good. works great, and I like the finish color</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality tool - the edges are sharp and exact. I am very pleased and will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth, effective, and love the black grip!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It is just like what they use in the salon, and is great for pedicures at home.  Great for toes with bad cuticles!</li>
            <li> It works the gripe is convenient, the nail clean  side is not very useful. However the cuticle pusher works fine.</li>
            <li> This was the cheapest cuticle pusher I saw, and it also had the best reviews. I think I paid a grand total of 5 dollars for it, and it was worth every penny and more. Both sides of the tool are non-damaging to nails, and the spoon is freaking awesome, very very effective at cleaning out from under the nails. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a handy tool for your nail maintenance.</li>
            <li> I love this little gizmo, it pushed back my cuticles without damaging my nail bed, and the little scooper side works well to get the gunk out from underneath the nail tip.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for what I wanted it to.  Easy to use and very good price.  I would recommend it, for sure.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this would be a nice item for a giveaway.  I&#x27;m not insulting anybody by giving them this.  Just not a well made, nice feeling or looking item.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It has met all my expectations.  Excellent service.  It takes up very little space</li>
            <li> This is good but I have small nails and it is big for mine. It works with the cuticle eliminator by ProLink; I do like the rubber grip.</li>
            <li> Works great and helps me save money--not more $30 manicures!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s sturdy and well made. Pushed the gel polish polish right out. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it. and this is a very handy tool that I can recommend to all of you.</li>
            <li> Perfect for manis and pedis.  The rubber grip makes this tool comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This product works like it should. I especially like the spoon part which cleans under the nails as it does an excellent job. I would recommend this product as it is of good quality and it works well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use tool.  Has a comfortable grip.  I can&#x27;t believe I never had one of these before.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> I love it, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fingernails, and still occasionally use it on them.  BUT the really great use is on my toenails!  They are rougher and tougher to get the nail ready for polish and with this it is a snap!  I used to pay for pedicures because they were a hassle -- and now I do my own!</li>
            <li> Arrived as described.  Well made, works as expected.</li>
            <li> The best cuticle pusher ever... it is very easy to use. I love it</li>
            <li> I order this when I ordered the nail dryer and the CND shellac nail kit, works perfect glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I do my nails! Great for DIY manicure at home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to give myself a manicure so much faster because the pusher is nearly the size of my nail!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> I use this as both a cuticle pushers and to gently scrape away gel polish after an acetone soak. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this great little tool.</li>
            <li> Does a great job ridding my nail of unwanted cuticles in preparation for applying nail wraps.</li>
            <li> Love this ! Works fab!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cuticle pusher because it got such good reviews. I tried it on and it works fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bugged me was that it got a couple fingerprints and some scratches on the metal part...it was sold as new item and was packaged like new too(though not sealed), but I could see someone&#x27;s fingerprints on it and that was strange I must say... Oh well, I just washed it really well before using it on my nails and it does the job just fine. I do recommend this one for anyone who wants to take care of their cuticle at home.</li>
            <li> This pusher may have been defective? It left deep nasty scratches in the first nail I tried it on. Couldn&#x27;t exchange it even though it&#x27;s defective, won&#x27;t be wasting money one another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean under my nails.&lt;br /&gt; My intentions were to only use the smaller end/ Spoon Nail Cleaner.&lt;br /&gt; I liked the soft grip touch.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger end (Cuticle Pusher) does have a small chip on the left tip, inside corners. ( if held up like picture)&lt;br /&gt;This makes it a little rough &amp; I would not use it against my toenail.&lt;br /&gt;The outer portion of the big end is completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I believe another reviewer already stated that.&lt;br /&gt;I knew this prior to my purchase so wasn&#x27;t sure if hers had broken during transport.&lt;br /&gt;So, its probably came from the manufacture a defective.&lt;br /&gt;Three stars cause although I currently don&#x27;t use the Cuticle pusher I never will cause of the chip.</li>
            <li> This tool claims that it will not damage your nails when pushing back your cuticles. I didn&#x27;t find that to be true. I am not a trained beautician, but I think I have been doing my own nails long enough to know that this tools is just sharp. It will scrape you nail beds like crazy! However, the other end of the tool, the cleaner, works ok.</li>
            <li> There were several nail tools similar to this one on Amazon, but I am so glad I ordered this one with the rubber grip.  It is perfect for helping you keep your cuticles pushed back and groomed and your nails clean. I keep mine in a little box by my recliner so it is handy, and I use it often.  Good product at excellent price.  I highly recommend it.</li>
