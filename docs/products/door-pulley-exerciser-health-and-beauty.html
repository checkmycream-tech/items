            <li>A cheap core door will not hold up if you use the equipment continually.  </li>

            <li>I have already used a shoulder and arm, very close to the one I purchased.</li>
            <li>Had shoulder surgery was very helpful in my therapy.</li>
            <li>and I had to shorten the rope so much that the ends hit me when I use it.  </li>
            <li>They are great for anyone who is recovering from broken shoulder.</li>
            <li>I was very paranoid to use or otherwise use my arm with the two drip lines hanging out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for re-hab for my wife from her recent injury</li>

            <li>The door pulley device is very strudy.</li>

            <li>My other one just sits on the top with a thing like a button that prevents it from pulling through when I shut the door.  </li>
            <li>With the help of my physical and occupational therapists and this piece of equipment, I am regaining full use of my shoulder.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap enough that the benefit far outweighs the cost.</li>

            <li>This was the exact unit that the physical therapy people have (they suggested that we get one for my wife.)</li>

            <li>The double pulley allows you to pull your injured arm straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 79 years old and recently had rotator cuff surgery.  </li>

            <li> This product is much cheaper than a single pulley model sold by the physical therapist.</li>
            <li> Seriously, for twenty dollars, I expected much more.</li>
            <li> I might recommend two modifications to this item - one that would make it capable of accommodating different thickness doors by providing removal rubber gaskets of varying dimensions, the other that would offer a handle inset for retention of extra lengths of cord that are not necessary due to the height at which it is mounted and height of the person.  </li>
            <li> The ends do have plastic aglets to keep it from unraveling which makes it look like a very long shoestring.</li>
            <li> What I needed was a single pulley over the door</li>
            <li> It is precisely as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> The rubber stoppers on the clamp that is put over the door might keep you from putting the clamp on other beams in your basement or other areas of your house.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be used for anything other than pulling your injured arm up to improve its range of motion.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to a sharp melted end that other manufacturers use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was in a bad accident and physical therapist recommended the pulley which worked out very well for me to do some of my exercises at home.</li>
            <li> Mine rubbed slightly and left a faint black mark on the inside door jamb (not visible when closed).</li>
            <li> It does squeak a little.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, juts out over a foot and impractical for travel.</li>
            <li> It is not what I&#x27;d call heavy duty</li>
            <li> It is not a fix-all, but it does give relief if a person will use it at least 50-100 times per day when along with other training</li>
            <li> If someone has joints in their arms or shoulders that are stiff or hurting, then this equipment will give them some relief.</li>
            <li> Ropes are not strong.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not entirely true - at least I&#x27;ve never had a shoestring that thick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Practical. Item as described</li>
            <li> Works great, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I am a home health therapist and got this for my patients who have various diagnosis that require range of motion with no resistance. So far so good</li>
            <li> This is very useful for people who have had a total shoulder replacement.  I have another unit that has one pully that works well but this one with two pully is exceptional.  I want my arm to go straight up not at an angle and this does the trick.  I can also leave this on the door when it is open.  My other one just sits on the top with a thing like a button that prevents it from pulling through when I shut the door.  With this one I don&#x27;t even have to shut the door to use it.  Highly recommended for those with my infirmities.</li>
            <li> My wife needed this for re-hab from her rotor-cuff surgery at home on days she does not go to re-hab. Works as good as the one at Re -Hab Center! She is very happy with it. I use it myself.</li>
            <li> Had a total reverse shoulder replacement &amp; needed to do therapy at home &amp; this is perfect. Fits on/off door very easily. Fast delivery. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product is adequate for the what it cost and for what I need it for. It does squeak a little.</li>
            <li> An over the door pulley was recommended by my physical therapist to increase range of motion for my frozen shoulder syndrome. This product comes closest to the exact one used in physical therapy rehabilitation center.  It is easy and fast to set up and use.  Well worth the money and with free shipping and handling it can&#x27;t be beat.  I priced others that cost more than twice the amount that did not include free shipping and handling.  All I can add is that it works!</li>
            <li> Not bad for a door pulley exerciser.  I purchased for my Mother who does daily physical therapy at home to maintain and increase the strength of her arm muscles.  Product was easy to install.  The product made some noise during the initial use, but it has subsided since and she likes the product and uses it daily. I added a hand weight (3lbs) at one end of the pulley and she uses it one arm at a time.</li>
            <li> Very  easy to assemble . Very easy to use.  Completely  satisfied with this  product. I am always happy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and works great.  It has helped my father-in-law with his physical therapy.  It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was the exact unit that the physical therapy people have (they suggested that we get one for my wife.) I went directly to Amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe that the first thing that showed up was the same as theirs.</li>
            <li> I have already used a shoulder and arm, very close to the one I purchased. If someone has joints in their arms or shoulders that are stiff or hurting, then this equipment will give them some relief. It is not a fix-all, but it does give relief if a person will use it at least 50-100 times per day when along with other training</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who used a similar device during physical therapy for a frozen shoulder. She noticed that the pain was returning after stopping this exercise. Her insurance company decided they didn&#x27;t want to pay a pesky medical claim anymore so she had to discontinue. I bought her this and it seems to work. It was cheap enough that the benefit far outweighs the cost. It fits on any door, and works as it should.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my home rehab! I bought it on the recommendation of my Physical Therapist. It works great!</li>
            <li> Had shoulder surgery was very helpful in my therapy. I use one at the hospital so it helps with my workout at home.</li>
            <li> The pulley is well built but there is no way to increase the tension and I had to shorten the rope so much that the ends hit me when I use it.  I must use it to strengthen my shoulder muscles and I do.  I would just like  to be able to adjust the tension or a weight adjustment.</li>
            <li> I found the exerciser easy to  put together, good quality, and works just the way I need.</li>
            <li> Was in a bad accident and physical therapist recommended the pulley which worked out very well for me to do some of my exercises at home. very pleased.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, I use them every day, very satisfied. They are great for anyone who is recovering from broken shoulder.</li>
            <li> It served its purpose in my rehab on my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and adjust for standing or sitting exercise.  Perfect for recovering from shoulder surgery and increasing flexibility and improving range of motion.  Inexpensive and portable.</li>
            <li> Door Pulley Exerciser,&lt;br /&gt;Great Product very well built, strong and sturdy. Hand grips work the best rope is adjustable to fit your needs for height requirement. Using this item for shoulder rehab all around great product.</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital for 7 months with an PICC line in my arm.  I was very paranoid to use or otherwise use my arm with the two drip lines hanging out.  I consequently developed &amp;#34;frozen shoulder&amp;#34;.  With the help of my physical and occupational therapists and this piece of equipment, I am regaining full use of my shoulder.  I selected this one because of the reviews onAmazon, plus the advice of the therapists that pulley exercisers with TWO pulleys was the better choice.</li>
            <li> Works great as expected</li>
            <li> I have used it successfully after I fell &amp; broke the ball off my shoulder, (humorus bone)&lt;br /&gt;It is made very well and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It was not what I needed.  This design had me too close to the wall.  What I needed was a single pulley over the door so I could sit with my back to the door - not at a 90 degree angle but a 180.  For someone else it might work perfectly.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is just like what I&#x27;ve used at physical therapy. I can save the copay and do the exercises and treatment at home.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for re-hab for my wife from her recent injury</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality, but it gets the job done.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This works perfect for what I needed. Easy to put together.</li>
            <li> This pulley is perfect for my needs. My pt gave me this exercise for shoulder problems. It works very works well.</li>
            <li> it works great for my husband  who has osteo arthritis and is very stiff early in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This equipment was purchased for my wife to free up her frozen shoulder.  It mimics the therapy she was doing at the Physical Therapist&#x27;s office.  You do need a sturdy door to attach it to.  A cheap core door will not hold up if you use the equipment continually.  The rubber stoppers on the clamp that is put over the door might keep you from putting the clamp on other beams in your basement or other areas of your house.  It is a good piece of equipment for the purpose of freeing up your shoulder muscles.</li>
            <li> Ordered this door pulley exerciser because of physical therapist recommendation for my injury. Easy to setup and adjust. Use it daily to exercise my injured shoulder. Meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I find this item to be an excellent home therapy for my rehabing if my shoulder injury. It is convenient , easy to set up and I am glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 79 years old and recently had rotator cuff surgery.  My doctor suggested I order this to help in getting the mobility back in my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Seriously, for twenty dollars, I expected much more. It is heavy, juts out over a foot and impractical for travel. I would not buy it and would have certainly returned it had my husband not assembled it. I bought another type of system that simply uses a strap that goes over the door and it travels well.</li>
            <li> It is precisely as I expected it to be.  A fairly simple system, but accomplishes the intended purpose and is made sufficiently well to meet the need with being flimsy.  I might recommend two modifications to this item - one that would make it capable of accommodating different thickness doors by providing removal rubber gaskets of varying dimensions, the other that would offer a handle inset for retention of extra lengths of cord that are not necessary due to the height at which it is mounted and height of the person.  Otherwise, this is the way to go for price, simplicity, and quality.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, useful for range of motion exercises coming off rotator cuff surgery. you physical therapist should encourage you to get one.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist used it during my therapy so I bought it to continue benefitting from its use.  Easy to put up.  Right weight.  Does what its supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy W</li>
            <li> Works great and has really helped my shoulder loosen up.  Easy to install and use and fits over any door in my house.</li>
            <li> I had a double mastectomy and had complications with one side. I have had Physical Therapy which did not help. A friend of mine told me about this product and I ordered it. I can already tell a hugh difference in my arm. The door pulley device is very strudy. I really am pleased with the results. I am a nurse and could not return to work in the nursing profession with restrictions. Thank you for this product. It is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set up and use. Best thing is you can toss it in a suitcase and take it with you. I&#x27;ll take mine when I leave for Florida this week.</li>
            <li> This pulley was easy to install.  On days without physical therapy, my husband&lt;br /&gt;uses this pulley to strengthen and stretch his arm.  He enjoys the pulley and&lt;br /&gt;it is necessary after shoulder surgery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it at all.  It is not as smooth as it should be.  Ropes are not strong.  Should have sent back.</li>
            <li> My left arm was shattered needing steel plate and seventeen screws to repair the damage.&lt;br /&gt;After surgical wound healed (38 staples) I needed Physical Therapy.  The pulley system was&lt;br /&gt;good for home exercise apart from the PT facility.  I recommend this for additional PT at home&lt;br /&gt;it is excellent.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper than a single pulley model sold by the physical therapist. It is not what I&#x27;d call heavy duty but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be used for anything other than pulling your injured arm up to improve its range of motion. For this task it is sufficiently designed. A heavier design would just make it more expensive without improving the utility. The double pulley allows you to pull your injured arm straight up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer claimed that the rope is a shoestring. That&#x27;s not entirely true - at least I&#x27;ve never had a shoestring that thick. The ends do have plastic aglets to keep it from unraveling which makes it look like a very long shoestring. I prefer this to a sharp melted end that other manufacturers use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning to leave the system installed, the door mounting bracket thickness may prevent you from closing the door all of the way. Mine rubbed slightly and left a faint black mark on the inside door jamb (not visible when closed). I covered the top with some electrical tape so that it didn&#x27;t get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine this could be a better device for the price including shipping.</li>
