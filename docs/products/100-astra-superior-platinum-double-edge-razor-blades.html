            <li>Good blade for me anyway.</li>
            <li>Price wise at 10 cents a blade</li>
            <li>My 2 sons and I all agree that Astra blades are superior to&lt;br</li>
            <li>I somehow feel that these are not as good as the originals.</li>
            <li>These are good blades.</li>
            <li>I purchased a sample pack of blades about a year ago and among the razors in the batch were Astra and these Astra Superior Premium Platinum.</li>
            <li>(it came with two of each) and it didn&#x27;t seem quite as good.</li>
            <li>Really good deal.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good blades for price</li>
            <li>Its a good blade</li>
            <li>Out of many that I&#x27;ve tried there are really a good deal!</li>
            <li>The best blade to use if you shave your head and still have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with these.</li>
            <li>Very glad to have them.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>BEst blade for me so far and great value</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, excellent product</li>
            <li>Recommend you get a multipack first to decide which ones work for you best.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, no scraping, face feels great.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving great value</li>
            <li>Gillette/proctor and gamble own them.</li>
            <li>but I received a sample pack of the Astras and worked really nice on my face.</li>
            <li>These are actually as good or better than the Feather brand that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>Nice shaving experience</li>
            <li>These cut very nice and smooth, no pull.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, very smooth shave with no irration!!!!</li>
            <li>they work great just as good as those Gillette hydro blades and much much cheaper</li>
            <li>For me, the kind of shave results I get mostly depends on the razor I use &amp; my shaving technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far every blade brand produced at that plant is superb.</li>
            <li>Best i have had so far</li>
            <li>Bought a assortment pack and these were the best by far for me</li>
            <li>As always YMMV, but for this ginger with sensitive skin, this is the best blade out there.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best blades I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>These are the best blades i&#x27;ve used so far, much better than the Vanderhagens I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li>I find with these blades I need to do more touch up work to get a nice 2 pass WTG+XTG shave, and that means more irritation and more risk for nicks.</li>
            <li>Very smooth vs everything else  </li>
            <li>They cut very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I get a very comfortable shave with these blades.</li>
            <li>I bought the sampler and found that this brand and the feather one are both very smooth.</li>
            <li>Astras give me 6 shaves per blade and could probably get more but quit at 6.</li>
            <li>these might be even better if you can get away with using them on your face.</li>
            <li>have not tried many brands but out of these, derby and wilkinson sword, these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the sample blades that came with my Pawn Stars favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect blade for me.</li>
            <li>did I mention CHEAP!</li>
            <li>Much better value than Derbys.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>May not give as many shaves as a heavier gauge blade, but the cost per blade makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I use feather for 3 or more day growth.&lt;br /&gt;nice.</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>My favorite blade.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on buying more.  </li>
            <li>I only use these now excellent for me.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Glad I gave them a shot.</li>
            <li>The reason I rated them as a five is I gave them to my sons and they both love them and have purchased them again</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use more than once.</li>
            <li>Way better than the five blades that came with my Van der Hagen razor handle.</li>
            <li>I used to pay about the 10 bucks or more for a 5 pack of cartridge blades, what a joke.</li>
            <li>so much better than using tweezers and nair</li>
            <li>I got one of those packs with many types of razors.</li>
            <li>They are so much better than the gillettes I used 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>Better than Personna, derby, shark,</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of blades</li>
            <li>I had to make many passes and still did not get a close shave.</li>
            <li>My favorite blades.</li>
            <li>But the RazoRock handle changes the angle just enough that for me it becomes the perfect combination.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and like them.</li>
            <li>6: finish up with Witch hazel wash and Trumpeter lime skin food and your favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>and I get about three more shaves after that.</li>
            <li>I am able to shave with these razors without tearing up my face.</li>
            <li>The Astra was one of my top three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>need to buy more, because I keep giving five-packs to friends because they don&#x27;t believe me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested the Astra and found that it did as well or better than any blade I have used.  </li>
            <li>But I find that a good stainless steel platinum coated blade will provide really nice shaves for about three weeks and then thereafter provide what I would characterize as acceptable shaves for the remainder of the two months.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>These blades are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Works great with my new Merkur.</li>
            <li>but this Astra is the most comfortable shave of all.  </li>
            <li>Smooth Smooth shaving!</li>
            <li>The Astra&#x27;s are smooth and love the price.</li>
            <li>The first use was very smooth!</li>
            <li>Also, I appreciate that these fit the DE safety razor much better than the Shark blades I had before.</li>
            <li>They were reasonably priced with good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is the blade that I&#x27;m most familiar with</li>
            <li>I have tried other blades but these are the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I can easily get three to four shaves out a a blade before I have to change it.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, but not the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>And easy to get at Walmart. 5</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades that don&#x27;t cut you up and a great value!  </li>
            <li>I use the razors twice before changing them and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>glides on my face easily and feels smooth and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 2-3 of these so far, and they&#x27;ve been pretty good, but I remember having some really excellent shaves with some of the multi-brand packs, and I don&#x27;t remember having that with these.</li>
            <li>wanted the best blades and this lives up to ALL the positive reviews I read on these... Will DEFINITELY buy again</li>
            <li>Cheap at under $10 free ship for 100 blades.</li>
            <li>Cheap at under $10 free ship for 100 blades.</li>
            <li>Baby Butt Smooth shave( 1 face 2 neck).</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since the 7th grade...</li>
            <li>(FYI, I get 3 fantastic shaves per blade).  </li>
            <li>So cheap and yet.</li>
            <li>They wont make me a millionaire by saving money compared to cheap razors either.</li>
            <li>Bought a multipack of razors to try out different ones and these stood out as great for my face.  </li>
            <li>Not the sharpest blades on the market, but provide a smooth, comfortable shave without skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I have used the blades both in a safety razor and in a shavette style razor and they always deliver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have a medium beard, and one blade with give me 5 or 6 comfortable shaves that leave my face smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>I liked this blades so much that I ordered 2 packs of 100.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used with Art of Shaving Pre-Shave oil and AOS Cream for a close smooth shave,</li>
            <li>Overall a great price for the quality of razor.</li>
            <li>razor and MARVEL at how effectively these can release so much blood.</li>
            <li>Dirt cheap compared to multi-blade options</li>
            <li>that came with my cheap &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; razor and those worked well.</li>
            <li>shaves before swapping (best shave of my life every morning), but they have lasted me 7 shaves, a few times, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great balance of Sharpness and smoothness in a double edged blade.</li>
            <li>you get the smooth shave you are looking for.</li>
            <li>Surprised that they&#x27;re so GOOD and CHEAP.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This 100 pack easily lasts two years, like them so much I&#x27;ve bought 3 others for gifts,, highly recommend, they shipped in perfect condition and fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel these would easily cut you up - except with the Pearl Razor I purchased - but also don&#x27;t expect a super close shave.</li>
            <li>I put one in my Feather AS-D2 instead of the usual Feather blade, and had a wonderful close, irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a de razor is a journey, one that I have enjoyed very much.</li>
            <li>I do use them in a Feather razor however, and in the other two that I have, seem to do the job with any good razor!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s 4 years worth of shaving for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li>Thats the fun part!</li>
            <li>Apparently different hair / skin combinations work better with different blades, an excellent value for 100 blades.</li>
            <li>The benefit was that my skin felt super smooth after each shave.</li>
            <li>I have found these Astra blades to be the best in my old Gillettes and  newer Parker open comb razors.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different and will have to find their own magic combination.</li>
            <li>Clean shave, no irritation, no bleeding,</li>
            <li>Best blades available, combined with any Weishi razor (they&#x27;re all functionally the same, just different handle lengths and colors) makes a FANTASTIC low-stress, low-expense DE razor setup.  </li>
            <li>and this blade is super friendly to me</li>
            <li>Feathers 2 shaves so this is much more of an economic no brainer.</li>
            <li>OVERALL: a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good blade for a newbie &amp; good enough to be the only blade you need to buy.</li>
            <li>But If 10 cents is too much for anyone&#x27;s budget, I think you shouldn&#x27;t be worried about the cost of this blade, because being homeless maybe a more immediate concern.</li>
            <li>many shaves is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Shave wise - again essentially equal.  </li>
            <li>and I got a super clean shave, no irritation.</li>
            <li>NOT BAD</li>
            <li>Excellent value blades; very sharp and much cheaper than Feather or Personna Med Prep blades.</li>
            <li>I tried many other brands including Featherweight, and these give me the best shave and last the longest.  </li>
            <li>Super blades.</li>
            <li>I used the Merkur Super blades (from AOS)</li>
            <li>Both were good but the Superior Premium Platinum performed much better with less drag on my face.</li>
            <li>so far I shave daily and have about 4 days on these blades close comfortable shave for a great price</li>
            <li>Very consistent in quality unlike the personna or derby blades.</li>
            <li>Dont last more than one shave for me, but still economical!!  </li>
            <li>and used this blade in a Weishi Long Handle 9306CL Gunmetal Finish razor, also my cheapest and most favorite of 6 razors.</li>
            <li>My only regret is not buying more than one pack!</li>
            <li>At a little over 10 cents a blade this is a great shaving deal.  </li>
            <li>While some folks discussed various razors as if they were debating fine wines, I wasn&#x27;t experienced enough to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Each of the 5-paks has a handy flip top &amp; old blades can be inserted back into the box for disposal when done.</li>
            <li>Rarely a nick,...</li>
            <li>I found my second favorite and the best part is that they only cost a fraction of the former from Japan!</li>
            <li>Astra Premium Platinums are now my favorite all-around razor, and when you add in the fact that they are good for a week of everyday shaving, you get two years worth of blades for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I have tried and liked the following blade in order of preference:</li>
            <li>Almost as good as feather, but far far cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>These are by far his favorite blades.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted three full weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to buy a sample pack to try a bunch of different manufacturers</li>
            <li>Love these blades very smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wetshaving with a DE razor for about 8 years now, and have tried a bunch of different blades during that time period, including some that are now discontinued and sell for many times their original price.</li>
            <li>Although I have not been able to compare the so called original Astra blades with these I am inclined to accept the fact that only the wrapper has changed and that the blade has not.</li>
            <li>Good buy, quality and sharp.</li>
            <li>Are these Astra blades as good as the Sharp Edges?</li>
            <li>Whenever I thought that one of them was really good, then I used the other one</li>
            <li>and it glides right through with no dragging or snagging.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Probably could get even more, but, I do feel the blade pulling more then and, for what it costs, not worth saving pennies.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave in 2 passes, sharp enough for 2-3 shaves, and a great value at $10 per 100.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Great razors,work as advertised, ill will get more when i need them.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and far better blades than the CVS ones I had been using.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>IMO you cant do any better than this blade or its brother the Astra Stainless as they are very sharp but much more forgiving than the Feather.</li>
            <li>Good blade for the price, not harsh on the skin for an Afro-American, as long as you shave in the right direction.</li>
            <li>For me, this blade offers a tremendous shave, especially when paired with a nice razor, shaving creme and badger brush.  </li>
            <li>They blow my old disposable razors out of the water, and I have yet to get a single nick or &amp;#34;weeper.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used them in a Feather Popular razor, and a 1958 Gillette Superspeed, both with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Thought the Feather blades I bought awhile back were good, the Astra&#x27;s are just a little bit better.</li>
            <li>blades are very subjective so take this review for what its worth..</li>
            <li>First box of blades I have bought.  </li>
            <li>For my skill level these blades are the Great/best, First blades, I&#x27;ve tried just learning to shave again with a Safety Razor........3 months skill level...</li>
            <li>The first hundred cost about 18 cents per blade.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly priced right.</li>
            <li>exactly what my son wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried maybe 10 or 15 different brands of DE blades and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I just switched to shaving with a safety razor, and these are the first blades I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic inexpensive blades that give a good shave in most razors without cutting up your face.</li>
            <li>I can shave more than a week with one blade, and I shave my entire head - not just my face!</li>
            <li>No need to shower first, just fill up the sink and get started.  </li>
            <li>The Astra blade did exactly that.  </li>
            <li>Both are very sharp but for some reason the Astra&#x27;s seem to be more comfortable,</li>
            <li>Great blades and an unbelievable value!</li>
            <li>These blades give a remarkably close shave and stay sharp far longer than the blades you get at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Derby Extra blades I originally tried, these are consistently sharp and much sharper overall giving me the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>Nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and any other razor.</li>
            <li>These are really sharp and do a nice job.</li>
            <li>I have every sensitive skin on my neck, I have tried almost every kind if disposable razor to 30 plus blades for my double razor.</li>
            <li>I get a good close shave, with no cuts, and very little razor burn.  </li>
            <li>so went with the 100 pack, super cheap, super sharp!</li>
            <li>no mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>great price  but not as sharp as others with similar pricing.</li>
            <li>First three shaves really close</li>
            <li>Great blades: very forgiving and stay  sharp through several shaves.</li>
            <li>Great for the average or short bearded men.</li>
            <li>Double edge razor blades are not all created equal; they have differing degrees of sharpness (sharper is not always better), flexibility, etc; After trying out different blades these work great for my skin; As far as the packaging, you get 20 packages of 5 blades each in a long box; the blades come individually wrapped in wax paper; a used blade bank would be nice</li>
            <li>Not all blades can endure that long (though I find that most stainless steel platinum coated blades can) ...</li>
            <li>in any case the Astra certainly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I decided to try these Astra blades out of strong curiosity, and so far I&#x27;ve had 5 shaves so far with them.</li>
            <li>Not too aggressive of a blade, nice close shave, stays sharp and comfortable for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Who knew that there were such huge differences between blade types.</li>
            <li>May Very from mine.</li>
            <li>I know the next year will be enjoyable, trouble free shaving with these blades!</li>
            <li>Astra blades are absolutely the smoothest shaving blades on the market.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave that lasts longer and has a cheaper replacement value than store bought razors plastic throwaways.</li>
            <li>I know blades are very subjective and differ from one person to another</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, but not the cheapest.</li>
            <li>I bought them for an ATT stainless.</li>
            <li>Eventually I&#x27;ll try the Feather blades that came with my razor, but I don&#x27;t really see at reason to try anything else.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than using mach 3 razors like I was doing before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes these.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much to compare to.</li>
            <li>These razors have worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>just wish i would have gotten the real thing as pictured</li>
            <li>My beard is very bristly</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and is like the blades for the cost</li>
            <li>The Astra was noticeably sharper and provided a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>and these blades give me a very close shave with no discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li>They worked great especially on my trouble spots like my neck.</li>
            <li>Blades are quality, and give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The R41 is a very aggressive razor.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re done FAST.  </li>
            <li>just started wet shaving have not found anything better, except mecur.</li>
            <li>Plus really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I tried 25 other blades but these astra&#x27;s are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about like most other folks.</li>
            <li>and I get a closer shave than most other blades.  </li>
            <li>Good price, sharp but not crazy sharp, and close to zero razor rash.  </li>
            <li>But a single blade can&#x27;t deliver the close, easy shaves of 3 blades in every swipe from my Mach3.</li>
            <li>But a single blade can&#x27;t deliver the close, easy shaves of 3 blades in every swipe from my Mach3.</li>
            <li>Recently came back to using a double edge saftey razor after many years of using everything else available.</li>
            <li>Most of the advice for new wet shavers was to buy a blade variety pack to see what you like and what works for you.</li>
            <li>My favorite over Feathers or any other high rated blade</li>
            <li>If you have a coarse beard like I do, these might take a little more finesse to do a good job over other brands.</li>
            <li>Overall not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>I am a barber and I&#x27;ve tried so many blades this brand are one of the best one they are sharp and not so thin like other ones.</li>
            <li>use them in my straight bar,slant bar and my adjustable razors new and vintage and performance is even across the board.</li>
            <li>Way better than the previous blades i had (Teflon coated blades from van der hagen) &amp; cheaper too.</li>
            <li>As an aside, the price for 100 of the Astras is $4 less than the price for 10 Merkur blades - that alone made the purchase worthwhile for me.</li>
            <li>Not the sharpest out there, but a decent medium sharpness</li>
            <li>I switched to Wilkinson Sword Classic</li>
            <li>Decent blades.</li>
            <li>The second use I definitely felt more razor burn trying to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>But used with the soap and applied after each pass with the final pass being mostly the oil, water, and left over watery soap.</li>
            <li>These seem to perform about as well as the more expensive Wilkinson Sword, which is an outstanding blade.</li>
            <li>I have a VERY thick/course beard with VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I first started shaving in the 1960s with the old Blue Blades and have the scars to prove it, so if that is your frame of reference, discard it.  </li>
            <li>Every one touting the high stainless(and</li>
            <li>high PRICED) feathers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little more flexible than the store-bought ones which may explain why I haven&#x27;t cut myself with them.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Astra over the Feathers because I get just as close of a shave with a little more forgiveness.</li>
            <li>Shaving is a very personal experience and one man&#x27;s great shave is another man&#x27;s nightmare, but I can&#x27;t envision anyone who would have serious umbrage with these blades.  </li>
            <li>This gives me a fantastic bbs shave with absolutely no razor burn.</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner to the DE razor scene (as I am, only been doing DE shaving for a month so take this for what its worth)</li>
            <li>Also, long lasting, get another day more out of them than the Feather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you want to know how many shaves you can milk out of each blade, I can&#x27;t help you as it is my firm belief that DE blades should be tossed after one use.</li>
            <li>After sampling a few DE razors, these came to be my favorite DE razor.</li>
            <li>The reviews were spot-on: good, sharp blades but not &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; sharp.</li>
            <li>I normally use a blade for two months (shaving every day).  </li>
            <li>Great blades, does seem that 3rd or 4th blade it is not as sharp as the first few blades , then it starts the cycle over must be a manufacturing problem .</li>
            <li>Believe each person needs to find their standard brand that feels right.</li>
            <li>For me the only blade that is better in my Merkur HD 34C is the Feather, but you pay a little more for it (Roughly 30 Cents a blade).</li>
            <li>Smooth and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s the blade I always put in a new razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving n</li>
            <li>Around day 3 or so, new blade time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two Astra blades out there, and these Green-Box Platinums are sharper, and last longer than the standard Blue box version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, very comfortable shave, and for $10, you cannot go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;~syf</li>
            <li>It turned and incredible experience into an unpleasant one</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I jumped in head first with Personnas and blissfully ignorant as I shaved away for the next month....</li>
            <li>I know that will completely change my experience with these blades!</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay twice the price for the same, or fewer blades, so I gambled on the Astras instead and it paid off.</li>
            <li>I use a long handle Ultimate razor (about (48-80$ depending on sale pricing) and seems fine with these Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last a long time and get the job done in a way that feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I got these strictly on the price, not bad, but I have not tried any other  brands.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy these again, in like a year and a half :).</li>
            <li>These are one of the best values out there, sharp and long lasting, I get a solid half dozen shaves each.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s such a large pack, so I won&#x27;t have to worry about razors for quite some time.</li>
            <li>These blades are super sharp and give me a closer shave with no tugging.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried, buying 100 at a time, but I am absolutely delighted, and I have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li>Old style blade</li>
            <li>Old style blade</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I like these blades so far.</li>
            <li>Will recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>when I would try to shave my sideburns line with the grain I would frequently scrape a bit of my ear.</li>
            <li>These blades are far inferior to the Shark blades.</li>
            <li>My beard is not heavy</li>
            <li>I have a full, average stubble with generally sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Tried a few shaves using many different DE blades...</li>
            <li>Also, they feel as sharp after three shaves and the Van der Hagen blades felt fresh out of the box.</li>
            <li>If I ignore the intentionally designed drag I get huge extra life for several more months use until they are truly dull &amp; need changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the way to shave, better and much less expensive than the latest &amp;#34;wonder razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are made in the exact same factory as the Gillette Silver Blue blades in St Petersburg, Russia.  </li>
            <li>Still, these blades are fine to use in a pinch, and cost about half as much as the Sharp Edges.</li>
            <li>Each new blade is individually wrapped &amp; for disposal safety the wrapping can be used for the old blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both blades are essentially similar so far - except that the Astra&#x27;s are 1/2 the price of the Gillettes!!  </li>
            <li>My husband has soft skin and rough this hair which grows fast.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that I have a very coarse beard, and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These are just NOT sharp.  </li>
            <li>So smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe the blade is in there.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that they were not going to give me the pain free shave of the sharks, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I ordered these based on reviews from several places and the very first thing I did after trying one was put all the other blades to the back!!</li>
            <li>so started tinkering with old style  double edge razors.</li>
            <li>They would not cut my one day old beard after multiple passes, though I could hear the hairs rubbing across the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I rank it as my second best blade only to the Feather.</li>
            <li>I have gone through several sample packs and was honestly starting to get bummed out that I couldn&#x27;t find a blade that didn&#x27;t pull or tug, even brand new ones.</li>
            <li>Further, there are enough in a package so you don&#x27;t have to constantly reorder and the pricing is decent.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the Feathers, but they are very serviceable, and also inexpensive.</li>
            <li>They are unexpectedly  extremely sharp and  very durable.</li>
            <li>The Astras glide a little better than the Merkurs did and leave less irritation for me personally.</li>
            <li>Each blade is individually wrapped in thin wax paper type material so the old,blade can be wrapped in the paper and disposed of safely when blades are changed.</li>
            <li>Very little razor rash and a occasional in grown hair but a lot better for my then other blades and disposables.</li>
            <li>just NOT SHARP enough</li>
            <li>I generally get 3 shaves with these and only 1 with the Featherweights.  </li>
            <li>I chose this because it did not seem to dull as quickly.</li>
            <li>I have not tried Feather, but I hear they are very sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very sharp but not too much to finish a shaving like a Sweeney Todd work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin feels better after using these two, which I guess is from less irritation due to just cutting better overall.</li>
            <li>For me when I tried feathers were a sharp blade but do not last dull very quick.</li>

            <li> Good blades, great price.</li>
            <li> Good blade for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Price wise at 10 cents a blade</li>
            <li> My 2 sons and I all agree that Astra blades are superior to&lt;br</li>
            <li> I somehow feel that these are not as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> These are good blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample pack of blades about a year ago and among the razors in the batch were Astra and these Astra Superior Premium Platinum.</li>
            <li> (it came with two of each) and it didn&#x27;t seem quite as good.</li>
            <li> Really good deal.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Good blades for price</li>
            <li> Its a good blade</li>
            <li> Out of many that I&#x27;ve tried there are really a good deal!</li>
            <li> The best blade to use if you shave your head and still have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> Very glad to have them.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> BEst blade for me so far and great value</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, excellent product</li>
            <li> Recommend you get a multipack first to decide which ones work for you best.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, no scraping, face feels great.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving great value</li>
            <li> Gillette/proctor and gamble own them.</li>
            <li> but I received a sample pack of the Astras and worked really nice on my face.</li>
            <li> These are actually as good or better than the Feather brand that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving experience</li>
            <li> These cut very nice and smooth, no pull.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, very smooth shave with no irration!!!!</li>
            <li> they work great just as good as those Gillette hydro blades and much much cheaper</li>
            <li> For me, the kind of shave results I get mostly depends on the razor I use &amp; my shaving technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far every blade brand produced at that plant is superb.</li>
            <li> Best i have had so far</li>
            <li> Bought a assortment pack and these were the best by far for me</li>
            <li> As always YMMV, but for this ginger with sensitive skin, this is the best blade out there.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best blades I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> These are the best blades i&#x27;ve used so far, much better than the Vanderhagens I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li> I find with these blades I need to do more touch up work to get a nice 2 pass WTG+XTG shave, and that means more irritation and more risk for nicks.</li>
            <li> Very smooth vs everything else  </li>
            <li> They cut very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I get a very comfortable shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> I bought the sampler and found that this brand and the feather one are both very smooth.</li>
            <li> Astras give me 6 shaves per blade and could probably get more but quit at 6.</li>
            <li> these might be even better if you can get away with using them on your face.</li>
            <li> have not tried many brands but out of these, derby and wilkinson sword, these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the sample blades that came with my Pawn Stars favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect blade for me.</li>
            <li> did I mention CHEAP!</li>
            <li> Much better value than Derbys.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> May not give as many shaves as a heavier gauge blade, but the cost per blade makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I use feather for 3 or more day growth.&lt;br /&gt;nice.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on buying more.  </li>
            <li> I only use these now excellent for me.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Glad I gave them a shot.</li>
            <li> The reason I rated them as a five is I gave them to my sons and they both love them and have purchased them again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use more than once.</li>
            <li> Way better than the five blades that came with my Van der Hagen razor handle.</li>
            <li> I used to pay about the 10 bucks or more for a 5 pack of cartridge blades, what a joke.</li>
            <li> so much better than using tweezers and nair</li>
            <li> I got one of those packs with many types of razors.</li>
            <li> They are so much better than the gillettes I used 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> Better than Personna, derby, shark,</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of blades</li>
            <li> I had to make many passes and still did not get a close shave.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades.</li>
            <li> But the RazoRock handle changes the angle just enough that for me it becomes the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and like them.</li>
            <li> 6: finish up with Witch hazel wash and Trumpeter lime skin food and your favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> and I get about three more shaves after that.</li>
            <li> I am able to shave with these razors without tearing up my face.</li>
            <li> The Astra was one of my top three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> need to buy more, because I keep giving five-packs to friends because they don&#x27;t believe me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested the Astra and found that it did as well or better than any blade I have used.  </li>
            <li> But I find that a good stainless steel platinum coated blade will provide really nice shaves for about three weeks and then thereafter provide what I would characterize as acceptable shaves for the remainder of the two months.  </li>
            <li> Nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Works great with my new Merkur.</li>
            <li> but this Astra is the most comfortable shave of all.  </li>
            <li> Smooth Smooth shaving!</li>
            <li> The Astra&#x27;s are smooth and love the price.</li>
            <li> The first use was very smooth!</li>
            <li> Also, I appreciate that these fit the DE safety razor much better than the Shark blades I had before.</li>
            <li> They were reasonably priced with good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the blade that I&#x27;m most familiar with</li>
            <li> I have tried other blades but these are the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I can easily get three to four shaves out a a blade before I have to change it.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, but not the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> And easy to get at Walmart. 5</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades that don&#x27;t cut you up and a great value!  </li>
            <li> I use the razors twice before changing them and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> glides on my face easily and feels smooth and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2-3 of these so far, and they&#x27;ve been pretty good, but I remember having some really excellent shaves with some of the multi-brand packs, and I don&#x27;t remember having that with these.</li>
            <li> wanted the best blades and this lives up to ALL the positive reviews I read on these... Will DEFINITELY buy again</li>
            <li> Cheap at under $10 free ship for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> Cheap at under $10 free ship for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> Baby Butt Smooth shave( 1 face 2 neck).</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since the 7th grade...</li>
            <li> (FYI, I get 3 fantastic shaves per blade).  </li>
            <li> So cheap and yet.</li>
            <li> They wont make me a millionaire by saving money compared to cheap razors either.</li>
            <li> Bought a multipack of razors to try out different ones and these stood out as great for my face.  </li>
            <li> Not the sharpest blades on the market, but provide a smooth, comfortable shave without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I have used the blades both in a safety razor and in a shavette style razor and they always deliver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have a medium beard, and one blade with give me 5 or 6 comfortable shaves that leave my face smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> I liked this blades so much that I ordered 2 packs of 100.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used with Art of Shaving Pre-Shave oil and AOS Cream for a close smooth shave,</li>
            <li> Overall a great price for the quality of razor.</li>
            <li> razor and MARVEL at how effectively these can release so much blood.</li>
            <li> Dirt cheap compared to multi-blade options</li>
            <li> that came with my cheap &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; razor and those worked well.</li>
            <li> shaves before swapping (best shave of my life every morning), but they have lasted me 7 shaves, a few times, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great balance of Sharpness and smoothness in a double edged blade.</li>
            <li> you get the smooth shave you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Surprised that they&#x27;re so GOOD and CHEAP.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This 100 pack easily lasts two years, like them so much I&#x27;ve bought 3 others for gifts,, highly recommend, they shipped in perfect condition and fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel these would easily cut you up - except with the Pearl Razor I purchased - but also don&#x27;t expect a super close shave.</li>
            <li> I put one in my Feather AS-D2 instead of the usual Feather blade, and had a wonderful close, irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a de razor is a journey, one that I have enjoyed very much.</li>
            <li> I do use them in a Feather razor however, and in the other two that I have, seem to do the job with any good razor!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 4 years worth of shaving for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> Thats the fun part!</li>
            <li> Apparently different hair / skin combinations work better with different blades, an excellent value for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> The benefit was that my skin felt super smooth after each shave.</li>
            <li> I have found these Astra blades to be the best in my old Gillettes and  newer Parker open comb razors.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and will have to find their own magic combination.</li>
            <li> Clean shave, no irritation, no bleeding,</li>
            <li> Best blades available, combined with any Weishi razor (they&#x27;re all functionally the same, just different handle lengths and colors) makes a FANTASTIC low-stress, low-expense DE razor setup.  </li>
            <li> and this blade is super friendly to me</li>
            <li> Feathers 2 shaves so this is much more of an economic no brainer.</li>
            <li> OVERALL: a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good blade for a newbie &amp; good enough to be the only blade you need to buy.</li>
            <li> But If 10 cents is too much for anyone&#x27;s budget, I think you shouldn&#x27;t be worried about the cost of this blade, because being homeless maybe a more immediate concern.</li>
            <li> many shaves is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Shave wise - again essentially equal.  </li>
            <li> and I got a super clean shave, no irritation.</li>
            <li> NOT BAD</li>
            <li> Excellent value blades; very sharp and much cheaper than Feather or Personna Med Prep blades.</li>
            <li> I tried many other brands including Featherweight, and these give me the best shave and last the longest.  </li>
            <li> Super blades.</li>
            <li> I used the Merkur Super blades (from AOS)</li>
            <li> Both were good but the Superior Premium Platinum performed much better with less drag on my face.</li>
            <li> so far I shave daily and have about 4 days on these blades close comfortable shave for a great price</li>
            <li> Very consistent in quality unlike the personna or derby blades.</li>
            <li> Dont last more than one shave for me, but still economical!!  </li>
            <li> and used this blade in a Weishi Long Handle 9306CL Gunmetal Finish razor, also my cheapest and most favorite of 6 razors.</li>
            <li> My only regret is not buying more than one pack!</li>
            <li> At a little over 10 cents a blade this is a great shaving deal.  </li>
            <li> While some folks discussed various razors as if they were debating fine wines, I wasn&#x27;t experienced enough to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Each of the 5-paks has a handy flip top &amp; old blades can be inserted back into the box for disposal when done.</li>
            <li> Rarely a nick,...</li>
            <li> I found my second favorite and the best part is that they only cost a fraction of the former from Japan!</li>
            <li> Astra Premium Platinums are now my favorite all-around razor, and when you add in the fact that they are good for a week of everyday shaving, you get two years worth of blades for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I have tried and liked the following blade in order of preference:</li>
            <li> Almost as good as feather, but far far cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> These are by far his favorite blades.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted three full weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to buy a sample pack to try a bunch of different manufacturers</li>
            <li> Love these blades very smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wetshaving with a DE razor for about 8 years now, and have tried a bunch of different blades during that time period, including some that are now discontinued and sell for many times their original price.</li>
            <li> Although I have not been able to compare the so called original Astra blades with these I am inclined to accept the fact that only the wrapper has changed and that the blade has not.</li>
            <li> Good buy, quality and sharp.</li>
            <li> Are these Astra blades as good as the Sharp Edges?</li>
            <li> Whenever I thought that one of them was really good, then I used the other one</li>
            <li> and it glides right through with no dragging or snagging.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Probably could get even more, but, I do feel the blade pulling more then and, for what it costs, not worth saving pennies.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave in 2 passes, sharp enough for 2-3 shaves, and a great value at $10 per 100.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Great razors,work as advertised, ill will get more when i need them.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and far better blades than the CVS ones I had been using.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> IMO you cant do any better than this blade or its brother the Astra Stainless as they are very sharp but much more forgiving than the Feather.</li>
            <li> Good blade for the price, not harsh on the skin for an Afro-American, as long as you shave in the right direction.</li>
            <li> For me, this blade offers a tremendous shave, especially when paired with a nice razor, shaving creme and badger brush.  </li>
            <li> They blow my old disposable razors out of the water, and I have yet to get a single nick or &amp;#34;weeper.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used them in a Feather Popular razor, and a 1958 Gillette Superspeed, both with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Thought the Feather blades I bought awhile back were good, the Astra&#x27;s are just a little bit better.</li>
            <li> blades are very subjective so take this review for what its worth..</li>
            <li> First box of blades I have bought.  </li>
            <li> For my skill level these blades are the Great/best, First blades, I&#x27;ve tried just learning to shave again with a Safety Razor........3 months skill level...</li>
            <li> The first hundred cost about 18 cents per blade.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly priced right.</li>
            <li> exactly what my son wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe 10 or 15 different brands of DE blades and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I just switched to shaving with a safety razor, and these are the first blades I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic inexpensive blades that give a good shave in most razors without cutting up your face.</li>
            <li> I can shave more than a week with one blade, and I shave my entire head - not just my face!</li>
            <li> No need to shower first, just fill up the sink and get started.  </li>
            <li> The Astra blade did exactly that.  </li>
            <li> Both are very sharp but for some reason the Astra&#x27;s seem to be more comfortable,</li>
            <li> Great blades and an unbelievable value!</li>
            <li> These blades give a remarkably close shave and stay sharp far longer than the blades you get at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Derby Extra blades I originally tried, these are consistently sharp and much sharper overall giving me the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and any other razor.</li>
            <li> These are really sharp and do a nice job.</li>
            <li> I have every sensitive skin on my neck, I have tried almost every kind if disposable razor to 30 plus blades for my double razor.</li>
            <li> I get a good close shave, with no cuts, and very little razor burn.  </li>
            <li> so went with the 100 pack, super cheap, super sharp!</li>
            <li> no mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> great price  but not as sharp as others with similar pricing.</li>
            <li> First three shaves really close</li>
            <li> Great blades: very forgiving and stay  sharp through several shaves.</li>
            <li> Great for the average or short bearded men.</li>
            <li> Double edge razor blades are not all created equal; they have differing degrees of sharpness (sharper is not always better), flexibility, etc; After trying out different blades these work great for my skin; As far as the packaging, you get 20 packages of 5 blades each in a long box; the blades come individually wrapped in wax paper; a used blade bank would be nice</li>
            <li> Not all blades can endure that long (though I find that most stainless steel platinum coated blades can) ...</li>
            <li> in any case the Astra certainly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I decided to try these Astra blades out of strong curiosity, and so far I&#x27;ve had 5 shaves so far with them.</li>
            <li> Not too aggressive of a blade, nice close shave, stays sharp and comfortable for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Who knew that there were such huge differences between blade types.</li>
            <li> May Very from mine.</li>
            <li> I know the next year will be enjoyable, trouble free shaving with these blades!</li>
            <li> Astra blades are absolutely the smoothest shaving blades on the market.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave that lasts longer and has a cheaper replacement value than store bought razors plastic throwaways.</li>
            <li> I know blades are very subjective and differ from one person to another</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, but not the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I bought them for an ATT stainless.</li>
            <li> Eventually I&#x27;ll try the Feather blades that came with my razor, but I don&#x27;t really see at reason to try anything else.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than using mach 3 razors like I was doing before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much to compare to.</li>
            <li> These razors have worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> just wish i would have gotten the real thing as pictured</li>
            <li> My beard is very bristly</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and is like the blades for the cost</li>
            <li> The Astra was noticeably sharper and provided a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> and these blades give me a very close shave with no discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li> They worked great especially on my trouble spots like my neck.</li>
            <li> Blades are quality, and give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The R41 is a very aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re done FAST.  </li>
            <li> just started wet shaving have not found anything better, except mecur.</li>
            <li> Plus really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I tried 25 other blades but these astra&#x27;s are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about like most other folks.</li>
            <li> and I get a closer shave than most other blades.  </li>
            <li> Good price, sharp but not crazy sharp, and close to zero razor rash.  </li>
            <li> But a single blade can&#x27;t deliver the close, easy shaves of 3 blades in every swipe from my Mach3.</li>
            <li> But a single blade can&#x27;t deliver the close, easy shaves of 3 blades in every swipe from my Mach3.</li>
            <li> Recently came back to using a double edge saftey razor after many years of using everything else available.</li>
            <li> Most of the advice for new wet shavers was to buy a blade variety pack to see what you like and what works for you.</li>
            <li> My favorite over Feathers or any other high rated blade</li>
            <li> If you have a coarse beard like I do, these might take a little more finesse to do a good job over other brands.</li>
            <li> Overall not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and I&#x27;ve tried so many blades this brand are one of the best one they are sharp and not so thin like other ones.</li>
            <li> use them in my straight bar,slant bar and my adjustable razors new and vintage and performance is even across the board.</li>
            <li> Way better than the previous blades i had (Teflon coated blades from van der hagen) &amp; cheaper too.</li>
            <li> As an aside, the price for 100 of the Astras is $4 less than the price for 10 Merkur blades - that alone made the purchase worthwhile for me.</li>
            <li> Not the sharpest out there, but a decent medium sharpness</li>
            <li> I switched to Wilkinson Sword Classic</li>
            <li> Decent blades.</li>
            <li> The second use I definitely felt more razor burn trying to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> But used with the soap and applied after each pass with the final pass being mostly the oil, water, and left over watery soap.</li>
            <li> These seem to perform about as well as the more expensive Wilkinson Sword, which is an outstanding blade.</li>
            <li> I have a VERY thick/course beard with VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I first started shaving in the 1960s with the old Blue Blades and have the scars to prove it, so if that is your frame of reference, discard it.  </li>
            <li> Every one touting the high stainless(and</li>
            <li> high PRICED) feathers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little more flexible than the store-bought ones which may explain why I haven&#x27;t cut myself with them.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Astra over the Feathers because I get just as close of a shave with a little more forgiveness.</li>
            <li> Shaving is a very personal experience and one man&#x27;s great shave is another man&#x27;s nightmare, but I can&#x27;t envision anyone who would have serious umbrage with these blades.  </li>
            <li> This gives me a fantastic bbs shave with absolutely no razor burn.</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner to the DE razor scene (as I am, only been doing DE shaving for a month so take this for what its worth)</li>
            <li> Also, long lasting, get another day more out of them than the Feather&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you want to know how many shaves you can milk out of each blade, I can&#x27;t help you as it is my firm belief that DE blades should be tossed after one use.</li>
            <li> After sampling a few DE razors, these came to be my favorite DE razor.</li>
            <li> The reviews were spot-on: good, sharp blades but not &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; sharp.</li>
            <li> I normally use a blade for two months (shaving every day).  </li>
            <li> Great blades, does seem that 3rd or 4th blade it is not as sharp as the first few blades , then it starts the cycle over must be a manufacturing problem .</li>
            <li> Believe each person needs to find their standard brand that feels right.</li>
            <li> For me the only blade that is better in my Merkur HD 34C is the Feather, but you pay a little more for it (Roughly 30 Cents a blade).</li>
            <li> Smooth and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s the blade I always put in a new razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving n</li>
            <li> Around day 3 or so, new blade time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two Astra blades out there, and these Green-Box Platinums are sharper, and last longer than the standard Blue box version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, very comfortable shave, and for $10, you cannot go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;~syf</li>
            <li> It turned and incredible experience into an unpleasant one</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I jumped in head first with Personnas and blissfully ignorant as I shaved away for the next month....</li>
            <li> I know that will completely change my experience with these blades!</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay twice the price for the same, or fewer blades, so I gambled on the Astras instead and it paid off.</li>
            <li> I use a long handle Ultimate razor (about (48-80$ depending on sale pricing) and seems fine with these Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last a long time and get the job done in a way that feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I got these strictly on the price, not bad, but I have not tried any other  brands.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy these again, in like a year and a half :).</li>
            <li> These are one of the best values out there, sharp and long lasting, I get a solid half dozen shaves each.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s such a large pack, so I won&#x27;t have to worry about razors for quite some time.</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and give me a closer shave with no tugging.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, buying 100 at a time, but I am absolutely delighted, and I have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Old style blade</li>
            <li> Old style blade</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I like these blades so far.</li>
            <li> Will recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> when I would try to shave my sideburns line with the grain I would frequently scrape a bit of my ear.</li>
            <li> These blades are far inferior to the Shark blades.</li>
            <li> My beard is not heavy</li>
            <li> I have a full, average stubble with generally sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few shaves using many different DE blades...</li>
            <li> Also, they feel as sharp after three shaves and the Van der Hagen blades felt fresh out of the box.</li>
            <li> If I ignore the intentionally designed drag I get huge extra life for several more months use until they are truly dull &amp; need changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the way to shave, better and much less expensive than the latest &amp;#34;wonder razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are made in the exact same factory as the Gillette Silver Blue blades in St Petersburg, Russia.  </li>
            <li> Still, these blades are fine to use in a pinch, and cost about half as much as the Sharp Edges.</li>
            <li> Each new blade is individually wrapped &amp; for disposal safety the wrapping can be used for the old blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both blades are essentially similar so far - except that the Astra&#x27;s are 1/2 the price of the Gillettes!!  </li>
            <li> My husband has soft skin and rough this hair which grows fast.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that I have a very coarse beard, and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These are just NOT sharp.  </li>
            <li> So smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe the blade is in there.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that they were not going to give me the pain free shave of the sharks, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered these based on reviews from several places and the very first thing I did after trying one was put all the other blades to the back!!</li>
            <li> so started tinkering with old style  double edge razors.</li>
            <li> They would not cut my one day old beard after multiple passes, though I could hear the hairs rubbing across the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I rank it as my second best blade only to the Feather.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several sample packs and was honestly starting to get bummed out that I couldn&#x27;t find a blade that didn&#x27;t pull or tug, even brand new ones.</li>
            <li> Further, there are enough in a package so you don&#x27;t have to constantly reorder and the pricing is decent.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the Feathers, but they are very serviceable, and also inexpensive.</li>
            <li> They are unexpectedly  extremely sharp and  very durable.</li>
            <li> The Astras glide a little better than the Merkurs did and leave less irritation for me personally.</li>
            <li> Each blade is individually wrapped in thin wax paper type material so the old,blade can be wrapped in the paper and disposed of safely when blades are changed.</li>
            <li> Very little razor rash and a occasional in grown hair but a lot better for my then other blades and disposables.</li>
            <li> just NOT SHARP enough</li>
            <li> I generally get 3 shaves with these and only 1 with the Featherweights.  </li>
            <li> I chose this because it did not seem to dull as quickly.</li>
            <li> I have not tried Feather, but I hear they are very sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very sharp but not too much to finish a shaving like a Sweeney Todd work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin feels better after using these two, which I guess is from less irritation due to just cutting better overall.</li>
            <li> For me when I tried feathers were a sharp blade but do not last dull very quick.</li>
            <li> The particulars: I have a medium beard, and sensitive skin, shave every other day +/-</li>
            <li> I have used many other razor blades before but they all cut my pretty bad, I use this last night</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as Dorco blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, however, I have sensitive skin and they gave me a ton of nicks.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buying blades again for nearly a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Yes they are slightly duller, but these very high tec blades are still very sharp.</li>
            <li> When my favorite blades became hard to source, I switched to Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Sharp Edge blades and have been using those almost exclusively for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I can get at least one extra shave per blade compared to my previous razors and the cost is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> As far as the shave, I see little , if any difference.</li>
            <li> They were very inexpensive but were hard on my face.</li>
            <li> This  creates an artificial extra drag across my face implying the blades are getting duller the more I use it.  </li>
            <li> I get a close, comfortable shave even while using a sub-par razor (which will remain nameless).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and prefer the quality of these blades for my everyday shaving needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great shave, lasts long.</li>
            <li> Yes, it may take a bit longer to wet shave, but once you start, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I have used a few of these so far, and they work well.</li>
            <li> I initially tried a 5 pack when I started learning how to wet shave.</li>
            <li> Long Handle Safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, dark facial hair and these razors</li>
            <li> The dissenting opinion is to buy one pack of highly rated blades and spend a few months figuring out what the hell you&#x27;re doing before you start switching blades up every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razors are the ones I bought and they are sharp and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Feather blades due to their sharpeness</li>
            <li> a long time ago leave it at that!</li>
            <li> Just not as sharp as the Japanese blades.</li>
            <li> They last about a week and don&#x27;t cut me up like other blades.</li>
            <li> I paid about 10 bucks for a box of 100 and these blades last me almost two weeks when I shave every other day.</li>
            <li> and I always double and sometime triple shave due to my beard growth pattern.  </li>
            <li> I only shave every other day but that should not be a problem.</li>
            <li> I recently have tried some other brand blades but seem to like the feel of these blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are razor sharp (pun intended) and last through two or three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bbs I can get with any of my other razors and products but only this routine gives it with zero burn or discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as sharp as I&#x27;d like, enough for a single shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can go straight to cutting against the grain with these blades, something I couldn&#x27;t really do at all with the Van der Hagen blades.</li>
            <li> I do take them out and dry them, which helps preserve the sharpness.</li>
            <li> Love these blades for my wife and I. I tried the feathers but they are extremely harsh and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I usually don&#x27;t shave every day with them.  </li>
            <li> In the mean time, Astra gives me alternatives &amp; highly recommend for Quality, Uniformity &amp; Durability.</li>
            <li> In the mean time, Astra gives me alternatives &amp; highly recommend for Quality, Uniformity &amp; Durability.</li>
            <li> not high quality.</li>
            <li> Sharp Edge blades are supposedly made by the same Russian firm that manufactures these Astra blades.</li>
            <li> that is until I found an extra Astra blade that I had forgotten to use during the previous testing period.</li>
            <li> shave every other day with these blades and for me they stay sharp enough for 3 to 4 shavings.</li>
            <li> These blades hold up well and are so sharp and holds its edge for a long time</li>
            <li> The blades are thinner and lighter weight than I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as expected.  </li>
            <li> at just a few cents per blade, why would ANYONE feed into the corporate triple blade scam?</li>
            <li> Skip all the messy time-consuming brushes and soaps, just use this with canned shaving cream and any commercial aftershave</li>
            <li> but I am using an empty pill bottle as someone suggested</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s world of all kinds of slippery polymers, there&#x27;s no reason those little strips have to dissolve so fast e.g. a gimmick to pump artificial demand &amp; keep prices high.</li>
            <li> After this review was posted I was contacted via email by the vendor who stated that the manufacturer started packing the blades in plain paper around 4 months ago and that the blades are the same as those in printed paper.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Older review:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Great blades that are sharp enough for a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adequate due to price.</li>
            <li> Sharp sharp sharp is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Zero pulling or tugging, zero irritation and got the job done in 3 passes instead of 4 like EVERY other blade I have tried.</li>
            <li> no irratation stay sharp up to 4 shaves</li>
            <li> Sharp, but not the sharpest.</li>
            <li> In other words...what works well for me might not work well for everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between a razor like this and those having a reputation for being extremely sharp and unforgiving.</li>
            <li> I have a moderately thick facial hair that I shave ever other day.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, my beard isn&#x27;t as heavy as some of the other people who have commented here, since I can go at least a month with one of these blades.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I have heard that the blades in plain paper are not the original blades and not the same quality as those in printed paper.  </li>
            <li> and they skipped all over and snagged and required multiple passes in the same direction to make your scalp smooth and leave nasty razor burn.</li>
            <li> Exellent sharp and durable blade!  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Some folks say they don&#x27;t stay sharp beyond a few shaves....who cares?</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, and smoother than Feather.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a safer shave while being very sharp.</li>
            <li> Plus I appreciate the use of less packaging.  </li>
            <li> but they are less forgiving.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Dorco&#x27;s (?)</li>
            <li> WOW is this blade HARD to beat!!</li>
            <li> I suspect these are not original.</li>
            <li> think the slippery strip on Mach3 is less about helping the head glide which is does anyway over slippery shave cream or shave oil,...&amp; more about changing the cutting angle &amp; pushing me into changing out those expensive blades before their time.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and close shaving and no cuts !!</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard, they may not be for you.</li>
            <li> the price of a few feather blades you can get 100</li>
            <li> Even if I were to change the blade everyday, 10 cents a day is a not gonna to hurt.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying blades again for a few years at that rate.</li>
            <li> Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Yellows, Tiger Super Platinum, Personna Lab Blues, Dorco, Derby, and Feathers (unforgivably sharp, very irritating to the skin and expensive).</li>
            <li> It was hard to pull the buying button on these due to my consumer loyalty to Feather.</li>
            <li> The set I received in this order have the colored case, but each blade came in plain wax paper, unlike the green/white papers I had in a sample pack.</li>
            <li> I ordered these blades because the picture shows them wrapped in printed paper rather than plain waxed paper.  </li>
            <li> When they came they were in plain waxed paper.  </li>
            <li> I have some already in plain paper</li>
            <li> These work well, but not quite as well as the samples I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Have tried quite a few brands and this one did NOT disappoint !</li>
            <li> As a note they have a small amount of glue on the blade that holds the wax paper wrapping in place.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to give a review on something like razor blades because everyone has different skin and beard characteristics and opinions and brand loyalties are subjective.</li>

            <li> Astra wasn&#x27;t in the sample pack, so I did not know what I was getting in to, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my friend.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Of all the blades I tried, these lasted the longest, pulled the least.</li>
            <li> Surprised that they&#x27;re so GOOD and CHEAP.  If you have a heavy beard, they may not be for you. But I anticipate getting 1-2 months use per blade.</li>
            <li> Good blade for me anyway. Exellent sharp and durable blade!  use them in my straight bar,slant bar and my adjustable razors new and vintage and performance is even across the board. Every one touting the high stainless(and high PRICED) feathers. For me when I tried feathers were a sharp blade but do not last dull very quick. Astras give me 6 shaves per blade and could probably get more but quit at 6. Feathers 2 shaves so this is much more of an economic no brainer. But as they say &amp;#34;your milage may vary&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was hard to pull the buying button on these due to my consumer loyalty to Feather. But I decided to try these Astra blades out of strong curiosity, and so far I&#x27;ve had 5 shaves so far with them. I still think Feather&#x27;s are the best in the market. But these Astra&#x27;s aren&#x27;t too find behind, and due the cost difference these might be even better if you can get away with using them on your face. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as the Feathers, but they are very serviceable, and also inexpensive. From now on I will include Astra blades into my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> Great value, great product. I have sensitive skin and prefer the quality of these blades for my everyday shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I JUST BOUGHT THE 100 PACK FOR 9.99 CANT BEAT THAT I GET ABOUT 10 SHAVES OUT OF THESE NOT BAD AT ALL.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT blade, I tried the Astra&#x27;s in a sample pack of 20 and I rank it as my second best blade only to the Feather. Price wise at 10 cents a blade WOW is this blade HARD to beat!! For me the only blade that is better in my Merkur HD 34C is the Feather, but you pay a little more for it (Roughly 30 Cents a blade). I have a VERY thick/course beard with VERY sensitive skin and this blade is super friendly to me but as always, Your Mileage May Very from mine. If you are a beginner to the DE razor scene (as I am, only been doing DE shaving for a month so take this for what its worth) IMO you cant do any better than this blade or its brother the Astra Stainless as they are very sharp but much more forgiving than the Feather.</li>
            <li> Good buy, quality and sharp.</li>
            <li> Just &amp;#34;Okay.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as sharp as I&#x27;d like, enough for a single shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adequate due to price.</li>
            <li> Sharp sharp sharp is all I can say. These are awesome and I get the best shave of my life. Highly recommend these</li>
            <li> Very smooth vs everything else  I have used.</li>
            <li> Great razors at a great price.  I tried a variety pack and these and the Derby blades gave the best shaves for me.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several sample packs and was honestly starting to get bummed out that I couldn&#x27;t find a blade that didn&#x27;t pull or tug, even brand new ones. I ordered these based on reviews from several places and the very first thing I did after trying one was put all the other blades to the back!! Zero pulling or tugging, zero irritation and got the job done in 3 passes instead of 4 like EVERY other blade I have tried. I know the next year will be enjoyable, trouble free shaving with these blades! #astraforlife</li>
            <li> These blades are something. Especially great when paired with Parker 99R razor!</li>
            <li> OVERALL: a good buy. These Astra Premium blades come from Europe. Five in a box. Twenty 5-paks for 100 total.  Each of the 5-paks has a handy flip top &amp; old blades can be inserted back into the box for disposal when done. Each new blade is individually wrapped &amp; for disposal safety the wrapping can be used for the old blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVE: I have a full, average stubble with generally sensitive skin.  No snagging or pulling to speak of. There&#x27;s a lot of talk about sharpness of the blade affecting results. Rarely a nick,...but that&#x27;s my fault of being in a hurry.  For me, the kind of shave results I get mostly depends on the razor I use &amp; my shaving technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RAZOR:  Mach3 (4,5,etc) blades are EXpensive so started tinkering with old style  double edge razors. I use a long handle Ultimate razor (about (48-80$ depending on sale pricing) and seems fine with these Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: By accident found I could extend the life of my Mach3 blades several months. The slippery strip is designed glide the head over my face but it&#x27;s  ALSO designed to rub off with use &amp; changing the cutting angle of the blade. This  creates an artificial extra drag across my face implying the blades are getting duller the more I use it.  Yes they are slightly duller, but these very high tec blades are still very sharp. If I ignore the intentionally designed drag I get huge extra life for several more months use until they are truly dull &amp; need changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the slippery strip on Mach3 is less about helping the head glide which is does anyway over slippery shave cream or shave oil,...&amp; more about changing the cutting angle &amp; pushing me into changing out those expensive blades before their time.  Just my opinion. In today&#x27;s world of all kinds of slippery polymers, there&#x27;s no reason those little strips have to dissolve so fast e.g. a gimmick to pump artificial demand &amp; keep prices high. Which brings me to the Astra Blades...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTT LINE: Astra Sup Prem Plat 2x blades earn 5-STARS. Old style blade but they work. Cheap at under $10 free ship for 100 blades. Quality made. But a single blade can&#x27;t deliver the close, easy shaves of 3 blades in every swipe from my Mach3. Guess I was looking for the impossible. Though 2x blade system is cheaper,  I may return to M3 later.  In the mean time, Astra gives me alternatives &amp; highly recommend for Quality, Uniformity &amp; Durability.Astra Sup Prem Plat 2x blades earn 5-STARS. Old style blade but they work.

            <li> Awesome blades. Very sharp, closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think they even sharpened these blades!!!</li>
            <li> Smooth and sharp.  Nice blades!</li>
            <li> Astra blades are absolutely the smoothest shaving blades on the market. My 2 sons and I all agree that Astra blades are superior to&lt;br /&gt;Feathers. Both are very sharp but for some reason the Astra&#x27;s seem to be more comfortable,</li>
            <li> Best blades ever! Astra for life!!</li>
            <li> These feel sharper than the blue Personna&#x27;s. I was really impressed. I will probably use this blade forever. The come from the St. Petersburg plant in Russia. Gillette/proctor and gamble own them. So far every blade brand produced at that plant is superb. There was a packaging change where they switched to a simple white wax paper wrap so don&#x27;t let anyone lead you to beleive they&#x27;re knock off&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great razors for the price! I can easily get three to four shaves out a a blade before I have to change it. Each blade is individually wrapped in thin wax paper type material so the old,blade can be wrapped in the paper and disposed of safely when blades are changed. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for several months now and am thoroughly,satisfied with these blades.</li>
            <li> have not tried many brands but out of these, derby and wilkinson sword, these are my favorite. I have a thick beard and get a week out of one blade and that is with doing 3-4 passes on each shave.  can not beat the price either. blades are very subjective so take this review for what its worth..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Feather blades due to their sharpeness but I received a sample pack of the Astras and worked really nice on my face. I found my second favorite and the best part is that they only cost a fraction of the former from Japan!</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, however, I have sensitive skin and they gave me a ton of nicks.</li>
            <li> Blades get dull after one shave... RUBBISH!!!</li>
            <li> Great Blades - nuff said...</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the sample blades that came with my Pawn Stars favorite razor. So smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe the blade is in there. I will definitely buy these again, in like a year and a half :).</li>
            <li> The blades are thinner and lighter weight than I expected. They are unexpectedly  extremely sharp and  very durable. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and I&#x27;ve tried so many blades this brand are one of the best one they are sharp and not so thin like other ones.</li>
            <li> Great blades no irratation stay sharp up to 4 shaves</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> These blades cut well and last me about 3 or 4 shaves. I have a coarse beard.</li>
            <li> WOW! What a great blade. Who knew that there were such huge differences between blade types. These cut very nice and smooth, no pull.</li>
            <li> These work well, but not quite as well as the samples I used in the past. The set I received in this order have the colored case, but each blade came in plain wax paper, unlike the green/white papers I had in a sample pack. I somehow feel that these are not as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> These blades hold up well and are so sharp and holds its edge for a long time</li>
            <li> Have tried quite a few brands and this one did NOT disappoint ! They are sharp and close shaving and no cuts !!</li>
            <li> First box of blades I have bought.  I got these strictly on the price, not bad, but I have not tried any other  brands.  One blade I get about 5-6 shaves with.  I get a very close shave that lasts longer and has a cheaper replacement value than store bought razors plastic throwaways.</li>
            <li> Update 9/12/17&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Opened a pack and the blades are blank and seem to be a bit of a rougher shave. I suspect these are not original. I contacted the seller. Let&#x27;s see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Older review:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Great blades that are sharp enough for a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> After trying a few razors in sample packs, and deciding that the Feathers were the go-to razor, there has been a shift in power in the beard cutting realm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Astra Premium Platinums are now my favorite all-around razor, and when you add in the fact that they are good for a week of everyday shaving, you get two years worth of blades for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try that with your Mach V quadruple-blade cartridge razors...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two Astra blades out there, and these Green-Box Platinums are sharper, and last longer than the standard Blue box version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, very comfortable shave, and for $10, you cannot go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;~syf</li>
            <li> kinda scratchy....great price  but not as sharp as others with similar pricing.</li>
            <li> Great razors,work as advertised, ill will get more when i need them.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect blade for me. These blades glide across my face like a hockey puck on ice. Zero irritation going against the grain, and did I mention CHEAP! I have tried and liked the following blade in order of preference: Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Yellows, Tiger Super Platinum, Personna Lab Blues, Dorco, Derby, and Feathers (unforgivably sharp, very irritating to the skin and expensive). 2 pass Baby Butt Smooth shave( 1 face 2 neck). I know blades are very subjective and differ from one person to another but for me anyways I&#x27;ll never try another. The particulars: I have a medium beard, and sensitive skin, shave every other day +/- and used this blade in a Weishi Long Handle 9306CL Gunmetal Finish razor, also my cheapest and most favorite of 6 razors. My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since the 7th grade... a long time ago leave it at that! Whew all this over a razor blade???</li>
            <li> Almost as good as feather, but far far cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of a few feather blades you can get 100 astras!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shave, lasts long. Just not as sharp as the Japanese blades.</li>
            <li> For my skill level these blades are the Great/best, First blades, I&#x27;ve tried just learning to shave again with a Safety Razor........3 months skill level...</li>
            <li> My go-to blade. Sharp, but not the sharpest. Comfortable, but not the most comfortable. Durable, but not the longest lasting. Reasonable price, but not the cheapest. This is the blade that I&#x27;m most familiar with so it&#x27;s the blade I always put in a new razor. Good blade for a newbie &amp; good enough to be the only blade you need to buy. Much better value than Derbys.</li>
            <li> everybody&#x27;s skin and face are different, I have to shave 5 days a week because of my job and one blade last me a week. I tried 25 other blades but these astra&#x27;s are my favorite. I have yet to get a bad blade and I am on my second pack of 100. If your face likes them you can beat the price and quality. As a note they have a small amount of glue on the blade that holds the wax paper wrapping in place. I used to fight to remove it before putting it in my razor, then I just gave up and realized the glue stays on the blade and doesn&#x27;t transfer to my razor or effect the shave in any way. So now I leave it and it no longer bothers me.</li>
            <li> After using the shark brand and being very happy with them for over a year, I took a chance to order these blades. My first impression was that they were not going to give me the pain free shave of the sharks, but I was wrong. These blades are super sharp and give me a closer shave with no tugging. The benefit was that my skin felt super smooth after each shave.</li>
            <li> Thought the Feather blades I bought awhile back were good, the Astra&#x27;s are just a little bit better. Smooth shave, no scraping, face feels great. Also, long lasting, get another day more out of them than the Feather&#x27;s. I do use them in a Feather razor however, and in the other two that I have, seem to do the job with any good razor!</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty good. Not the sharpest out there, but a decent medium sharpness I would say. I don&#x27;t feel these would easily cut you up - except with the Pearl Razor I purchased - but also don&#x27;t expect a super close shave. Overall not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Tried a few shaves using many different DE blades... Derby, Shick, Feather but this Astra is the most comfortable shave of all.  Not too aggressive of a blade, nice close shave, stays sharp and comfortable for a long time.  Try it with any shaving oil, 2-3 drops in your shaving soap before you lather up for added comfort.  Bought 100 count of these Astras, dumped the rest.</li>
            <li> My husband has soft skin and rough this hair which grows fast. These are by far his favorite blades.</li>
            <li> Husband loves these!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as expected.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades that don&#x27;t cut you up and a great value!  Works great with my new Merkur.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this</li>
            <li> These are good blades.</li>
            <li> These are just NOT sharp.  They would not cut my one day old beard after multiple passes, though I could hear the hairs rubbing across the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I tried two blades.  just NOT SHARP enough</li>
            <li> May not give as many shaves as a heavier gauge blade, but the cost per blade makes up for it.</li>
            <li> use this as every day razor. I use feather for 3 or more day growth.&lt;br /&gt;nice. I dont get cuts or knicks from these</li>
            <li> The Astra SPs are the best blades that I have used. I get a close, comfortable shave even while using a sub-par razor (which will remain nameless).</li>
            <li> Shaving is a very personal experience and one man&#x27;s great shave is another man&#x27;s nightmare, but I can&#x27;t envision anyone who would have serious umbrage with these blades.  For me, this blade offers a tremendous shave, especially when paired with a nice razor, shaving creme and badger brush.  It&#x27;s the only way to go. The heck with these 4 and 5 blade monsters that break your bank and your skin. For what it&#x27;s worth, I first started shaving in the 1960s with the old Blue Blades and have the scars to prove it, so if that is your frame of reference, discard it.  Plus, my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow would break out around noon. Yes, it may take a bit longer to wet shave, but once you start, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Good blades at a superb price. If you have a coarse beard like I do, these might take a little more finesse to do a good job over other brands. Great for the average or short bearded men.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. I put one in my Feather AS-D2 instead of the usual Feather blade, and had a wonderful close, irritation free shave.  I didn&#x27;t buy them for my D2. I bought them for an ATT stainless. It&#x27;s my preferred blade in both razors.  Some folks say they don&#x27;t stay sharp beyond a few shaves....who cares? - they cost 10 cents a blade (compare that to cartridges)! Even if I were to change the blade everyday, 10 cents a day is a not gonna to hurt. (FYI, I get 3 fantastic shaves per blade).  But If 10 cents is too much for anyone&#x27;s budget, I think you shouldn&#x27;t be worried about the cost of this blade, because being homeless maybe a more immediate concern.</li>
            <li> Provide an excellent shave!  I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a way to avoid razor burn.  This product did the trick at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as an alternative to feather blades. They are very sharp, and smoother than Feather. Feather has them beat on sharpness and blade life. But at ten dollars for one hundred, these are a definate steal.</li>
            <li> These blades give a remarkably close shave and stay sharp far longer than the blades you get at the drugstore.  They&#x27;re a little more flexible than the store-bought ones which may explain why I haven&#x27;t cut myself with them.  Apparently, my beard isn&#x27;t as heavy as some of the other people who have commented here, since I can go at least a month with one of these blades.</li>
            <li> Most of the advice for new wet shavers was to buy a blade variety pack to see what you like and what works for you. The dissenting opinion is to buy one pack of highly rated blades and spend a few months figuring out what the hell you&#x27;re doing before you start switching blades up every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dissenting opinion made a lot of sense to me, so I bought the Astra SPs. I&#x27;m glad I did. They blow my old disposable razors out of the water, and I have yet to get a single nick or &amp;#34;weeper.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used them in a Feather Popular razor, and a 1958 Gillette Superspeed, both with fantastic results. Eventually I&#x27;ll try the Feather blades that came with my razor, but I don&#x27;t really see at reason to try anything else.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave. Very little irritation even when I&#x27;m sloppy and in a hurry. I have tried other blades but these are the best I have used. I prefer the Astra over the Feathers because I get just as close of a shave with a little more forgiveness.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on my face.</li>
            <li> They were very inexpensive but were hard on my face. I used all 100 of them.  They cost was about 11 cents per blade.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying more.  I switched to Wilkinson Sword Classic Double Edge Safety Razor Blades - Made in Germany from Schick.  The first hundred cost about 18 cents per blade.  I recently ordered a second 100. Maybe your skin will like the Astras.  Mine did not.</li>
            <li> One of the worst shaves I&#x27;ve had since going back to a DE razor. They also seem to wear out very quickly; only two shaves for me. I got them as a present and am thinking of regifting them or throwing them away</li>
            <li> I have used a few of these so far, and they work well. Much cheaper than using mach 3 razors like I was doing before.</li>
            <li> So cheap and yet. So perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Razors are the ones I bought and they are sharp and long lasting. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades. My husband really likes these. He said they give the best shave he has ever had.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have much to compare to. Nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Unlike the Derby Extra blades I originally tried, these are consistently sharp and much sharper overall giving me the best shave of my life.  Plus I appreciate the use of less packaging.  Will be using this brand exclusively from now on!</li>
            <li> These are the best blades i&#x27;ve used so far, much better than the Vanderhagens I&#x27;ve tried . They&#x27;re certainly priced right. Recently came back to using a double edge saftey razor after many years of using everything else available. This is the way to shave, better and much less expensive than the latest &amp;#34;wonder razor&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m currently using the &amp;#34;as seen on t.v.&amp;#34; razor being endorsed by Rick Harrelson of pawn stars fame.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving great value</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Have always used feather brand, but upon reading reviews I&#x27;ve decided to switch to Astra. I won&#x27;t look back! Smooth Smooth shaving!</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! These blades are awesome. Way better than the previous blades i had (Teflon coated blades from van der hagen) &amp; cheaper too.</li>
            <li> These razors have worked really well for me.  I have sensitive skin, so I usually don&#x27;t shave every day with them.  I use the razors twice before changing them and it works fine.  I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as Dorco blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades so far I shave daily and have about 4 days on these blades close comfortable shave for a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent, good price too!</li>
            <li> Find your perfect razor. I used Amazons variety pack and dialed in on the Astra brand. I only use these now excellent for me. Believe each person needs to find their standard brand that feels right. I recommend this one, but also Amazon&#x27;s variety pack if you are just starting.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about how people receive blades in white paper instead of the ones in the picture and i was one of those people but i can&#x27;t complain the ones i received shave and feel great just wish i would have gotten the real thing as pictured</li>
            <li> VERY thin and flimsy. not high quality.</li>
            <li> 300 or so shaves for next to nothing, suck it Gillette!</li>
            <li> BEst blade for me so far and great value</li>
            <li> These razors are ok...nothing to write home about.  I prefer the Gillette Platinum razors over these.  I have not tried Feather, but I hear they are very sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li> Love these. Saves me a ton on razors. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great blades. Convenient, recyclable packaging. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I have used.  They last about a week and don&#x27;t cut me up like other blades. They cut very smoothly.  Further, there are enough in a package so you don&#x27;t have to constantly reorder and the pricing is decent. I&#x27;m very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> I like these blades so far. I dont get all fancy with pre shave oils and badger hair bristle brushes. Just shaving gel, these blades and an aftershave lotion. They wont make me a millionaire by saving money compared to cheap razors either. But, i use them twice and then dispose of them. At a nickel per shave, theyre not shabby at all. Glad I gave them a shot.</li>
            <li> Great blades! Very consistent in quality unlike the personna or derby blades. Out of many that I&#x27;ve tried there are really a good deal!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with blades, but they do not like to shave more than a one day growth. I would recommend buying feather blades instead.</li>
            <li> Father and 2 sons give these blades a thumbs up for closeness and longevity.</li>
            <li> Bought a multipack of razors to try out different ones and these stood out as great for my face.  They last a long time and get the job done in a way that feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I initially bought these for myself. Personally I do not like them. My beard is very bristly and I don&#x27;t get a close shave. The reason I rated them as a five is I gave them to my sons and they both love them and have purchased them again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wetshaving with a DE razor for about 8 years now, and have tried a bunch of different blades during that time period, including some that are now discontinued and sell for many times their original price. When my favorite blades became hard to source, I switched to Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Sharp Edge blades and have been using those almost exclusively for the past couple of years. Sharp Edge blades are supposedly made by the same Russian firm that manufactures these Astra blades. Are these Astra blades as good as the Sharp Edges? NO, they are not. I find with these blades I need to do more touch up work to get a nice 2 pass WTG+XTG shave, and that means more irritation and more risk for nicks. Still, these blades are fine to use in a pinch, and cost about half as much as the Sharp Edges. If you must shave every day, then I wouldn&#x27;t even bother with these Astra blades, as I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re up to snuff. Compared to a lot of dull, scratchy, cheapo blades (i.e. Derby, Crystal, etc.) that come in sampler packs or the junk blades from the drugstore though, these a definitely a step above. If you want to know how many shaves you can milk out of each blade, I can&#x27;t help you as it is my firm belief that DE blades should be tossed after one use.</li>
            <li> exactly what my son wanted.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will not recommend. Can&#x27;t use more than once.</li>
            <li> Very good blades at a very good price.  Not the sharpest blades on the market, but provide a smooth, comfortable shave without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Way better than the five blades that came with my Van der Hagen razor handle. I shave in the shower because my hair is very coarse and I can go straight to cutting against the grain with these blades, something I couldn&#x27;t really do at all with the Van der Hagen blades. Also, they feel as sharp after three shaves and the Van der Hagen blades felt fresh out of the box. I paid about 10 bucks for a box of 100 and these blades last me almost two weeks when I shave every other day. That&#x27;s 4 years worth of shaving for 10 bucks! My skin feels better after using these two, which I guess is from less irritation due to just cutting better overall.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my son , who uses them every day.  Says they are the best blade he has ever used.  And you can&#x27;t beet the price.</li>
            <li> Super blades. My first one lasted three full weeks of shaving. That was 21 sessions and I always double and sometime triple shave due to my beard growth pattern.  I won&#x27;t be buying blades again for a few years at that rate. That&#x27;s almost 6 years!</li>
            <li> These blades did not give me the same result or feel than the blade I received when I bought my PARKER Safety Razor.  It turned and incredible experience into an unpleasant one and I went back to my Gillette disposable.  I only shave every other day but that should not be a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe 10 or 15 different brands of DE blades and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li> these are the sharpest Razors I have used yet</li>
            <li> The perfect razors for my skin at a great price.</li>
            <li> After trying several blades I picked this one to be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blade. Smooth shave in 2 passes, sharp enough for 2-3 shaves, and a great value at $10 per 100.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and is like the blades for the cost</li>
            <li> best shaving value I&#x27;ve found...</li>
            <li> I initially tried a 5 pack when I started learning how to wet shave. Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this and any other razor. While some folks discussed various razors as if they were debating fine wines, I wasn&#x27;t experienced enough to tell the difference. I eventually settled on a 100 pack of Personna blades. They were reasonably priced with good reviews. I jumped in head first with Personnas and blissfully ignorant as I shaved away for the next month.... that is until I found an extra Astra blade that I had forgotten to use during the previous testing period. Man, what a difference. The Astra was noticeably sharper and provided a much closer shave. I can get at least one extra shave per blade compared to my previous razors and the cost is exactly the same. Go with the 100 pack and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Very sharp and nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, excellent product</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample pack of blades about a year ago and among the razors in the batch were Astra and these Astra Superior Premium Platinum. Both were good but the Superior Premium Platinum performed much better with less drag on my face. It is difficult to give a review on something like razor blades because everyone has different skin and beard characteristics and opinions and brand loyalties are subjective. In other words...what works well for me might not work well for everyone. What I can say is that I have a very coarse beard, and very sensitive skin and these blades give me a very close shave with no discomfort or irritation. I have used the blades both in a safety razor and in a shavette style razor and they always deliver a smooth shave. They glide well against the skin without any tugging or pulling at the hair.</li>
            <li> They are Astra greens. Some of the best blades you can buy.</li>
            <li> They worked great especially on my trouble spots like my neck. Will recommend them to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 20 Pks of 5 Astra Razors.  After sampling a few DE razors, these came to be my favorite DE razor. At a little over 10 cents a blade this is a great shaving deal.  I used to pay about the 10 bucks or more for a 5 pack of cartridge blades, what a joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 boxes of these over the years and would recommend them. I recently have tried some other brand blades but seem to like the feel of these blades.</li>
            <li> so much better than using tweezers and nair</li>
            <li> The best blade to use if you shave your head and still have a full head of hair. I have very thick wiry hair and it glides right through with no dragging or snagging. I have also tried feathers for this and they skipped all over and snagged and required multiple passes in the same direction to make your scalp smooth and leave nasty razor burn. Just goes to show the importance of edge geometry. I usually use the Astra once per side on my head and performs consistently throughout the shave. This combined with headslick makes for the best head shave period</li>
            <li> These are the best blades that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Much cheaper and far better blades than the CVS ones I had been using.</li>
            <li> They seem really great. I&#x27;ve had difficulty actually comparing straight-edge razor blades. I got one of those packs with many types of razors. Whenever I thought that one of them was really good, then I used the other one (it came with two of each) and it didn&#x27;t seem quite as good. I&#x27;ve only used 2-3 of these so far, and they&#x27;ve been pretty good, but I remember having some really excellent shaves with some of the multi-brand packs, and I don&#x27;t remember having that with these. Anyways, I went for this pack because it was second-highest rated compared to feather. I like that it&#x27;s such a large pack, so I won&#x27;t have to worry about razors for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I just switched to shaving with a safety razor, and these are the first blades I&#x27;ve purchased.  They are so much better than the gillettes I used 40 years ago.  I have a medium beard, and one blade with give me 5 or 6 comfortable shaves that leave my face smooth as silk.  I won&#x27;t buying blades again for nearly a year and a half.  Ten bucks for that many shaves is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> These are one of the best values out there, sharp and long lasting, I get a solid half dozen shaves each. This 100 pack easily lasts two years, like them so much I&#x27;ve bought 3 others for gifts,, highly recommend, they shipped in perfect condition and fast</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, buying 100 at a time, but I am absolutely delighted, and I have a heavy beard. These are actually as good or better than the Feather brand that came with the razor. I do take them out and dry them, which helps preserve the sharpness. Russia, who knew?</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES the entire set I bought him.</li>
            <li> I tried many other brands including Featherweight, and these give me the best shave and last the longest.  I generally get 3 shaves with these and only 1 with the Featherweights.  They come boxed in packs of 5.</li>
            <li> Awesome! These will last me a while. They hold there edge for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Blades are quality, and give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Best i have had so far</li>
            <li> My favorite. Get 4-5 shaves per blade. Great price too.</li>
            <li> The perfect blade for me.  I have a moderately thick facial hair that I shave ever other day.  The blades are razor sharp (pun intended) and last through two or three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at just a few cents per blade, why would ANYONE feed into the corporate triple blade scam?</li>
            <li> I liked this blades so much that I ordered 2 packs of 100.&lt;br /&gt;It glides on my face easily and feels smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp but not too much to finish a shaving like a Sweeney Todd work.&lt;br /&gt;I shave every other day with these blades and for me they stay sharp enough for 3 to 4 shavings.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Used with Art of Shaving Pre-Shave oil and AOS Cream for a close smooth shave,</li>
            <li> I have every sensitive skin on my neck, I have tried almost every kind if disposable razor to 30 plus blades for my double razor. For me these blade have been the best to date. Very little razor rash and a occasional in grown hair but a lot better for my then other blades and disposables.</li>
            <li> Really good deal and great razors.</li>
            <li> Like all double edge razor blades, they perform differently depending on the razor you install them in. I have found these Astra blades to be the best in my old Gillettes and  newer Parker open comb razors.</li>
            <li> I get a very comfortable shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> They work great. Really good deal.</li>
            <li> Good value. Decent blades. Can get 2 shaves with each blade.</li>
            <li> These razors match my facial hair like nobodies bussines. I have pretty thick, dark facial hair and these razors do wonders without any pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> Smoothest blades I have ever used ... I&#x27;m new to DE shaving n wanted the best blades and this lives up to ALL the positive reviews I read on these... Will DEFINITELY buy again</li>
            <li> Fantastic inexpensive blades that give a good shave in most razors without cutting up your face.</li>
            <li> Great blades, does seem that 3rd or 4th blade it is not as sharp as the first few blades , then it starts the cycle over must be a manufacturing problem .</li>
            <li> Love these blades for my wife and I. I tried the feathers but they are extremely harsh and uncomfortable. The Astra&#x27;s are smooth and love the price.</li>
            <li> The blades worked great! The first use was very smooth! The second use I definitely felt more razor burn trying to get a close shave. I haven&#x27;t used them with a pre-shave oil or aftershave balm yet. I know that will completely change my experience with these blades! Overall a great price for the quality of razor. Also, I appreciate that these fit the DE safety razor much better than the Shark blades I had before. The edge on the shark blades always stuck out of the sides quite a bit so when I would try to shave my sideburns line with the grain I would frequently scrape a bit of my ear.</li>
            <li> Great blades and an unbelievable value!</li>
            <li> Good blades for price</li>
            <li> These razors are great.  Shipping time and product is awesome! Thank you very much.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great blade for the price.  Better than Personna, derby, shark, et. al.  Cheaper than feathers.</li>
            <li> Bought a assortment pack and these were the best by far for me so went with the 100 pack, super cheap, super sharp!</li>
            <li> I ordered these blades because the picture shows them wrapped in printed paper rather than plain waxed paper.  When they came they were in plain waxed paper.  I am disappointed because I have heard that the blades in plain paper are not the original blades and not the same quality as those in printed paper.  I have some already in plain paper and they work well but I wanted to make a comparison of the two and see for myself if there was a difference.  I wish the blades would have been as shown in the picture.  Because of that I am giving 3 stars.    After this review was posted I was contacted via email by the vendor who stated that the manufacturer started packing the blades in plain paper around 4 months ago and that the blades are the same as those in printed paper.  I hope so.    Update: Although I have not been able to compare the so called original Astra blades with these I am inclined to accept the fact that only the wrapper has changed and that the blade has not. I must say that these blades give me a very good shave and are a very good deal at this price.  I have tried many brands of blades and I think this blade is the best bang for your buck.  I am revising my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These blades are far inferior to the Shark blades. The blades have sticky residue like glue holding the papers on, and they are duller than a cartridge blade. I had to make many passes and still did not get a close shave. I&#x27;m tossing the 99 I have left and either trying feather or going back to shark.</li>
            <li> Excellent value blades; very sharp and much cheaper than Feather or Personna Med Prep blades. Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades. Sharp and smooth.  Shaving with a de razor is a journey, one that I have enjoyed very much. Everyone must find the combination of blade, razor, soap and brush that works for them.In my case, after seven months of trial and error this is what gives me that perfect shave that we look for. 1: Muhle R41 razor head. 2: the handle from my RazoRock mission. The R41 is a very aggressive razor. But the RazoRock handle changes the angle just enough that for me it becomes the perfect combination. 3: Astra premium platinum blades. The R41 is still to aggressive with Feather blades for me. But with the Astras in it and the solid handle of the mission,Wow! The perfect combination. 4: Van der hagen luxury shave soap. I have tried many others and like them. But for price and quality of sope it cant be beat. And easy to get at Walmart. 5: Shave Secret shave oil. I can&#x27;t use this a they recommend.  But used with the soap and applied after each pass with the final pass being mostly the oil, water, and left over watery soap. This gives me a fantastic bbs shave with absolutely no razor burn. The bbs I can get with any of my other razors and products but only this routine gives it with zero burn or discomfort. 6: finish up with Witch hazel wash and Trumpeter lime skin food and your favorite aftershave. Everyone is different and will have to find their own magic combination. But hay! Thats the fun part!</li>
            <li> These blades are Great! I can shave more than a week with one blade, and I shave my entire head - not just my face! My only regret is not buying more than one pack!</li>
            <li> Double edge razor blades are not all created equal; they have differing degrees of sharpness (sharper is not always better), flexibility, etc; After trying out different blades these work great for my skin; As far as the packaging, you get 20 packages of 5 blades each in a long box; the blades come individually wrapped in wax paper; a used blade bank would be nice</li>
            <li> Great buy, just pennies a blade. Allot smoother shave than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Discoloration of blades observed after four days of use.  No spot to put used blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades Great price gotta love it !!!</li>
            <li> First three shaves really close and I get about three more shaves after that. Probably could get even more, but, I do feel the blade pulling more then and, for what it costs, not worth saving pennies. It seems to be a safer shave while being very sharp. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between a razor like this and those having a reputation for being extremely sharp and unforgiving. I have tried them and they do not give me a closer shave but they are less forgiving.</li>
            <li> I change them once a week they work great just as good as those Gillette hydro blades and much much cheaper</li>
            <li> I am able to shave with these razors without tearing up my face. Very glad to have them. They are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made in the exact same factory as the Gillette Silver Blue blades in St Petersburg, Russia.  Both blades are essentially similar so far - except that the Astra&#x27;s are 1/2 the price of the Gillettes!!  Shave wise - again essentially equal.  Recommend A+++++</li>
            <li> Good blades, great price.</li>
            <li> Nice shaving experience</li>
            <li> Apparently different hair / skin combinations work better with different blades, an excellent value for 100 blades. Thesedouble edged blades actually has four numbered (1-4) sharpened edges so you can extend life of a ten cent blade by flipping it.</li>
            <li> Best blades available, combined with any Weishi razor (they&#x27;re all functionally the same, just different handle lengths and colors) makes a FANTASTIC low-stress, low-expense DE razor setup.  Skip all the messy time-consuming brushes and soaps, just use this with canned shaving cream and any commercial aftershave and you&#x27;re done FAST.  No need to shower first, just fill up the sink and get started.  Clean shave, no irritation, no bleeding, no mess to clean up.  But use these with the wrong (more aggressive?) razor and MARVEL at how effectively these can release so much blood.</li>
            <li> I have used many other razor blades before but they all cut my pretty bad, I use this last night and I got a super clean shave, no irritation. I&#x27;m very pleased! I use this in conjunction with poraso soap and brush.</li>
            <li> A tad sharper than the Shark safety razors but last about the same for me.</li>
            <li> Seven bucks a year versus three hundred and some a year. As far as the shave, I see little , if any difference. It&#x27;s just shaving, not brain surgery.</li>
            <li> These blades are great!</li>
            <li> just started wet shaving have not found anything better, except mecur.</li>
            <li> Very nice blades.  My beard is not heavy but I get about a week out of each blade.  Dirt cheap compared to multi-blade options</li>
            <li> Got into DE shaving because I got tired of paying outrageous sums of money for cartridges that barely lasted a week. I purchased a sampler of blades, tried each of them and kept notes throughout. The Astra was one of my top three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the book says, Your results may vary.</li>
            <li> Great blades: very forgiving and stay  sharp through several shaves. Also come at a great price. Recommend you get a multipack first to decide which ones work for you best.</li>
            <li> I use these religiously. My favorite over Feathers or any other high rated blade</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Astra yet, you need to.  Sharp and smooth. Will usually last about four shaves.</li>
            <li> Great razors. I am yet to cut myself and switch blades every week or so. Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> Love these blades very smooth and sharp. They just glide for me.</li>
            <li> Good blade for the price, not harsh on the skin for an Afro-American, as long as you shave in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about like most other folks. I bought the sampler and found that this brand and the feather one are both very smooth. I chose this because it did not seem to dull as quickly. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Great price amd delivery times. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wets having for several years and have tried almost everything. These blades are in my opinion second to none.</li>
            <li> I use these with my Merkur HD Long Handle Safety razor.  I get a good close shave, with no cuts, and very little razor burn.  These seem to perform about as well as the more expensive Wilkinson Sword, which is an outstanding blade.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these blades. I just started using double edged razor because of the price of Fusion blades 4 for $20.00. So I bought the double edged. 100 for $9.99. That is ten cents per blade!!!  I highly recommend this product, very smooth shave with no irration!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these based on reviews here. The reviews were spot-on: good, sharp blades but not &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; sharp. They do a great job but don&#x27;t nick me. I was previously using the Dorco&#x27;s (?) that came with my cheap &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; razor and those worked well. These work just as well. They do not come with any containers to throw the used blades away like the Dorco&#x27;s did but I am using an empty pill bottle as someone suggested and it works fine. Would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are really sharp and do a nice job.</li>
            <li> As always YMMV, but for this ginger with sensitive skin, this is the best blade out there.</li>
            <li> These glide over my beard and I get a closer shave than most other blades.  Plus really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best blades I have ever used.  About a year ago I ordered a sample pack of 20 different blades, 2 of each, to try to see what was out there.  It was a horrendous experience.  I purchased a 100 pack of Astra SP on the advice of a friend.  Astra wasn&#x27;t in the sample pack, so I did not know what I was getting in to, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my friend.  Buy 3 of these.  This is the last blade you will ever get.  At this price, I only let my blades go 2 shaves before swapping (best shave of my life every morning), but they have lasted me 7 shaves, a few times, in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to buy more, because I keep giving five-packs to friends because they don&#x27;t believe me.  I am starting to think they are gaming me at this point.  :-D</li>
            <li> Great balance of Sharpness and smoothness in a double edged blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The Astra is a very good blade and I recommend it.  Some background:  I&#x27;ve been DE razor shaving since 1960.  I&#x27;ve tested the Astra and found that it did as well or better than any blade I have used.  I normally use a blade for two months (shaving every day).  Not all blades can endure that long (though I find that most stainless steel platinum coated blades can) ... in any case the Astra certainly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously a blade can&#x27;t provide pristine, perfect shaves for two months.  But I find that a good stainless steel platinum coated blade will provide really nice shaves for about three weeks and then thereafter provide what I would characterize as acceptable shaves for the remainder of the two months.  The Astra blade did exactly that.  Its a good blade and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and undamaged.  Great blades!! Dont last more than one shave for me, but still economical!!  Edit- 12/8/14  I can now get 2-3 shaves out of each blade. Pribably because of improved technique, angle, and pressure. Great blade for the price!! Bow have 300.  Also try personna lab blues!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I used the Merkur Super blades (from AOS) prior to getting the Astra blades and I noticed a difference right away. As an aside, the price for 100 of the Astras is $4 less than the price for 10 Merkur blades - that alone made the purchase worthwhile for me. The Astras glide a little better than the Merkurs did and leave less irritation for me personally. I would have liked to buy a sample pack to try a bunch of different manufacturers but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay twice the price for the same, or fewer blades, so I gambled on the Astras instead and it paid off.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> These blades are great.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous others In a variety of samplers, and keep coming back to these.  Good price, sharp but not crazy sharp, and close to zero razor rash.  Around day 3 or so, new blade time.</li>
            <li> you get the smooth shave you are looking for.</li>
