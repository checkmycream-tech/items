            <li>It smells wonderful and makes your skin wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>but this lotion seems to do a great job of enhancing  your tan so that you don&#x27;t really need the bronzer.  </li>
            <li>First of all the after smell of this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Overall, a great buy!</li>
            <li>It works pretty good..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on how good I smell after going tanning when using this lotion!</li>
            <li>Scent is too strong, I won&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>Delivered and was so excited.</li>
            <li>, this did the trick :)  after using it twice I have developed a lovely color.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good (not as good as I expected from reading other reviews) and feels good on my skin, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made a difference in my tan at all.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the smell too sweet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with other lotions smelling great going on, but leaving you smelling &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; afterward, which this lotion does not do.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and doesnt give you that burnt smell after tanning like other products i have usded.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live with out AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to tanning and very light skinned despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been going 2-3 times a month.</li>
            <li>So far, I really love it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this lotion and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>If you want a very nice bronzer buy the black bottle of pink :)</li>
            <li>I first saw this lotion at the tanning salon</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin SUPER soft!</li>
            <li>My salon sells this same bottle for $35, I was happy to see it on Amazon for half the price.</li>
            <li>If you are tanning in the right bed with this lotion you will be amazingly surprised with the results!</li>
            <li>My tan seems much richer and darker.</li>
            <li>and it didnt seem to do much</li>
            <li>I look like i have a natural tan!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the black colored bottle of this brand!!</li>
            <li>I tan nice in the real sun which is why I thought it was weird.</li>
            <li>Bear in mind that I do have sensitive skin and eczema, so if you have solar concerns steer clear</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than local salon and works just as well.</li>
            <li>There is no bronser added to it, which I hate, as those always stain my clothing(or between my fingers) and it works great!</li>
            <li>and they were exactly the same - same scent, texture, color etc.  </li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t use a maximizer during the winter because I don&#x27;t want to look too obvious about going tanning...</li>
            <li>I first bought this at my salon, but wanted to find it fir less $.</li>
            <li>as always, tan responsibly, burnt skin is not pretty skin.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in color within the first few tanning sessions..</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m more after something with at least a little bronzer in it.</li>

            <li> this lotion smells great, feels great (not greasy or sticky). will not cause you to look &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;, even if your very fair skinned, like myself. as always, tan responsibly, burnt skin is not pretty skin.</li>
            <li> I first saw this lotion at the tanning salon I go to and was intrigued by the &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; label.  The lotion was $30 at the salon but I found it here for around $16 which was a great deal.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot of things about shady dealers using fake tanning lotions, but I actually compared the one I received with the one at the salon and they were exactly the same - same scent, texture, color etc.  This lotion works great! It smells awesome - I&#x27;ve had issues with other lotions smelling great going on, but leaving you smelling &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; afterward, which this lotion does not do.  I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on how good I smell after going tanning when using this lotion! I&#x27;m also not a big fan of bronzers as I feel they can make you look orange and I hate dealing with it rubbing off onto your clothing - but this lotion seems to do a great job of enhancing  your tan so that you don&#x27;t really need the bronzer.  Overall, I love this lotion and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> If you are tanning in the right bed with this lotion you will be amazingly surprised with the results! First of all the after smell of this product is amazing! Second, it&#x27;s hard for me to get dark, i get tan but i just want to be dark and this lotion has been helping me get there! Im obsessed! Other than the pump not working on my bottle, id recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this lotion. So far, I really love it. My tan seems much richer and darker. It smells great.</li>
            <li> I used this for one month tanning about 2-3 times a week and it didnt seem to do much yes it accelerated the tan but not as much as other accelerators I have used in the past.  The smell is nice and it rubbins in nicely as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion smelled like a Christmas tree! I loved the smell bit my sensitive skin did not enjoy it at all, I got a rash from head to toe within hours of using this product. Bear in mind that I do have sensitive skin and eczema, so if you have solar concerns steer clear</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells amazing, even after you tan, you don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell. There is NO bronzer, so you wont turn orange. It leaves your skin SUPER soft! Overall, a great buy! My salon sells this same bottle for $35, I was happy to see it on Amazon for half the price.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my salon, but wanted to find it fir less $. This is much cheaper than local salon and works just as well. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good (not as good as I expected from reading other reviews) and feels good on my skin, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made a difference in my tan at all.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning maximizer! There is no bronser added to it, which I hate, as those always stain my clothing(or between my fingers) and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning and very light skinned despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been going 2-3 times a month. I really wasn&#x27;t looking for a bronzer because I&#x27;m afraid that would look fake.  I just wanted something that would boost my color just a little so i&#x27;m not white, but i&#x27;m not TAN either.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this did the trick :)  after using it twice I have developed a lovely color.  Plus, it smells like cookies!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> Smells great no bronzer and works giving a great tan</li>
            <li> This is the best maximized I have ever tried. I am very experienced in tanning lotions, and have tried many from the devoted creations line,but none gave me results like this. Instant color that doesn&#x27;t fade, that&#x27;s the beauty about maximized as opposed to bronzers. Amazing lotion!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great!</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot!!! Works great and smells wonderful.i have a great tan now and I got my product within days.. Couldn&#x27;t live with out AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> This Lotion is great. I never used to get tan in a tanning booth. I would usually burn or just get red and it never turned tan.I am not fair skinned either.I tan nice in the real sun which is why I thought it was weird. I did NOT order from Amazon I bought it from a Co-worker who owns a salon.I saw instant results after using this product.I was shocked.It smells great and doesnt give you that burnt smell after tanning like other products i have usded.I will continue to use this product.This doesnt have a bronzer in it.I was using thos trial packets the salon offered for like $4 a pack. what a rip off just buy a bottle, I used a brozer lotion not realizng it and my hands were orange and between my finger looked dirty.Which I do not get at all with this product.I look like i have a natural tan! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Received this quicker than I have ever received anything!! Very happy and impressed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell too sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice mosterizor. But I&#x27;m more after something with at least a little bronzer in it. I absolutely love the black colored bottle of this brand!! So if your looking for just mosterizor you&#x27;ve found a great product. If you want a very nice bronzer buy the black bottle of pink :)</li>
            <li> Scent is too strong, I won&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.. I just HATE the way it smells.and when I got it in the mail the lid was broken Off.</li>
            <li> Even though people warn me, I still buy lotions from amazon... I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet. This lotion is amazing. It smells wonderful and makes your skin wonderfully soft. After using Ed Hardy Peace and Harmony and not getting any results, I switched to this lotion. I could see a difference in color within the first few tanning sessions.. I recommend this lotion for those just starting out who are trying to develop a base tan. Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Delivered and was so excited. Put it in my gym bag only to find that it leaked all over my clothes. Found a small crack in the bottle and product leaked everywhere. Only go to use about 1/3 bc the rest leaked out.</li>
            <li> this lotion SMELLS great, FEELS great on my skin &amp; LOOKS great just after 2 sessions!&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t use a maximizer during the winter because I don&#x27;t want to look too obvious about going tanning...but this lotion is a great plateu buster--perfect for March/April when you really want to start getting good color! couldn&#x27;t ask for more! :)</li>
