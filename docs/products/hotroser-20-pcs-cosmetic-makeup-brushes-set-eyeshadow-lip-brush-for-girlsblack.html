            <li>Love the 20pc brush set!</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing will order again</li>
            <li>Quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>they were amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>but the feel and look are amazing.</li>
            <li>The reason is because they are nice brushes they just don&#x27;t have the names in them.</li>
            <li>they look nice.</li>
            <li>Nice quality brishes.</li>
            <li>and they had a nice length to them.</li>
            <li>and they were nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>but if you are a professional and want good word of mouth for an excellent application, these are NOT the bruses,.....</li>
            <li>the brushes are nice but they don&#x27;t pick up the colors at all and don&#x27;t spread it.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes.</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun trying every brush!!!</li>
            <li>Having multiples of these brushes is great because I&#x27;ll have a clean one to use every time I paint a face.</li>
            <li>If you want a good full set though for a good price, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and work great!!</li>
            <li>Would be perfect if they were marked for what they are for.</li>
            <li>I loved the brush egg I also got free with my order.</li>
            <li>soft, perfect and pro!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and came in great packaging!</li>
            <li>so I was super happy when I found out that there was more than one of some of the brushes</li>
            <li>I love this brushes they are soft and the brushegg is perfect and they came on time you have 20 brushes but</li>
            <li>Wow I got my brushes today and they are absolutely amazing!!</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li>I also love d brushes but pls what&#x27;s the brush egg used for?</li>
            <li>Awesome same that ilustrated</li>
            <li>More for creams and liquids in my opinion just by looks and feel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>So many brushes to use that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not constantly prepping my faves over and over to use... Great quality!!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes cant wait to use them!&lt;br</li>

            <li>eh, ok brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think most of them got it either.</li>
            <li>Wil be buying more</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t as many brushes as the picture makes it look.</li>
            <li>was the mascara one (the top came off)</li>
            <li>They are okay</li>
            <li>Also why so many are duplicates?</li>
            <li>The packages arrived 3 days earlier than was said to arrive and that was a great bonus!</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>

            <li>Love it n</li>
            <li>Up close they kind of look like drug store brushes, but the good thing is I have a set of good brushes and was just looking for some extra.</li>
            <li>For the price these brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very soft and great looking.</li>
            <li>So far they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>brushes are uber soft and they do a great job.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s not the good brushes that are duplicated is why I didn&#x27;t go the whole 5 stars.</li>
            <li>What I found them good for is for my fx makeup since they apply creams very well.</li>
            <li>All my brushes are very nice and soft.</li>
            <li>But I washed them before I used them and they softened up easily and the strong plastic scent was gone.</li>
            <li>They do have a strong chemical smell,  which dispersed upon washing.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and accurate to it&#x27;s description.  </li>
            <li>Works fine does what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li>Super pleased can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li>Item showed up quickly!</li>
            <li>I Am Super Pleased With My Order.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to catch color.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty soft and good quality for the price !</li>
            <li>Great makeup brushes especially the price!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy nice brushes</li>
            <li>You get 20 what seem to be great quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li>I did not receive the free gift</li>
            <li>a free brush egg üëèüëè</li>
            <li>Great brushed.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say they are very helpful</li>
            <li>the free gift</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>Brushes are really soft and looks and smells good.</li>
            <li>These are extremely soft and good quality,  g look ad I purchased.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product the brushes are super soft, and are great!</li>
            <li>Came in mega fast!!!</li>
            <li>These are very nice but its a big set</li>
            <li>Did receive my egg brush cleaner :) as for the brushes they have this cheap feel to them and aren&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>The quality is overall pretty good!</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves do their jobs right and perfectly, but once you get them they&#x27;re a bit stiff.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, these are absolutely amazing, you get 20, just like in the picture, and they are so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The only thing I loved was they brought a makeup brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>They are good brushes for liquid only.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good brushes and the only one that broke</li>
            <li>I guess its good to have extra tho.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving them so far ‚ù§</li>
            <li>First things first, the brushes got here very quickly!</li>
            <li>Overall i strongly recomend!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and all of the brushes are versatile and there has been no hair fallout either.</li>
            <li>Brushes came on time, they did have a toxic like smell to them but a quick wash took that away.</li>
            <li>I plan to spend more money and buy a better set of brushes and give these to my teenage sister.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is super as well.  </li>
            <li>My eyeshadows come on perfectly and cleaning time is so simple with the brushing egg!!(Much larger</li>
            <li>One more thing, don&#x27;t expect 20 pieces of different brushes, I believe some styles have 2 for each one, which is even better for me because i&#x27;m just adding to what I already have anyway.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very nice and the product arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>Overall I was very pleased and would definitely&lt;br /&gt;purchase</li>
            <li>Not worth the money, quality isn&#x27;t great and they do give you two of the save brushes</li>
            <li>and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>You get your moneys worth</li>
            <li>I liked how the handles were wooden</li>
            <li>The package came a day early, was supposed to be here tomorrow, but boy am I glad they came today.</li>
            <li>They are soft and after washing the smell is much better.</li>
            <li>Because honestly, they are only like $10.</li>
            <li>To many brushes to choose from, for make up experts as well as for the inexperienced ones just like me :)))  </li>
            <li>the handles are good and the bristles are soft, perfect for the face unlike other cheap brushes with hard bristles.</li>
            <li>but i wash all my brushes before using them anyway, no shedding but one of the handles was lose but nothing super glue or hot glue cant fix</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impress with these make up brushes ,I love it love it ,they are so soft and easy to clean.will definitely recommend this .100%</li>
            <li>Love every single one of them strongly recommended</li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>it just slufs right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There sooo soft &amp; came pretty quickly most def recomending them to my friends</li>
            <li>Love it great quality for reasonable price came earlier then expected</li>
            <li>I recommend these to anyone looking for a good amount of brushes for less than $10</li>
            <li>These are great, I wish the double ended ones Weren&#x27;t double ended</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price, doesnt shed (so far)</li>
            <li>I got them very very fast</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I just got my eye-shadow brushes in the mail I love them, they do have a smell on them not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>Pretty too even tho</li>
            <li>Also, they haven&#x27;t shed any bristles after washing before my first use.</li>
            <li>I recieved exactly what was shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li>Chemical smell upon arrival but was gone after washing once (which I do with all my brushes after first purchasing them anyways</li>
            <li>All 20 pieces exactly what&#x27;s advertised...</li>
            <li>They do smell like chemicals or something when you first get them</li>
            <li>They arrived in separate packaging from the washing tool and the brushes were individually wrapped and then wrapped in bubble wrap so completely safe and undamaged when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>they are super soft!!</li>
            <li>When I received these it did have a very pungent paint smell, but it went right away</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and have nice sturdy wooden handles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping does take a long time so if you need these quickly it probably won&#x27;t happen but again for for the price and free shipping</li>
            <li>The concealer brush shed really bad when I used it but for the most part it was a good set!</li>
            <li>I bought these a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very decent brushes for very decent price.</li>
            <li>Super soft and dense.</li>
            <li>looove my new brushes!!</li>
            <li>beacuse i expected it to come with a bag for the brushes and it did not feeling diappointed since other sellers had beautiful color bags that held the brushes in</li>
            <li>I live new brushes!!!</li>
            <li>There my go to brushes everyday and to be so cheap there fabulous.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>only they stain easily and really have to clean to get them white again.  </li>
            <li>They work really really well.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up much product.</li>
            <li>, so this really was no hassle).</li>
            <li>so I have alot of brushes that I don&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li>Really gets the job done</li>
            <li>Much Needed, work well</li>
            <li>All in all, they&#x27;re soft enough to use and blend with and they&#x27;re good for daily makeup.</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft &amp; look like they&#x27;re good quality, but they are too firm for blending.</li>
            <li>Although the package comes with a strong sterilized scent it wont be for long if you air out the brushes!</li>
            <li>going back to break down and pay the money for good Sigma and mac brushes.</li>
            <li>I have never bought such good quality brushes for a such a low price!</li>
            <li>I do love the extra little pink hand scrubbie gift it came with, it really works great, especially when combined with beauty blender bush soap</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also many brushes of the same type, so there&#x27;s really not 20 different brushes.</li>
            <li>they should have a label or a paper saying wich ones what but otherwise fast shipping and very soft üòä</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and sleek!</li>
            <li>These are most defiantly too stiff to gently apply eye shadow blend and stuff.</li>
            <li>just like the high end brushes out there, works and does its job</li>
            <li>Most of them are really small and several are all the same size, but there were more than I wanted</li>
            <li>I new to eyebrushes</li>
            <li>I live with alot of toddlers</li>
            <li>And if they get damaged you just replace them with a new set.</li>
            <li>i like the use and they are very soft</li>
            <li>Very soft, seem durable and high quality so far.</li>
            <li>Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY.. VERY SOFT TOO..</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and pick up the product well.</li>
            <li>I did receive the pink brush cleaner since it was part of the special.</li>
            <li>and it came with an unexpected gift!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re toxic when you first individually unwrap them, you can even smell it from the bag, just wash the handle with water and a cloth.</li>
            <li>So since I obviously am the one to blame for not noticing the lack of a case and large powder brush I will give this a  4 star.</li>
            <li>stay clear</li>
            <li>As with any synthetic brush set, I noticed some hair loss in the brushes over time which was to be expected at such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>There soft but not to soft they got here in 10 days</li>
            <li>They are affordable and plus they came early.</li>
            <li>They came a day early unlike the rest of the things I ordered</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m assuming they won&#x27;t pick up too much powdered product well enough to suit my needs.</li>
            <li>Arrived 3 days early.</li>
            <li>Really professional.</li>
            <li>Items had not shipped as early as I thought,  I contacted them and a reply was spot on.</li>
            <li>they came So early</li>
            <li>dont like these brushes did not like t feel some where to soft</li>
            <li>they came 3 days early.</li>
            <li>I have some duplicates like 8 not of the same one but 5 of the same and 3 of the same they are okay but flat</li>
            <li>Just a whole lot of flat ones for your eyelid.</li>
            <li>They work well as far as I can tell so far, however I got multiple of the same ones, and they don&#x27;t detail very well.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again depending on how long they last but as of right now, it would be a yes as well.</li>
            <li>Major deal!</li>
            <li>Thats what you would usually pay for a cheap conceler brush alone.</li>
            <li>Quality Brushes - They&#x27;re SO soft, not sparse, and none of the individual strands fall out after washing!</li>
            <li>Update 09/05 bought a second set as a gift and package arrived early again.  </li>
            <li>definitely NOT for the professional.</li>
            <li>Soft hairs but sturdy enough were no hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li>So far the only one I like is the foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The brushed are soft just like on the description.</li>
            <li>I only wish there were a few more of the wider eye shadow brushes, and less of the super thin ones; but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The really suck and I didn&#x27;t get the mascara brush Ana by looking at other reviews</li>
            <li>came earlier than expected, very soft and sturdy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the 20pc brush set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing will order again</li>
            <li> Quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> they were amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> but the feel and look are amazing.</li>
            <li> The reason is because they are nice brushes they just don&#x27;t have the names in them.</li>
            <li> they look nice.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brishes.</li>
            <li> and they had a nice length to them.</li>
            <li> and they were nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> but if you are a professional and want good word of mouth for an excellent application, these are NOT the bruses,.....</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice but they don&#x27;t pick up the colors at all and don&#x27;t spread it.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun trying every brush!!!</li>
            <li> Having multiples of these brushes is great because I&#x27;ll have a clean one to use every time I paint a face.</li>
            <li> If you want a good full set though for a good price, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Very soft, and work great!!</li>
            <li> Would be perfect if they were marked for what they are for.</li>
            <li> I loved the brush egg I also got free with my order.</li>
            <li> soft, perfect and pro!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and came in great packaging!</li>
            <li> so I was super happy when I found out that there was more than one of some of the brushes</li>
            <li> I love this brushes they are soft and the brushegg is perfect and they came on time you have 20 brushes but</li>
            <li> Wow I got my brushes today and they are absolutely amazing!!</li>
            <li> Can never have too many brushes in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I also love d brushes but pls what&#x27;s the brush egg used for?</li>
            <li> Awesome same that ilustrated</li>
            <li> More for creams and liquids in my opinion just by looks and feel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> So many brushes to use that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not constantly prepping my faves over and over to use... Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes cant wait to use them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these brushs.</li>
            <li> eh, ok brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think most of them got it either.</li>
            <li> Wil be buying more</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t as many brushes as the picture makes it look.</li>
            <li> was the mascara one (the top came off)</li>
            <li> They are okay</li>
            <li> Also why so many are duplicates?</li>
            <li> The packages arrived 3 days earlier than was said to arrive and that was a great bonus!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> but i really love them</li>
            <li> I love these brush</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Love the brush egg for washing them.</li>
            <li> Many brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought I love them will buy again</li>
            <li> Love it n</li>
            <li> Up close they kind of look like drug store brushes, but the good thing is I have a set of good brushes and was just looking for some extra.</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very soft and great looking.</li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> brushes are uber soft and they do a great job.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s not the good brushes that are duplicated is why I didn&#x27;t go the whole 5 stars.</li>
            <li> What I found them good for is for my fx makeup since they apply creams very well.</li>
            <li> All my brushes are very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> But I washed them before I used them and they softened up easily and the strong plastic scent was gone.</li>
            <li> They do have a strong chemical smell,  which dispersed upon washing.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and accurate to it&#x27;s description.  </li>
            <li> Works fine does what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> Super pleased can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> Item showed up quickly!</li>
            <li> I Am Super Pleased With My Order.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to catch color.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty soft and good quality for the price !</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes especially the price!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy nice brushes</li>
            <li> You get 20 what seem to be great quality brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the free gift</li>
            <li> a free brush egg üëèüëè</li>
            <li> Great brushed.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say they are very helpful</li>
            <li> the free gift</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft and looks and smells good.</li>
            <li> These are extremely soft and good quality,  g look ad I purchased.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product the brushes are super soft, and are great!</li>
            <li> Came in mega fast!!!</li>
            <li> These are very nice but its a big set</li>
            <li> Did receive my egg brush cleaner :) as for the brushes they have this cheap feel to them and aren&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> The quality is overall pretty good!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves do their jobs right and perfectly, but once you get them they&#x27;re a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, these are absolutely amazing, you get 20, just like in the picture, and they are so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The only thing I loved was they brought a makeup brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> They are good brushes for liquid only.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good brushes and the only one that broke</li>
            <li> I guess its good to have extra tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving them so far ‚ù§</li>
            <li> First things first, the brushes got here very quickly!</li>
            <li> Overall i strongly recomend!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and all of the brushes are versatile and there has been no hair fallout either.</li>
            <li> Brushes came on time, they did have a toxic like smell to them but a quick wash took that away.</li>
            <li> I plan to spend more money and buy a better set of brushes and give these to my teenage sister.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is super as well.  </li>
            <li> My eyeshadows come on perfectly and cleaning time is so simple with the brushing egg!!(Much larger</li>
            <li> One more thing, don&#x27;t expect 20 pieces of different brushes, I believe some styles have 2 for each one, which is even better for me because i&#x27;m just adding to what I already have anyway.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and the product arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Overall I was very pleased and would definitely&lt;br /&gt;purchase</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, quality isn&#x27;t great and they do give you two of the save brushes</li>
            <li> and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> You get your moneys worth</li>
            <li> I liked how the handles were wooden</li>
            <li> The package came a day early, was supposed to be here tomorrow, but boy am I glad they came today.</li>
            <li> They are soft and after washing the smell is much better.</li>
            <li> Because honestly, they are only like $10.</li>
            <li> To many brushes to choose from, for make up experts as well as for the inexperienced ones just like me :)))  </li>
            <li> the handles are good and the bristles are soft, perfect for the face unlike other cheap brushes with hard bristles.</li>
            <li> but i wash all my brushes before using them anyway, no shedding but one of the handles was lose but nothing super glue or hot glue cant fix</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impress with these make up brushes ,I love it love it ,they are so soft and easy to clean.will definitely recommend this .100%</li>
            <li> Love every single one of them strongly recommended</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> it just slufs right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There sooo soft &amp; came pretty quickly most def recomending them to my friends</li>
            <li> Love it great quality for reasonable price came earlier then expected</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone looking for a good amount of brushes for less than $10</li>
            <li> These are great, I wish the double ended ones Weren&#x27;t double ended</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price, doesnt shed (so far)</li>
            <li> I got them very very fast</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I just got my eye-shadow brushes in the mail I love them, they do have a smell on them not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Pretty too even tho</li>
            <li> Also, they haven&#x27;t shed any bristles after washing before my first use.</li>
            <li> I recieved exactly what was shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Chemical smell upon arrival but was gone after washing once (which I do with all my brushes after first purchasing them anyways</li>
            <li> All 20 pieces exactly what&#x27;s advertised...</li>
            <li> They do smell like chemicals or something when you first get them</li>
            <li> They arrived in separate packaging from the washing tool and the brushes were individually wrapped and then wrapped in bubble wrap so completely safe and undamaged when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> they are super soft!!</li>
            <li> When I received these it did have a very pungent paint smell, but it went right away</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and have nice sturdy wooden handles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping does take a long time so if you need these quickly it probably won&#x27;t happen but again for for the price and free shipping</li>
            <li> The concealer brush shed really bad when I used it but for the most part it was a good set!</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very decent brushes for very decent price.</li>
            <li> Super soft and dense.</li>
            <li> looove my new brushes!!</li>
            <li> beacuse i expected it to come with a bag for the brushes and it did not feeling diappointed since other sellers had beautiful color bags that held the brushes in</li>
            <li> I live new brushes!!!</li>
            <li> There my go to brushes everyday and to be so cheap there fabulous.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> only they stain easily and really have to clean to get them white again.  </li>
            <li> They work really really well.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up much product.</li>
            <li> , so this really was no hassle).</li>
            <li> so I have alot of brushes that I don&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li> Really gets the job done</li>
            <li> Much Needed, work well</li>
            <li> All in all, they&#x27;re soft enough to use and blend with and they&#x27;re good for daily makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft &amp; look like they&#x27;re good quality, but they are too firm for blending.</li>
            <li> Although the package comes with a strong sterilized scent it wont be for long if you air out the brushes!</li>
            <li> going back to break down and pay the money for good Sigma and mac brushes.</li>
            <li> I have never bought such good quality brushes for a such a low price!</li>
            <li> I do love the extra little pink hand scrubbie gift it came with, it really works great, especially when combined with beauty blender bush soap</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also many brushes of the same type, so there&#x27;s really not 20 different brushes.</li>
            <li> they should have a label or a paper saying wich ones what but otherwise fast shipping and very soft üòä</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and sleek!</li>
            <li> These are most defiantly too stiff to gently apply eye shadow blend and stuff.</li>
            <li> just like the high end brushes out there, works and does its job</li>
            <li> Most of them are really small and several are all the same size, but there were more than I wanted</li>
            <li> I new to eyebrushes</li>
            <li> I live with alot of toddlers</li>
            <li> And if they get damaged you just replace them with a new set.</li>
            <li> i like the use and they are very soft</li>
            <li> Very soft, seem durable and high quality so far.</li>
            <li> Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY.. VERY SOFT TOO..</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and pick up the product well.</li>
            <li> I did receive the pink brush cleaner since it was part of the special.</li>
            <li> and it came with an unexpected gift!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re toxic when you first individually unwrap them, you can even smell it from the bag, just wash the handle with water and a cloth.</li>
            <li> So since I obviously am the one to blame for not noticing the lack of a case and large powder brush I will give this a  4 star.</li>
            <li> stay clear</li>
            <li> As with any synthetic brush set, I noticed some hair loss in the brushes over time which was to be expected at such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> There soft but not to soft they got here in 10 days</li>
            <li> They are affordable and plus they came early.</li>
            <li> They came a day early unlike the rest of the things I ordered</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m assuming they won&#x27;t pick up too much powdered product well enough to suit my needs.</li>
            <li> Arrived 3 days early.</li>
            <li> Really professional.</li>
            <li> Items had not shipped as early as I thought,  I contacted them and a reply was spot on.</li>
            <li> they came So early</li>
            <li> dont like these brushes did not like t feel some where to soft</li>
            <li> they came 3 days early.</li>
            <li> I have some duplicates like 8 not of the same one but 5 of the same and 3 of the same they are okay but flat</li>
            <li> Just a whole lot of flat ones for your eyelid.</li>
            <li> They work well as far as I can tell so far, however I got multiple of the same ones, and they don&#x27;t detail very well.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again depending on how long they last but as of right now, it would be a yes as well.</li>
            <li> Major deal!</li>
            <li> Thats what you would usually pay for a cheap conceler brush alone.</li>
            <li> Quality Brushes - They&#x27;re SO soft, not sparse, and none of the individual strands fall out after washing!</li>
            <li> Update 09/05 bought a second set as a gift and package arrived early again.  </li>
            <li> definitely NOT for the professional.</li>
            <li> Soft hairs but sturdy enough were no hairs are falling out.</li>
            <li> So far the only one I like is the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The brushed are soft just like on the description.</li>
            <li> I only wish there were a few more of the wider eye shadow brushes, and less of the super thin ones; but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The really suck and I didn&#x27;t get the mascara brush Ana by looking at other reviews</li>
            <li> came earlier than expected, very soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package they did smell a little like paint as other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> i experienced no shedding and they do have an odor but not as bad as the reviews say, they just smell like they just came from a factory thats all!</li>
            <li> Visual check after wash and none of the brushes changed from or were loose.</li>
            <li> but these were different then expected.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes much earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> They Came In Earlier Than Expected Which Is A Plus.</li>
            <li> These brushes are all soft yet firm and dense.</li>
            <li> Got them a bit early and I got all of them they smell a bit toxic and some of the brush strings are like sticking out and uneven</li>
            <li> They are long in length and it makes it a plus!</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, soft brushes, the only bad part is that the brush does not give the detail of what the brush is for.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that the quality of the brushes would be ok.</li>
            <li> I was really kind of disappointed about the lack of a case.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t hold product and are soft to touch but very harsh on your face.</li>
            <li> Brushes were not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but everything came as expected and was neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they&#x27;re &amp;#34;alright&amp;#34; for the price.</li>
            <li> the only thing that is a bit confusing is what the brushes are for.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that this does not come with a blending brush.</li>
            <li> No bristles were bent, each brush was individually packaged in side a thick layer of bubble rap.</li>
            <li> down side they smell like sharpies</li>
            <li> they are black</li>
            <li> However you get what you pay for and this set was less than $10.</li>
            <li> They are plastic, hard and not particularly pliable.</li>
            <li> not as expected the bristles are hard</li>
            <li> Brush heads fall off the handle after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The only bad part would have to be how some of the brushes are double sided</li>
            <li> but i wish they  weren&#x27;t so small</li>
            <li> also the small eyeliner brush has like hard tips</li>
            <li> The only brushes that are useless to me are the thin ones with a few bristles used for liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t as bad and still just as soft!</li>
            <li> Hard bristles.</li>
            <li> and I know a couple people complained about a smell</li>
            <li> These brushes sucks.</li>
            <li> I would like that they come with some instructions, I mean according to the size which one I need to use.</li>
            <li> The brushes are basically all the same, I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought these to up my make up game.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately none of the shadow brushes pick up pigment well and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sad</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it</li>
            <li> hey, hate to do it</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality for the price and a nice add on to my collection. Can never have too many brushes in my opinion.</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Remember to wash before use ladies and gents!</li>
            <li> I gave the brushes a three  star. The reason is because they are nice brushes they just don&#x27;t have the names in them. I new to eyebrushes and if they had their name on them it would be easier for me to use them</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, soft brushes, the only bad part is that the brush does not give the detail of what the brush is for.</li>
            <li> There soft but not to soft they got here in 10 days I like them but i wish they  weren&#x27;t so small</li>
            <li> Came in mega fast!!! Super pleased can&#x27;t wait to use them I live new brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes came on time, they did have a toxic like smell to them but a quick wash took that away. Visual check after wash and none of the brushes changed from or were loose. Its a 20pc set, I actually received an extra brush.  Would be perfect if they were marked for what they are for. Brushes are very soft and sleek! Great buy</li>
            <li> the only thing that is a bit confusing is what the brushes are for. i ordered thinking they were just makeup brushes but these were different then expected. i like the use and they are very soft i just don&#x27;t use every brush.</li>
            <li> The concealer brush shed really bad when I used it but for the most part it was a good set!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes especially the price! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> they should have a label or a paper saying wich ones what but otherwise fast shipping and very soft üòä</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t hold product and are soft to touch but very harsh on your face. It looked like there would be a blending brush, but there isn&#x27;t. I plan to spend more money and buy a better set of brushes and give these to my teenage sister.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Brushes were not what I expected.</li>
            <li> i like them but it has repeated brushes</li>
            <li> These are good quality and I know a couple people complained about a smell but I didn&#x27;t have that problem! I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> You get your moneys worth</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product the brushes are super soft, and are great! They are affordable and plus they came early. I was spectacle about ordering them but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. The brushes work great for all my make-up needs</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected. They work well as far as I can tell so far, however I got multiple of the same ones, and they don&#x27;t detail very well. All in all great for the price, though.</li>
            <li> Item showed up quickly! Was exactly as described. Was packaged very nicely and I was&lt;br /&gt;happy with the price. Overall I was very pleased and would definitely&lt;br /&gt;purchase from this seller again in the future. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy nice brushes</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best. Most of them are really small and several are all the same size, but there were more than I wanted so I can&#x27;t complain too much. If you want a good full set though for a good price, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Came in on time, just like the picture. I love them! Very soft, seem durable and high quality so far. I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> great brushes. only they stain easily and really have to clean to get them white again.  but do-able.</li>
            <li> Very decent brushes for very decent price.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and accurate to it&#x27;s description.  Looking forward to using the set.</li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;re great. You get what you paid for so no complaining here. They came a day early unlike the rest of the things I ordered so that&#x27;s a big plus. Would purchase again depending on how long they last but as of right now, it would be a yes as well.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes much earlier than I expected. I also love d brushes but pls what&#x27;s the brush egg used for?</li>
            <li> They work really really well.</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes today. I love them! Came two days earlier as well.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! So glad I bought these!!</li>
            <li> I Am Super Pleased With My Order. They Came In Earlier Than Expected Which Is A Plus. The Smell Isn&#x27;t That Bothersome &amp; The Brush Cleaner Made Me Extremely Happy LOL. I Would Definitely Repurchase From Them Again !</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago and I am very pleased with my purchase. You get 20 what seem to be great quality brushes for a low price. I only wish there were a few more of the wider eye shadow brushes, and less of the super thin ones; but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping does take a long time so if you need these quickly it probably won&#x27;t happen but again for for the price and free shipping I couldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the free gift</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are great to use for your eye shadow</li>
            <li> Love it great quality for reasonable price came earlier then expected üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü</li>
            <li> Awesome same that ilustrated</li>
            <li> I just got my eye-shadow brushes in the mail I love them, they do have a smell on them not a big deal to me. One thing I had to label each one to what they are used for, plus it comes with a makeup cleaning brush so that&#x27;s a plus. Really good brushes. Pretty too even tho they are black they look nice.</li>
            <li> Did receive my egg brush cleaner :) as for the brushes they have this cheap feel to them and aren&#x27;t as good as I expected. they do the job after 3-4 applications of eyeshadow. upside is they were all individually packaged üëçüèª</li>
            <li> great deal for all these brushes! The brushes are soft and good quality. they come individually wrapped for sanitation. the handles are good and the bristles are soft, perfect for the face unlike other cheap brushes with hard bristles. Major deal! s glad i have them a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impress with these make up brushes ,I love it love it ,they are so soft and easy to clean.will definitely recommend this .100%</li>
            <li> Perfect for playing in make up</li>
            <li> Arrived waaaay before it said it was going to and it came with an unexpected gift! Nice quality brishes. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased these brushes they the best.</li>
            <li> First things first, the brushes got here very quickly! These brushes are all soft yet firm and dense. I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet but I&#x27;m assuming they won&#x27;t pick up too much powdered product well enough to suit my needs. More for creams and liquids in my opinion just by looks and feel. Great quality in terms of production because I tried taking the ferrules off of the double-ended brushes. I&#x27;m not a fan of dual-sided brushes so I had to resort to heating them up with a lighter to remove them. Also, they haven&#x27;t shed any bristles after washing before my first use. The brushes did have a somewhat noxious smell but that&#x27;ll dissipate over time. I liked how the handles were wooden and they had a nice length to them. Having multiples of these brushes is great because I&#x27;ll have a clean one to use every time I paint a face. The only brushes that are useless to me are the thin ones with a few bristles used for liquid eyeliner. The rest I&#x27;ll definitely use, especially with eyes, seeing how this set is focused on that area of makeup. I received 20 brushes, as stated in the item description and I&#x27;m satisfied with my order. I recommend these to anyone looking for a good amount of brushes for less than $10 and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Thank you!</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these. They don&#x27;t bring any brushes to blend your eyeshadows. Just a whole lot of flat ones for your eyelid. Different sizes. They don&#x27;t pick up much product. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. The only thing I loved was they brought a makeup brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! The brushes are very nice and the product arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are pretty good. I loved the brush egg I also got free with my order.</li>
            <li> Love!! Makes my life easier especially in wedding and formal season... So many brushes to use that I&#x27;m not constantly prepping my faves over and over to use... Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Didn&#x27;t come with the instructions that were pictured on the website but these are very good for the price</li>
            <li> All my brushes are very nice and soft.The tool is wonderful.</li>
            <li> soft, perfect and pro!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes and the price cant be beat!</li>
            <li> Works fine does what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> These are great, I wish the double ended ones Weren&#x27;t double ended but oh well I got what I paid for!</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft &amp; look like they&#x27;re good quality, but they are too firm for blending. There&#x27;s also many brushes of the same type, so there&#x27;s really not 20 different brushes. Other than that, they&#x27;re &amp;#34;alright&amp;#34; for the price.</li>
            <li> Quality Brushes - They&#x27;re SO soft, not sparse, and none of the individual strands fall out after washing! I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t cost like, 15 dollars more!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes cant wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;There sooo soft &amp; came pretty quickly most def recomending them to my friends</li>
            <li> I love these brushs. There my go to brushes everyday and to be so cheap there fabulous.  I would recommend these brushs to anybody</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and came in great packaging! I recieved exactly what was shown in the pictures. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Arrived 3 days early. The brushes are great quality and this is a really great deal! I bought these to up my make up game. Heh heh. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Amazing products!!! Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I got this set for all the shadow brushes that came with it. Unfortunately none of the shadow brushes pick up pigment well and when I tried to apply the shadow to my eyes, the powder fell off the brush and pigments fell unto my cheeks. All these brushes are good for something though, they work well as concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing will order again</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Sturdy handle, no hairs fall out. Easy to clean, easy to catch color. Chemical smell upon arrival but was gone after washing once (which I do with all my brushes after first purchasing them anyways, so this really was no hassle). I do love the extra little pink hand scrubbie gift it came with, it really works great, especially when combined with beauty blender bush soap (just do NOT use hand scrubbie on a beauty blender, it will tear instantly! Just use the soap!). Quality exceeded a price! Recommended.</li>
            <li> came earlier than expected, very soft and sturdy. down side they smell like sharpies but i wash all my brushes before using them anyway, no shedding but one of the handles was lose but nothing super glue or hot glue cant fix</li>
            <li> They came waaay before I was expecting them and im very happy with the brushes</li>
            <li> I got them very very fast and they were nicely packaged. No bristles were bent, each brush was individually packaged in side a thick layer of bubble rap. The quality is overall pretty good!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that the quality of the brushes would be ok. Some id probably throw away after a handful of uses. Boy was  I was wrong! These brushes are soft and have nice sturdy wooden handles. When I first opened the package they did smell a little like paint as other reviews have mentioned. I just washed them and the smell was gone within minutes. Definitely a great deal. Update 09/05 bought a second set as a gift and package arrived early again.  Smell wasn&#x27;t as bad and still just as soft!</li>
            <li> Horrible product! I am a makeup artist and the Brushes are NOT for powder eyes shadows. They are good brushes for liquid only. I was so disappointed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t hold any of my makeup!</li>
            <li> eh, ok brushes. definitely NOT for the professional. They are plastic, hard and not particularly pliable. They don&#x27;t hold any product ....it just slufs right off. I hate to admit it but you do get what you pay for.....going back to break down and pay the money for good Sigma and mac brushes. hey, hate to do it but if you are a professional and want good word of mouth for an excellent application, these are NOT the bruses,.....stay clear</li>
            <li> I love  these  brushes they work  great!</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice but they don&#x27;t pick up the colors at all and don&#x27;t spread it. you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> just like the high end brushes out there, works and does its job</li>
            <li> Wow! For the price I paid, i totally got a deal for these brush sets. Quality is amazing. Really professional. And for the price? Its definately a steal. ORDER THESE! i promise you will be satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;I looove my new brushes!!</li>
            <li> beacuse i expected it to come with a bag for the brushes and it did not feeling diappointed since other sellers had beautiful color bags that held the brushes in</li>
            <li> I was really kind of disappointed about the lack of a case. Up close they kind of look like drug store brushes, but the good thing is I have a set of good brushes and was just looking for some extra. Not something that I would get for regular, constant use.</li>
            <li> Ordered on July 16 and got the package on the 20th so that&#x27;s very good. Brushes are really soft and looks and smells good. I recommend that u try fro this seller, great service! All 20 pieces exactly what&#x27;s advertised... üëç</li>
            <li> The really suck and I didn&#x27;t get the mascara brush Ana by looking at other reviews I don&#x27;t think most of them got it either. The brushes are basically all the same, I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;d buy here again</li>
            <li> They are perfect... Wil be buying more</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty soft and good quality for the price ! They came a day before the estimated delivery date. They do smell like chemicals or something when you first get them but once you wash them they&#x27;re good to go !</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup bushes. Very soft and great looking. I love them. The price is great to.</li>
            <li> I would like that they come with some instructions, I mean according to the size which one I need to use.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes they are soft and the brushegg is perfect and they came on time you have 20 brushes but the only brush i didn&#x27;t like was the sponge applicator but  i think its a great set of brush</li>
            <li> Love every single one of them strongly recommended</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, quality isn&#x27;t great and they do give you two of the save brushes</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! They are very very extremely beautiful and work amazing! I will order again soon!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to try them out yet but everything came as expected and was neatly packaged. I did receive the pink brush cleaner since it was part of the special. Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t as many brushes as the picture makes it look. They&#x27;re good brushes and the only one that broke was the mascara one (the top came off) they were amazing for the price. Recommend.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE GREAT FOR ALL THE NEEDS OF YOUR EYES ESPECIALLY.. VERY SOFT TOO..</li>
            <li> The package came a day early, was supposed to be here tomorrow, but boy am I glad they came today. They&#x27;re toxic when you first individually unwrap them, you can even smell it from the bag, just wash the handle with water and a cloth. Nonetheless, these are absolutely amazing, you get 20, just like in the picture, and they are so soft to the touch. I definitely recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> Super soft and dense. NO shedding</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes!! Just like I wanted/needed! Very soft, and work great!!</li>
            <li> I live with alot of toddlers so my brushes get chewed up all the time so I was super happy when I found out that there was more than one of some of the brushes, they work great and have held together well too. And for the price I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> They are okay I have some duplicates like 8 not of the same one but 5 of the same and 3 of the same they are okay but flat</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who thought a powder brush would be part of this set? Also why so many are duplicates? It&#x27;s too sad I didn&#x27;t notice this stuff before I ordered. Such as no carrying pouch. However you get what you pay for and this set was less than $10. The packages arrived 3 days earlier than was said to arrive and that was a great bonus! They arrived in separate packaging from the washing tool and the brushes were individually wrapped and then wrapped in bubble wrap so completely safe and undamaged when they arrived. They are soft and after washing the smell is much better. So since I obviously am the one to blame for not noticing the lack of a case and large powder brush I will give this a  4 star. The fact that it&#x27;s not the good brushes that are duplicated is why I didn&#x27;t go the whole 5 stars.</li>
            <li> 5 stars from me. Because honestly, they are only like $10. Thats what you would usually pay for a cheap conceler brush alone. I am extreamly impressed with how quickly they were shipped and delivered! Awesome service, great product. As a aspiring MUA these will work perfectly with my clients. And the brush cleaner scruby thing works amazing! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> not as expected the bristles are hard</li>
            <li> These are extremely soft and good quality,  g look ad I purchased. They do have a strong chemical smell,  which dispersed upon washing.  Their customer service is super as well.  Items had not shipped as early as I thought,  I contacted them and a reply was spot on. My item came 2 days after shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes!!!! But one of them lost it hair when i washed them. I thing the glue used was a low quality oneüòÅ but i really love them</li>
            <li> Let me just say these brushes are a must! Soft hairs but sturdy enough were no hairs are falling out. They are long in length and it makes it a plus! My eyeshadows come on perfectly and cleaning time is so simple with the brushing egg!!(Much larger then you think) the brushing egg almost reaches the width of youre palm. Although the package comes with a strong sterilized scent it wont be for long if you air out the brushes! Overall i strongly recomend!! You get more for what you pay!&#x27; shipping is a breeze!!</li>
            <li> These are very nice but its a big set so I have alot of brushes that I don&#x27;t really use. I guess its good to have extra tho. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Got them a bit early and I got all of them they smell a bit toxic and some of the brush strings are like sticking out and uneven but they all are like good and I&#x27;m good to have them in there even duplicates and also the small eyeliner brush has like hard tips so you have to wash them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s here I love these brush ordered 2 sets nd a free brush egg üëèüëèüëèüòòüíÑ  must buy for the price it took lik a week they came So early</li>
            <li> they are super soft!! I love them!! I just got it in the mail today and haven&#x27;t use them but the feel and look are amazing. i experienced no shedding and they do have an odor but not as bad as the reviews say, they just smell like they just came from a factory thats all! One more thing, don&#x27;t expect 20 pieces of different brushes, I believe some styles have 2 for each one, which is even better for me because i&#x27;m just adding to what I already have anyway. Great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for doing all sorts of eye make up and came quickly</li>
            <li> Love the 20pc brush set! Really gets the job done</li>
            <li> I love them. and thank you for the gift. I feel spoil lol.. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Great brushed.  Wash them before you use them and the smell will disappear instantly.</li>
            <li> These are most defiantly too stiff to gently apply eye shadow blend and stuff. What I found them good for is for my fx makeup since they apply creams very well. And if they get damaged you just replace them with a new set. Multiples of each brush. Love the brush egg for washing them.</li>
            <li> To many brushes to choose from, for make up experts as well as for the inexperienced ones just like me :)))  I am having so much fun trying every brush!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves do their jobs right and perfectly, but once you get them they&#x27;re a bit stiff. But I washed them before I used them and they softened up easily and the strong plastic scent was gone. The only bad part would have to be how some of the brushes are double sided so when you&#x27;re storing them in a bowl or a cup, one brush will have to touch the bottom. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and all of the brushes are versatile and there has been no hair fallout either. I would buy again and recommend to a friend. A heads up though, there is no traditional blender brush in this set!</li>
            <li> Many brushes. Good price. Nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes because they were synthetic and as a vegan, it means a lot to me when companies choose synthetic materials to create their products. As with any synthetic brush set, I noticed some hair loss in the brushes over time which was to be expected at such a cheap price. All in all, they&#x27;re soft enough to use and blend with and they&#x27;re good for daily makeup. I would recommend this to someone who is learning to use eye palettes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are incredibly soft and high quality. I have never bought such good quality brushes for a such a low price! Will buy again üëçüëç</li>
            <li> Awesome set&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are uber soft and they do a great job. Considering the price, this is a steal</li>
            <li> Wow I got my brushes today and they are absolutely amazing!! I would definitely buy them again!!!!</li>
            <li> When I received these it did have a very pungent paint smell, but it went right away once I washed my brushes. I have already washed them twice and there is no shedding! They are very soft and pick up the product well. My only complaint would be that this does not come with a blending brush.</li>
            <li> Package came sooner then I thought I love them will buy again</li>
            <li> So far the only one I like is the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes sucks. Hard bristles. Can&#x27;t pick up anything.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Much Needed, work well</li>

            <li> You Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> dont like these brushes did not like t feel some where to soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving them so far ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç they came 3 days early. The brushed are soft just like on the description. I haven&#x27;t used them, but they are good quality for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. I can honestly say they are very helpful and they get the job done</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Been using these brushes for months!! AMAZING!! none fell apart yet!</li>
            <li> Love it n the free gift u get oh yea</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price, doesnt shed (so far) I would recommend for makeup apprentice just to practice, all in all ot gets the job done</li>
            <li> Brush heads fall off the handle after a few uses. Don&#x27;t buy this if you intend to use them often.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OK not the best but good for the price</li>
            <li> Worked great thank you</li>
