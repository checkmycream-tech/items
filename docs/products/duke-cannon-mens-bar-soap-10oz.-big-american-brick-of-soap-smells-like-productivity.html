            <li>A great deal of soap for the price as well!</li>
            <li>Best soap ever.</li>
            <li>I bought all the scents to figure out which one I like best.</li>
            <li>Also the added bonus of a portion of sale goes to support Vets is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great feel and cleaning power!  </li>
            <li>This scent is great.</li>
            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>Duke Cannon&#x27;s marketing team is great.</li>
            <li>Amazing soap!</li>
            <li>The soap has a pleasant menthol smell.</li>
            <li>Great, refreshing scent!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best part of this soap was taking it out of the box, appreciating how huge it was, and smelling it.</li>
            <li>it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>Good smell</li>
            <li>Good for relaxing shower.</li>
            <li>Great bar of soap defiantly my favorite bar.</li>
            <li>Clean rinsing, good smelling soap!</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant and refreshing without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and cleans and rinses nicely.  </li>
            <li>The product packaging is attractive and you feel good supporting troops.</li>
            <li>So far, it has lasted over a month, which is impressive, as I shower twice a day (once after gym, once after work).  </li>
            <li>Those things start to disappear right before your eyes just as soon as you try to build up a lather in a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mild scents of the Cannon bricks are perfect.</li>
            <li>It is definitely very minty, and leaves you with a very clean and refreshed feeling (and a pleasant tingle!)</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely and most importantly, rinses nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, cleans effectively, and rinses off easily without depositing any noticeable residue on my skin (like some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; bars do).  </li>
            <li>Refreshing in the morning.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a much more manageable size.  </li>
            <li>and I think this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells really lovely and</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using Duke Cannon&#x27;s soap for the better part of 4 months I believe.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve went through two bars (with one Peppermint Dr. Bronners in between) and love them.</li>
            <li>smells good and feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li>I want to love this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been through three bricks of Duke Cannon soap which I started using when I was gifted one on Christmas 2014, and here it is nearing the end of May.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this product again for sure.</li>
            <li>A man&#x27;s bar of soap and so refreshing.</li>
            <li>The oat flakes in the bar seem to be more for grip than exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Just received this today and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but the ladies will love this one too.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this hunk of soap.</li>
            <li>This was my first product tried and the pleasant scent and size of the bar</li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling when done with my shower.  </li>
            <li>The soap smell minty and lives up to its expectations of being soapy and having a clean menthol feeling!</li>
            <li>Phenomenal price the bar is huge.</li>
            <li>The sensitive and intelligent gentleman who spits fire, eats nails, and never buys his suits off the peg needs this soap.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, too, though not as long-lasting as the other Duke Cannon scents.</li>
            <li>It dissolves very quickly.</li>
            <li>The cool mint is refreshing and awakening yet not over powering.</li>
            <li>It after-scent is pleasant and not too strong, and is not so masculine that it would prevent women from also using this soap, IMHO.  </li>
            <li>And it is a HUGE bar.</li>
            <li>Great smell, but left a sticky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great soap even my 8 year old loves it worth the price not to smell &amp;#34;like a girl&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Again, this is a high quality soap, akin to the best major brands you&#x27;ll find at your supermarket or pharmacy, and well worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am pretty sure Roger Sterling uses this soap.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this bar of soap, but now it just sits neglected on my shower rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel particularly clean, refreshed, or moisturized after using this soap.</li>
            <li>but you still smell clean.  </li>
            <li>By far the best smelling, longest lasting, lathering soap I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>I received the ammo box full of Duke Cannon products for Christmas 2014.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad scent just...</li>
            <li>Scent is not bad, I will probably try another when this one is done.  </li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>The menthol has a nice scent and the grains give a nice little scrub.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and it really was a giant bar of soap!  </li>
            <li>Once I started using it, its appeal dissolved as quickly as its size.</li>
            <li>They are mildly scented.</li>
            <li>It smells good, lasts long, and it&#x27;s not designed to shave your legs with.</li>
            <li>Brick is a great description of this soap as others can hear you set it down while in the shower.</li>
            <li>packaging is funny!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent, and I love that it is a simple, no frills product.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far his favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love the size and it last a good long time, no weenie soap slivers in a week.</li>
            <li>All I know is Productivity is sitting in my shower right now</li>
            <li>Lathers very well, cuts oila nd dirt and Rinses Clean.</li>
            <li>smells of menthol and mint are not overpowering and really do smell like clean,</li>
            <li>You really feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The Menthol was cool and refreshing and the bar lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love my Duke Cannon white.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is uber manly and militant, pretty funny/cool to have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried them all - musgo real, lush dirty, outlaw soaps, Dr. Squatch, etc - this is easily the best.</li>
            <li>The bar is big and looks like it is going tho last for about 20 showers, which it pretty good.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too large to hold.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get adjusted to the large size, but will re-buy.</li>
            <li>In regards to the bars of soap:  I really like the large handful of this bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>An amazing bath experience all round.</li>
            <li>However, the whole oats aren&#x27;t don&#x27;t really add anything to the soap.</li>
            <li>Cleans you very well.</li>
            <li>I really like these Duke Cannon soaps.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really gotten excited about soap before!  </li>
            <li>I love the marketing, hands down.</li>
            <li>It is, indeed, a very large bar of soap, so I cut it in half for easier handling and to fit my soap dish.  </li>
            <li>you a new and real man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>We love all of the Duke Cannon soaps although we haven&#x27;t tried the &#x27;black&#x27; bar because reviewers have said that it stains washcloths.  </li>
            <li>A good old time soap that doesn&#x27;t leave much scum in the tub.  </li>
            <li>Now it just smells like a standard bar of soap as it quickly dwindles in size.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality soap.  </li>
            <li>skin will feel clean, never over dry, and resistant to the antiaircraft fire of Communist regimes.  </li>
            <li>They clean well and leave skin dry, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>and I love using it everyday.</li>
            <li>The white bar is best because, even though they all smell like they&#x27;re killing bugs, yhe white bar does not leave green or black soap stains in the tub/shower.  </li>
            <li>I have to chuckle at myself, because not only do I purchase my shower soap online from Amazon, I&#x27;m excited enough about the product to write a review!</li>
            <li>Fresh minty aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger long after your shower</li>
            <li>I also like this one better than their other scents as they tended to leave stains on the white shower curtain liners.</li>
            <li>Big bar, good lather with subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>A bar large enough to grab and it lasts!  </li>
            <li>BUT the same could be said of most other high quality, name brand soaps you can by at your local supermarket or pharmacy, except for the extra large size.  </li>
            <li>Not like the wimpy little tiny bars sold in most retail outlets.</li>
            <li>Hemingway would use this soap were he still alive.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the scent, it just smells like toothpaste to me...</li>
            <li>Good, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li>DIdnt last as long as expected but a great soap none the less</li>
            <li>For such a big bar of soap, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some better soaps</li>
            <li>My only gripe is the deodarant effect of the soap fades very quickly vs the Amry Green bar of Duke Cannon.</li>
            <li>The large bar of soap lasts three to four times longer than the standard 4 ounce commercial brands.  </li>
            <li>However, the soap doesn&#x27;t last long despite its large size.</li>
            <li>It definitely gets you clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or cause other issues.</li>
            <li>The dead skin and dirt come right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very average clean, I don&#x27;t feel the menthol, and I feel very dry after using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I feel compelled to now after having managed to get a little more than a month&#x27;s daily shower use out of a brick of this &#x27;Smells Like Productivity&amp;#34; Duke Cannon soap, and the bricks of &amp;#34;Army Green Victory&amp;#34; I had before it lasted even longer than that.</li>
            <li>Doesnt dry out my skin and gets the stink off my old body.  </li>
            <li>Really does wake you up a little too with the mint and menthol.</li>

            <li> The white bar is best because, even though they all smell like they&#x27;re killing bugs, yhe white bar does not leave green or black soap stains in the tub/shower.  </li>
            <li> I have to chuckle at myself, because not only do I purchase my shower soap online from Amazon, I&#x27;m excited enough about the product to write a review!</li>
            <li> Fresh minty aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger long after your shower</li>
            <li> I also like this one better than their other scents as they tended to leave stains on the white shower curtain liners.</li>
            <li> Big bar, good lather with subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> A bar large enough to grab and it lasts!  </li>
            <li> BUT the same could be said of most other high quality, name brand soaps you can by at your local supermarket or pharmacy, except for the extra large size.  </li>
            <li> Not like the wimpy little tiny bars sold in most retail outlets.</li>
            <li> Hemingway would use this soap were he still alive.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the scent, it just smells like toothpaste to me...</li>
            <li> Good, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li> DIdnt last as long as expected but a great soap none the less</li>
            <li> For such a big bar of soap, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some better soaps</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the deodarant effect of the soap fades very quickly vs the Amry Green bar of Duke Cannon.</li>
            <li> The large bar of soap lasts three to four times longer than the standard 4 ounce commercial brands.  </li>
            <li> However, the soap doesn&#x27;t last long despite its large size.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets you clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or cause other issues.</li>
            <li> The dead skin and dirt come right off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very average clean, I don&#x27;t feel the menthol, and I feel very dry after using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel compelled to now after having managed to get a little more than a month&#x27;s daily shower use out of a brick of this &#x27;Smells Like Productivity&amp;#34; Duke Cannon soap, and the bricks of &amp;#34;Army Green Victory&amp;#34; I had before it lasted even longer than that.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry out my skin and gets the stink off my old body.  </li>
            <li> Really does wake you up a little too with the mint and menthol.</li>
            <li> I usually manage to go through even the biggest bars of all the most common brands in a week or two max.</li>
            <li> The soap is a block shape and the edges are a little sharp at first.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long a</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Productivity&amp;#34; scented bar, and I have used exactly half of it so far.  </li>
            <li> Last a long time and doesn&#x27;t get mushy like other smaller soap bars.</li>
            <li> Lathers really well and lasts a little longer than your average bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> It washes off completely no residue.</li>
            <li> The soap cleans well, lathers well but leaving red &amp;#34;track&amp;#34; marks down my arms isn&#x27;t something I need to add to my extensive collection of track marks.  </li>
            <li> They are big bars, so I cut them in half to last longer.</li>
            <li> It smells minty, feels invigorating on the skin, and lasts longer due to its massive size.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t made it too dry.</li>
            <li> Some complained that it dries you out, but I don&#x27;t notice this particular problem.  </li>
            <li> This brick of masculine cleanliness delivers a rich lather that is never dainty or prissy.</li>
            <li> The worst part is the menthol (that I wanted as a nice way to wake up in my morning shower) only lasted for the first few showers.</li>
            <li> It sounds like Excalibur going back in its sheath or Thor setting his hammer down with nonchalance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying other Duke Cannon products!</li>
            <li> Will definitely try the other scents!</li>
            <li> It seems to last about the typical number of uses for its size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of Duke Cannon soaps for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve tried all the different ones</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that the grains, which I believe are there to help with grip, are more annoying than anything.  </li>
            <li> It feels really awkward at first, especially if you are used to the shower gels.  </li>
            <li> This was not like any other I have tried before.  </li>
            <li> Smell is kinda mediciney, and bar alittle too big for comfort... should be round, edges too ruff!</li>
            <li> Duke Cannon makes a good soap but this one smells like the nasty chalk breath-mints you get at the pay-stand at Denny&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am a 6&#x27;4 lumberjack who cuts down trees with his bare hands, but the whole oats when you hit one, is a bad time on your skin.</li>
            <li> But then again, Doc B is gone in about a week and a half of showering.</li>
            <li> half its size.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> For the record I slightly prefer the Army Green Victory version over the Smells Like Productivity.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband but will admit to having used it a few times when I ran out of soap.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> It beats handling a small 4 ouncer.  </li>
            <li> I do not find the oats too hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product sucks, don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> The sharp grains in the soap is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really exfoliate and at worst</li>
            <li> I guess this company thinks if they say it does, put some other stupid logos all over a catchy box we&#x27;ll believe it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Clean rinsing, good smelling soap!</li>
            <li> Big fan of this soap. Peppermint/Menthol smell too it. Refreshing in the morning.Lathers very well, cuts oila nd dirt and Rinses Clean. My only gripe is the deodarant effect of the soap fades very quickly vs the Amry Green bar of Duke Cannon. But still a 5 star product. Lasted about 5 weeks for me of Daily showers. Sometimes 2 a day.</li>
            <li> The bar is a bit unwieldy when intact - I actually quartered mine and it&#x27;s a much more manageable size.  This scent is great.</li>
            <li> I have to chuckle at myself, because not only do I purchase my shower soap online from Amazon, I&#x27;m excited enough about the product to write a review! This soap is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of Duke Cannon soaps for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve tried all the different ones and I think this one is my favorite. It smells minty, feels invigorating on the skin, and lasts longer due to its massive size. It definitely gets you clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or cause other issues.</li>
            <li> Forget the slimy stuff, &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34;, anything with pictures of coconuts or flowers, anything advertised with &amp;#34;essence of&amp;#34; and do what I did. Quit mooching from your gal&#x27;s shower supplies, grow up, be a man, and buy this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is what it is. A big chunk of soap. It smells good, lasts long, and it&#x27;s not designed to shave your legs with. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it really was a giant bar of soap!  Some complained that it dries you out, but I don&#x27;t notice this particular problem.  I enjoy the scent, and I love that it is a simple, no frills product.  My only complaints are that the grains, which I believe are there to help with grip, are more annoying than anything.  So far, it has lasted over a month, which is impressive, as I shower twice a day (once after gym, once after work).  I will definitely be trying other Duke Cannon products!</li>
            <li> Grow up and get some!  Yes, it&#x27;s big. Yes, the oatmeal is exfoliating.  Yes, it&#x27;s designed for men, not for &amp;#34;non-men.&amp;#34;  So grow up, grow some, and get some!</li>
            <li> This soap is big. Really, really big. Brick is a great description of this soap as others can hear you set it down while in the shower. It sounds like Excalibur going back in its sheath or Thor setting his hammer down with nonchalance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure Roger Sterling uses this soap. Hemingway would use this soap were he still alive. Robert Mitchum used this soap on the set of &amp;#34;Thunder Road&amp;#34; and in jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells of menthol and mint are not overpowering and really do smell like clean, Kaizen productivity rather than chemicals like the body washes of non-men.  This brick of masculine cleanliness delivers a rich lather that is never dainty or prissy. Don&#x27;t like those seeds in there? Well, too bad Sunshine because they exfoliate the skin and make you a new and real man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will feel clean, never over dry, and resistant to the antiaircraft fire of Communist regimes.  The sensitive and intelligent gentleman who spits fire, eats nails, and never buys his suits off the peg needs this soap.</li>
            <li> Smells really lovely and packaging is funny!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Duke Cannon&#x27;s soap for the better part of 4 months I believe. And I&#x27;ve went through two bars (with one Peppermint Dr. Bronners in between) and love them. Personal opinion here, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent. I mean it&#x27;s great! No doubt about it, but I feel like Dr. Bronners Peppermint edges Duke Cannon out with the minty/menthol scent and feeling. But then again, Doc B is gone in about a week and a half of showering. Maybe I&#x27;m at a standstill.... All I know is Productivity is sitting in my shower right now and I love using it everyday. Enough said.</li>
            <li> smells good and feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap.  I want to eat this soap it smells so good.  I actually look forward to my morning shower. It lathers well and cleans and rinses nicely.  The bar is big and looks like it is going tho last for about 20 showers, which it pretty good.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap! One of the only soaps that leave my skin feeling moisturized! Even suds up nice in cold water. A great deal of soap for the price as well! The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the scent, it just smells like toothpaste to me... Not a bad scent just... Not quite what I was expecting! Will definitely try the other scents!</li>
            <li> I received the ammo box full of Duke Cannon products for Christmas 2014.  In regards to the bars of soap:  I really like the large handful of this bar of soap.  It beats handling a small 4 ouncer.  The white bar is best because, even though they all smell like they&#x27;re killing bugs, yhe white bar does not leave green or black soap stains in the tub/shower.  The large bar of soap lasts three to four times longer than the standard 4 ounce commercial brands.  I also like the idea that some profits go to veteran/military groups as a benefit.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend as he loves Duke Cannon soaps.  This one is by far his favorite.  Great, refreshing scent!  One bar lasts months!</li>
            <li> We love all of the Duke Cannon soaps although we haven&#x27;t tried the &#x27;black&#x27; bar because reviewers have said that it stains washcloths.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I want to love this soap. I love the marketing, hands down. The soap has a pleasant menthol smell. However, the whole oats aren&#x27;t don&#x27;t really add anything to the soap. They don&#x27;t really exfoliate and at worst they can actually hurt. I am a 6&#x27;4 lumberjack who cuts down trees with his bare hands, but the whole oats when you hit one, is a bad time on your skin. The soap cleans well, lathers well but leaving red &amp;#34;track&amp;#34; marks down my arms isn&#x27;t something I need to add to my extensive collection of track marks.  Needless to say, this soap is marketed like a boss. It smells like a cough drop. It cleans like 2 chains but I don&#x27;t take showers to inflict pain on myself. Once again, I can just whip myself or something.</li>
            <li> DIdnt last as long as expected but a great soap none the less</li>
            <li> As with all Duke Cannon soaps, this is a winner.</li>
            <li> A bar large enough to grab and it lasts!  Not like the wimpy little tiny bars sold in most retail outlets.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this bar of soap, but now it just sits neglected on my shower rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s way too big. I understand this is one of it&#x27;s &amp;#34;appeals&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s too large to hold. You just end up dropping this brick-sized bar of soap all the time or fumbling with it.&lt;br /&gt;2) It dissolves very quickly. For such a big bar of soap, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some better soaps half its size.&lt;br /&gt;3) I don&#x27;t feel particularly clean, refreshed, or moisturized after using this soap. It&#x27;s a very average clean, I don&#x27;t feel the menthol, and I feel very dry after using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this soap was taking it out of the box, appreciating how huge it was, and smelling it. Once I started using it, its appeal dissolved as quickly as its size.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband but will admit to having used it a few times when I ran out of soap. It is definitely very minty, and leaves you with a very clean and refreshed feeling (and a pleasant tingle!) Smells wonderful, too, though not as long-lasting as the other Duke Cannon scents.</li>
            <li> Never would I have imagined myself writing a review about a soap. but I feel compelled to now after having managed to get a little more than a month&#x27;s daily shower use out of a brick of this &#x27;Smells Like Productivity&amp;#34; Duke Cannon soap, and the bricks of &amp;#34;Army Green Victory&amp;#34; I had before it lasted even longer than that. I&#x27;ve now been through three bricks of Duke Cannon soap which I started using when I was gifted one on Christmas 2014, and here it is nearing the end of May. I&#x27;m amazed. I usually manage to go through even the biggest bars of all the most common brands in a week or two max. Those things start to disappear right before your eyes just as soon as you try to build up a lather in a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mild scents of the Cannon bricks are perfect. For the record I slightly prefer the Army Green Victory version over the Smells Like Productivity. I&#x27;m never going back to using a sissy soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really gotten excited about soap before!  This was not like any other I have tried before.  The Menthol was cool and refreshing and the bar lasted a long time.  I will be purchasing this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but left a sticky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smell is kinda mediciney, and bar alittle too big for comfort... should be round, edges too ruff!</li>
            <li> This was my first product tried and the pleasant scent and size of the bar it encouraged me to try others..</li>
            <li> Of all the Duke Cannon soaps, and I&#x27;ve tried all five, this is the one that&#x27;s going to be regularly purchased. An amazing bath experience all round.</li>
            <li> The soap smell minty and lives up to its expectations of being soapy and having a clean menthol feeling!</li>
            <li> Great soap even my 8 year old loves it worth the price not to smell &amp;#34;like a girl&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A good old time soap that doesn&#x27;t leave much scum in the tub.  The soap is a block shape and the edges are a little sharp at first.  I would buy it again without hesitation .</li>
            <li> I am no soap expert, but I bought this because it says it smells like peppermint, well it doesn&#x27;t. I guess this company thinks if they say it does, put some other stupid logos all over a catchy box we&#x27;ll believe it. This product sucks, don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Best soap ever. Love the size and it last a good long time, no weenie soap slivers in a week.</li>
            <li> I like the soap. The menthol has a nice scent and the grains give a nice little scrub. It doesn&#x27;t last as long a you would think though.</li>
            <li> Cleans you very well. The dead skin and dirt come right off. I will only use this soap now. Smell like a champ too.</li>
            <li> Good, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry out my skin and gets the stink off my old body.  Price points on the per bar price is steep versus the actual manufacturers combo deals.</li>
            <li> Love my Duke Cannon white.  A man&#x27;s bar of soap and so refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Good smell</li>
            <li> I really like these Duke Cannon soaps. They are mildly scented. They clean well and leave skin dry, non-greasy. I have dry skin and it hasn&#x27;t made it too dry. Used on the face, it seems to reduce wrinkles. They are big bars, so I cut them in half to last longer. The oat flakes in the bar seem to be more for grip than exfoliate. I bought all the scents to figure out which one I like best.</li>
            <li> Just received this today and absolutely love it.  It feels really awkward at first, especially if you are used to the shower gels.  Lathers nicely and most importantly, rinses nicely as well.  Nice clean feeling when done with my shower.  Scent is not bad, I will probably try another when this one is done.  And it is a HUGE bar.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried them all - musgo real, lush dirty, outlaw soaps, Dr. Squatch, etc - this is easily the best. Scent is pleasant and refreshing without being overpowering. Really does wake you up a little too with the mint and menthol. Phenomenal price the bar is huge. The packaging is uber manly and militant, pretty funny/cool to have in the bathroom. Buy it, you&#x27;ll end up buying again.</li>
            <li> Duke Cannon&#x27;s marketing team is great. The product packaging is attractive and you feel good supporting troops. However, the soap doesn&#x27;t last long despite its large size. The sharp grains in the soap is unpleasant. The worst part is the menthol (that I wanted as a nice way to wake up in my morning shower) only lasted for the first few showers. Now it just smells like a standard bar of soap as it quickly dwindles in size.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Productivity&amp;#34; scented bar, and I have used exactly half of it so far.  It is, indeed, a very large bar of soap, so I cut it in half for easier handling and to fit my soap dish.  I have used it only in the shower.  This is a high quality soap.  It lathers well, cleans effectively, and rinses off easily without depositing any noticeable residue on my skin (like some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; bars do).  It after-scent is pleasant and not too strong, and is not so masculine that it would prevent women from also using this soap, IMHO.  It seems to last about the typical number of uses for its size.  BUT the same could be said of most other high quality, name brand soaps you can by at your local supermarket or pharmacy, except for the extra large size.  The oatmeal flakes seem too few in number to contribute anything much of anything to scrubbing or cleaning effectiveness, or to the claimed &amp;#34;grip ability.&amp;#34;  Again, this is a high quality soap, akin to the best major brands you&#x27;ll find at your supermarket or pharmacy, and well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Fresh minty aroma that doesn&#x27;t linger long after your shower but you still smell clean.  Lathers really well and lasts a little longer than your average bar of soap.  Transform your daily ritualistic shower into an invigorating experience of your senses with this soap. Is it manly? Yes but the ladies will love this one too.  I would walk a mile to take a shower with this soap.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Shipment went as planned</li>
            <li> Great bar of soap defiantly my favorite bar. The cool mint is refreshing and awakening yet not over powering. Last a long time and doesn&#x27;t get mushy like other smaller soap bars. Get this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Big bar, good lather with subtle scent.  Good for relaxing shower.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this hunk of soap. I do not find the oats too hard on my skin. You really feel clean after using it. It washes off completely no residue. Also the added bonus of a portion of sale goes to support Vets is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Duke Cannon makes a good soap but this one smells like the nasty chalk breath-mints you get at the pay-stand at Denny&#x27;s. Wife likes the smell though so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Great feel and cleaning power!  It takes a while to get adjusted to the large size, but will re-buy.</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling, longest lasting, lathering soap I&#x27;ve found! I also like this one better than their other scents as they tended to leave stains on the white shower curtain liners.</li>
