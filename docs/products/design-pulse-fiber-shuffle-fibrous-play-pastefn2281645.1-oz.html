            <li>THIS PASTE WORKS GREAT AND KEEPS MY HAIR LOOKING GREAT ALL DAY LONG...</li>
            <li>Needed more couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t that many different fiber hair products and this one was the best value.</li>
            <li>too many words required.</li>
            <li>I struck out many times until I discovered this product.  </li>
            <li>Use this and the rock n hold gel at the same time and your hair will look awesome...</li>
            <li>this product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years, and it is the best styling  paste I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Soooo glad I could find this online, because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>He used to use Axe and it was OK.  </li>
            <li>I also have not been able to replicate the &amp;#34;spider web&amp;#34; technique with any of the four containers from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin-ish, wavy-ish, fine hair that needs product to make it look okay.  </li>
            <li>This is the most fabulous product for my hair</li>
            <li>Makes it look like it&#x27;s full of volume!</li>
            <li>An easy 10 all around.</li>
            <li>This particular product isn&#x27;t nearly as good as Pravana in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Great product...smells good and just plain works!  </li>
            <li>Discovered this stuff through my local salon, works great.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>, it holds, it looks natural, it has a matte finish, and it smells great, plus its fun to play with)    </li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and after reading another review about fine hair</li>
            <li>This is a great one and doesn&#x27;t flake or get too sticky or stiff :)</li>
            <li>Especially good for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The texture is a bit like glue and when mashed between the fingers several times turns into a spider web-like substance that gives really good hold and support for 15+</li>
            <li>the styling of the jar is very masculine (and I&#x27;m very not!), and c) the minty smell was an interesting surprise and took a little while to get used to, but it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>It is sticky on your hands, but works great in keeping your hair neat without giving your hair that greasy look that other hair gels leave.</li>
            <li>That stiffness quickly wears off after it is used.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I usually do not use hair gels.</li>
            <li>It also rinses out really easily and isn&#x27;t harsh, while maintaining a good hold.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to wash out - doesn&#x27;t take multiple shampooing to get out - my hair is squeaky clean after one shampoo cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I have never had this much body in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product if you want a little lighter feel.</li>
            <li>So far, I have found that is works great when my hair is short</li>
            <li>The texture and consistency seems to change from container to container, with some being more chunky and less sticky while others have been more runny and glue-like.</li>
            <li>I received some of this in the mail a long time ago as a sample and instantly liked it.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a natural hold look that was soft to the touch (no crunchiness or greasiness) and a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Mix a tiny bit of water with it when applying and works better than gel.</li>
            <li>I used Redken Rewind 06 styling paste for years - it kept the wave in and static out of my hair, and one jar would last me months - but I&#x27;ve been searching for a more economical product for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Apply the Rock n Hold first and then the fiber..</li>
            <li>It sticky at first but once in the hair you can&#x27;t even see it.  </li>
            <li>I hope I will be able to find it while my last order of 2 jars are used up.</li>
            <li>I was first turned onto this fiber paste by my girlfriend&#x27;s friend at Beauty Brands.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m still happy with this fiber paste, but I&#x27;m not loving it like I did with the first container.</li>
            <li>Not a firm hold, but does a nice job separating the hair for short funky styles.</li>
            <li>It gives it so much body and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for me, and has no hold</li>
            <li>so he doesn&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>but the paste works really well with my hair</li>
            <li>OK for it&#x27;s intended purpose as long as you realize that 1) the hold is quite soft and 2) moisture or a humid afternoon will undo your styling.  </li>
            <li>Vavoom&#x27;s Fiber Paste looks pretty natural once it dries</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, it applies easily, works into hair wet, damp, or dry.</li>
            <li>I am looking for a good fiber product similar to one I used to use by Abba a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair short and you can style it easily after your hair is dry (and it stays) with this paste.</li>
            <li>The whole idea of fiber for me was that it has a natural (not wet)</li>
            <li>This fiber shuffle works great when my hair is wet, but I can also use it dry hair to tame my wild hair!</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend that much on such a small amount, I turned to Amazon and found I could get more than twice as much of this Design Pulse for only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>and I am able to re-shape it a little bit later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW  </li>
            <li>and she recommended it for a soft, natural looking hold.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for my hair - short, straight and thick - Shuffle gives it the boost it needs and holds without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>I get up with my hair looking decent enough to go out without having to \\&quot;do my hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>He has coarse Italian hair and is very fussy but loves this product and swears by it!</li>
            <li>This is the exact same paste my hairdresser uses, and at a lesser price than the beauty suppliers!</li>
            <li>I have super fine, thin flat hair.</li>
            <li>(seriously this stuff is amazing, its loose</li>
            <li>The hold isn&#x27;t as good as I remember, and I often have to go back for a second round of touch-ups for hairs that didn&#x27;t quite stay in place or are losing their hold after a few hours.</li>
            <li>No flaking when it gets dry and easy to reactivate with a little water in the hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many false hopes before, b)</li>
            <li>It only takes a very small amount to make my hair really have a much fuller look and the lift that it needs.</li>
            <li>and when it is first put in your hair it is fairly stiff.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and loose but it holds whatever shape I place into my hair.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on thin, fine, lifeless hair (mine).</li>

            <li> Works wonders on thin, fine, lifeless hair (mine).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your hair in place and not feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> (I am Indian) but it always just falls flat unless there is some product.</li>
            <li> With Design Pulse by Matrix, I never have to worry about my hair going flat.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I thought it would be as good as my regular and was a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> And if I do end up running my fingers through my hair during the day, I simply run a wet hand over my hair and everything is back in place.  </li>
            <li> I am so afraid that I will soon not be able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Firm like gel, but still soft on the hair.</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to market this for a long long time as I plan to use it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to others and as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase</li>
            <li> I like this gel, it lasst a long time and was resonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and like to rough it up</li>
            <li> I considered buying other products such as Axe hair gel</li>
            <li> I keeping trying other products found in stores but keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> I recommend applying a dab of it through your hair after your hair is dry or almost dry.</li>
            <li> I put it on almost dry hair and then rub and massage it on my scalp, wait a minute or two.</li>
            <li> It can be applied with wet or dry hair and as long as I don&#x27;t touch my hair a lot, everything stays put all day long.  </li>
            <li> enough product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but also keeps it from getting all frizzy.</li>
            <li> Was more expensive than I can usually get it in a salon for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly cheaper, slightly larger, and works just as well!  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and it gives me the ability to wear my hair a little spiky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a hair product that gives me the natural and flexible hold.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be fibrous at all, and seems too wet to be a paste.  </li>
            <li> Other products leave a sticky residue on my car and couch&#x27;s headrests, but not Design Pulse.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> my husband luvs this stuff, he has very short hair and likes every hair in place without being hard to the touch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to last for at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> (1-2 inches) and works well when my hair is a little</li>
            <li> He got a little sample of this  at the hair salon</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who needs a little management for their hair.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is still sitting in the vanity after  using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Fiber Shuffle gives my hair body &amp; style  without being stiff or gooey.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too stiff and tacky.  </li>
            <li> In addition, very little hairspray is required.  </li>
            <li> but it was almost $10 for a small container about 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s my hair type</li>
            <li> The jar pictured is what I usually get - it&#x27;s taller</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only hair product that my son will use</li>
            <li> Used it one once and loved it! Needed more couldn&#x27;t find it. Were would I be with out Amazon. Totally lost</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere but online.  great product</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for me and I like it. (Man, short hair). It starts off kinda gross, like elmers glue, but once it dries you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there - no stiffness, but keeps the style in place and no frizzes.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and after reading another review about fine hair I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;WOW WOW WOW  This is the most fabulous product for my hair I have ever used.  It gives it so much body and&lt;br /&gt;I do not even need to use hairspray.  I do not have oily hair so I wash it every 4 or 5 days and do not have&lt;br /&gt;to do anything but comb it in between.  Love love love it!!!  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  YEP, I&lt;br /&gt;bought it at Amazon...</li>
            <li> Great product if you want a little lighter feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a hair product that gives me the natural and flexible hold.  My look is over.  This stuff works great, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Discovered this stuff through my local salon, works great. Mix a tiny bit of water with it when applying and works better than gel. Firm like gel, but still soft on the hair. No flaking when it gets dry and easy to reactivate with a little water in the hand.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my hair.  I have super fine, thin flat hair. Fiber Shuffle gives my hair body &amp; style  without being stiff or gooey. It makes styling a breeze as well as  gives my hair memory. I get up with my hair looking decent enough to go out without having to \\&quot;do my hair\\&quot;.  Actually in place of a daily shampoo - I now only shampoo every 2 - 3 days.  In addition, very little hairspray is required.  At this point in time - I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  I hope they continue to market this for a long long time as I plan to use it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I love this paste! I wear my hair short and you can style it easily after your hair is dry (and it stays) with this paste. I ordered 4 jars of it because I had heard they were going to discontinue making it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was a \\&quot;fiber\\&quot; when i found this on Amazon. There aren&#x27;t that many different fiber hair products and this one was the best value. So far, I have found that is works great when my hair is short (1-2 inches) and works well when my hair is a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is kind of like glue and when it is first put in your hair it is fairly stiff. That stiffness quickly wears off after it is used. I like that it is very easy to use and holds your hair where you want it. The whole idea of fiber for me was that it has a natural (not wet) look to it and you can re-style your hair later in the day. Vavoom&#x27;s Fiber Paste looks pretty natural once it dries and I am able to re-shape it a little bit later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others and as long as the price doesn&#x27;t increase I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I usually do not use hair gels. This one just takes a drop to give your hair some shape and volume. I recommend applying a dab of it through your hair after your hair is dry or almost dry. It is sticky on your hands, but works great in keeping your hair neat without giving your hair that greasy look that other hair gels leave.</li>
            <li> I have never had this much body in my fine hair.  This is really good.</li>
            <li> Was more expensive than I can usually get it in a salon for. Maybe lower the price. too many words required. this is why I don&#x27;t do reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and feel that the name of the product is misleading.  I don&#x27;t find this to be fibrous at all, and seems too wet to be a paste.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything for me, and has no hold and basically I&#x27;m just not liking this product. The smell sort of reminds me of Vick&#x27;s vapor rub which is also displeasing. I am looking for a good fiber product similar to one I used to use by Abba a few years ago.  They discontinued it and came up with something that has a similar type name or discription but isn&#x27;t even close.  I do have to say you get a lot of product for the money with this so it&#x27;s a good deal if you like the product.  For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> OK for it&#x27;s intended purpose as long as you realize that 1) the hold is quite soft and 2) moisture or a humid afternoon will undo your styling.  I have medium-long hair and this hasn&#x27;t worked well for me in the summer weather.</li>
            <li> Great product...smells good and just plain works!  Not a firm hold, but does a nice job separating the hair for short funky styles.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  Especially good for thick curly hair.  Holds well but not sticky.  I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have thin-ish, wavy-ish, fine hair that needs product to make it look okay.  I used Redken Rewind 06 styling paste for years - it kept the wave in and static out of my hair, and one jar would last me months - but I&#x27;ve been searching for a more economical product for a long time.  I struck out many times until I discovered this product.  It&#x27;s slightly cheaper, slightly larger, and works just as well!  I hesitated initially because a) I&#x27;ve had so many false hopes before, b) the styling of the jar is very masculine (and I&#x27;m very not!), and c) the minty smell was an interesting surprise and took a little while to get used to, but it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is the pickiest guy in the world.  He has coarse Italian hair and is very fussy but loves this product and swears by it!</li>
            <li> Use this and the rock n hold gel at the same time and your hair will look awesome... I promise. Apply the Rock n Hold first and then the fiber..</li>
            <li> Not as Good as used to be..</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d just paste in what I just told my friend who recommended this product to me.    Elena you are the best thing that has happened in my life , I just want to let you know that I love you. -Sincerly, My Hair. (seriously this stuff is amazing, its loose, it holds, it looks natural, it has a matte finish, and it smells great, plus its fun to play with)    It is by far the best product I have ever used in my hair, my hair is very healthy and dense (I am Indian) but it always just falls flat unless there is some product. This honestly is the best thing I have ever used in all my years. It smells fantastic, it applies easily, works into hair wet, damp, or dry. It looks natural and loose but it holds whatever shape I place into my hair. I really could rave on for days about this product, this is kind of like finding intelligent organic life on another planet to me.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same paste my hairdresser uses, and at a lesser price than the beauty suppliers! I have found the one and only place I will continue to buy this item from now on. Not to mention the speed in which I received this paste. An easy 10 all around. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son he says it is the stuff lol So guess I am happy he is and that s good</li>
            <li> this product is fabulous! Really creates great hairstyles!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years, and it is the best styling  paste I have ever used.  It is light, but holds beautifully.  Sadly, it is getting very difficult to find.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> my husband luvs this stuff, he has very short hair and likes every hair in place without being hard to the touch</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Light enough product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but also keeps it from getting all frizzy.</li>
            <li> Great hair volume no weight to hair</li>
            <li> This particular product isn&#x27;t nearly as good as Pravana in my opinion.  I purchased this because I thought it would be as good as my regular and was a little less expensive.  It is still sitting in the vanity after  using it a few times.  Doesn&#x27;t hold well-I am back to my Pravana.</li>
            <li> Soooo glad I could find this online, because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I have had short hair since 1984 and I have used only 3-4 different products. This is a great one and doesn&#x27;t flake or get too sticky or stiff :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He used to use Axe and it was OK.  He got a little sample of this  at the hair salon and he liked it. I tried to find at Target and Walmart but they didn&#x27;t carry it. He has very short hair so he doesn&#x27;t need to use much. It&#x27;s going to last for at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> Great item would order from them again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND I LIKE TO SPIKE MY HAIR. THIS PASTE WORKS GREAT AND KEEPS MY HAIR LOOKING GREAT ALL DAY LONG...</li>
            <li> I have short, spiky, hair and hate when a product fails me half way throughout the day and causes my hair to fall, or look flat.  With Design Pulse by Matrix, I never have to worry about my hair going flat.  This is one of my all-time favorite products!  It can be applied with wet or dry hair and as long as I don&#x27;t touch my hair a lot, everything stays put all day long.  And if I do end up running my fingers through my hair during the day, I simply run a wet hand over my hair and everything is back in place.  Other products leave a sticky residue on my car and couch&#x27;s headrests, but not Design Pulse.  And it&#x27;s very easy to wash out - doesn&#x27;t take multiple shampooing to get out - my hair is squeaky clean after one shampoo cleaning.  I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your hair in place and not feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I think the product is that good and I am very pleased with the results I have achieved with it.  It was recommended by a friend and I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day - it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Good...but not quite like Nick Chavez Angel wings...thank you anyway</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  I use it all the time.  I wear my hair short and it gives me the ability to wear my hair a little spiky.  It sticky at first but once in the hair you can&#x27;t even see it.  Good product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for my hair - short, straight and thick - Shuffle gives it the boost it needs and holds without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> I probably would not purchase this again personally.  I found it to be too stiff and tacky.  If you have very short hair and want it spiked then this would be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair and its amazing. However this is overpriced I bought mine from my barber and only paid $10 no way am I going to pay close to $60 for this.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever! My local beauty supply store has stopped carrying this product. I am so afraid that I will soon not be able to find it here on Amazon. I hope I will be able to find it while my last order of 2 jars are used up. It only takes a very small amount to make my hair really have a much fuller look and the lift that it needs. GREAT product for fine hair!</li>
            <li> I could not style my hair without Fiber Shuffle.  I have short hair and this is the only thing that keeps my style like I want it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.</li>
            <li> I received some of this in the mail a long time ago as a sample and instantly liked it. I was rather upset when the sample ran out because I couldn&#x27;t find anyone who sold it in my area. I considered buying other products such as Axe hair gel but it was almost $10 for a small container about 2 oz. Not wanting to spend that much on such a small amount, I turned to Amazon and found I could get more than twice as much of this Design Pulse for only a few dollars more. I am not sure if it&#x27;s my hair type but the paste works really well with my hair and you only need a small amount. It also rinses out really easily and isn&#x27;t harsh, while maintaining a good hold. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses hair gel/paste/pomade. Oh and it also smells good!.</li>
            <li> I like this gel, it lasst a long time and was resonably priced.  I recommend it for anyone who needs a little management for their hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I was very happy with the price, the ease of ordering it, and the quickness of receiving it.</li>
            <li> Best product for hair I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The jar pictured is what I usually get - it&#x27;s taller that the jar you sent, which is shallow.  Moreover, the cream is hardened.</li>
            <li> Have used it before I liked it.</li>
            <li> I was first turned onto this fiber paste by my girlfriend&#x27;s friend at Beauty Brands. I have thick hair that I wear in a faux pompadour and she recommended it for a soft, natural looking hold. My first container I bought from BB was great! It gave my hair a natural hold look that was soft to the touch (no crunchiness or greasiness) and a nice sheen. The texture is a bit like glue and when mashed between the fingers several times turns into a spider web-like substance that gives really good hold and support for 15+ hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the last four containers on Amazon and I&#x27;ve found that the paste&#x27;s quality has been a bit iffy. The hold isn&#x27;t as good as I remember, and I often have to go back for a second round of touch-ups for hairs that didn&#x27;t quite stay in place or are losing their hold after a few hours. The texture and consistency seems to change from container to container, with some being more chunky and less sticky while others have been more runny and glue-like. I also have not been able to replicate the &amp;#34;spider web&amp;#34; technique with any of the four containers from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m still happy with this fiber paste, but I&#x27;m not loving it like I did with the first container.</li>
            <li> This fiber shuffle works great when my hair is wet, but I can also use it dry hair to tame my wild hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on and off for the last couple of years. I keeping trying other products found in stores but keep coming back to this. I have short hair and like to rough it up and this gives me the hold I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on thin, fine, lifeless hair (mine). Makes it look like it&#x27;s full of volume! Just put some on your hands and rub and massage into your scalp. I put it on almost dry hair and then rub and massage it on my scalp, wait a minute or two. Instantly fuller hair! Then I finish blow drying and my hair looks great! I hope they never stop making this product!</li>
