            <li>Have received many compliments and questions about this fragrance.</li>

            <li>a very unique smell - people recognize it.</li>
            <li>far as the perfume, gorgeous smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it is original.</li>
            <li>so I thought for sure it was the real deal....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bold, sophisticated, mysterious, and sexy.</li>

            <li>The first time I smelled this, I had to get it for my wife.  </li>
            <li>please contact me if interested at gloryglory22000 at AOL com.</li>
            <li>Think adolescent boy with his first cologne.</li>
            <li>A certain sensuality that seems to whisper at you as you walk by.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is a very feminine smell</li>
            <li>and how real the bottles and boxes look.</li>
            <li>so you know it&#x27;s the real thing</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It is almost as when you apply your perfume and after many hours there is a little almost nothing smell.  </li>
            <li>I have come to like it for its strong, dark, and animalistically sensual scent.  </li>
            <li>Considering how expensive this perfume/cologne normally is, got a fantastic deal and am quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>super smell but not very stable</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, lasts a long time, and isn&#x27;t too heavy or musky.</li>
            <li>I am usually not a perfume lover, so my husband is on a ever lasting task to find something that I really like.</li>
            <li>It was soft but seductive.  </li>
            <li>My guts were right, and unfortunately this perfume doesn&#x27;t fit my taste.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance but lately I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in local stores.</li>
            <li> A woman should wear this when she wants to be a she beast, and not a pretty little thing.</li>
            <li> I wanted this perfume for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It seemed too strange and strident to be perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time I have had a poor experience with Amazon.</li>
            <li> She told me it didn&#x27;t smell the same on her as the samples I had given her previously.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last and $58 down the drain!</li>
            <li> I hesitated ordering perfume from online due to the tons of knock off&#x27;s</li>

            <li> The price is not cheap for getting nothing.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too floral nor too muskie, easily an everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is week and a few min after I put it on the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> It is like spraying with plain water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet, flowery, or delicate.  </li>
            <li> When my girl friend first put this on, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t hardly smell anything.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> this parfume is not original it doesnt smell.I wish i didnt purchase this product.Its a big dissapointment for me.Do not buy this product from this seller.You pay for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;sorry for the previous review.this parfume is original.i&#x27;ve been wearing it for a year.i will purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this perfume the scent does not last at all. I have also purchase the perfume for my friend and she express the same feel.  Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s amazon it got to be good!</li>
            <li> Good one nice I like so authentic!</li>
            <li> I opened this product and \\&quot;it smells like nothing\\&quot;.  It had literally lost it&#x27;s scent!  I tried to exchange it and was told their policy was that used item could not be exchanged.  I believe they must be getting old stock cheaply and re-selling it unless just this bottle was defective!  I will never ever buy from them again and I get almost everything on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This sent is nearly perfect.  A certain sensuality that seems to whisper at you as you walk by.  The first time I smelled this, I had to get it for my wife.  She was extremely happy with it.  This is the perfect getting dressed up and going out scent.  Drove me crazy, every time the scent drifted my direction.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a nanosecond.  It is like spraying with plain water.  Save your money or purchase where it can be returned.</li>
            <li> Great deal...!!!! Arrived on time. I love this fragrance but lately I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in local stores. I will be purchasing more here!!!! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am usually not a perfume lover, so my husband is on a ever lasting task to find something that I really like. Well, I got Bvulgari Jasmin Noir for a gift from husband on his recent trip to Europe, and before I opened the box I figured I better try it at Sephora. My guts were right, and unfortunately this perfume doesn&#x27;t fit my taste. It&#x27;s too sweet/strong for my taste, and I would like to sell to someone who truly enjoys it. It is still in sealed plastic wrap; 3.7oz; Made in Italy.  please contact me if interested at gloryglory22000 at AOL com. Thanks</li>
            <li> Every time I wear Jasmin Noir somebody tells me that I smell wonderful. The price was awsome compared to any store.</li>
            <li> One of my patients had this wonderful scent on and I asked her what it was called. When I got it I was delighted. I love this new (to me anyway) scent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> super smell but not very stable</li>
            <li> Considering how expensive this perfume/cologne normally is, got a fantastic deal and am quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when they stopped selling this perfume at Sephora.  It is a very feminine smell but I think it&#x27;s very sexy.  I get a lot of compliments and I like that it has a very unique smell - people recognize it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this perfume spray.  There is no smell.  I tried this in the department store and it is was so different.  It was soft but seductive.  Now, I can&#x27;t hardly smell anything.  It is almost as when you apply your perfume and after many hours there is a little almost nothing smell.  It seems like they diluted the perfume with water.  I even sprayed my pillow to smell it on the piece of linen versus the skin  and nothing...  Because of regulations Amazon will not take it back.  I&#x27;ll never buy another perfume here again. The price is not cheap for getting nothing.   I think this would have not happened have I had gone to a department store.  I like Amazon but I should have read their return policy with perfumes.</li>
            <li> I wanted this perfume for a long time.  Not too overpowering, a nice balance of floral and vanilla-like scents.  I LOVE IT!!  The scent is nice, lasts a long time, and isn&#x27;t too heavy or musky.</li>
            <li> i have tried this on from a sample and have tried it at the department store as well...this smelled nothing like the two</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! It&#x27;s bold, sophisticated, mysterious, and sexy. The best thing about it is that, unlike many fragrances out there, the jasmine scent lasts for HOURS! It has great staying power and is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it when my Significant other Said &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;, That&#x27;s all that mattered to me. Excellent Service and On time delivery. You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, Disappointing, Had no Idea there were two perfumes with same name.  This one is Jasmine Noir, but doesn&#x27;t hae the MON in front of it.  I thought MON JASMINE NOIR AND JASMINE NOIR where the same perfume but they are not.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Have received many compliments and questions about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I always get a lot of compliments on this perfume.  Arrived quickly in good condition.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the recipient reported that it was what she wanted and that it was a&lt;br /&gt;s advertised....</li>
            <li> I have used the fragrance before, and think it is sultry, yummy scent.&lt;br /&gt;How well a fragrance smells when used, depends on that person&#x27;s body&lt;br /&gt;chemistry.  This one works for me!!!  I always get compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Patricia</li>
            <li> When my girl friend first put this on, I was disappointed.  It&#x27;s not sweet, flowery, or delicate.  It seemed too strange and strident to be perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have come to like it for its strong, dark, and animalistically sensual scent.  A woman should wear this when she wants to be a she beast, and not a pretty little thing.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for over a year and want to wear nothing else.  I get many compliments from people asking what it is and the best compliment was from my boyfriend when he said one of his customers was wearing it and all he could think about was me.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too floral nor too muskie, easily an everyday fragrance.  I love the shower gel also for a layered smell.</li>
            <li> Tested the sample spray at ULTA Beauty Store and fell in love with the deep, sexy smell and that it lasted ALL day, I literally couldn&#x27;t quit smelling my wrist through out the day. ULTA&#x27;s price was $68, checked Amazon and ordered it for $10 less. Very disappointed with the product, spray tons of the perfume on and it doesn&#x27;t last. The smell is the same as the one at ULTA but can not smell it 5 mins later.&lt;br /&gt;***Please note there are a lot of knock off perfume dealers out there. I checked the bottom of the bottle and the box and it was made in Italy so I thought for sure it was the real deal....I hesitated ordering perfume from online due to the tons of knock off&#x27;s and how real the bottles and boxes look. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money at a Dept. Store so you know it&#x27;s the real thing and you can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.***&lt;br /&gt;As far as the perfume, gorgeous smell my husband went nuts when I put it on but again....didn&#x27;t last and $58 down the drain!</li>
            <li> The base smell is quite base. Perhaps there is some Jasmin under this musky wood, but detection would require a scent hound. If you wish to be noticed, this is your scent. Think adolescent boy with his first cologne. You&#x27;ll be noticed before you arrive and after you leave. Followed, no doubt, by curses, the opening of windows and doors, and activation of the central air fan.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the one I still have. The fragrance is week and a few min after I put it on the smell is gone. I don&#x27;t believe it is original. I should ask for my money back. :(</li>
            <li> i love this scent- it is my go to for a night on the town or inside, i always get complimented on how i smell when i wear it</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this buyer, everything is perfect. Thank you for your services. The perfume is really in a good shape.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I get a lot of compliments, and it makes me feel sexy!</li>
            <li> I will not be looking for &amp;#34;deals&amp;#34; on Amazon any more. I purchased this as a gift for my mother.  She told me it didn&#x27;t smell the same on her as the samples I had given her previously.  I tried the perfume I gave her against what I have for myself (not from Amazon), and they do not smell the same at all.  Very disappointing.  First time I have had a poor experience with Amazon.</li>
