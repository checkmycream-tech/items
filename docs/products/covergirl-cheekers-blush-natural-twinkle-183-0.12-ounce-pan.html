            <li> My favorite blush. Stays on all day! Great priced. Absolutely love Amazon subscribe and save got a love that extra 15%.</li>
            <li> Very small compact.  Light bubble gum pink is more suitable for the tween.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade, flattering on many different skin tones</li>
            <li> Best color ever very natural!!</li>
            <li> Arrived rattling around in box.  As result, it was broken.</li>
            <li> Use this color if you have blue undertones in your skin.  Look at the veins in your arms, if they look blue, use this color.  If your veins look green, use a more orangish tinted blush.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s ok.  The color is much lighter than you would expect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no wonder Cheekers Blush has stayed available for so many years!  It&#x27;s a great little blush, and very compact in size which make it great for throwing in your purse or your on-the-go makeup bag.</li>
            <li> i use this blush about 2 month and i really love it. when i ordered it i was thinking it will be so pinky, but its not. it has light pink color and i love it. perfect for light skin people.</li>
            <li> Nice color, a little lighter than expected, but the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t the best for me.  I&#x27;m very very pale and need a lighter blush.  This was a tad darker than i usually like to ware.  I will probably be giving this to my sister.  Covergirl is a good brand so i&#x27;m kinda bummed it didn&#x27;t turn out like I thought.</li>
            <li> This blush doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on very well.  Also the brush is not very good..But okay for the price.  Color is fine.</li>
            <li> I have used this blush for years and it suits me just fine. The price was&lt;br /&gt;good here and a bonus coupon for $1 was nice also.</li>
            <li> This is the only blush I use and I&#x27;m 62 years old and I have used a bunch.</li>
            <li> I may apply once more if I am going out again in the afternoon. I love the color.</li>
            <li> Ok.  Seems silly to do a review cause it really is about how well this matches your skin tone.  I have fair to medium freckled skin and it is a perfect match.  Gives a very natural &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; color.  Love it!</li>
