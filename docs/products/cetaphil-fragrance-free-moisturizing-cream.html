            <li>Also great to bring along on trips- since it serves as an all body moisturizer (body + face!)&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I tried this and while it worked great, it also cost $$$.</li>

            <li>And it&#x27;s a great price when you buy the 2 pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that great for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for my boys with excema--we use this in the summer (and Aquaphor in the winter) because it&#x27;s lighter, not greasy, and not scented.</li>

            <li>great product works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has been great.</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and keeps my skin feeling so wonderful!  </li>

            <li>I really love this product!!</li>
            <li>Longtime favorite of mine,,, wonderful!!</li>
            <li>Being able to buy two 16-ounce jars from Amazon has been great!  </li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s been a wonderful product and has had better results in its 3 weeks of usage versus the 12+ months of usage of the Aveeno Eczema product.</li>
            <li>Love  it very good .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always being asked by people what I use because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Omega liquid (2 times a day) - good for brain development, skin etc&lt;br /&gt;Chewable pro-biotic tablets (2 times a day)</li>
            <li>This cream is light weight, but works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My mother took this cream with her to hospice care; the nurses there loved it and asked where they could get it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy formula is what makes it one of the best creams available out there.</li>
            <li>I doubt its good to eat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a costly product, but Amazon always seems to come up with the best prices and free shipping for this product.</li>
            <li>So it is already a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good Choice for me.</li>
            <li>We went to the dermatologist and ask her how she kept her skin looking so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the good</li>
            <li>Good stuff,</li>
            <li>And it gives good moisture for each rub.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>It is good for the ezcema baby as it can help to relieve the dryness and keep the moisture.</li>
            <li>I used it  for both my baby and I. Good.</li>
            <li>I knew that it felt good</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that works as good as this.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I have never found a better product for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good price on this excellent moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>After going through that first jar, I looked around and Amazon seems to have the best deal.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love Cetaphil!  </li>
            <li>love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this body cream!</li>
            <li>But this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>It was amazing</li>
            <li>This is an amazing moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cetaphil is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fragrance free, and great price too.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin nice and moisturized even during the winter months.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until my loving sister who graciously donated a half-used jar to my cause that I had a chance to sample Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>This will help \\&quot;lock\\&quot; all that nice moisture</li>
            <li>What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of greasy and oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li>okay but not as good.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this to me (specifically suggesting the tub kind) and that I apply it immediately after getting out of the shower (without drying off).  </li>
            <li>i thought i got a good deal with this pack of two cetaphil moisturizing cream thinking that i will be able to save something but</li>
            <li>I scraped the top surface off and we were good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice consistency -- not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good  and better then</li>
            <li>I have nothing to lose, I am glad I did, my face is looking ten times better, and best of all, this is the most affordable cream for face and body!!!!</li>
            <li>Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face as well as my elbows kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Very clean!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a great deal of brands, and this one works quickly.</li>
            <li>and I break out in rashes and eczema, in addition to bruising very easily.</li>
            <li>I also purchased a product called CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (through [...]) and liked that much better.</li>
            <li>I tried everything, yet this cream is by far the best I have tried on her.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product on the market</li>
            <li>It is wonderful, keeps my skin hydrated and silky soft</li>
            <li>Whichever makes me sound wise and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any scent which is good if you are allergic to fragrance filled products.</li>
            <li>it is the best lotion i have found so far.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is by far the best lotion/moisturizer on the market for treatment of these problems (and we have tried many).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>The best product to use for adult and children who have skin conditions and allergic to fragrance and fabric with fragrances on it.</li>
            <li>For best results, use directly after bathing, wetting the skin or washing hands.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer by far.</li>
            <li>the good thing is i got the free shipping as i bought another item...</li>
            <li>be a chump, use your own cheaper better creams and oils -</li>
            <li>And the best part is that it isn&#x27;t nearly as goopy as most of its competitors.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that the item isn&#x27;t so good as they said.</li>
            <li>and I genuinely see a difference in her skin and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Very light, non-sticky.  </li>
            <li>Very light feel to it.</li>
            <li>and I loved the way it keeps you super moisturized without being greasy or leaving a film or anything on your body.</li>
            <li>I will add a &amp;#34;me too&amp;#34; positive comment, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face, are So cheap and work better than anything!</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent and a super deal thru Amazon !</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love Cetaphil&#x27;s face wash, but this was a dud.</li>
            <li>Quite simply the best!</li>
            <li>Well, I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>, I use it on my face mostly and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or anything.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m anal.  </li>
            <li>At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers, this cream is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>And now I am glued to this :)</li>
            <li>I Love it.  </li>
            <li>I like the cream much more than the pump moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried top name brands since like Nivea, Olay and Eucerin when they come out with something \\&quot;newer and better\\</li>
            <li>The price was also wonderful, especially for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>Excellent product and a terrific value.    </li>
            <li>Pursuant to my brother&#x27;s advice, I tried washing my face again with one of my many face washes (I think it was Clearasil or Purpose).</li>
            <li>So I used more and what do you know -</li>
            <li>B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit]] (which I use two or three times a</li>
            <li>So I tried tubs of skin cream and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>We tried both and like the cetaphil much better.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I think anyone would feel better using this.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>but I do not believe they carry it any more.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better deal in the market or drug stores.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell or taste, and is safe if baby puts her hands in her mouth after application.  </li>
            <li>I began using this after every shower (has to be the cream, not the lotion), and it&#x27;s 10x more effective than any steroid cream, UVB light, etc.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the cetaphil in the jar.  </li>
            <li>so I was focusing mostly on the wrinkles when I bought products.  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but that is with most lotions and creams...</li>
            <li>I (like most of you) am dealing with \\&quot;Snow-pocalypse 2014\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love tlhis product.</li>
            <li>Throughout the years I have tried many products, all in which haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I also love it for myself on my arms and shoulders</li>
            <li>I love these products and sent an order of Cetaphil  moisturizing cream and the Cetaphil body wash to my sister.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so much better than over marketed, yet ineffective, lotions from any of the fortune 500</li>
            <li>I love that it has no smell and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my dermatologist suggested this product.  </li>
            <li>I swim,and it is perfect for the entire body,especially after showering.</li>
            <li>It arrived safely and intact.</li>
            <li>Came just as you would buy it in the store but with a much better price</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years in my children with excellent results, however this cream that I got burned the face of my children producing them an allergy.</li>
            <li>Much better compared to the lotion.</li>
            <li>Aside from a homemade shea butter concoction my friend makes, I have never used a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion...</li>
            <li>I tried the Cetaphil lotion that comes with a pump, but this cream is much more thicker and more moisturizing than the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many well known moisturizers but never had any improvement.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li>love the softening effect and its purity.  </li>
            <li>The deal i got on amazon is better than the costco price.</li>
            <li>She loves it and bought some more for her sister and friend.</li>
            <li>She said it worked better than Eucerine that she had used before.</li>
            <li>just love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this brand because it keeps the BABY ACNE AWAY.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>We went with cetaphil and love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for years and love the way it moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>you guys better buy this at walmart so if it does not works for you</li>
            <li>I love how this works on my children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I also love that this is product is unscented.  </li>
            <li>would buy this again for sure.</li>

            <li>Feel safe for my sensative skin.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>This Cetaphil keeps them moist and feels much better.</li>
            <li>My wife prefers something thinner because she puts lotion all over her body, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see</li>
            <li>They make anything they are in more spreadable.</li>
            <li>: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative.</li>
            <li>Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it.</li>

            <li>lOVE</li>
            <li>I tried many lotions and creams but they either didn&#x27;t work or the fragrances in them irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I love all the products &amp; contiue to use them.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cetaphil for many years and now my husband uses it at times.  </li>

            <li>Cetaphil does SOOOOOOOO much better at calming the rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to stop using my prescription gel because the rosacea has all but disappeared since I started using this cream on my face.  </li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say her skin has improved significantly.  </li>
            <li>I tried the lotion and the face wash and honestly nothing special.</li>

            <li>It is pretty good.  </li>

            <li>In college, I used to get blotches and dry skin from even the best moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is fragrance-free and doesn&#x27;t compete with a light touch of my favorite perfume or scented hand cream.</li>
            <li>It is such a good deal, the reason I like it is that there is no smell, and it can make your face really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price and more!</li>
            <li>I was using Aveeno&#x27;s Baby Eczema which was fine, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting better.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>MY SKIN HAS NEVER BEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.</li>

            <li>Super greasy, doesn&#x27;t sink in easily and it clogs pores!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free which is great for me since I&#x27;m sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, esp.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy with no smell.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay for my skin, so I decided to try out this cream too (since Cetaphil products have been known as good treatment for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>so far Cetaphil and Eucerin are the best of its category, not to mention they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick and perfect for those of us on Accutane.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get told all the time that I look much younger than I am, and also that my skin is beautiful....</li>
            <li>This cream helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li>This lasts a long time and feels so good after I put it on!</li>
            <li>the cheap ones work fine.)</li>
            <li>They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>notice a huge difference if we skip it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream that doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it</li>
            <li>I do not consider this cream overly oily and find that I get great results applying it immediately after toweling off following showering.  </li>
            <li>I have used many lotions but this is well worth you trying it.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>I liberally apply this after showering to keep my skin smooth &amp; moisturized through the day.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product for the people like me who are suffering from eczema.</li>
            <li>It functions to condition and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant.</li>
            <li>They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I used the steroid cream on my son, and it worked, but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my skin areas prone to dryness like hands, feet and elbows, yet it’s even gentle enough for my face.</li>
            <li>Creams are far more effective than lotions</li>
            <li>This product is also good for sensitive skin for kids as well.....</li>
            <li>So it is very economical as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful in all days.</li>
            <li>This product was originally suggested by my dermatologist to help with my very dry skin, and after I&#x27;ve been delighted with it!</li>
            <li>It was so well worth the effort in finding the Cetaphil cream!  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this cream after the first try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li>It works great, does just what it says and nothing it doesn&#x27;t, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>The package is worth to buy!</li>
            <li>Very safe, natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very safe, natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cetaphil brand cream never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is great for healing dry skin and plus its oderless.</li>
            <li>This is really a great product for my son, and has eliminated the dry patches.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry and combo skins.  </li>
            <li>Like many people out there, my face is fairly sensitive to most face washes.</li>
            <li>old had moderate eczema, and after 1 or 2 uses, we had a baby with very beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs better and appears to keep his sensitive skin better moisturized than the lotion version.  </li>
            <li>Great for outdoor hands or fighting winter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li>Most importantly though, it doesn&#x27;t burn and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for the dry spots like your elbow and knee area.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known Cetaphil for quite a while, and this is by far the most appropriate moisturizing cream for my daughter who have eczema since birth.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil has been great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream does a great job and keeps my skin from getting dry and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wipe the greasy layer off when it gets to that stage, and my skin is still super smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is good but not thick enough for the kind of moisturizing I need.  </li>
            <li>I have very healthy, super soft skin because of it.</li>
            <li>Super rich cream that goes on smooth and melts into skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great product for my baby&#x27;s dry skin!</li>
            <li>I have very dry hands in the Winter, after applying they feel great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for super dry hands in the winter months.</li>
            <li>The only thing you need to be careful of and pay attention to is that you best make sure your hands are clean before you dig in..</li>
            <li>it is the perfect moisturizer for the delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>but when its put on, it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it.</li>
            <li>so happy I finally found something that works well with my sensitive skin and acne. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use this on areas like elbows and knees because it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li>I love and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>(that said, I only use a gel blush and maybe some powder) and it has a good ranking on the Environmental Working Group site (I think a 2 or 3) and contains no parabens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil:</li>
            <li>A welcome relief for very dry skin!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But it is quickly absorbed/dried up, leaving my skin feel nice and natural.  </li>
            <li>Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well.  </li>
            <li>This is really good for my skin and every person who has tried it agrees with my many words on this subject.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and it is really important for me to find the right lotion.</li>
            <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis, and the treatment is a mild cortizone cream during break outs.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I&#x27;m pretty sure the hot weather is a contributing</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing Cream.  </li>
            <li>My Granddaughters use this for everything along with Cetaphil gentle facial wash, they think this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Worthy product</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non–greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to me for my mild eczema.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in quickly and well, doesn&#x27;t interfere with any make up</li>
            <li>I figure if I get a good running start now, I can look more youthful even as my body has other plans ;)</li>
            <li>CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend, but Cetaphil is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>you so very much!</li>
            <li>Very Very Very Recommend this Product!</li>
            <li>This product is decent if your skin is mildly dry, but it doesn&#x27;t effectively heal the skin of the moderate-high dry-flaky kind.</li>
            <li>I have used many face moisturizers, and all of them make my face break out, I was just giving up trying new things.</li>
            <li>She said that if a product comes in a pump bottle or is called a lotion, it won&#x27;t do the job - they may feel good but your skin is still going to crack and bleed if you&#x27;ve got seriously dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and it did a good job of keeping the leg from being completely dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several creams and I love this one!</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>Originally purchased to help with my grandson&#x27;s excema, now the whole family uses it!</li>
            <li>I even use this as a facial moisturizer, and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt better!</li>
            <li>I have eczema and my dermatologist recommended I use Cetaphil Moisturizine Cream or Eucerin Calming Cream, I ordered both and liked the Cetaphil cream better because it felt less oily.</li>
            <li>This is woooonnnderful!&lt;br /&gt;It has a non greasy feel, doesnt leave skin sticky, lathers and absorbs really nicely and quick enough for my toddler to get her clothes on post bath time.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly so you can get dressed right after applying.</li>
            <li>I was using cheap moisturizers for over 2 years and they didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>It is really fragrance free (</li>
            <li>I should get a free ones by now for getting so much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing this Cetaphil cream is.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>but nothing is better than this one so far.  </li>
            <li>Being reluctant to use even more cortisone stuff, I decided instead to lavishly and frequently apply  cetaphil in an effort to avoid them.  </li>
            <li>Being the nice non-compliant patient that I am, I never bothered to actually look up the product and try it out.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the  money.</li>
            <li>Though costly, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love it for me and my young sons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this.</li>
            <li>I am now 68 and everyone comments on my skin and says how clear and mostly wrinkle-free it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Little on the costly side but worth it... I purchased a 2 pack</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to use natural stuff</li>
            <li>(It does have a trace of a scent in the jar -- not artificial, but just like anything, it has something of a scent.</li>
            <li>if you have any skin problems, or even if you don&#x27;t, its so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li>It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a more natural cream</li>
            <li>It does get absorbed very fast so the greasiness is mild and temporary.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>A large tank, used method Body Milk Hand Cream, feeling pretty good, sometimes long face acne, it is also used, can repair, second days is very magical, will consider it has been used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite rich but doesn not feel greesy, as the cream is very aborbant and leaves a fresh feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better because it moisturizes my face a lot better than the other.      </li>
            <li>This is my first facial moisturizer, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love it more than any other cream.</li>
            <li>This cream is light enough for every day use and effective enough to keep our dry skin in great condition.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you to try cetaphil if you or your love ones are suffering from dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>Moistens my hands and feet right up.  </li>
            <li>and when I use this it soaks right into my skin to leave it feeling softer and moister.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil works right away.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the speed it was absorbed into your skin, on the other hand however, it did not \\&quot;last\\&quot; as long in the skin as i anticipated.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for Sensitive Dry Skin.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and put a finger full of Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream on afterwards.</li>
            <li>observation, which is more of a tip than a point against this product, is to make sure you keep the lid tight.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t soak her for a long time, but I do make sure she&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li>You can see the difference right after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing for my ultra dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and super gentle.</li>
            <li>It goes on a tad bit greasy if you use too much, but it quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>It dissolves quickly and doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.</li>
            <li>Great price here compared to regular big box stores-especially with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Recommended by one of my docs, I use it morning and evening on my legs, and it definitely is effective for helping them avoid dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thick, feels nice going on, doesn&#x27;t burn, and kept my skin unbelievably healthy.</li>
            <li>Very good  for dry skin  lasts a long time  inexpensive</li>
            <li>The first use of the product, down effect can also be suitable for everyday use!If the price is able to offer some better!</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis, and this cream keeps my skin moisturized very, very well.</li>
            <li>I then went on to use a natural product with calendula, which I thought was better than the Aveeno product (and which I still use and would highly suggest).  </li>
            <li>Most of all, it moisturizes my skin, especially in the winter months where the heater drys out skin and makes it itchy and flaky.  </li>
            <li>It also has NO smell at all, no weird chemical smells or anything.</li>
            <li>At first it felt a bit greesy</li>
            <li>Also, my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The cream may feel a bit oily when first applied.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, the effect lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li>Great long lasting moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>(A lot of people will tell you that eczema is aggravated by hot weather.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to recommend comfortable cotton clothing and frequent clothing</li>
            <li>My make up now looks better, I actually glow</li>
            <li>My psoriasis has improved by a lot since I first began using this product.</li>
            <li>Just great cream, not sticky or too thick.</li>
            <li>Teenage daughters, wife and I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They obviously require me to use a moisturizer every day and this was the one I selected because the alternative, Vaseline, is just too greasy and while it may be a better moisture barrier, Vaseline has always seemed to insulate my body heat which makes me itch</li>
            <li>I use it on my lips when the skin is peeling off - it instantly calms the flaking skin better than any lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I wake up with really soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Better than any generic from drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Very supple on skin and moisture protecting!</li>
            <li>After my first use I was in love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years.</li>
            <li>Really does what it says!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my skin within the first week.</li>
            <li>I first tried this lotion when I was visiting my parents in Chicago.</li>
            <li>Love this cream for my entire body.  </li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>And, this is the first time I order this pack from this merchant.</li>
            <li>We tried Aquaphor as well, but the texture seemed to clog his skin more than actually help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful for Cetaphil!  </li>
            <li>I actually like this better than the cetaphil pump lotion.  </li>
            <li>feel soft and comfortable when applying it on face and body.&lt;br /&gt;baby</li>
            <li>Just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like Avon or oil of OLE.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different ones and</li>
            <li>I find this is much better than any chapstick or similar product.</li>
            <li>decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is safe enough to be consumed internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene</li>
            <li>This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermatologist at first and a jar in every room in the house now.</li>
            <li>Great for these extra dry winters.  </li>
            <li>works great on dry skin, and although it is sold locally, I prefer to buy it here to get a 2 pack....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also true that if you do hot yoga you may not be able to hold your arms, feet, legs or other body part when using this product.</li>
            <li>So far, this cream has not disappointed me in any way.</li>
            <li>I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe &amp; vera.</li>
            <li>My 2 yo suffering allergy and her skin get irritate easy and cetaphil is the only cream that works for her eczema, we have tried a lot of other brand but this cream is magic!</li>
            <li>(I heard positive things about this)&lt;br /&gt;Cataphil cream (2 times a day -  once in the morning before daycare</li>
            <li>No other word can say, it is very useful for our famalily.</li>
            <li>I pretty much tried everything, including the ointment prescribed by the doctor.  </li>
            <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body and for the first time ever, I have an even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that dries quickly in the winter months if I do not moisturize.  </li>
            <li>After five days my skin is super soft and my dermatitis is fading away.  </li>
            <li>These attributes of the cream make it ideally suited for dry, sensitive skin and symptoms of dry skin associated with eczema</li>
            <li>have used for years but may have found a better cream for my dry heels.</li>
            <li>The pump kind feels watered down and do not offer as much protection as the cream.  </li>
            <li>and this is moisturizing yet super gentle and leaves my arms and legs feeling soft like a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li>Psoriasis is a condition wherein certain areas of your body, the skin matures at a very accelerated pace.</li>
            <li>truly believe the above combo is helping out, but I need to give a huge credit to CETAPHIL.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I had applied too much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soothing to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It is light enough to use anytime--under makeup or before bed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to use the medicated ointment, because of the cortizone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life, and followed me to adulthood.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like this cream as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell much like anything.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream is that you can purchase it almost anywhere, and it is much cheaper than a lot of the more expensive creams out there that, in my experience, don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The price here is so much lower than anywhere else</li>
            <li>stuff really works.</li>
            <li>The fact that Cetaphil is fragrance free is just another big plus.</li>
            <li>I have had psoriasis for decades and it really does the job.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline did nothing but burn and the smell is really pungent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that I can do anything about it.  </li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy, and has the same reputation as the Cetaphil washing lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the information, &amp;#34;Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has quality humectants, emollients and occlusive agents that provide intense, long–lasting hydration.</li>
            <li>I use it with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser to cleanse my skin before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Tried it on and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sticky with fast absorption.</li>
            <li>I missed it so much.</li>
            <li>Not too oily, soaks in fast and works well.</li>
            <li>I used to have very dry/ashy skin before, but after using this product for awhile,  my skin is no longer dry/irritated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since stopped buying on amazon since it&#x27;s so much cheaper at Costco.</li>
            <li>After that, I could use any cleanser and this would moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me though, because I put it on at night.</li>
            <li>I have used cetaphil for my whole family.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it, and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>otherwise this will cost me too much....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and really sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory over three years use.</li>
            <li>But after putting it on, I can&#x27;t really detect it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that .</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you use it consistently, it really improves the condition of your skin.</li>
            <li>Really has no smell and is not sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li>On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li>This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages.</li>
            <li>This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages.</li>
            <li>It really helps ease itching and flakes.</li>
            <li>Very multipurpose.  </li>
            <li>There is a light fragrance that goes away shortly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>And it really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon&#x27;s pricing on this 2pack is very competitive with what I&#x27;ve seen in the drugstores</li>
            <li>Then my sister kindly pointed out with minimum name-calling and moderate eye-rolling that I was using way not enough of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>After many different skin moisturizers for my sensitive skin, I stopped at this one to balance my skin type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy, good in the winter and in the summer.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t billed as a wrinkle cream, but when I use it on my face and compare to other facial lotions, I see a better result from Cetaphil in smoothing the fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>We live in a hot and humid climate so her flare-ups occur often.  </li>
            <li>so 2 for $20 is about right as far as price.</li>
            <li>This product is truly fragrance-free and does not cause an allergic reaction on my skin like so many other products do.</li>
            <li>I used it head to toe throughout my pregnancy and it relieved the itching much better than any other cream i tried.  </li>
            <li>literaly no smell unlike many other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and doesn&#x27;t make me itchier, like many other creams do.  </li>
            <li>All other lotions I try seemed to aggravate his skin more than help it..</li>
            <li>It is clean and light with no strong perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>Rubs into the skin, I always buy this kind because it seems to last a long time too.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to feel good going on, yet absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a thick cream that is fragrance and dye free, which is great since my little one is allergic to dyes and fragrances.</li>
            <li>In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately \\&quot;breathe.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;People argue that the ingredients may be the same as regular moisturizers found elsewhere; however, the right formulation is important for absorption and skin protection.</li>
            <li>There are great applications for each of those but as a general moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make itchiness worse and really seems to moisturize gently, Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream does the trick.</li>
            <li>Oddly the place that I can tell the most difference is in my neck as I don&#x27;t have that crepeiness</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a tub/large container with a wide mouth that is easy to access.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin after and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>had really dry hands and tried all kinds of products before I sound this produce.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it lasts forever if you use it for mainly your face.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I not had any type of reaction to this product, but my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream I have found that keeps my skin soft and free of \\&quot;winter rash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have never noticed a &#x27;greasy feeling&#x27; after using this cream and haven&#x27;t had a film build up on my skin; as I stated above, my skin soaks it up quickly.</li>
            <li>routine for my daughter consists of regular quick baths and lots of hydration.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my entire body soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Over and above, the Cetaphil moisturizing cream is mild and does not leave a oily feel after the application.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried everything, having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions, but they weren&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno</li>
            <li>Cetaphil was the only thing so far that keeps him moist and rash free</li>
            <li>and I particularly appreciate that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars, because it is decent against mild-dryness, but that&#x27;s the limit of Cetaphil&#x27;s capability.</li>
            <li>My condition is related to chemotherapy, but this product is super - hydrating, and may be applied everywhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis).</li>

            <li>When I don&#x27;t use this product, my face gets really dry like it usually does, but it works great when I use it.</li>
            <li>We also highly recommend the cream versus the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Even high end moisturizers didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling this supple and piable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d splurge a little in my mission to become better friends with my skin.</li>
            <li>I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry.</li>
            <li>In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol:</li>
            <li>In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol:</li>
            <li>Though not a medicine, Cetaphil&#x27;s action has done much to alleviate the discomfort that I used to bear.</li>
            <li>The cream feels light and wet between your fingers.  </li>
            <li>The cream just feels better and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This product truly works for dried skin, eczema, and more.</li>
            <li>and I normally need hypoallergenic cosmetics/skin care products</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the jar will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizing cream, but I seem to detect a slight fragrance although it is definitely not scented.</li>
            <li>I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin,</li>
            <li>I put it on right after a shower and it lasts until my next shower.  </li>
            <li>I was suffering from very dry skin and skin allergies and this product was the only thing that didn&#x27;t irritate it even more.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely fragrance free as advertised and also doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling as long as you don&#x27;t slather too much on at once.</li>
            <li>well, you can live with it, like a fish:</li>
            <li>cannot live with out my cetaphil.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders on my new baby who has eczema.  </li>
            <li>Since I also live in LA, my skin dries out rapidly in our desert climate.</li>
            <li>I bought cetaphil for my new born daugther.</li>
            <li>at begining, it was used for my new baby.</li>
            <li>My children can&#x27;t live a week without cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>This cream is totally non-irritating and totally fragrance free.</li>
            <li>My skin is super dry</li>
            <li>Have super dry skin and Cetaphil moisturizing cream helps to keep it moist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very inexpensive, and hydrates my skin like no other cream has.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have to watch what I put on it.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that reacts severely to a number of chemicals found in a lot of skincare products.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized all the time.</li>
            <li>Even though I have very sensitive skin, I use cetaphil on my face too.</li>
            <li>I have very, very, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Her dry patches are pretty much all gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products at many price points, including some extremely expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Tried a number of products in the past experiencing many caveats.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually got me to write a review.  </li>
            <li>My doctor turned me on to this cream when I was 31 because I was breaking out on my face and it has worked better than any other moisturizer for me for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>Keep it on a hot window sill and then shake it open like champagne in a rap video, mouth aggressively agape.  </li>
            <li>I think the next step is going to be a pediatric dermatologist, but I&#x27;m waiting for the summer weather to be over first to see if there&#x27;s improvement.  </li>
            <li>I first tried using the Cetaphil facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it makes your face really soft when you wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li>Quite recently was the first time i ever used CETAPHIL .</li>
            <li>On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known.</li>
            <li>Less than 24 hours after using this product any symtoms of dry skin or break outs of any kind were all but gone.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and very minimal</li>
            <li>In phase 2b of the trial, I was *completely* cured...to the degree that I took hot showers, was running around being physical and sweating, etc.</li>
            <li>That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>week).The results have been amazing to say the least!  </li>
            <li>its very moisturizing and it dry fast</li>
            <li>and once right after bath)&lt;br /&gt;Switched her soap to \\&quot;SOAP WORKS\\&quot; olive oil bar, which is normally found in health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have been following the above method for about a month, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100% natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also realize that eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by various factors, including certain food items.  </li>
            <li>If you accidentally forget to put the lid on, the product gets hard at the top......</li>
            <li>But thanks to these two products, my husband (who doesn&#x27;t notice these things) says my skin now looks \\&quot;very healthy.\\&quot;  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of Cetaphil; it really works, especially in the very dry climate of Colorado.</li>
            <li>it is very useful for me, especially in autumn and winter part of my body starts to be very dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every moisturizer out there that promises to be gentle enough to sensitive skin and would moisturize, but nothing has done it as well as the Cetaphil cream.</li>
            <li>All the brands I&#x27;ve used, including Clearasil, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, H20, Cetaphil face wash, and Purpose, have a tendency to dry the skin beneath my eyes and leave noticeable red marks there as well.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil has helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>but my skin dries out near my cheeks, near my eyes and chin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I slather it on at night and wear a pair of inexpensive white cotton gloves, although you don&#x27;t really need them because the cream is not greasy.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because my gf saw this and said, \\&quot;oh, you&#x27;re using the old people moisturizer\\&quot;.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had psoriasis since I was six years old, now I&#x27;m thirteen.</li>

            <li>She was just a month old and kept breaking out in rashes with every baby cream or lotion we tried.  </li>
            <li>I can even use it on my highly sensitive face.</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it during all seasons to keep my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, the natural calendula product is quite greasy where as the Cetaphil is not.  </li>
            <li>My mom has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the local store where I&#x27;ve been buying it.</li>
            <li>The only moisturizing Cream that really works.  </li>
            <li>Since using Cetaphil on my feet, my pedicurist asked me how I keep my feet so soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element.</li>
            <li>It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skinirritant for people with sensitive</li>

            <li>baby also had eczema and it says for sensitive skin, every age, I applied this with a tad bit of coconut oil to his skin and it helped.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and so does my mom &amp; my 20-month old daughter.</li>
            <li>Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy.</li>
            <li>Do not buy the generic in the stores,as this product is superior,and worth the extra pennies to have the name brand.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is thick, but light and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>I was using Aveeno Daily, the green cap, and this one feels better.</li>
            <li>good price compared to the lotion I was using before that was really expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and my skin feels moisturized for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really thick and seems to help his skin much more.</li>
            <li>A mum and two toddlers all three with very sensitive skin coming from a humnid tropical zone going into their first winter in a very dry snow zone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin, very soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t give me the deep moisturizing I desire, but it&#x27;s better than several other creams / lotions I have tried</li>
            <li>This is as plain of lotion as it gets which is a huge plus in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It really had made my dry skin much softer and quite smooth and the dry itchy skin has calmed down.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit heavy but on clean skin before going to bed</li>
            <li>: if you have a membership atyour local sams club, they sell a 20 oz bottle for $11, while amazon is selling 16 oz bottles for $13; lesser quantity higher price.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin, which erupts into eczema whenever I&#x27;m not careful about exposing myself to really strong doses of reality, and this lotion is the only thing that helps short of steroid cream.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the Cetaphil cream because I thought it was greasy, but with a few days use I realized that I was using too much.</li>
            <li>Large vol that can use for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and we use it for the entire family including our infant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for winter but not super thick.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil works during normal human life, yoga?</li>
            <li>I follow the therapy prescribed and have been living as close to normal as possible.</li>
            <li>It also rubs in better and seems to last longer, especially if we put it on within a few minutes of his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>... my skin tends to get a bit dry and itchy as the cool &amp; dry fall/</li>
            <li>: I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free, but I feel that it takes a little time to penetrate deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.irritant for people with sensitive</li>
            <li>In winter, the dry condition really give her fits.  </li>

            <li>I live in an area with very low humidity (summer seldom more than around 30% and winter usually around 10%) and as a result have problems with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>Since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, I have tried both.</li>
            <li>In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.</li>

            <li>Very dry skin and this product really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard in the jar, but it applies smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li>After a few bouts with face-swelling trips to the allergy doctor, she prescribed a special moisturizer that I could only get from the drug store.</li>
            <li>This cream generally goes on his face soothingly.  </li>
            <li>It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl</li>

            <li>Compared to Eucerin, Cetaphil is lighter and quickly absorbed but that being said that less moisturizing in personal opinion.</li>

            <li>&quot; look that many facial creams often leave behind.</li>
            <li>My skin is not typically dry</li>
            <li>In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is original or copycat generic low quality brand??</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m always being asked by people what I use because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Omega liquid (2 times a day) - good for brain development, skin etc&lt;br /&gt;Chewable pro-biotic tablets (2 times a day)</li>
            <li> This cream is light weight, but works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> My mother took this cream with her to hospice care; the nurses there loved it and asked where they could get it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy formula is what makes it one of the best creams available out there.</li>
            <li> I doubt its good to eat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a costly product, but Amazon always seems to come up with the best prices and free shipping for this product.</li>
            <li> So it is already a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good Choice for me.</li>
            <li> We went to the dermatologist and ask her how she kept her skin looking so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the good</li>
            <li> Good stuff,</li>
            <li> And it gives good moisture for each rub.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> It is good for the ezcema baby as it can help to relieve the dryness and keep the moisture.</li>
            <li> I used it  for both my baby and I. Good.</li>
            <li> I knew that it felt good</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that works as good as this.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I have never found a better product for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good price on this excellent moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> After going through that first jar, I looked around and Amazon seems to have the best deal.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love Cetaphil!  </li>
            <li> love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this body cream!</li>
            <li> But this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> It was amazing</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cetaphil is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fragrance free, and great price too.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin nice and moisturized even during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until my loving sister who graciously donated a half-used jar to my cause that I had a chance to sample Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> This will help \\&quot;lock\\&quot; all that nice moisture</li>
            <li> What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of greasy and oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li> okay but not as good.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me (specifically suggesting the tub kind) and that I apply it immediately after getting out of the shower (without drying off).  </li>
            <li> i thought i got a good deal with this pack of two cetaphil moisturizing cream thinking that i will be able to save something but</li>
            <li> I scraped the top surface off and we were good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice consistency -- not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good  and better then</li>
            <li> I have nothing to lose, I am glad I did, my face is looking ten times better, and best of all, this is the most affordable cream for face and body!!!!</li>
            <li> Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face as well as my elbows kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Very clean!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a great deal of brands, and this one works quickly.</li>
            <li> and I break out in rashes and eczema, in addition to bruising very easily.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a product called CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (through [...]) and liked that much better.</li>
            <li> I tried everything, yet this cream is by far the best I have tried on her.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on the market</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, keeps my skin hydrated and silky soft</li>
            <li> Whichever makes me sound wise and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any scent which is good if you are allergic to fragrance filled products.</li>
            <li> it is the best lotion i have found so far.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is by far the best lotion/moisturizer on the market for treatment of these problems (and we have tried many).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The best product to use for adult and children who have skin conditions and allergic to fragrance and fabric with fragrances on it.</li>
            <li> For best results, use directly after bathing, wetting the skin or washing hands.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer by far.</li>
            <li> the good thing is i got the free shipping as i bought another item...</li>
            <li> be a chump, use your own cheaper better creams and oils -</li>
            <li> And the best part is that it isn&#x27;t nearly as goopy as most of its competitors.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that the item isn&#x27;t so good as they said.</li>
            <li> and I genuinely see a difference in her skin and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Very light, non-sticky.  </li>
            <li> Very light feel to it.</li>
            <li> and I loved the way it keeps you super moisturized without being greasy or leaving a film or anything on your body.</li>
            <li> I will add a &amp;#34;me too&amp;#34; positive comment, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face, are So cheap and work better than anything!</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent and a super deal thru Amazon !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil&#x27;s face wash, but this was a dud.</li>
            <li> Quite simply the best!</li>
            <li> Well, I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> , I use it on my face mostly and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or anything.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m anal.  </li>
            <li> At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers, this cream is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> And now I am glued to this :)</li>
            <li> I Love it.  </li>
            <li> I like the cream much more than the pump moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried top name brands since like Nivea, Olay and Eucerin when they come out with something \\&quot;newer and better\\</li>
            <li> The price was also wonderful, especially for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> Excellent product and a terrific value.    </li>
            <li> Pursuant to my brother&#x27;s advice, I tried washing my face again with one of my many face washes (I think it was Clearasil or Purpose).</li>
            <li> So I used more and what do you know -</li>
            <li> B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit]] (which I use two or three times a</li>
            <li> So I tried tubs of skin cream and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> We tried both and like the cetaphil much better.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but I think anyone would feel better using this.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> but I do not believe they carry it any more.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better deal in the market or drug stores.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell or taste, and is safe if baby puts her hands in her mouth after application.  </li>
            <li> I began using this after every shower (has to be the cream, not the lotion), and it&#x27;s 10x more effective than any steroid cream, UVB light, etc.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the cetaphil in the jar.  </li>
            <li> so I was focusing mostly on the wrinkles when I bought products.  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but that is with most lotions and creams...</li>
            <li> I (like most of you) am dealing with \\&quot;Snow-pocalypse 2014\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love tlhis product.</li>
            <li> Throughout the years I have tried many products, all in which haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I also love it for myself on my arms and shoulders</li>
            <li> I love these products and sent an order of Cetaphil  moisturizing cream and the Cetaphil body wash to my sister.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so much better than over marketed, yet ineffective, lotions from any of the fortune 500</li>
            <li> I love that it has no smell and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my dermatologist suggested this product.  </li>
            <li> I swim,and it is perfect for the entire body,especially after showering.</li>
            <li> It arrived safely and intact.</li>
            <li> Came just as you would buy it in the store but with a much better price</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years in my children with excellent results, however this cream that I got burned the face of my children producing them an allergy.</li>
            <li> Much better compared to the lotion.</li>
            <li> Aside from a homemade shea butter concoction my friend makes, I have never used a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion...</li>
            <li> I tried the Cetaphil lotion that comes with a pump, but this cream is much more thicker and more moisturizing than the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many well known moisturizers but never had any improvement.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li> love the softening effect and its purity.  </li>
            <li> The deal i got on amazon is better than the costco price.</li>
            <li> She loves it and bought some more for her sister and friend.</li>
            <li> She said it worked better than Eucerine that she had used before.</li>
            <li> just love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this brand because it keeps the BABY ACNE AWAY.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> We went with cetaphil and love it.</li>

            <li> Feel safe for my sensative skin.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> This Cetaphil keeps them moist and feels much better.</li>
            <li> My wife prefers something thinner because she puts lotion all over her body, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see</li>
            <li> They make anything they are in more spreadable.</li>
            <li> : This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative.</li>
            <li> Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve even been able to stop using my prescription gel because the rosacea has all but disappeared since I started using this cream on my face.  </li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price and more!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s rich without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> The package is worth to buy!</li>
            <li> Very safe, natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very safe, natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cetaphil brand cream never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is great for healing dry skin and plus its oderless.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product for my son, and has eliminated the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry and combo skins.  </li>
            <li> Like many people out there, my face is fairly sensitive to most face washes.</li>
            <li> old had moderate eczema, and after 1 or 2 uses, we had a baby with very beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs better and appears to keep his sensitive skin better moisturized than the lotion version.  </li>
            <li> Great for outdoor hands or fighting winter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> Most importantly though, it doesn&#x27;t burn and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for the dry spots like your elbow and knee area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known Cetaphil for quite a while, and this is by far the most appropriate moisturizing cream for my daughter who have eczema since birth.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has been great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream does a great job and keeps my skin from getting dry and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wipe the greasy layer off when it gets to that stage, and my skin is still super smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is good but not thick enough for the kind of moisturizing I need.  </li>
            <li> I have very healthy, super soft skin because of it.</li>
            <li> Super rich cream that goes on smooth and melts into skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great product for my baby&#x27;s dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands in the Winter, after applying they feel great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for super dry hands in the winter months.</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to be careful of and pay attention to is that you best make sure your hands are clean before you dig in..</li>
            <li> it is the perfect moisturizer for the delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> but when its put on, it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it.</li>
            <li> so happy I finally found something that works well with my sensitive skin and acne. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use this on areas like elbows and knees because it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li> I love and highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> (that said, I only use a gel blush and maybe some powder) and it has a good ranking on the Environmental Working Group site (I think a 2 or 3) and contains no parabens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil:</li>
            <li> A welcome relief for very dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But it is quickly absorbed/dried up, leaving my skin feel nice and natural.  </li>
            <li> Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well.  </li>
            <li> This is really good for my skin and every person who has tried it agrees with my many words on this subject.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it is really important for me to find the right lotion.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, and the treatment is a mild cortizone cream during break outs.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I&#x27;m pretty sure the hot weather is a contributing</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing Cream.  </li>
            <li> My Granddaughters use this for everything along with Cetaphil gentle facial wash, they think this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Worthy product</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non–greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me for my mild eczema.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in quickly and well, doesn&#x27;t interfere with any make up</li>
            <li> I figure if I get a good running start now, I can look more youthful even as my body has other plans ;)</li>
            <li> CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend, but Cetaphil is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> you so very much!</li>
            <li> Very Very Very Recommend this Product!</li>
            <li> This product is decent if your skin is mildly dry, but it doesn&#x27;t effectively heal the skin of the moderate-high dry-flaky kind.</li>
            <li> I have used many face moisturizers, and all of them make my face break out, I was just giving up trying new things.</li>
            <li> She said that if a product comes in a pump bottle or is called a lotion, it won&#x27;t do the job - they may feel good but your skin is still going to crack and bleed if you&#x27;ve got seriously dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and it did a good job of keeping the leg from being completely dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several creams and I love this one!</li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> Originally purchased to help with my grandson&#x27;s excema, now the whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> I even use this as a facial moisturizer, and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt better!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and my dermatologist recommended I use Cetaphil Moisturizine Cream or Eucerin Calming Cream, I ordered both and liked the Cetaphil cream better because it felt less oily.</li>
            <li> This is woooonnnderful!&lt;br /&gt;It has a non greasy feel, doesnt leave skin sticky, lathers and absorbs really nicely and quick enough for my toddler to get her clothes on post bath time.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly so you can get dressed right after applying.</li>
            <li> I was using cheap moisturizers for over 2 years and they didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> It is really fragrance free (</li>
            <li> I should get a free ones by now for getting so much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing this Cetaphil cream is.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> but nothing is better than this one so far.  </li>
            <li> Being reluctant to use even more cortisone stuff, I decided instead to lavishly and frequently apply  cetaphil in an effort to avoid them.  </li>
            <li> Being the nice non-compliant patient that I am, I never bothered to actually look up the product and try it out.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the  money.</li>
            <li> Though costly, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love it for me and my young sons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this.</li>
            <li> I am now 68 and everyone comments on my skin and says how clear and mostly wrinkle-free it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Little on the costly side but worth it... I purchased a 2 pack</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to use natural stuff</li>
            <li> (It does have a trace of a scent in the jar -- not artificial, but just like anything, it has something of a scent.</li>
            <li> if you have any skin problems, or even if you don&#x27;t, its so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li> It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a more natural cream</li>
            <li> It does get absorbed very fast so the greasiness is mild and temporary.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> A large tank, used method Body Milk Hand Cream, feeling pretty good, sometimes long face acne, it is also used, can repair, second days is very magical, will consider it has been used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite rich but doesn not feel greesy, as the cream is very aborbant and leaves a fresh feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot better because it moisturizes my face a lot better than the other.      </li>
            <li> This is my first facial moisturizer, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it more than any other cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is light enough for every day use and effective enough to keep our dry skin in great condition.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you to try cetaphil if you or your love ones are suffering from dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> Moistens my hands and feet right up.  </li>
            <li> and when I use this it soaks right into my skin to leave it feeling softer and moister.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil works right away.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the speed it was absorbed into your skin, on the other hand however, it did not \\&quot;last\\&quot; as long in the skin as i anticipated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Sensitive Dry Skin.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and put a finger full of Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream on afterwards.</li>
            <li> observation, which is more of a tip than a point against this product, is to make sure you keep the lid tight.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t soak her for a long time, but I do make sure she&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li> You can see the difference right after the first use.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing for my ultra dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented and super gentle.</li>
            <li> It goes on a tad bit greasy if you use too much, but it quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> It dissolves quickly and doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.</li>
            <li> Great price here compared to regular big box stores-especially with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Recommended by one of my docs, I use it morning and evening on my legs, and it definitely is effective for helping them avoid dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, feels nice going on, doesn&#x27;t burn, and kept my skin unbelievably healthy.</li>
            <li> Very good  for dry skin  lasts a long time  inexpensive</li>
            <li> The first use of the product, down effect can also be suitable for everyday use!If the price is able to offer some better!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and this cream keeps my skin moisturized very, very well.</li>
            <li> I then went on to use a natural product with calendula, which I thought was better than the Aveeno product (and which I still use and would highly suggest).  </li>
            <li> Most of all, it moisturizes my skin, especially in the winter months where the heater drys out skin and makes it itchy and flaky.  </li>
            <li> It also has NO smell at all, no weird chemical smells or anything.</li>
            <li> At first it felt a bit greesy</li>
            <li> Also, my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The cream may feel a bit oily when first applied.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, the effect lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> (A lot of people will tell you that eczema is aggravated by hot weather.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to recommend comfortable cotton clothing and frequent clothing</li>
            <li> My make up now looks better, I actually glow</li>
            <li> My psoriasis has improved by a lot since I first began using this product.</li>
            <li> Just great cream, not sticky or too thick.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughters, wife and I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They obviously require me to use a moisturizer every day and this was the one I selected because the alternative, Vaseline, is just too greasy and while it may be a better moisture barrier, Vaseline has always seemed to insulate my body heat which makes me itch</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips when the skin is peeling off - it instantly calms the flaking skin better than any lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I wake up with really soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Better than any generic from drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Very supple on skin and moisture protecting!</li>
            <li> After my first use I was in love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years.</li>
            <li> Really does what it says!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my skin within the first week.</li>
            <li> I first tried this lotion when I was visiting my parents in Chicago.</li>
            <li> Love this cream for my entire body.  </li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> And, this is the first time I order this pack from this merchant.</li>
            <li> We tried Aquaphor as well, but the texture seemed to clog his skin more than actually help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful for Cetaphil!  </li>
            <li> I actually like this better than the cetaphil pump lotion.  </li>
            <li> feel soft and comfortable when applying it on face and body.&lt;br /&gt;baby</li>
            <li> Just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like Avon or oil of OLE.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different ones and</li>
            <li> I find this is much better than any chapstick or similar product.</li>
            <li> decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is safe enough to be consumed internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene</li>
            <li> This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist at first and a jar in every room in the house now.</li>
            <li> Great for these extra dry winters.  </li>
            <li> works great on dry skin, and although it is sold locally, I prefer to buy it here to get a 2 pack....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also true that if you do hot yoga you may not be able to hold your arms, feet, legs or other body part when using this product.</li>
            <li> So far, this cream has not disappointed me in any way.</li>
            <li> I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe &amp; vera.</li>
            <li> My 2 yo suffering allergy and her skin get irritate easy and cetaphil is the only cream that works for her eczema, we have tried a lot of other brand but this cream is magic!</li>
            <li> (I heard positive things about this)&lt;br /&gt;Cataphil cream (2 times a day -  once in the morning before daycare</li>
            <li> No other word can say, it is very useful for our famalily.</li>
            <li> I pretty much tried everything, including the ointment prescribed by the doctor.  </li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body and for the first time ever, I have an even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that dries quickly in the winter months if I do not moisturize.  </li>
            <li> After five days my skin is super soft and my dermatitis is fading away.  </li>
            <li> These attributes of the cream make it ideally suited for dry, sensitive skin and symptoms of dry skin associated with eczema</li>
            <li> have used for years but may have found a better cream for my dry heels.</li>
            <li> The pump kind feels watered down and do not offer as much protection as the cream.  </li>
            <li> and this is moisturizing yet super gentle and leaves my arms and legs feeling soft like a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> Psoriasis is a condition wherein certain areas of your body, the skin matures at a very accelerated pace.</li>
            <li> truly believe the above combo is helping out, but I need to give a huge credit to CETAPHIL.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe I had applied too much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very soothing to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It is light enough to use anytime--under makeup or before bed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to use the medicated ointment, because of the cortizone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life, and followed me to adulthood.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this cream as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like anything.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing about Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream is that you can purchase it almost anywhere, and it is much cheaper than a lot of the more expensive creams out there that, in my experience, don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The price here is so much lower than anywhere else</li>
            <li> stuff really works.</li>
            <li> The fact that Cetaphil is fragrance free is just another big plus.</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis for decades and it really does the job.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline did nothing but burn and the smell is really pungent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that I can do anything about it.  </li>
            <li> It is light, non-greasy, and has the same reputation as the Cetaphil washing lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the information, &amp;#34;Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has quality humectants, emollients and occlusive agents that provide intense, long–lasting hydration.</li>
            <li> I use it with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser to cleanse my skin before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Tried it on and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sticky with fast absorption.</li>
            <li> I missed it so much.</li>
            <li> Not too oily, soaks in fast and works well.</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry/ashy skin before, but after using this product for awhile,  my skin is no longer dry/irritated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since stopped buying on amazon since it&#x27;s so much cheaper at Costco.</li>
            <li> After that, I could use any cleanser and this would moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bother me though, because I put it on at night.</li>
            <li> I have used cetaphil for my whole family.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it, and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> otherwise this will cost me too much....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and really sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory over three years use.</li>
            <li> But after putting it on, I can&#x27;t really detect it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that .</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you use it consistently, it really improves the condition of your skin.</li>
            <li> Really has no smell and is not sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li> On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages.</li>
            <li> This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages.</li>
            <li> It really helps ease itching and flakes.</li>
            <li> Very multipurpose.  </li>
            <li> There is a light fragrance that goes away shortly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> And it really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s pricing on this 2pack is very competitive with what I&#x27;ve seen in the drugstores</li>
            <li> Then my sister kindly pointed out with minimum name-calling and moderate eye-rolling that I was using way not enough of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> After many different skin moisturizers for my sensitive skin, I stopped at this one to balance my skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, good in the winter and in the summer.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t billed as a wrinkle cream, but when I use it on my face and compare to other facial lotions, I see a better result from Cetaphil in smoothing the fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> We live in a hot and humid climate so her flare-ups occur often.  </li>
            <li> so 2 for $20 is about right as far as price.</li>
            <li> This product is truly fragrance-free and does not cause an allergic reaction on my skin like so many other products do.</li>
            <li> I used it head to toe throughout my pregnancy and it relieved the itching much better than any other cream i tried.  </li>
            <li> literaly no smell unlike many other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and doesn&#x27;t make me itchier, like many other creams do.  </li>
            <li> All other lotions I try seemed to aggravate his skin more than help it..</li>
            <li> It is clean and light with no strong perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> Rubs into the skin, I always buy this kind because it seems to last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to feel good going on, yet absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream that is fragrance and dye free, which is great since my little one is allergic to dyes and fragrances.</li>
            <li> In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately \\&quot;breathe.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;People argue that the ingredients may be the same as regular moisturizers found elsewhere; however, the right formulation is important for absorption and skin protection.</li>
            <li> There are great applications for each of those but as a general moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make itchiness worse and really seems to moisturize gently, Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream does the trick.</li>
            <li> Oddly the place that I can tell the most difference is in my neck as I don&#x27;t have that crepeiness</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a tub/large container with a wide mouth that is easy to access.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin after and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> had really dry hands and tried all kinds of products before I sound this produce.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it lasts forever if you use it for mainly your face.  </li>
            <li> Not only have I not had any type of reaction to this product, but my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream I have found that keeps my skin soft and free of \\&quot;winter rash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have never noticed a &#x27;greasy feeling&#x27; after using this cream and haven&#x27;t had a film build up on my skin; as I stated above, my skin soaks it up quickly.</li>
            <li> routine for my daughter consists of regular quick baths and lots of hydration.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my entire body soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Over and above, the Cetaphil moisturizing cream is mild and does not leave a oily feel after the application.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried everything, having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions, but they weren&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno</li>
            <li> Cetaphil was the only thing so far that keeps him moist and rash free</li>
            <li> and I particularly appreciate that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars, because it is decent against mild-dryness, but that&#x27;s the limit of Cetaphil&#x27;s capability.</li>
            <li> My condition is related to chemotherapy, but this product is super - hydrating, and may be applied everywhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis).</li>

            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this product, my face gets really dry like it usually does, but it works great when I use it.</li>
            <li> We also highly recommend the cream versus the lotion.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even high end moisturizers didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling this supple and piable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d splurge a little in my mission to become better friends with my skin.</li>
            <li> I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry.</li>
            <li> In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol:</li>
            <li> In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol:</li>
            <li> Though not a medicine, Cetaphil&#x27;s action has done much to alleviate the discomfort that I used to bear.</li>
            <li> The cream feels light and wet between your fingers.  </li>
            <li> The cream just feels better and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This product truly works for dried skin, eczema, and more.</li>
            <li> and I normally need hypoallergenic cosmetics/skin care products</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the jar will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizing cream, but I seem to detect a slight fragrance although it is definitely not scented.</li>
            <li> I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin,</li>
            <li> I put it on right after a shower and it lasts until my next shower.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from very dry skin and skin allergies and this product was the only thing that didn&#x27;t irritate it even more.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely fragrance free as advertised and also doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling as long as you don&#x27;t slather too much on at once.</li>
            <li> well, you can live with it, like a fish:</li>
            <li> cannot live with out my cetaphil.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders on my new baby who has eczema.  </li>
            <li> Since I also live in LA, my skin dries out rapidly in our desert climate.</li>
            <li> I bought cetaphil for my new born daugther.</li>
            <li> at begining, it was used for my new baby.</li>
            <li> My children can&#x27;t live a week without cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> This cream is totally non-irritating and totally fragrance free.</li>
            <li> My skin is super dry</li>
            <li> Have super dry skin and Cetaphil moisturizing cream helps to keep it moist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very inexpensive, and hydrates my skin like no other cream has.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have to watch what I put on it.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that reacts severely to a number of chemicals found in a lot of skincare products.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized all the time.</li>
            <li> Even though I have very sensitive skin, I use cetaphil on my face too.</li>
            <li> I have very, very, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Her dry patches are pretty much all gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products at many price points, including some extremely expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Tried a number of products in the past experiencing many caveats.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually got me to write a review.  </li>
            <li> My doctor turned me on to this cream when I was 31 because I was breaking out on my face and it has worked better than any other moisturizer for me for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> Keep it on a hot window sill and then shake it open like champagne in a rap video, mouth aggressively agape.  </li>
            <li> I think the next step is going to be a pediatric dermatologist, but I&#x27;m waiting for the summer weather to be over first to see if there&#x27;s improvement.  </li>
            <li> I first tried using the Cetaphil facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it makes your face really soft when you wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li> Quite recently was the first time i ever used CETAPHIL .</li>
            <li> On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known.</li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours after using this product any symtoms of dry skin or break outs of any kind were all but gone.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and very minimal</li>
            <li> In phase 2b of the trial, I was *completely* cured...to the degree that I took hot showers, was running around being physical and sweating, etc.</li>
            <li> That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> week).The results have been amazing to say the least!  </li>
            <li> its very moisturizing and it dry fast</li>
            <li> and once right after bath)&lt;br /&gt;Switched her soap to \\&quot;SOAP WORKS\\&quot; olive oil bar, which is normally found in health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have been following the above method for about a month, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100% natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also realize that eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by various factors, including certain food items.  </li>
            <li> If you accidentally forget to put the lid on, the product gets hard at the top......</li>
            <li> But thanks to these two products, my husband (who doesn&#x27;t notice these things) says my skin now looks \\&quot;very healthy.\\&quot;  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of Cetaphil; it really works, especially in the very dry climate of Colorado.</li>
            <li> it is very useful for me, especially in autumn and winter part of my body starts to be very dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every moisturizer out there that promises to be gentle enough to sensitive skin and would moisturize, but nothing has done it as well as the Cetaphil cream.</li>
            <li> All the brands I&#x27;ve used, including Clearasil, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, H20, Cetaphil face wash, and Purpose, have a tendency to dry the skin beneath my eyes and leave noticeable red marks there as well.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> but my skin dries out near my cheeks, near my eyes and chin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I slather it on at night and wear a pair of inexpensive white cotton gloves, although you don&#x27;t really need them because the cream is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Also keeps cuticles soft and preserves that manicure.</li>
            <li> It keeps the kids&#x27; skin well moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this lotion hasn&#x27;t irritated my face at all.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and moisturizing, especially when you are washing your hands a million times a day after changing diapers.</li>
            <li> It keeps my baby&#x27;s skin soft and my hands from drying out.</li>
            <li> Old Review</li>
            <li> Your review system, lightening fast shipping and unlimited selection of products keeps me coming back again and again.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because my gf saw this and said, \\&quot;oh, you&#x27;re using the old people moisturizer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin, like mine, can be irritated by perfumed lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reommend.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stripe the skin of it&#x27;s natural barriers.  </li>

            <li> She was just a month old and kept breaking out in rashes with every baby cream or lotion we tried.  </li>
            <li> I can even use it on my highly sensitive face.</li>

            <li> I use it during all seasons to keep my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, the natural calendula product is quite greasy where as the Cetaphil is not.  </li>
            <li> My mom has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the local store where I&#x27;ve been buying it.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizing Cream that really works.  </li>
            <li> Since using Cetaphil on my feet, my pedicurist asked me how I keep my feet so soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element.</li>
            <li> It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skinirritant for people with sensitive</li>
            <li> It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas.</li>

            <li> baby also had eczema and it says for sensitive skin, every age, I applied this with a tad bit of coconut oil to his skin and it helped.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and so does my mom &amp; my 20-month old daughter.</li>
            <li> Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the generic in the stores,as this product is superior,and worth the extra pennies to have the name brand.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is thick, but light and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> I was using Aveeno Daily, the green cap, and this one feels better.</li>
            <li> good price compared to the lotion I was using before that was really expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and my skin feels moisturized for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and seems to help his skin much more.</li>
            <li> A mum and two toddlers all three with very sensitive skin coming from a humnid tropical zone going into their first winter in a very dry snow zone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin, very soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t give me the deep moisturizing I desire, but it&#x27;s better than several other creams / lotions I have tried</li>
            <li> This is as plain of lotion as it gets which is a huge plus in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It really had made my dry skin much softer and quite smooth and the dry itchy skin has calmed down.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit heavy but on clean skin before going to bed</li>
            <li> : if you have a membership atyour local sams club, they sell a 20 oz bottle for $11, while amazon is selling 16 oz bottles for $13; lesser quantity higher price.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, which erupts into eczema whenever I&#x27;m not careful about exposing myself to really strong doses of reality, and this lotion is the only thing that helps short of steroid cream.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the Cetaphil cream because I thought it was greasy, but with a few days use I realized that I was using too much.</li>
            <li> Large vol that can use for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and we use it for the entire family including our infant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for winter but not super thick.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil works during normal human life, yoga?</li>
            <li> I follow the therapy prescribed and have been living as close to normal as possible.</li>
            <li> It also rubs in better and seems to last longer, especially if we put it on within a few minutes of his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ... my skin tends to get a bit dry and itchy as the cool &amp; dry fall/</li>
            <li> : I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free, but I feel that it takes a little time to penetrate deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.irritant for people with sensitive</li>
            <li> In winter, the dry condition really give her fits.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend it to people with sensitive &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very low humidity (summer seldom more than around 30% and winter usually around 10%) and as a result have problems with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> Since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, I have tried both.</li>
            <li> In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.</li>
            <li> It really helps with very dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Very dry skin and this product really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard in the jar, but it applies smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li> After a few bouts with face-swelling trips to the allergy doctor, she prescribed a special moisturizer that I could only get from the drug store.</li>
            <li> This cream generally goes on his face soothingly.  </li>
            <li> It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl</li>

            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft throughout the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this based on several reviews of the product and so far, I do like it.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a guy, and I&#x27;m would have never expected that I would be using moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil.</li>

            <li> and this is the key to soft but not greasy skin.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use it on my face but only hands and legs, but if I run out of my facial cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;Phenoxyethanol: When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried restricting certain food from her diet, but I found it extremely difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to Eucerin, Cetaphil is lighter and quickly absorbed but that being said that less moisturizing in personal opinion.</li>
            <li> Unlike other moistureizors I used such as Aveeno, this gets absorbed by the skin without leaving a residue that is present for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> dry skin and cetaphil cream is one of the few creams/lotions that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel more dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Absorber quickly and does not leave a greasy or slick feel.</li>
            <li> It cleared the dermatitis right up and as long as I use it every day, I don&#x27;t have any other problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and my problem was that I live in an exceptionally dry climate and my skin is susceptible to breaking out.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and easily gets dry and on a weird day, very oily in some parts.</li>
            <li> &quot; look that many facial creams often leave behind.</li>
            <li> My skin is not typically dry</li>
            <li> In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is original or copycat generic low quality brand??</li>
            <li> It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes.</li>

            <li> The Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has relieved me of much discomfort due to the constant flaking of my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I&#x27;m not allergic to this</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I&#x27;m not allergic to this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My baby girl has had dry skin and rash issues since she was 3 months old.  </li>
            <li> From frequent washing, my hands dry out, crack and bleed during the winter months.</li>
            <li> In less than three minutes, I&#x27;m ready to put clothes on without them</li>
            <li> Both the kids and I have dry, sensitive skin and can suffer from seasonal eczema.</li>
            <li> My grandson has dry &amp; sensitive skin and his parents need to lotion him 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Long lasting  lasting moisture for baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive</li>
            <li> ; does not feel wet; works really well for severely dry skin.    </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and dry, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily after I shower and it completely releives any dry skin and discomfort even in the winter.</li>
            <li> I was told by my dermatologist that she could only strongly stand behind two products for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like it enough to use it everyday but you should be careful not to overdo it cuz it absorbs really quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter because when she started teething she developed very dry skin under her neck.</li>
            <li> My three month old had developed eczema and dry, chapped, winter skin and after just a few days this cream had completely cleared up the problems.  </li>
            <li> Hydrocortizone helps a little, but I feel very against putting chemicals on her body.  </li>
            <li> Nothing new to explain of the product it is as u seen in any other store , there is no difference of it.</li>
            <li> First of all, an official disclaimer: as a typical red-blooded American dude, I have limited knowledge in moisturizing products.  </li>
            <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I use it in the Winter particularly because the forced air heat and long comforting hot showers dry out my skin at that time of year.</li>
            <li> Important to note:  scoop a small amount onto your hands and rub your hands together to &#x27;melt it down&#x27; before applying to the body.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and therefore my skin stays very dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical, it doesn&#x27;t contribute to breakouts (the skin on my face has an attitude), it moisturizes and keeps my skin that way throughout the day, and it seriously softens everything it touches.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive brand lotions that only dry out my skin more, leave my skin too oily or irritate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> of all, with that big jar, it can last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that if I didn&#x27;t use it, I&#x27;ll have horribly dry/ peeling skin all over my face and look twenty years older than I actually do because of it.</li>
            <li> It works but it really doesn&#x27;t help with the little dry skin around the nose area.</li>
            <li> I use another, more expensive cream regularly, but if it is a particularly very dry winter, I will use this cream at night.</li>
            <li> I get the new skin to dead skin cycle twice in a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big lotion person, but I don&#x27;t like dry, itchy skin either.</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one that prevents my extremely dry skin from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> I was very self-conscious about how I looked, so much, in fact, that I had my girlfriend carry around moisturizing cream for me at all times to combat the dryness beneath my eyes (sad, I know).</li>
            <li> During particularly dry seasons, I may apply this cream several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it at night to deep moisturize my dry flaky face.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not quite enough for my dry, chapped hands</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Even after I apply this to my face or neck, where my skin is dry and flaky, it&#x27;s as though it dismally staved off and forestall the inevitable shedding of the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Petrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \\&quot;rod wax.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have dry skin especially during winter and this is my companion wherever I go!</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s quite expensive at my local Target (and even more so at the local convenience store), I prefer to buy it on subscription at Amazon where I can get at least a little discount, and have it delivered straight to my door.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin, especially my legs, get very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and bought several creams to help this condition.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fairly quickly, not as greasy as other brands, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I moved to the high desert plains a couple of years ago and the combination of low humidity and hard water began to wreak havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin.</li>

            <li> (nothing seems to work better on them than Vaseline, I&#x27;m afraid).  </li>
            <li> but the results were often temporary, too greasy, and took too long to absorb.  </li>
            <li> since it lasts so long, I don&#x27;t like the thought of dipping my hands into a tub, it feels unsanitary.</li>
            <li> i bought it long time ago</li>
            <li> If I go without it for too long</li>
            <li> As long as this stuff is being made I will buy it.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have only had 2 outbreaks, less serious than the first one and only....</li>
            <li> well i still kept it because it&#x27;s too long to do that&lt;</li>
            <li> Frequently I had red patches on my skin and a very uneven skin tone in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like bare minerals radiance (slight shimmer) and</li>
            <li> and we live in a very harsh climate.</li>
            <li> Ever so often I have been enticed away by other creams, but I always come back to this cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon for years and has only had one other problelm.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m at the extreme end of the spectrum and may only get four or five days out of a 16 oz jar</li>
            <li> Other over the counter topicals like Eucerin and Lubriderm last *maybe</li>
            <li> but it has now gotten to extreme conditions with constant application of lotions.  </li>
            <li> the key of this product here is to prevent side effects due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I will admit, one jar lasts me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had a face rash from the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> My son has dry skin and his pediatrician recommended this.  </li>

            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It help controls the eczema and dry skin for me.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the few reviewers who said this cream was heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely non irritating, and it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I cannot speak on behalf of everyone and claim that they&#x27;ll experience similar, instantaneous relief, but I now use Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream every time I wash my face, and ever since I&#x27;ve started that regimen, neither my face nor my eyes have dried up.    </li>
            <li> It also was impossible to blend into the skin, leaving a white film for a few minutes until it soaked in on its own.</li>
            <li> It does bother me that a product with the &#x27;lightweight&#x27; and &#x27;non-greasy&#x27; monikers does not live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using Cetaphil:  I have NONE of the flakiness and have not had one single break out.  </li>

            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and find that hand creams just seem to make them drier.</li>
            <li> I use it only when the lotion doesn&#x27;t work well, though the chance is very few, such as heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> Its quite thick, and may be a little uncomfortable when first using it, but once you get used to it, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver i looked so bad with my skin so dry, and this makes it so smooth!</li>
            <li> I accidentally forgot to twist it tight enough and when we opened it, the lotion had somewhat solidified.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the thick cream completely smoothed out the dry skin and removed the redness under my eyes - neither conditions were even remotely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have Psoriasis, so my choices of cleansing/lotion product is very limited.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s soothing on dry spots, and I don&#x27;t hesitate to put it on over rashes or any other spot.</li>
            <li> Besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> Because the jar is so big, I don&#x27;t feel bad applying a thick layer to make sure my skin is hydrated throughout the night (especially in the winter).</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Cream moisturized as expected.</li>
            <li> Being the stubborn person that I am, I did not want to waste money or time seeking the advice of a Dermatologist, so I tried different types of lotions to see if any of them would remedy my problem.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong itcher.</li>

            <li> well you only have 1 pack wasted...</li>
            <li> Is it not enough for me to give this product 5 stars withought having to go to the trouble of giving you a written essay?</li>
            <li> As expected...</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be thick and greazy, but was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;beauty industry\\&quot; will put any crap into a product if it will make your skin look or feel better but they don&#x27;t give a dang about how it might affect your overall health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this product works!  </li>
            <li> As a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick</li>
            <li> I found that it stays in the skin without giving the greasy or wet feeling that you have after applying other moisturizing creams.     </li>
            <li> Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water.</li>
            <li> It does seem thick when first putting it on, but once rubbed in is not greasy or thick at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little of this moisturizing cream goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly thick but absorbs quickly and without leaving a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream is that the tube is huge and inconvenient to travel with at times, but it is a small price to pay to avoid the self-consciousness I felt at having flaky, red skin beneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I buy it not to Contrast other price.</li>

            <li> No breakouts, hydrated skin and a steal compared to the other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams out there.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every other product in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other brands--this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil now sits on my bathroom vanity and is used as a routine moisturizer for my face, elbows, arms and any other moisturizing needs.   </li>
            <li> Works well and does not have a fragrance to interfere with any other fragranced item you may apply.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this product to be used instead of J&amp;J or other kinds of baby lotion products.  </li>
            <li> I wont be using any other moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> Our family fights eczema and other allergy-induced skin ailments.</li>
            <li> Well, you&#x27;ve no doubt heard from some other reviewers that cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing lotion formula is greasy</li>
            <li> so it lasts longer in my opinion than other lotions.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for moisturizer that actually works without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie, so in the past I&#x27;ve deviated from this to try other lotions and creams, but always came back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter.</li>
            <li> THAT is likely the thin layer that protects further dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it year round to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li> It eliminates dry skin within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use it especially during the cold, dry winter months and my skin remains so soft.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very cold climate and with the drying heat always being on, I get dry patches of skin, this will eliminate them 90% overnight and totally by the next day.</li>
            <li> And it has no real strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I just turned 39 and am starting to see some signs of aging and just really dull skin.  </li>
            <li> I workout daily and hardly any of it comes off when I sweat.  </li>
            <li> A very little amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> At this price for two jars, it&#x27;s a steal and depending on how liberal you use it, but jar will last at least a couple of months for one person.</li>

            <li> I am living in DC and it is thick enough for me.</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers made my skin tight, then itchy, made me prone to acne, and blotches.    </li>
            <li> One down side is that when using it all over the baby gets a bit slippery..</li>
            <li> Five months down the road</li>
            <li> However, if you put a very very small amount of water into the bottle (several drops), just enough to curtail the thick viscosity, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DUE TO WEATHER &amp; GOT IMMEDIATE RELIEF!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been having dried skin all my life and have suffered skin rash due to dryness.  </li>
            <li> i use this at night time; i have slightly oily and sometimes acne skin; but i still need a moisturizer;  it is not greasy</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has seriously taken ten years off my face and body.  </li>
            <li> I use less makeup to cover up my flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Result: my face - break out pretty bad, my neck - dry out like snake&#x27;s shedded skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is relatively thick, so a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update in a little while and see if the results are long-lasting and don&#x27;t develop in break-outs (which they haven&#x27;t after two weeks).</li>
            <li> No more oily/greasy feeling on my hands and legs as with other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s got two little kids....</li>
            <li> It does go on a little greasy</li>
            <li> Because my t-zone is oily anyway, my forehead is a little greasy by the end of the day</li>
            <li> but when the articles came from amazon it was a little bit damaged</li>
            <li> Both my son and my daughter had eczema when they were little.</li>
            <li> My kids have horrible eczema… I spent tons of money on other product, but came right back to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I usually get a little dry skin in the winter time, and have been using Vaseline for Men in the past.</li>
            <li> We put it on her at least twice a day and now the dry skin has cleared up!</li>
            <li> I have allergies and during a recent trip, I developed bad eczema on my hands and fingers from using antibacterial soaps and lotions.  </li>
            <li> But with Cetaphil, she does not have nearly as much trouble as before.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I also have severe allergies and develop sensitivity to moisturizers after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is heavy, it does not grease up your skin for hours or leave grease stains on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Its also a firm cream</li>
            <li> In the evening, I slather a generous amount of Cetaphil on my skin after the evening skincare regimen to seal off all of the nutrients that I&#x27;ve put on my face (retinol, Vitamin C, green tea, etc.)</li>
            <li> I do not use this as my everyday body crème, even though my dermatologist wishes I would.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I use this as an all over (head to toe) moisturizer year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few containers of this.</li>
            <li> But I will still use a greezy vaseline lotion if I get into something that is really harsh.</li>
            <li> But this is my everyday go product.</li>
            <li> This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils).</li>
            <li> No more flakes or feeling tight after a shower.</li>
            <li> I became skeptical about moisturizers in general until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Our skin was raw itchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> It can be quite expensive but a little  bit goes a long way and buying with Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> I keep a small amount in a travel size bottle</li>
            <li> but I reuse small cream containers to make this \\&quot;portable\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisture IS long-lasting and if it continues in this vein, I&#x27;ll have found my miracle moisturizer and at a fraction of the price I&#x27;ve paid in the past.  </li>
            <li> We go through a few of these a winter!</li>
            <li> and psoriasis.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply as often as needed, usually in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix with a small spray of Neutrogena Sesame oil.  </li>
            <li> This saved my skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it the past decade, and nothing else.  </li>
            <li> it producted by 2012,it will expried the next year.i want to the new,not the storage,do you understand?it make me sad.</li>
            <li> I usually use it after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder.</li>
            <li> winter has been brutal on my skin -- especially my hands -- but Cetaphil had made them soft again.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I started using only water to wash my face because I was so concerned about my dry skin, which, obviously, was quite nasty for me.    </li>
            <li> I live in San Francisco where the weather and tap water dries out my skin badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guilty for using in on the dry patches on my arms though!</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry skin on my legs and at times it was uncomfortable and itchy.</li>
            <li> but it is very thick and gets clothing messy because it never dries.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old son has had bad eczema all his life.</li>
            <li> Why would you waste money on expensive products made up of weird synthetic ingredients that can irritate your skin when something this simple and inexpensive works?</li>
            <li> I keep at least 2 tubs at home and one at work.</li>
            <li> It seems there&#x27;s always something that makes my skin itchy whether it&#x27;s wool clothing, drying cold winter air, or simply my skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I have bought every expensive cream, lotion, anti-aging product out there and spent tons of money doing so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the negative reviews about the cetaphil products, but the cream works for me.</li>
            <li> the last thing you need in this tub is some dirty</li>
            <li> If someone lives in a sper cold place maybe it is not nutritious enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients that [[ASIN:B001ET76GW Cetaphil Lotion]] lacks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick, but it helps moisturize.  </li>
            <li> but this is thick and unattractive to wear.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick, and we apply it after baths......</li>
            <li> (Not sure this is a word!).  </li>
            <li> I have small children and am always washing my hands and this is the only rescue from my hands drying, cracking and being extremely painful.    </li>
            <li> Thick but not greasy, lasts all day even on my crazy dry skin.</li>
            <li> * three or four hours if you can tolerate what feels like a thin oil slick on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount</li>
            <li> Seriously unbelievable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, I could already begin to feel my face drying up, and I could see the redness under my eyes appearing again.</li>
            <li> They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I have the worst skin.</li>
            <li> Winter is pretty awful for me.</li>
            <li> It is VERY thick, like cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a thin layer of something that you can feel in your skin when sweaty.</li>
            <li> I was never great about lotion on my face</li>
            <li> My daughter started getting ezcema at approximately three months of age.  </li>
            <li> However this year, my hands are so broken and chapped they&#x27;ve been bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is poor quality.</li>
            <li> any crap you can buy in store for same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply everywhere and let it air dry (quite chilly in the winter!).  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil failed me here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive moisturizers and serums (Exuvience, H2O, etc), and I haven&#x27;t gotten the results I did with this Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> (By the way, no need to buy expensive \\&quot;medical\\&quot; gloves--</li>
            <li> so use one after this or buy a moisturizer that does have SPF (those are expensive though).</li>
            <li> It is unsightly and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but I accepted the fact that unless I undergo an expensive therapy, the condition will prevail.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I got pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You just can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best cream ever made!</li>
            <li> BEEN USING SINCE 2008 AND WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER PRODUCT AGAIN. MY SKIN HAS NEVER BEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. MUST HAVE FOR DRY SKIN OR DARKER SKINNED PERSONS!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream.  I have combination skin with oily t-zone but my skin dries out near my cheeks, near my eyes and chin.  I use this cream twice a day--once at night after a shower and once in the morning after washing and cleaning my face.  A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft.  Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well.  No added scents!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Its quality same as legend,  Very suitable for my skin allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Can effectively inhibit the recurrence of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;But I buy it not to Contrast other price.</li>
            <li> as always cetaphil is the best</li>
            <li> I had a face rash from the dry winter months. Cetaphil is great for healing dry skin and plus its oderless. Great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product around my eyes at night for the last 15 years and I&#x27;m always being asked by people what I use because my skin looks so good. I tell them but they still want to believe I&#x27;m using some crazy expensive designer cream. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit heavy but on clean skin before going to bed it is the perfect moisturizer for the delicate skin around the eyes. I keep a small amount in a travel size bottle so I&#x27;m never without it.  Why would you waste money on expensive products made up of weird synthetic ingredients that can irritate your skin when something this simple and inexpensive works?</li>
            <li> I was just recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis and initially, this was the only thing that keept my skin moisturized. Then it seemed as if I need something thicker.  Cetaphil is good but not thick enough for the kind of moisturizing I need.  I no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 40 years and it is still excellent.  Ever so often I have been enticed away by other creams, but I always come back to this cream.  The lotion is great too.</li>
            <li> Uhh, did I get a bad batch? I love Cetaphil&#x27;s face wash, but this was a dud. I couldn&#x27;t use it on my face because it made me break out. It also was impossible to blend into the skin, leaving a white film for a few minutes until it soaked in on its own. When it did soak in it left a sticky feeling on my skin. Cetaphil failed me here.</li>
            <li> I moved to the high desert plains a couple of years ago and the combination of low humidity and hard water began to wreak havoc on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many different products at many price points, including some extremely expensive ones. Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy. This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low but I reuse small cream containers to make this \\&quot;portable\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin soft and supple. Doesn&#x27;t leave a scent. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Quite simply the best!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife after a referral to try it. Less than 24 hours after using this product any symtoms of dry skin or break outs of any kind were all but gone. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> My son has dry skin and his pediatrician recommended this.  He was using Aquaphor but the results were often temporary, too greasy, and took too long to absorb.  This is really a great product for my son, and has eliminated the dry patches.  The surprise came when I applied it to my face.  I have seborrheic dermatitis, and the treatment is a mild cortizone cream during break outs.  My skin is always dry on my face, even when it&#x27;s not during a break-out. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive moisturizers and serums (Exuvience, H2O, etc), and I haven&#x27;t gotten the results I did with this Cetaphil.  I have to layer the moisturizers and serums to get sufficient moisture.  What a find, after spending untold amounts of money looking for the perfect moisturizer(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a break-out, and I didn&#x27;t want the cortizone cream interact with my moisturizer, so decided to use the Cetaphil after washing. I was amazed that after a day or so, the results were beyond what I&#x27;ve ever achieved with the serums, moisturizers, and hydrating (everything) I&#x27;d purchased.  The moisture IS long-lasting and if it continues in this vein, I&#x27;ll have found my miracle moisturizer and at a fraction of the price I&#x27;ve paid in the past.  I&#x27;ll update in a little while and see if the results are long-lasting and don&#x27;t develop in break-outs (which they haven&#x27;t after two weeks). Also, the fact that it has no parabens is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin. I use it at night on my face and body and it hydrates me so well and never makes me break out. It&#x27;s unscented and super gentle.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I live in San Francisco where the weather and tap water dries out my skin badly. Tried a number of products in the past experiencing many caveats. It was until I had a skin infection when the dermatologist recommended this brand name. Tried once and voila! the perfect formulation for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People argue that the ingredients may be the same as regular moisturizers found elsewhere; however, the right formulation is important for absorption and skin protection. Yes, there is a thin layer of something that you can feel in your skin when sweaty. THAT is likely the thin layer that protects further dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also true that if you do hot yoga you may not be able to hold your arms, feet, legs or other body part when using this product. But hey! the key of this product here is to prevent side effects due to dry skin. Cetaphil works during normal human life, yoga? well, you can live with it, like a fish: slippery but swimming like a bird in the sky.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have to watch what I put on it.  I bought this after reading the numerous positive reviews.  While it did not cause burning etc., I did find it to be quite greasy.  I thought maybe I had applied too much but the results were the same on the second try.  I also purchased a product called CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (through [...]) and liked that much better.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and eczema, and my dermatologist recommended this product. It is the only moisturizing cream that worked for me. I found that it stays in the skin without giving the greasy or wet feeling that you have after applying other moisturizing creams.     Pros: Not greasy; does not feel wet; works really well for severely dry skin.    Cons: You still have to apply it daily... Oh well.     Botton line: go for it.</li>
            <li> This cream is teriffic for dry, chapped, cracked hands. This cream is totally non-irritating and totally fragrance free. I slather it on at night and wear a pair of inexpensive white cotton gloves, although you don&#x27;t really need them because the cream is not greasy. [[ASIN:B000BMS22U White Cotton Parade Gloves]] (By the way, no need to buy expensive \\&quot;medical\\&quot; gloves--the cheap ones work fine.) Works like a charm! Also keeps cuticles soft and preserves that manicure. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well, I love this cream.  I have been using all kinds of moisturizing cream for the kids family but nothing is better than this one so far.  It&#x27;s quite rich but doesn not feel greesy, as the cream is very aborbant and leaves a fresh feeling on your skin. It keeps the kids&#x27; skin well moisturized and soft and it&#x27;s very soothing to the touch.  I normally don&#x27;t use it on my face but only hands and legs, but if I run out of my facial cream I use it on my face too and it feels just as great.  I probably could just use this one as well.  It&#x27;s a must have for our family now.</li>
            <li> This Cetaphil product has fulfilled all my expectations!  It is clean and light with no strong perfume smell.  It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me feel like I&#x27;ve been dipped in a vat of oil.  Most of all, it moisturizes my skin, especially in the winter months where the heater drys out skin and makes it itchy and flaky.  It is light enough to use anytime--under makeup or before bed. I&#x27;ve tried several creams and I love this one!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been suffering from eczema since she was a baby.  I pretty much tried everything, including the ointment prescribed by the doctor.  I didn&#x27;t really want to use the medicated ointment, because of the cortizone.  I also realize that eczema is an inflammation of the skin caused by various factors, including certain food items.  I tried restricting certain food from her diet, but I found it extremely difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I did some research, and I tried the following combination:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omega liquid (2 times a day) - good for brain development, skin etc&lt;br /&gt;Chewable pro-biotic tablets (2 times a day) - she thinks it&#x27;s candy (I heard positive things about this)&lt;br /&gt;Cataphil cream (2 times a day -  once in the morning before daycare and once right after bath)&lt;br /&gt;Switched her soap to \\&quot;SOAP WORKS\\&quot; olive oil bar, which is normally found in health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have been following the above method for about a month, and I can honestly say her skin has improved significantly.  Her dry patches are pretty much all gone and her skin is glowing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe the above combo is helping out, but I need to give a huge credit to CETAPHIL.  I tried everything, yet this cream is by far the best I have tried on her.  It goes on so easily, it is greaseless, yet moisturizes beatifully.  AWESOME PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it as a facial lotion. This tub has lasted me over a year and I use it on a daily basis. I have extremely sensitive skin and this lotion hasn&#x27;t irritated my face at all. It also has NO smell at all, no weird chemical smells or anything. It goes on a tad bit greasy if you use too much, but it quickly absorbs. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne. When I don&#x27;t use this product, my face gets really dry like it usually does, but it works great when I use it. If I had to pick a con, it would be that I hate that this product is in a tub.....since it lasts so long, I don&#x27;t like the thought of dipping my hands into a tub, it feels unsanitary. If you accidentally forget to put the lid on, the product gets hard at the top......either way, whatever. It still works great.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my pediatrician and sister who also uses it on her child. I love it! It is very soothing and moisturizing, especially when you are washing your hands a million times a day after changing diapers. It keeps my baby&#x27;s skin soft and my hands from drying out. It&#x27;s great for the whole family.</li>
            <li> solid all purpose cream</li>
            <li> I love this.  My dermatologist has always told me to use cetaphil because I have acne.  I was actually using the cetaphil facial moisturizer for a while until I tried this.  I like it a lot better because it moisturizes my face a lot better than the other.      I use it on my face and neck every time I wash my face (morning and night).  It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick, but it helps moisturize.  It Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, oily, or sticky either.  Another plus is that it lasts forever if you use it for mainly your face.  I&#x27;m guilty for using in on the dry patches on my arms though!</li>
            <li> Old Review [See Update Below]: if you have a membership atyour local sams club, they sell a 20 oz bottle for $11, while amazon is selling 16 oz bottles for $13; lesser quantity higher price.  Update: 11/10/2011 : Looks like Amazon has reduced the price to ~$10 for the 16 Oz bottles to match Sams price. Way to go Amazon! might actually be cheaper on Amazon now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and both my g/f and I use this. It&#x27;s a nice cream that doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it, I use it on my face mostly and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or anything. It doesn&#x27;t have an SPF so use one after this or buy a moisturizer that does have SPF (those are expensive though). It&#x27;s white colored, and if I have any stubble it does leave my stubble white until it dries. I just keep rubbing at it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> At first it felt a bit greesy but my skin absord it. My dry condition has improve a lot in two days. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m anal.  I pour over reviews for hours before making a purchase.  It was so well worth the effort in finding the Cetaphil cream!  This cream is light weight, but works wonderfully.  I really don&#x27;t understand the few reviewers who said this cream was heavy or greasy.  At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers, this cream is fabulous!  I purchased a chemical peel that recommended this product for use after treatment and I am so glad I did.  No breakouts, hydrated skin and a steal compared to the other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams out there.  Also, my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft.  No more oily/greasy feeling on my hands and legs as with other moisturizers.  Plain and simple, this product works!  Thank you Amazon.  Your review system, lightening fast shipping and unlimited selection of products keeps me coming back again and again.</li>
            <li> My kids have eczema. I was walking around Walmart looking at soap section. A woman saw my kids and told me to use Cetaphil soap/body wash followed by Cetaphil cream. My kids are 9 and 10.  I ask them how their skin feel after using the Moisturing Cream. The 9 year old said her skin felt softer and smoother. The 10 years shares the same opinion. I felt it was softer too.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually got me to write a review.  This is the best moisturizer ever - no fragrance, non-greasy, also good for babies.  Great for dry and combo skins.  I ever use this for my chapped lips too. I have tried every other product in the market.But this is an amazing product.  I got to know about this product from a sample from a doctor&#x27;s office. And now I am glued to this :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big lotion person, but I don&#x27;t like dry, itchy skin either. This lotion is perfect. No smell, non-greasy and super effective. It goes on easily, esp. after showering. It keeps my skin nice and moisturized even during the winter months. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other brands--this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one that prevents my extremely dry skin from getting chapped. cracked, and red. And the best part is that it isn&#x27;t nearly as goopy as most of its competitors. (I&#x27;ve tried them all.)</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin/psoriasis and I have tried all of the moisturizers in the world that claim to relieve dry skin but Cetaphil is the only cream that has ever saved me. It&#x27;s really great for any skin type and I recommend it to everyone. It seems like it would be greasy but when its put on, it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling. I&#x27;m pretty sure that if I didn&#x27;t use it, I&#x27;ll have horribly dry/ peeling skin all over my face and look twenty years older than I actually do because of it. It&#x27;s so wonderful! CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend, but Cetaphil is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I do have very very dry skin and this is a WONDERFUL moistuizer!  I Love it.  If you are like me and have dry skin get this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much! J</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I have the worst skin. I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life, and followed me to adulthood. My skin is extremely sensitive and easily gets dry and on a weird day, very oily in some parts. I&#x27;ve tried just about every moisturizer out there that promises to be gentle enough to sensitive skin and would moisturize, but nothing has done it as well as the Cetaphil cream. Its quite thick, and may be a little uncomfortable when first using it, but once you get used to it, it will be worth it. It is definitely non irritating, and it moisturizes very well. My skin feels comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t sting on contact, and moisturizerization lasts throughout most of the day.</li>
            <li> I have Psoriasis, so my choices of cleansing/lotion product is very limited.  I have been using Cetaphil before my dermatologist recommended it.  I do not see any reason to change.  It goes on easy with no smell.  The cream may feel a bit oily when first applied.  But it is quickly absorbed/dried up, leaving my skin feel nice and natural.  I like the cream much more than the pump moisturizer.  The pump kind feels watered down and do not offer as much protection as the cream.  The cream just feels better and long lasting.  My wife does not have great skin either.  In winter, the dry condition really give her fits.  But with Cetaphil, she does not have nearly as much trouble as before.  We even use it on my daughter since she was born.  To date, no issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, with that big jar, it can last a long time.  So it is very economical as well.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist friend has this all over his home... he&#x27;s got two little kids.... so I figured there might be something to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bit pricey but I can see how this will last me awhile.... I like to use it on my drier bits... feet, knees, elbows, face, etc. I was never great about lotion on my face but when I&#x27;ve used this, it&#x27;s been kind of awesome.... it just love that it feels so rich but so neutral... I guess that&#x27;s the point... don&#x27;t want it to aggravate the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured I&#x27;d splurge a little in my mission to become better friends with my skin. I figure if I get a good running start now, I can look more youthful even as my body has other plans ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like this cream!</li>
            <li> My baby girl has had dry skin and rash issues since she was 3 months old.  This is by far the best product on the market and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  Plus it does not leave the skin greasy and it does last all day.</li>
            <li> Very light, non-sticky.  Scentless.  Excellent moisturizing!  My mother took this cream with her to hospice care; the nurses there loved it and asked where they could get it.</li>
            <li> My doctor turned me on to this cream when I was 31 because I was breaking out on my face and it has worked better than any other moisturizer for me for the last 15 years. Now at age 46, it still doesn&#x27;t cause outbreaks and works like a charm on my face as well as an all over body lotion. It isn&#x27;t billed as a wrinkle cream, but when I use it on my face and compare to other facial lotions, I see a better result from Cetaphil in smoothing the fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes. It&#x27;s great for super dry hands in the winter months. I&#x27;ve tried top name brands since like Nivea, Olay and Eucerin when they come out with something \\&quot;newer and better\\&quot; but nothing has topped this.</li>
            <li> Longtime favorite of mine,,, wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Cream moisturized as expected. Would recommend this product to friends and family. Worked well, especially on very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is as plain of lotion as it gets which is a huge plus in my eyes.  Use it just after the shower to lock in moisture. Great product for those who do not want to smell like stinky lotion.  I keep at least 2 tubs at home and one at work.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter uses this for Eczema and it has helped a lot. The price was also wonderful, especially for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and during a recent trip, I developed bad eczema on my hands and fingers from using antibacterial soaps and lotions.  Regular hand lotions (like Lubriderm) didn&#x27;t help.  When I returned home, my dermatologist  prescribed cortisone meds for my eczema. He also suggested I use Cetaphil moisturizing cream on a regular basis for all my skin. Being reluctant to use even more cortisone stuff, I decided instead to lavishly and frequently apply  cetaphil in an effort to avoid them.  And it worked!  Within a day, the eczema started healing.  And in a week my skin was cleared up. And all the healing took place without cortisone. Can&#x27;t say enough praise for Cetaphil moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and my dermatologist recommended I use Cetaphil Moisturizine Cream or Eucerin Calming Cream, I ordered both and liked the Cetaphil cream better because it felt less oily. Both creams work for dry skin but Cetaphil is my preference. If I could order it in larger tubs I would.    I use it everyday after I get out of the shower. It is a must have if you have eczema or dry skin.</li>
            <li> A large tank, used method Body Milk Hand Cream, feeling pretty good, sometimes long face acne, it is also used, can repair, second days is very magical, will consider it has been used</li>
            <li> Since 1995 I was diagnosed with psoriasis. I follow the therapy prescribed and have been living as close to normal as possible. Psoriasis is a condition wherein certain areas of your body, the skin matures at a very accelerated pace. I get the new skin to dead skin cycle twice in a day. It is unsightly and uncomfortable. I use a medication which retards the process but I accepted the fact that unless I undergo an expensive therapy, the condition will prevail. The Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has relieved me of much discomfort due to the constant flaking of my skin. I sleep well at nights not waking up to the itchiness and the sandpaper roughness brought about by the psoriasis. Though not a medicine, Cetaphil&#x27;s action has done much to alleviate the discomfort that I used to bear.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, which erupts into eczema whenever I&#x27;m not careful about exposing myself to really strong doses of reality, and this lotion is the only thing that helps short of steroid cream. After every shower, I have to re-bathe myself in this stuff. It&#x27;s the best product out there for the chronically moistureless. Don&#x27;t waste your time with other products.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very low humidity (summer seldom more than around 30% and winter usually around 10%) and as a result have problems with dry skin.  I also have severe allergies and develop sensitivity to moisturizers after a few weeks.  This one works and I have no problems developing sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like this cream as much as I do.  It&#x27;s an excellent value and I don&#x27;t plan to be without it in the future.  Cetaphil now sits on my bathroom vanity and is used as a routine moisturizer for my face, elbows, arms and any other moisturizing needs.   The scent is clean and very minimal so it doesn&#x27;t iterfere or offend.   It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.    Excellent product and a terrific value.    The glowing reviews here were my reason for trying it and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years . It is wonderful, keeps my skin hydrated and silky soft&lt;br /&gt;Love that I can have it delivered automatically</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy formula is what makes it one of the best creams available out there. Plus non smelly. Those give me a headache! My skin feels so soft &amp; nourished after every application.</li>
            <li> Twice a day for chronic dry skin.  Moistens my hands and feet right up.  Doesn&#x27;t smell much like anything.  Not a runny lotion.  I doubt its good to eat.  Keep it on a hot window sill and then shake it open like champagne in a rap video, mouth aggressively agape.  RAAAAAAAAAAA!</li>
            <li> Like many people out there, my face is fairly sensitive to most face washes. All the brands I&#x27;ve used, including Clearasil, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, H20, Cetaphil face wash, and Purpose, have a tendency to dry the skin beneath my eyes and leave noticeable red marks there as well. I was very self-conscious about how I looked, so much, in fact, that I had my girlfriend carry around moisturizing cream for me at all times to combat the dryness beneath my eyes (sad, I know). Being the stubborn person that I am, I did not want to waste money or time seeking the advice of a Dermatologist, so I tried different types of lotions to see if any of them would remedy my problem. I tried Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, Aloe, Jergens, CeVere, and even Vaseline at times. Those products helped to fight the flaky skin beneath my eyes, but my relief was only temporary, and both the flaky skin and the red marks continued to be a problem notwithstanding my constant application of those lotions to my face. Eventually, I started using only water to wash my face because I was so concerned about my dry skin, which, obviously, was quite nasty for me.    My relief finally came in the form of Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream. Pursuant to my brother&#x27;s advice, I tried washing my face again with one of my many face washes (I think it was Clearasil or Purpose). Not surprisingly, I could already begin to feel my face drying up, and I could see the redness under my eyes appearing again. I immediately applied Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream afterward. To my surprise, the thick cream completely smoothed out the dry skin and removed the redness under my eyes - neither conditions were even remotely noticeable. What&#x27;s more, the effect lasted the entire day. Obviously, I cannot speak on behalf of everyone and claim that they&#x27;ll experience similar, instantaneous relief, but I now use Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream every time I wash my face, and ever since I&#x27;ve started that regimen, neither my face nor my eyes have dried up.    My only complaint about Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream is that the tube is huge and inconvenient to travel with at times, but it is a small price to pay to avoid the self-consciousness I felt at having flaky, red skin beneath my eyes. Also, I would advise anyone using this product to apply it in small, fingertip-sized amounts at first. The cream is relatively thick, so a little can go a long way. It&#x27;ll also help to avoid the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; look that many facial creams often leave behind. The nice thing about Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream is that you can purchase it almost anywhere, and it is much cheaper than a lot of the more expensive creams out there that, in my experience, don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is wonderful, and is my routine night cream for my face!&lt;br /&gt;Scent: no scent.&lt;br /&gt;Oily: Not at all, just don&#x27;t use too much!&lt;br /&gt;It is very inexpensive, and hydrates my skin like no other cream has. Also great to bring along on trips- since it serves as an all body moisturizer (body + face!)&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT. you have to try it.</li>
            <li> Super rich cream that goes on smooth and melts into skin quickly.  Great for these extra dry winters.  No scent, which I like.</li>
            <li> My family has extremely dry skin and we live in a very harsh climate. I order these in pairs from Amazon so we always have enough. This is a thick cream that is fragrance and dye free, which is great since my little one is allergic to dyes and fragrances. She is actually allergic to soap and eventually we switched her to Cetaphil cleanser and that did the trick-clean hands without the rash. The price here is so much lower than anywhere else we have found. We go through a few of these a winter!</li>
            <li> i use this at night time; i have slightly oily and sometimes acne skin; but i still need a moisturizer;  it is not greasy and i can even wear it under makeup if needed.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that reacts severely to a number of chemicals found in a lot of skincare products. After a few bouts with face-swelling trips to the allergy doctor, she prescribed a special moisturizer that I could only get from the drug store. I tried this and while it worked great, it also cost $$$. When I mentioned this to the pharmacist, she recommended I try Cetaphil. That was over five years ago and it still is working like a dream. I put it on after my shower in the morning and at night just before bed. Not only have I not had any type of reaction to this product, but my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  Referred to me by a doctor&#x27;s assistant.  Works well and does not have a fragrance to interfere with any other fragranced item you may apply.</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended this when our 3-mo. old had moderate eczema, and after 1 or 2 uses, we had a baby with very beautiful skin. To this day, he&#x27;s 14 mo. old now, we still use it every night after his bath. Great for infants and toddlers.</li>
            <li> First of all, an official disclaimer: as a typical red-blooded American dude, I have limited knowledge in moisturizing products.  So take this review with a grain of salt.  Or maybe a drink or three.  Whichever makes me sound wise and legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... my skin tends to get a bit dry and itchy as the cool &amp; dry fall/winter air settles in.  I was pointed to Cetaphil by my dermatologist.  Being the nice non-compliant patient that I am, I never bothered to actually look up the product and try it out.  It wasn&#x27;t until my loving sister who graciously donated a half-used jar to my cause that I had a chance to sample Cetaphil.  At first, it didn&#x27;t really do much.  Then my sister kindly pointed out with minimum name-calling and moderate eye-rolling that I was using way not enough of this stuff.  So I used more and what do you know - it actually helped a lot!  After going through that first jar, I looked around and Amazon seems to have the best deal.  So I bought the 2-pack and called it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick suggestion - use this immediately after you get out of the shower, when your skin is pruny from all the moisture.  This will help \\&quot;lock\\&quot; all that nice moisture in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because my gf saw this and said, \\&quot;oh, you&#x27;re using the old people moisturizer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I cover my face and neck with Cetaphil every night and especially love how it soaks in after using the [[ASIN:B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment Kit]] (which I use two or three times a week).The results have been amazing to say the least!  I just turned 39 and am starting to see some signs of aging and just really dull skin.  But thanks to these two products, my husband (who doesn&#x27;t notice these things) says my skin now looks \\&quot;very healthy.\\&quot;  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of Cetaphil; it really works, especially in the very dry climate of Colorado.</li>
            <li> cannot live with out my cetaphil. I am someone who has extremely dry skin and have tried everything out there. This is the only product that has worked for me for years!!!</li>
            <li> The first use of the product, down effect can also be suitable for everyday use!If the price is able to offer some better!</li>
            <li> On my doctor&#x27;s advice I started using Cetaphil products. I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it. I always apply this cream before going to sleep at night followed up by an application the following day. During particularly dry seasons, I may apply this cream several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works. I suffer from very dry skin and Atopic Dermatitis. Applying the Cetaphil cream seems to help alleviate these skin conditions. What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented. Sensitive skin, like mine, can be irritated by perfumed lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reommend.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that dries quickly in the winter months if I do not moisturize.  This is the only cream I have found that keeps my skin soft and free of \\&quot;winter rash\\&quot;. I have been using it for three years and will not change now.  I love that it is fragrance-free and doesn&#x27;t compete with a light touch of my favorite perfume or scented hand cream. I do not consider this cream overly oily and find that I get great results applying it immediately after toweling off following showering.  No reapplication is necessary until the next day&#x27;s shower. Great product and great value!</li>
            <li> I tried this product a couple of years ago and have switched form Lubriderm to Cetaphil.  Great long lasting moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> Very good  for dry skin  lasts a long time  inexpensive</li>
            <li> my husband suffers from a sort of skin rash itchy disease around his foot and ankle and this help him. its a really great trusted brand and lasts forever. plus you can a get a two pack on subscribe and save auto ship. no brainer.</li>
            <li> Plagued by dry skin as I got older, I tried everything I could find.  Finally, a dermatologist told me that the key word to look for is &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.  She said that if a product comes in a pump bottle or is called a lotion, it won&#x27;t do the job - they may feel good but your skin is still going to crack and bleed if you&#x27;ve got seriously dry skin.  So I tried tubs of skin cream and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great product for my baby&#x27;s dry skin!</li>
            <li> Our son has eczema and our pediatrician recommended either Cetaphil or Aquaphor.  We tried both and like the cetaphil much better.  We also highly recommend the cream versus the lotion.  The cream absorbs better and appears to keep his sensitive skin better moisturized than the lotion version.  It also rubs in better and seems to last longer, especially if we put it on within a few minutes of his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchase this on our subscribe and save to save additional money!</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver i looked so bad with my skin so dry, and this makes it so smooth! 100% RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I love it.  I have extremely dry skin and when I use this it soaks right into my skin to leave it feeling softer and moister.  The only problem I have is that I have to repeat application in a few hours--that is how dry my skin is!  I have used the Cetaphil lotion and the cleanser and like them also.  I have never noticed a &#x27;greasy feeling&#x27; after using this cream and haven&#x27;t had a film build up on my skin; as I stated above, my skin soaks it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I was using cheap moisturizers for over 2 years and they didn&#x27;t really do much. I became skeptical about moisturizers in general until I tried this product. I use it every day on my face and I feel so....MOIST!  It feels wonderful. I use it for acne but I think anyone would feel better using this. It actually works. Wonderful. Glad I tried it. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have consistantly used this product for years. My skin is sensitive and dry, especially in the winter.  A very little amount goes a long way.  It is great under make-up as a moisturizer.  My daughter lives in Colorado where it is very dry in the winter, and she just loves it when I send Cetaphil to her for her birthday. The fact that Cetaphil is fragrance free is just another big plus.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this product to be used instead of J&amp;J or other kinds of baby lotion products.  The 2-pack is a great value.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil products have helped me go from complaining about itchy legs and extremely dry feet to recommending all of the cetaphil products to my family.  The cream hydrates the skin and the soap doesn&#x27;t stripe the skin of it&#x27;s natural barriers.  It&#x27;s a costly product, but Amazon always seems to come up with the best prices and free shipping for this product.</li>
            <li> Works well without any added scents. Even though it is heavy, it does not grease up your skin for hours or leave grease stains on your clothes. Great for outdoor hands or fighting winter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is truly fragrance-free and does not cause an allergic reaction on my skin like so many other products do. At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the Cetaphil cream because I thought it was greasy, but with a few days use I realized that I was using too much. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This winter has been brutal on my skin -- especially my hands -- but Cetaphil had made them soft again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin creams on the market. We&#x27;ve tried a great deal of brands, and this one works quickly.</li>
            <li> Or it seemed so at the time. I was suffering from very dry skin and skin allergies and this product was the only thing that didn&#x27;t irritate it even more.    I&#x27;m a lifelong itcher. My skin is dry. I have eczema, dermatitis, allergies. It seems there&#x27;s always something that makes my skin itchy whether it&#x27;s wool clothing, drying cold winter air, or simply my skin conditions. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything over the years but regular lotions - even the fragrance-free, dermatologist-recommended ones - don&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena, Aquaphor, Lubriderm, etc. There are great applications for each of those but as a general moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make itchiness worse and really seems to moisturize gently, Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream does the trick. Creams, lotions, and petroleum-based moisturizers all feel differently and work differently. Some irritate my skin, some don&#x27;t. So far, this cream has not disappointed me in any way. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my physician!  I&#x27;ve been using it for face and hands for years.  It&#x27;s fragrance free which is great for me since I&#x27;m sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! This was recommended by my wife&#x27;s dermatologist friend who said that this will help her reduce stretchmarks during her pregnancy. I&#x27;ve been using it for myself too with dry skin. It&#x27;s definitely fragrance free as advertised and also doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling as long as you don&#x27;t slather too much on at once.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders on my new baby who has eczema.  I use it on my face too, it is not greasy and does not make me break-out.  It&#x27;s thick enough to feel good going on, yet absorbs quickly. Its great!</li>
            <li> From frequent washing, my hands dry out, crack and bleed during the winter months. My son also has this problem. After trying almost every proudcut, he found Cetaphil and told me about it. It is the only moisturizer that actually heals my skin. I was buying it at Wal-Mart but I do not believe they carry it any more. I finally found it at Walgreens for $14.99 for one jar. I will be buying it from Amazon from now on. You cant&#x27; beat the price for 2 jars!</li>
            <li> I received my product on time, just we need to try it to confirm the quality...thanks!! Excellent</li>
            <li> My daughter started getting ezcema at approximately three months of age.  It itches her really bad and she scratched a lot which left scratches on her arms and legs.  I went to my pediatrician and we tried switching her formula but that didn&#x27;t work.  Hydrocortizone helps a little, but I feel very against putting chemicals on her body.  I think the next step is going to be a pediatric dermatologist, but I&#x27;m waiting for the summer weather to be over first to see if there&#x27;s improvement.  (A lot of people will tell you that eczema is aggravated by hot weather.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine for my daughter consists of regular quick baths and lots of hydration.  Some people believe in not wetting the babies, but I find that disgusting because babies sweat too which adds up to impurities and stink.  So I don&#x27;t soak her for a long time, but I do make sure she&#x27;s clean.  Every time I bathe her or change her diaper, I cream her with Cetaphil.  I apply it generously and hold her a while or leave her in the play pen before putting clothes on while the cream absorbs.  It keeps her skin soft and clear.  I also do weekly oatmeal baths, and when it&#x27;s on sale I get aveeno cream too (you will go through a lot of cream with a baby who has ezcema).  The routine worked well and she was perfect until the summer months.  Thus, I&#x27;m pretty sure the hot weather is a contributing factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to recommend comfortable cotton clothing and frequent clothing changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aim for reapplying lotion every hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cetaphil cream on here, I bought two for twenty.  I have yet to find a better deal in the market or drug stores.  The cream feels light and wet between your fingers.  It has no smell or taste, and is safe if baby puts her hands in her mouth after application.  I also use aquafor but it is very thick and gets clothing messy because it never dries.  I like Cetaphil a lot and will continue to use and will also continue to purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> I began using this after every shower (has to be the cream, not the lotion), and it&#x27;s 10x more effective than any steroid cream, UVB light, etc. that I&#x27;ve ever tried for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the cetaphil in the jar.  It&#x27;s incredibly thick but absorbs quickly and without leaving a greasy feeling behind. I used it head to toe throughout my pregnancy and it relieved the itching much better than any other cream i tried.  My three month old had developed eczema and dry, chapped, winter skin and after just a few days this cream had completely cleared up the problems.  It is really fragrance free (literaly no smell unlike many other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;) and I would highly recommend it to anyone as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cetaphil cream for almost 20 years. I have dry skin and cetaphil cream is one of the few creams/lotions that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel more dry after using it. Cetaphil cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized all the time. Even though I have very sensitive skin, I use cetaphil on my face too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the fragrance free moisturizing creams.  I have had psoriasis for decades and it really does the job.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and doesn&#x27;t make me itchier, like many other creams do.  Highly recommend it.  And it&#x27;s a great price when you buy the 2 pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great for acne prone skin. It&#x27;s kind of greasy and oily feeling. I do recommend if you have dry knees or elbows. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent which is good if you are allergic to fragrance filled products. Recommend for body use only.</li>
            <li> I will add a &amp;#34;me too&amp;#34; positive comment, this stuff is great.  I have very dry hands in the Winter, after applying they feel great.  Absorbs fairly quickly, not as greasy as other brands, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie.  I have bought every expensive cream, lotion, anti-aging product out there and spent tons of money doing so.  This cream is amazing.  Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my skin in case this helps:  I have very dry skin that is prone to break out.  I felt I had wrinkled prematurely because of sun damage so I was focusing mostly on the wrinkles when I bought products.  Often my forehead would be flakey and my chin would have breakouts.  Frequently I had red patches on my skin and a very uneven skin tone in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Cetaphil:  I have NONE of the flakiness and have not had one single break out.  Also, my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated.  Cetaphil has seriously taken ten years off my face and body.  Oddly the place that I can tell the most difference is in my neck as I don&#x27;t have that crepeiness (Not sure this is a word!).  I&#x27;ve thrown everything away and have started stockpiling this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER had a product that made such a difference.  My make up now looks better, I actually glow and I don&#x27;t feel like I look my age anymore.  I use it on my whole body and for the first time ever, I have an even skin tone.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing Cream.  Nice and thick and perfect for those of us on Accutane.  My skin is super dry and I have been using the Cetaphil lotion on my face and body.  I actually ordered this by mistake and I am so glad I did.  I use it at night to deep moisturize my dry flaky face.  I still use the lotion during the day under makeup.  Never makes me breakout and soothes the itchy dryness.</li>
            <li> it is very useful for me, especially in autumn and winter part of my body starts to be very dry</li>
            <li> Nothing new to explain of the product it is as u seen in any other store , there is no difference of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter because when she started teething she developed very dry skin under her neck. This cream helped tremendously!  We put it on her at least twice a day and now the dry skin has cleared up! We now use after her bath time every night. One down side is that when using it all over the baby gets a bit slippery.. but that is with most lotions and creams... all in all the product did what we bought it for!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Targette&#x27; (Target) b/c my hands were so chapped I couldn&#x27;t wait for mail order. I (like most of you) am dealing with \\&quot;Snow-pocalypse 2014\\&quot;. This bitter cold weather has my paws in terrible shape. I usually get a little dry skin in the winter time, and have been using Vaseline for Men in the past. However this year, my hands are so broken and chapped they&#x27;ve been bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vaseline did nothing but burn and the smell is really pungent. I tried some Lubriderm to no avail. My hands just ended up greasy and smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Cetaphil as the reviews said it was neither greasy nor smelly. I&#x27;ll be honest I didn&#x27;t expect much. Much to my surprise... THIS STUFF ROCKS! It dissolves quickly and doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything. Most importantly though, it doesn&#x27;t burn and is very soothing. I paid about $9.90 at Target for one container so 2 for $20 is about right as far as price. Well worth the  money.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughters use this for everything along with Cetaphil gentle facial wash, they think this is great stuff. This is their go to cream.</li>
            <li> I love tlhis product. It keeps my entire body soft and smooth. Long lasting  lasting moisture for baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatoligist recommended this cream for my body (Not face though), as a preventive measure for my dermatitis.  After five days my skin is super soft and my dermatitis is fading away.  I use it every morning and night in all my body except my face.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis since I was six years old, now I&#x27;m thirteen. Throughout the years I have tried many products, all in which haven&#x27;t worked. Cetaphil has helped my skin clear up. My psoriasis has improved by a lot since I first began using this product. This product truly works for dried skin, eczema, and more.</li>
            <li> Love this. Have auditor years</li>
            <li> The only cream that works for severe eczema! My 2 yo suffering allergy and her skin get irritate easy and cetaphil is the only cream that works for her eczema, we have tried a lot of other brand but this cream is magic!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion/cream I have ever used. I apply it after I shower and it stays on my skin all day. It also has no scent.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil. I tried the lotion and the face wash and honestly nothing special. Then I saw this in Costco while looking for my daughter&#x27;s cream (she has ezcema) and thought \\&quot;why not try this\\&quot;. I fell in love with this cream after the first try. This is woooonnnderful!&lt;br /&gt;It has a non greasy feel, doesnt leave skin sticky, lathers and absorbs really nicely and quick enough for my toddler to get her clothes on post bath time. I also love it for myself on my arms and shoulders (i dont use this for my face though). I find that this doesnt clog my pores, since I have acne prone skin on my chest, back and shoulders I was worried it would be a problem there. Nope not at all. I live in a very cold climate and with the drying heat always being on, I get dry patches of skin, this will eliminate them 90% overnight and totally by the next day. Im so happy I finally found something that works well with my sensitive skin and acne. :)</li>
            <li> Just great cream, not sticky or too thick.</li>
            <li> best cream for dealing with dry skin and eczema as well as diaper rash, used by everyone int he house</li>
            <li> I first tried using the Cetaphil facial cleanser. It worked okay for my skin, so I decided to try out this cream too (since Cetaphil products have been known as good treatment for sensitive skin). I used it on both facial and neck area. Result: my face - break out pretty bad, my neck - dry out like snake&#x27;s shedded skin. Guess I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> The price of the moisturizing cream is a very good deal in my country. What i can get off the shelf is double the price for the same volumetric size. So it is already a good buy. Over and above, the Cetaphil moisturizing cream is mild and does not leave a oily feel after the application. It moisturise deep and well. Worthy product</li>
            <li> I got this tip from a co-worker who&#x27;s daughter had terrible acne-I use it as a body lotion and also on my face.  There is no oily residue</li>
            <li> I love these products and sent an order of Cetaphil  moisturizing cream and the Cetaphil body wash to my sister.  I only found out yesterday that she received the moisturizing cream  and absolutely loves it, but. never received the body wash.  Five months down the road I really don&#x27;t think that I can do anything about it.  I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon for years and has only had one other problelm. The merchandise went back and I was reimbursed.  I will continue to buy this product from amazon site and when sending merchandise to others will make sure I check to make sure they receive the full purchase.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughters, wife and I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so much better than over marketed, yet ineffective, lotions from any of the fortune 500 companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pharmacist and make-up artist shared that both Cetaphil cream and cleaner products are dermatologist recommended if not prescribed.</li>
            <li> The best body moisturizer for all skin types. It&#x27;s second to none and you can just buy it without any second thought.</li>
            <li> Good Choice for me. It can keep my head and face away from dry. And it is no Fagrance, I like it. Just suit for me</li>
            <li> A welcome relief for very dry skin! Feels like you have given your skin a drink of water. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product! Though costly, it&#x27;s worth every penny. My skin rejoices!</li>
            <li> I wont be using any other moisturizing cream.  I love that it has no smell and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> We went to the dermatologist and ask her how she kept her skin looking so good.  She said all she uses is cetaphil.  So now we have been using the moisturizing cream for about 5 years.  It really does a great job.  Not greasy or sticky. Very light feel to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years since I had a breakout at 25 of dermatitis. It cleared the dermatitis right up and as long as I use it every day, I don&#x27;t have any other problems.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this lotion does wonders. I love it for me and my young sons. it is the best lotion i have found so far. call me crazy I think my stretch marks are fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and my problem was that I live in an exceptionally dry climate and my skin is susceptible to breaking out.  This stuff is great, I have never found a better product for moisturizing.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily and there is 0 scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my dermatologist suggested this product.  It really had made my dry skin much softer and quite smooth and the dry itchy skin has calmed down.</li>
            <li> Our family fights eczema and other allergy-induced skin ailments. Cetaphil is by far the best lotion/moisturizer on the market for treatment of these problems (and we have tried many).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a side benefit: it is non-greasy and does NOT stain clothing.</li>
            <li> Well, you&#x27;ve no doubt heard from some other reviewers that cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizing lotion formula is greasy so I won&#x27;t beat that into the ground. It does bother me that a product with the &#x27;lightweight&#x27; and &#x27;non-greasy&#x27; monikers does not live up to expectations. However, if you put a very very small amount of water into the bottle (several drops), just enough to curtail the thick viscosity, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that the product does the job. If you are looking for a non-comodegenic, hypo-allergenic product then this is for you. If you are also looking for an oil-free product, then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Works great for my boys with excema--we use this in the summer (and Aquaphor in the winter) because it&#x27;s lighter, not greasy, and not scented. Great price here compared to regular big box stores-especially with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I have been using for over 5 years for dry skin.  It is a very good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> great for skin that can&#x27;t have fragrance or dyes.  keeps skin moist without getting greasy</li>
            <li> The best product to use for adult and children who have skin conditions and allergic to fragrance and fabric with fragrances on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews. I tried it for a week and it&#x27;s TERRIBLE. Super greasy, doesn&#x27;t sink in easily and it clogs pores! Needless to say, I got pimples all over my face. The acne went away after I stopped using this cream. It&#x27;s better to use this on areas like elbows and knees because it&#x27;s really greasy. I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best. Moisturizes well and non-irritating. Its also a firm cream so it lasts longer in my opinion than other lotions.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for me to use in the winter. I use another, more expensive cream regularly, but if it is a particularly very dry winter, I will use this cream at night. It is light, non-greasy, and has the same reputation as the Cetaphil washing lotion. It is designed for severely dry skin. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin areas prone to dryness like hands, feet and elbows, yet it’s even gentle enough for my face. It&#x27;s non–greasy and absorbs quickly. Once applied, it leaves my skin feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the information, &amp;#34;Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has quality humectants, emollients and occlusive agents that provide intense, long–lasting hydration. These attributes of the cream make it ideally suited for dry, sensitive skin and symptoms of dry skin associated with eczema and psoriasis.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply as often as needed, usually in the morning and before bed. For best results, use directly after bathing, wetting the skin or washing hands. I use it with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser to cleanse my skin before moisturizing. It is recommended by dermatologists and pediatricians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 01-08-14</li>
            <li> i bought it long time ago and i still have it . its very moisturizing and it dry fast i use for my body and feet</li>
            <li> This item can be purchased OTC however some pharmacies and grocery stores were out of it.It is a wonderful product,and was shipped quickly,to my home.I swim,and it is perfect for the entire body,especially after showering.And great for sensitive,and baby skin.A terrific product.Do not buy the generic in the stores,as this product is superior,and worth the extra pennies to have the name brand.</li>
            <li> Like Aquaderm but without the smell. A suggestion by a family member and I had to try it out because of dry skin. It arrived safely and intact. Will have to use and update on the effectiveness. Tried it on and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sticky with fast absorption. Will update with results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 10 years. My dermatologist recommended it to me for my mild eczema. His tip, which makes all the difference in the world, is to apply it after a bath/shower while there are still beads of water on the skin. Works every time! If I apply it without wet skin it works okay but not as good. I no longer have eczema problems but still use this product for my severely dry skin. If I go without it for too long I swear I&#x27;d turn into a pile of dust. I use it everywhere: legs, arms, tummy, even my face (which I don&#x27;t recommend if you have acne prone skin). I have small children and am always washing my hands and this is the only rescue from my hands drying, cracking and being extremely painful.    As long as this stuff is being made I will buy it.</li>
            <li> Came just as you would buy it in the store but with a much better price</li>
            <li> I was in the drug trial for dupilumab (by Regeneron). They obviously require me to use a moisturizer every day and this was the one I selected because the alternative, Vaseline, is just too greasy and while it may be a better moisture barrier, Vaseline has always seemed to insulate my body heat which makes me itch more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I&#x27;m at the extreme end of the spectrum and may only get four or five days out of a 16 oz jar but my skin stays hydrated for close to 12 hours on this. Other over the counter topicals like Eucerin and Lubriderm last *maybe* three or four hours if you can tolerate what feels like a thin oil slick on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my morning shower with [[ASIN:B005HO0ARM Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture, Sensitive Skin, 24 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] and then apply a generous layer of this while still damp. In less than three minutes, I&#x27;m ready to put clothes on without them feeling like they&#x27;re getting stuck to the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth a try. It&#x27;s the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - If you have eczema, pray dupilumab gets approved by the FDA. In phase 2b of the trial, I was *completely* cured...to the degree that I took hot showers, was running around being physical and sweating, etc.</li>
            <li> It is such a good deal, the reason I like it is that there is no smell, and it can make your face really good.</li>
            <li> My daughter could not tolerate any moisturizer.  She was just a month old and kept breaking out in rashes with every baby cream or lotion we tried.  She also had dry skin so we desperately needed some sort of moisturizer.  Her pediatrician recommended Cetaphil and we have been using it ever since (she&#x27;s 2 now).  Cetaphil makes cream, which is denser (almost like body-butter) and lotion, which is lighter.  We use the cream for her in winters and lotion when it gets warmer.  In fact, we have started using cetaphil products ourselves as well.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, and it works. I use it on my lips when the skin is peeling off - it instantly calms the flaking skin better than any lip balm I&#x27;ve used. In the evening, I slather a generous amount of Cetaphil on my skin after the evening skincare regimen to seal off all of the nutrients that I&#x27;ve put on my face (retinol, Vitamin C, green tea, etc.) Because the jar is so big, I don&#x27;t feel bad applying a thick layer to make sure my skin is hydrated throughout the night (especially in the winter). I wake up with really soft, smooth skin. Works as a great sleeping mask!</li>
            <li> This is the only body cream that I use. The dermatologist recommended it to me. I tried to replaced once but I could not do it. I missed it so much. It is also great for the face.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years in my children with excellent results, however this cream that I got burned the face of my children producing them an allergy. I demand to know if it&#x27;s re-packaging of the product or you have another formula, the truth is that I now bring to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great product. Much better compared to the lotion. I would highly recommend it and we use it for the entire family including our infant.</li>
            <li> I started using this two years ago and I am still using it I should get a free ones by now for getting so much</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Better than any generic from drugstore.  latter was not of the same whipped creamy consistency as Cetaphil brand!!!  Very moisturizing! Very clean!  No smell!  Sometimes I mix with a small spray of Neutrogena Sesame oil.  Very supple on skin and moisture protecting!</li>
            <li> anything cetaphil is awesome!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have used to date since I have eczema --- I do apply every day and when I don&#x27;t well you can tell.. good price compared to the lotion I was using before that was really expensive.. if I have to apply lotion every freaking day - I want to be able to afford it!&lt;br /&gt;happy lotioning!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good price on this excellent moisturizing cream. Recommended by one of my docs, I use it morning and evening on my legs, and it definitely is effective for helping them avoid dry, flaky skin.  Not too oily, soaks in fast and works well. Amazon&#x27;s price with Prime shipping is a less than I would pay at my local CVS.</li>
            <li> I buy this sat Costco when it is on sale and went on Amazon to do a comparison price check.  I do not use this as my everyday body crème, even though my dermatologist wishes I would.  This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich.  I turned on a friend to this as she has very dry skin and now she uses it every day.  Important to note:  scoop a small amount onto your hands and rub your hands together to &#x27;melt it down&#x27; before applying to the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cetaphil for years now,  made a really big difference for my skin.  I used to have very dry/ashy skin before, but after using this product for awhile,  my skin is no longer dry/irritated.  Highly reccomended.  I&#x27;ve since stopped buying on amazon since it&#x27;s so much cheaper at Costco.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer there is. Aside from a homemade shea butter concoction my friend makes, I have never used a better moisturizer. Nothing works like Cetaphil cream.</li>
            <li> Great value for a great product</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle. I have incredibly dry skin from eczema and allergies. Winter is pretty awful for me. My skin, especially my legs, get very dry and itchy. Then I scratch and they hurt. Then I put lotion on and they sting. And I&#x27;ve tried everything, having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions, but they weren&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this has been a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I use Cetaphil face wash, I would have never thought to try this out but received it in a package of products from Allure called the Allure Beauty Box. After my first use I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, feels nice going on, doesn&#x27;t burn, and kept my skin unbelievably healthy. I haven&#x27;t scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years. Seriously unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Really does what it says!</li>
            <li> I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered before they said I would. I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered when they said I would.I got what I ordered when I expected it. Got what I ordered when they said I would.I got what I ordered when I expected it.

            <li> In college, I used to get blotches and dry skin from even the best moisturizers.  I have an oily T-zone, but cheeks get dry.    I tried everything, and was about to give up when one of my family introduced me to cetaphil.    After that, I could use any cleanser and this would moisturize very well.  Other moisturizers made my skin tight, then itchy, made me prone to acne, and blotches.    This saved my skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it the past decade, and nothing else.  No fragrance in it to irritate my skin, and hydrates my skin all over even with an oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> This is my first facial moisturizer, and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s oil free, but I feel that it takes a little time to penetrate deep into the skin. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me though, because I put it on at night. Otherwise, it makes your face really soft when you wake up in the morning! I love it!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer by far. Thoroughly moisturizing without causing breakouts. My brother, who is a plastic surgeon, recommends cetaphil, and it is the only moisturizer I have found that actually last.</li>
            <li> Great after a shower to keep skin soft. Absorbs quickly. I use it year round to combat dry skin. Dermatology recommended .</li>
            <li> My kids have horrible eczema… I spent tons of money on other product, but came right back to Cetaphil. Just apply on your child 3 to 4 times a day and you&#x27;ll see improvements. Do it religiously as preventive rather than as needed.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me (specifically suggesting the tub kind) and that I apply it immediately after getting out of the shower (without drying off).  I apply everywhere and let it air dry (quite chilly in the winter!).  It leaves my skin feeling soft throughout the entire day.  I workout daily and hardly any of it comes off when I sweat.  LOVE this lotion... I would pay $50 a tub for it if I had to.</li>
            <li> A mum and two toddlers all three with very sensitive skin coming from a humnid tropical zone going into their first winter in a very dry snow zone. Our skin was raw itchy and flaky. Not anymore - this stuff rocks! Loooking at it I thought it was going to be thick and greazy, but was pleasently surprised. I can even use it on my highly sensitive face. Would definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I love and highly recommend this product! Prior to using, I had uneven skin tone and minor acne. I noticed a difference in the look and feel of my skin within the first week. I apply to my face and neck every evening before bed - if I skip a day, I can always tell a difference in how my makeup goes on my face the next morning. I use powder foundation, so don&#x27;t use this cream in the morning, but applying the night before is enough for my combination skin. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Love  it very good . You should try it</li>
            <li> Good stuff, and this is the way to buy it--by the pound!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily.  Totally absorbent and not greasy. Has a nice scent and a super deal thru Amazon !</li>
            <li> This item is poor quality. It makes my baby&#x27;s skin very dry and itching. I am not sure if it is original or copycat generic low quality brand??</li>
            <li> I first tried this lotion when I was visiting my parents in Chicago. It&#x27;s very dry in the winters there and my mom had bought this Cetaphil cream. It was amazing and I loved the way it keeps you super moisturized without being greasy or leaving a film or anything on your body. Also I don&#x27;t like scents and this cream has no added scents (and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a tub/large container with a wide mouth that is easy to access. It is VERY thick, like cocoa butter. I tried the Cetaphil lotion that comes with a pump, but this cream is much more thicker and more moisturizing than the lotion. Since it&#x27;s quite expensive at my local Target (and even more so at the local convenience store), I prefer to buy it on subscription at Amazon where I can get at least a little discount, and have it delivered straight to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and I break out in rashes and eczema, in addition to bruising very easily. Since I also live in LA, my skin dries out rapidly in our desert climate. This cream has been a lifesaver and I can&#x27;t go without it! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s soothing on dry spots, and I don&#x27;t hesitate to put it on over rashes or any other spot. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face in a pinch. Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li> The best body creme ever!</li>
            <li> Love this cream for my entire body.  I use it especially during the cold, dry winter months and my skin remains so soft.  I have used many lotions but this is well worth you trying it.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin but it&#x27;s also combination dry/oily. I use this moisturizer every morning and the tub lasts a year or longer. It does go on a little greasy so I have to wait 5-10 minutes for it to soak in before applying any makeup. Because my t-zone is oily anyway, my forehead is a little greasy by the end of the day but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for moisturizer that actually works without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> it producted by 2012,it will expried the next year.i want to the new,not the storage,do you understand?it make me sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled dry flaky skin on my face every winter for years. I&#x27;ve tried many well known moisturizers but never had any improvement. I read some reviews here and grabbed a jar at a local store. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks. No more flakes or feeling tight after a shower. My skin is smooth and moist. It takes a very small amount and I&#x27;m sure the jar will last for a very long time. I&#x27;m sure sorry I didn&#x27;t know about this cream sooner...</li>
            <li> This is the twin pack of Cetaphil. This is an amazing moisturizer cream. It has no yucky fragrance or chemicals that are irritants, so it works wonders on damaged hurting skin. I just got done using my chainsaw is some limbs, then weed eating. My hands were all scraped up, with a cut thumb. This cream is on my hands and helping as I write this. Absorber quickly and does not leave a greasy or slick feel. Gets into your skin to where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> Both the kids and I have dry, sensitive skin and can suffer from seasonal eczema. This cream is light enough for every day use and effective enough to keep our dry skin in great condition. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s (truly) unscented. Everyone who has come to my home and tried this product has become regular users. It can be quite expensive but a little  bit goes a long way and buying with Subscribe and Save helps to watch the pennies.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for the dry spots like your elbow and knee area.  it&#x27;s bit thicker than some on the market.  I like it enough to use it everyday but you should be careful not to overdo it cuz it absorbs really quick.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and bought several creams to help this condition.  This really works!  I will buy more when needed.  Has cleared up the dry skin about 99 percent.  Finally!</li>
            <li> A little of this moisturizing cream goes a long way.....love the softening effect and its purity.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I buy this products several times with this company competitive price</li>
            <li> I bought cetaphil for my new born daugther. I use after every bath. It is fragrance free and good for sensitive skin.  So works perfectly for my daugther.    I have used cetaphil for my whole family. And it gives good moisture for each rub.  The deal i got on amazon is better than the costco price.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it&#x27;s now the only thing I use--it&#x27;s that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It&#x27;s the longest-lasting lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
            <li> I bought my mother who had very dry skin. She loves it and bought some more for her sister and friend. She said it worked better than Eucerine that she had used before. Good product!!</li>
            <li> I have very, very, very sensitive skin. It seems like every cream and lotion irritates it, causing me to break out. Until I found this cream. It works great, does just what it says and nothing it doesn&#x27;t, and it lasts a long time. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either. Two jars for twenty bucks? Only one jar in the store would cost you ten to fourteen bucks, if you can find it in a store, that is.</li>
            <li> just love the stuff. have used it 4 years on my face and it works wonders.!!&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known Cetaphil for quite a while, and this is by far the most appropriate moisturizing cream for my daughter who have eczema since birth. And, this is the first time I order this pack from this merchant. I would expect a month of delivery to Asia, but totally out of my expectation, my order arrive in two weeks and the jars were intact. Well done.</li>
            <li> This is really good for my skin and every person who has tried it agrees with my many words on this subject.</li>
            <li> After many different skin moisturizers for my sensitive skin, I stopped at this one to balance my skin type. No perfume and not greasy.</li>
            <li> My son has Psoriasis and this is the only product he can use and he swears by it&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars all the way1</li>
            <li> Cetaphil cream is always in my bathroom and I&#x27;ve been using it for 4+ years. I use it during all seasons to keep my skin soft and moisturized. I have sensitive skin and I normally need hypoallergenic cosmetics/skin care products and this is moisturizing yet super gentle and leaves my arms and legs feeling soft like a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> I use this on my infant.  I just dig in and smother it all over him after his daily bath.  Love this brand because it keeps the BABY ACNE AWAY.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer. Thick but not greasy, lasts all day even on my crazy dry skin. Soaks in to your skin, not your clothes. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and nothing compares to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> This cream really works. Stops itching too.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for about five years having read an article by Jennifer Aniston where she said she used Neutrogena  washing bar and Cetaphil.  I am now 68 and everyone comments on my skin and says how clear and mostly wrinkle-free it is.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased to help with my grandson&#x27;s excema, now the whole family uses it! It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it, and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> We find Cetaphil a a great cream for all the family, we can&#x27;t find anything like it in Ireland so we have to import it on a regular basis!!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s doctor recommended Cetaphil or Aquaphor for my son after he had an eczema outbreak. We went with cetaphil and love it. We tried Aquaphor as well, but the texture seemed to clog his skin more than actually help. Cetaphil is thick, but light and soaks in very well. It is a life saver. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love Cetaphil!  Used to spend big bucks on those fancy dancy products at the dept. store.  Tried this at the recommendation of a dermatologist who told me all that I really wanted was a good moisturizer....that a prescription would be needed by those companies if they lived up to their claims.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil ever since....also the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t go wrong.  It&#x27;s  non -greasy, keeps your skin moist all day....and before you go to bed, after washing your face, all night!  It can be used all over your body actually:  those elbows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get told all the time that I look much younger than I am, and also that my skin is beautiful....well, I dunno about all that, but any help I get is because of Cetaphil.  I also like bare minerals radiance (slight shimmer) and Nars for some of their liquids (blushes) that I put on to make my skin have a dewy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful for Cetaphil!  My son suffers from some sort of excema. Doctors suggested I switch to this lotion and a different soap.. All other lotions I try seemed to aggravate his skin more than help it.. Cetaphil was the only thing so far that keeps him moist and rash free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little on the costly side but worth it... I purchased a 2 pack</li>
            <li> With severe chapped hands every winter Cetaphil works to smooth and ease the discomfort; makes my hands feel so much better.  No horrid perfume or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and love the way it moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended, I like it as well, unscented, no greasy feel.  I feel moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> i thought i got a good deal with this pack of two cetaphil moisturizing cream thinking that i will be able to save something but to my dismay i saw the same thing at walmart which is sold individually at $10.70 so it&#x27;s almost the same thing...the good thing is i got the free shipping as i bought another item...otherwise this will cost me too much....you guys better buy this at walmart so if it does not works for you well you only have 1 pack wasted...</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on several reviews of the product and so far, I do like it.  It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t give me the deep moisturizing I desire, but it&#x27;s better than several other creams / lotions I have tried and I particularly appreciate that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love how this works on my children&#x27;s skin. I put them on within 10 minutes after shower or bath. We apply generous amounts so of course it initially starts out as greasy. It does get absorbed very fast so the greasiness is mild and temporary.&lt;br /&gt;One observation, which is more of a tip than a point against this product, is to make sure you keep the lid tight. I accidentally forgot to twist it tight enough and when we opened it, the lotion had somewhat solidified. I scraped the top surface off and we were good to go.</li>
            <li> Quite recently was the first time i ever used CETAPHIL . I was very impressed with the speed it was absorbed into your skin, on the other hand however, it did not \\&quot;last\\&quot; as long in the skin as i anticipated.</li>
            <li> I bought the big package. The shipment was more expensive than the product itself. The most important thing is that the item isn&#x27;t so good as they said.</li>
            <li> I use this as an all over (head to toe) moisturizer year round. In the summers, I put my go-to sunscreen over it and it&#x27;s not too much. I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie, so in the past I&#x27;ve deviated from this to try other lotions and creams, but always came back to Cetaphil. I&#x27;m not budging again. It&#x27;s economical, it doesn&#x27;t contribute to breakouts (the skin on my face has an attitude), it moisturizes and keeps my skin that way throughout the day, and it seriously softens everything it touches. It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in quickly and well, doesn&#x27;t interfere with any make up I use (that said, I only use a gel blush and maybe some powder) and it has a good ranking on the Environmental Working Group site (I think a 2 or 3) and contains no parabens. Sold.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!! My kids have eczema and it does a remarkable job on their skin!!! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face in the winter.  It&#x27;s rich without being greasy.  But it&#x27;s not quite enough for my dry, chapped hands (nothing seems to work better on them than Vaseline, I&#x27;m afraid).  I also love that this is product is unscented.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Is it not enough for me to give this product 5 stars withought having to go to the trouble of giving you a written essay?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the negative reviews about the cetaphil products, but the cream works for me. It&#x27;s non greasy and really sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li> My Doctor recommended this to me for my dry skin. It works but it really doesn&#x27;t help with the little dry skin around the nose area.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter. I have been using Cetaphil products on my face and body for a month now. The difference this product has made in my life is beyond belief. I use less makeup to cover up my flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now \\&quot;stalk\\&quot; the pharmacy&#x27;s weekly ads so that I can stock up.</li>
            <li> I actually like this better than the cetaphil pump lotion.  It seems to work better and applies evenly more easily.  The only thing you need to be careful of and pay attention to is that you best make sure your hands are clean before you dig in..the last thing you need in this tub is some dirty hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory over three years use. 14 words - do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS IN A TWIN PACK &amp; GAVE TO MY DAUGHTERS &amp; THEY LOVE IT..BOTH HAVE DRY SKIN ISSUES DUE TO WEATHER &amp; GOT IMMEDIATE RELIEF!  MOISTURIZES &amp; HYDRATES FACE TOO..USES UNDER FOUNDATION..FLAWLESS LOOK!</li>
            <li> Perfecta para proteger la piel de un niño con problemas respiratorios, que desencadenan gran resequedad en la piel. Facil de aplicar en uso diario</li>
            <li> This product is decent if your skin is mildly dry, but it doesn&#x27;t effectively heal the skin of the moderate-high dry-flaky kind. Even after I apply this to my face or neck, where my skin is dry and flaky, it&#x27;s as though it dismally staved off and forestall the inevitable shedding of the skin. I apply this \\&quot;liberally\\&quot; both in the morning and at night, like it suggests, but haven&#x27;t had impressive results. I gave this product two stars, because it is decent against mild-dryness, but that&#x27;s the limit of Cetaphil&#x27;s capability. Also, I will admit, one jar lasts me a very long time. Even after applying a liberal amount, twice a day, it&#x27;s taken me months to topically consume the entire jar. It&#x27;s probably the most long-lasting/durable product I&#x27;ve possessed. But there may be a reason for this. One reviewer noticed that his didn&#x27;t contain a foil seal and may have been a counterfeit product. Looking back, I also don&#x27;t remember ripping open a foil seal on mine.</li>
            <li> feel soft and comfortable when applying it on face and body.&lt;br /&gt;baby like it, so does mother. that&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizing cream, but I seem to detect a slight fragrance although it is definitely not scented.</li>
            <li> I was told by my dermatologist that she could only strongly stand behind two products for moisturizing. Eucerin and Cetaphil. Since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, I have tried both. I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin, the thing about Cetaphil (specifically the cream in the jar -- not the pump lotion) is that it is not even a tad bit greasy compared to the former. It eliminates dry skin within a few hours. My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter. Both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned. I bought this to give her a sample of as well. She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works. Besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across. I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe &amp; vera. At this price for two jars, it&#x27;s a steal and depending on how liberal you use it, but jar will last at least a couple of months for one person. Just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like Avon or oil of OLE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people use crap like this.&lt;br /&gt;It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does one use instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well just about EVERY brand you can buy online or at the drugstore uses bad ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s better to use natural stuff like:&lt;br /&gt;shea butter&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006Y7U1TS Coastal Scents Unrefined Shea Butter, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;organic coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100% natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Check out this info:&lt;br /&gt;beautyoffood.com/?hop&#x3D;nfopower&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the \\&quot;beauty industry\\&quot; will put any crap into a product if it will make your skin look or feel better but they don&#x27;t give a dang about how it might affect your overall health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be a chump, use your own cheaper better creams and oils - some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face, are So cheap and work better than anything!</li>
            <li> Great product. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, good in the winter and in the summer. My skin stays moisturized all day. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to day to day moisturizer.  I liberally apply this after showering to keep my skin smooth &amp; moisturized through the day.  Being able to buy two 16-ounce jars from Amazon has been great!  This product was originally suggested by my dermatologist to help with my very dry skin, and after I&#x27;ve been delighted with it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has baby eczema and this is recommended by her pediatrician as well. I lathered this on when my eczema flares up and to moisturize during my pregnancy. No stretch marks. Love this.</li>
            <li> Was an Excellent purchase i enyoy with my family and friends, i recomended to used with al your people, Was watch i expected</li>
            <li> It really helps with very dry skin problems. The Grandma and her sisters loves it.  It is a must for them!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions and this is the best one I have ever tried. It keeps my skin moisturized without being overly oily and sticky. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin after and it is fragrance free. It doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable residue or layer of oil on my skin. It is well priced too. I have used expensive brand lotions that only dry out my skin more, leave my skin too oily or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has been great for my dry skin.  The cream is thick and my skin feels moisturized for most of the day.  I highly recommend it to people with sensitive &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this on my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  She has had eczema since she was born but it has now gotten to extreme conditions with constant application of lotions.  We live in a hot and humid climate so her flare-ups occur often.  I was using Aveeno&#x27;s Baby Eczema which was fine, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting better.  It was essentially containing the issue.  I then went on to use a natural product with calendula, which I thought was better than the Aveeno product (and which I still use and would highly suggest).  However, the natural calendula product is quite greasy where as the Cetaphil is not.  We&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I genuinely see a difference in her skin and am very pleased with the results.  Cetaphil is also recommended by the American Ezcema Association, which is why we tried it.  In any case, it&#x27;s been a wonderful product and has had better results in its 3 weeks of usage versus the 12+ months of usage of the Aveeno Eczema product.</li>
            <li> Have super dry skin and Cetaphil moisturizing cream helps to keep it moist.  Been using it for years and go thru a jar a month.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and this cream keeps my skin moisturized very, very well. It&#x27;s a part of my daily routine. (Actually, I shower once in the morning and once in the evening and apply the cream afterwards.) The cream does a great job and keeps my skin from getting dry and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice consistency -- not oily or greasy at all. And it has no real strong fragrance. (It does have a trace of a scent in the jar -- not artificial, but just like anything, it has something of a scent. But after putting it on, I can&#x27;t really detect it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the best lotion or cream to help my skin I&#x27;ve ever found -- and I tried several before this.</li>
            <li> Marvellous on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes without feeling oily.  I really like that . Creams are far more effective than lotions</li>
            <li> My mom has sensitive skin and she likes this product. it can make skin smooth and healthy. good product worth to buy</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk because we use it every day. It&#x27;s well worth the price because a little goes a long way and it really works. I have very healthy, super soft skin because of it.</li>
            <li> I have been having dried skin all my life and have suffered skin rash due to dryness.  After I have used this product, I no longer have skin rash problem.  This product really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few containers of this. Really like it. This is a great price for this product. Much cheaper than the local store where I&#x27;ve been buying it.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have come across!</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin, very soothing. Love it more than any other cream.</li>
            <li> Very Very Very Recommend this Product! It&#x27;s very useful in all days.</li>
            <li> not at all greasy. Rubs into the skin, I always buy this kind because it seems to last a long time too. I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i have really bad skin. drys out a lot to the point where i could look like a reptile in some spots. This stuff is good  and better then any crap you can buy in store for same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have this on scrb and save. and i tend to go through 1 set a month</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes this stuff. I feel the same. I was using Aveeno Daily, the green cap, and this one feels better.</li>
            <li> This product was ordered by my doctor (dermatologist) because I &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; some type of &#x27;hoof-n-mouth&#x27; disease actually caused by chemotherapy.  With Neosporin, tis product does the trick, and I had heard night nightmarish tales about the condition. My condition is related to chemotherapy, but this product is super - hydrating, and may be applied everywhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll not only order it again, it&#x27;s on Subscription so I won&#x27;t forget to have it on hand.</li>
            <li> have used for years but may have found a better cream for my dry heels. Gold bond diabetic intensive lotion.</li>
            <li> great product works great&lt;br /&gt;keep recommending this to every body we know with baby. this cured our daughter on set of ezema</li>
            <li> My 2 year old son has had bad eczema all his life. We&#x27;d used Cetaphil lotion before but this cream is so much better. It&#x27;s really thick and seems to help his skin much more. This 2-pack has lasted us over 6 months and we&#x27;re still not about to run out. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for very dry skin.  I even use this as a facial moisturizer, and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt better!</li>
            <li> I have used many face moisturizers, and all of them make my face break out, I was just giving up trying new things. One day I figured, what the heck, let me try this on my face. I have nothing to lose, I am glad I did, my face is looking ten times better, and best of all, this is the most affordable cream for face and body!!!!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it is really important for me to find the right lotion. I tried so many different ones and so far Cetaphil and Eucerin are the best of its category, not to mention they are reasonably priced. Compared to Eucerin, Cetaphil is lighter and quickly absorbed but that being said that less moisturizing in personal opinion. Overall, this is a great product for the people like me who are suffering from eczema. Thank you Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> No other word can say, it is very useful for our famalily. at begining, it was used for my new baby.</li>
            <li> My children can&#x27;t live a week without cetaphil.  They have very dry skin and before cetaphil we tried almost everything out there, including aveno, and nothing worked.  Cetaphil works right away.  You can see the difference right after the first use.  I strongly recommend you to try cetaphil if you or your love ones are suffering from dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand of moisturizer and then tried Cetaphil and have officially changed over to using this brand exclusively. It is amazing for my ultra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it is fragrance free. Feel safe for my sensative skin. It&#x27;s good for winter but not super thick. I am living in DC and it is thick enough for me. If someone lives in a sper cold place maybe it is not nutritious enough.</li>
            <li> My grandson has dry &amp; sensitive skin and his parents need to lotion him 3 times a day.  This cream generally goes on his face soothingly.  It keeps his face lubricated and helps minimize eczema when used diligently.  This is a quality name brand product.</li>
            <li> According to Consumer Reports, this is the best.  The only moisturizing Cream that really works.  According to my wife who has tried all of them it is the best.  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  if you have any skin problems, or even if you don&#x27;t, its so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li> It is good for the ezcema baby as it can help to relieve the dryness and keep the moisture. The package is worth to buy!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a guy, and I&#x27;m would have never expected that I would be using moisturizing cream. I use it on my hands, elbows, knees, and lips. Yes I said lips. I find this is much better than any chapstick or similar product. Chapstick makes the skin on my lips peal. This Cetaphil keeps them moist and feels much better. I use it once in the morning and once at night and after showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had really dry hands and tried all kinds of products before I sound this produce. But I will still use a greezy vaseline lotion if I get into something that is really harsh. But this is my everyday go product. If you have never tried it you should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and have recommended this to a friend. My wife prefers something thinner because she puts lotion all over her body, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream! I live in a very dry climate and therefore my skin stays very dry. This lasts a long time and feels so good after I put it on!</li>
            <li> Im a regular costumer</li>
            <li> Large vol that can use for a long time. I used it  for both my baby and I. Good. I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with dermatitis eczema in 2010 and my dermatologist has recommended me this cream to use on a daily basis. Since then, I have only had 2 outbreaks, less serious than the first one and only....because I stopped using it. I did not give 5 stars for the product because of the price that Amazon charged for the shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my combination, acne-prone, and sensitive skin. I won&#x27;t go anywhere without it I wash my face with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and put a finger full of Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream on afterwards. It does seem thick when first putting it on, but once rubbed in is not greasy or thick at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has been great.</li>
            <li> Used it for years...every now and then I try something else, but I ALWAYS come back. If you use it consistently, it really improves the condition of your skin.</li>
            <li> Since using Cetaphil on my feet, my pedicurist asked me how I keep my feet so soft.  I knew that it felt good but this was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Used this for about 2 years on my children with eczema. Works well mixed with cocoa butter or baby oil. I now plan to stop using it d/t the parabens. Really has no smell and is not sticky on the skin. Also works well as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It works so well. I usually use it after taking a shower. NO fragrance is always the best choice. You can try.</li>
            <li> I use it only when the lotion doesn&#x27;t work well, though the chance is very few, such as heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema. The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance. I&#x27;ve used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients. It&#x27;s disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients that [[ASIN:B001ET76GW Cetaphil Lotion]] lacks. Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, petrolatum, glyceryl polymethacrylate, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, disodium EDTA, propylene glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \\&quot;rod wax.\\&quot; On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known. It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin. Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water. On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin. In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately \\&quot;breathe.\\&quot; That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. As a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl Polymethacrylate: This substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air. It is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dicaprylyl ether: This is an oil derived from a plant, AKA dioctyl ether or Cetiol OE. It functions to condition and smooth the skin. It is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin-care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin: Glycerin AKA glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations. It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant. It is safe enough to be consumed internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element. It is approved for internal and external use. Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. They include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. They make anything they are in more spreadable. They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl stearate: This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skinirritant for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol: A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. It is used in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil: Very safe, natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEG-30 glyceryl stearate: Emulsifying agent. It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl acetate: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative. It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes. In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl alcohol: This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. It is considered very low risk. It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol: When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium hydroxide: Like potassium hydroxide, this is another name for lye. It is used in the paper and chemical industries, for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, for pH regulation, and in the production of aluminum. It is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in. I would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but--lye? Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acrylates/C10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: This is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis). So far, I&#x27;ve never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I&#x27;m not allergic to this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethiconol: Similar to dimethicone (see above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disodium EDTA: This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages. When combined with vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it forms benzene, a dangerous carcinogen. This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene glycol: This lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze. Cosmetic products employ it as a humescent, to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin. Unfortunately, the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin. In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.irritant for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol: A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil.

            <li> This is absolutely the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  By using this product every day, I no longer have dry flaking skin.  It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance which is a huge plus.  It&#x27;s worth the price and more!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer. It&#x27;s hard in the jar, but it applies smoothly over the skin. The only down side is that it gets greasy after a couple hours. I just wipe the greasy layer off when it gets to that stage, and my skin is still super smooth. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t put this on under makeup, I use a different moisturizer for that.</li>
            <li> very nice cream, does make your skin feel soft and moist.</li>
            <li> moisturizes good, absorbed quickly, can&#x27;t believe I could even apply on my face. My skin is not typically dry but I don&#x27;t feel it greasy. I like it&#x27;s fragrance free, and great price too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As expected... And lower price</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist because I have very dry skin. It really helps ease itching and flakes. I only use this product at night because it leaves my skin feeling tacky. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who has oily skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly as advertised.  Love the product, will order again when I need Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream.  Great Service! Great Price!</li>
            <li> very good. i bought it one month ago ,i think it is very good .now i use it every day</li>
            <li> Unlike other moistureizors I used such as Aveeno, this gets absorbed by the skin without leaving a residue that is present for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Cetaphil moisturizing cream! I have dry skin especially during winter and this is my companion wherever I go!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended to be by friends years ago.  It is pretty good.  I like that I can use it anywhere and it does not leave an oily or lotion-y feeling.  I use it on my face as well as my elbows kind of thing.  Very multipurpose.  There is a light fragrance that goes away shortly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family member used this for her knee while it was in and out of an aircast and it did a good job of keeping the leg from being completely dry.</li>
            <li> Very dry skin and this product really works. Have used it for years. Found that buying from costco in 2 pack saves lot of money than amazon.... Wont use anything else for winters.&lt;br /&gt;My baby also had eczema and it says for sensitive skin, every age, I applied this with a tad bit of coconut oil to his skin and it helped. His itchiness stopped and relieved the dryness. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to any and everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is as said...provides excellent moisture and protects the skin. This product is also good for sensitive skin for kids as well.....</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is the best body moisturizing cream that I have ever used! It makes my skin softer, but not grassy</li>
            <li> l love that cream but when the articles came from amazon it was a little bit damaged well i still kept it because it&#x27;s too long to do that&lt;br /&gt;well i don&#x27;t know if i  will try next time with  amazon</li>
            <li> Cetaphil brand cream never disappointed me. This is very good moisturizing cream for your body.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Works very well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance.  Absorbs quickly so you can get dressed right after applying.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and my dermatologist recommended that I use this brand of cream - not lotion.  I have never found anything that works as good as this.  I put it on right after a shower and it lasts until my next shower.  All the stuff I&#x27;ve tried before only last an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I order this product every opportunity I get.  It&#x27;s so expensive in the stores, but here I get it at a reasonable price especially when I buy multiple jars.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer EVER!  lOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a more natural cream but this is thick and unattractive to wear.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is the key to soft but not greasy skin. It is aslsdo unscented.</li>
            <li> we have tried everything from eucerin on up...and this works the best.  This cream is thick, and we apply it after baths......notice a huge difference if we skip it.  works great on dry skin, and although it is sold locally, I prefer to buy it here to get a 2 pack....</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for your skin. It help controls the eczema and dry skin for me.  I will only use this for now on.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  It works well and Amazon has the best price I could find.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.  I use it in the Winter particularly because the forced air heat and long comforting hot showers dry out my skin at that time of year.</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry skin on my legs and at times it was uncomfortable and itchy. I tried many lotions and creams but they either didn&#x27;t work or the fragrances in them irritated my skin. I have sensitive skin so I tried this Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream about a year ago, and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since. This cream has dramatically improved the condition of my skin on my legs. I use it daily after I shower and it completely releives any dry skin and discomfort even in the winter. This is a great product for Sensitive Dry Skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and so does my mom &amp; my 20-month old daughter. A dermatologist recommended Cetpahil to me - the cream, the body lotion &amp; the body wash. I love all the products &amp; contiue to use them. It does not have any fragrance to irritate the skin. And it really moisturizes well. Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for many years and now my husband uses it at times.  Recommended by my dermatologist at first and a jar in every room in the house now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and have been totally satisfied.  Strongly recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Both my son and my daughter had eczema when they were little. I used the steroid cream on my son, and it worked, but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable using it. Another doctor told me to use Dove soap and Cetaphil. It cured his eczema. After my daughter was born, she got it too, but this time I knew what to do. I&#x27;m so grateful for this product. I have very dry hands and find that hand creams just seem to make them drier. This is the only thing that&#x27;s given them relief. We always have a jar of this in our home!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing this Cetaphil cream is.  It absorbs nicely and keeps my skin feeling so wonderful!  Even high end moisturizers didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling this supple and piable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea and have completley stopped using my expensive moistureizer...Cetaphil does SOOOOOOOO much better at calming the rosacea.  I&#x27;ve even been able to stop using my prescription gel because the rosacea has all but disappeared since I started using this cream on my face.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s pricing on this 2pack is very competitive with what I&#x27;ve seen in the drugstores</li>
    </ol>
