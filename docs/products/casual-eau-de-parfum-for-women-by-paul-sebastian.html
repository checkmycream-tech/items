            <li> Been wearing it for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Hardly ever wear anything else!</li>
            <li> I should do a commercial for CASUAL !!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Casual for over 10 years, and those are the comments I receive at least two to three times a week.</li>
            <li> I started using Casual</li>

            <li> My daughter got me this perfume quite a few years ago for Christmas.  Every time I wear it I get a lot of compliments.  Hardly ever wear anything else!</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever.  People are always asking me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.  Been wearing it for at least 10 years.  Not carried any longer in the department stores, but can always be found on the internet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this Casual from Paul Sabastian.  I like only the ( Eau De Parfum  Spray )  The  Fine is ok, but the eau de parfum is stronger and it lasts longer. There is a difference,  its all still great !!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. My son brought me this perfume for christmas, and I fell in love with it. I will purchasing it real soon.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for over twenty years! People stop me all the time to ask what it is. I should do a commercial for CASUAL !!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years, I love it on her...</li>
            <li> I first smelled this scent on a passerby and actually stopped her to inquire as to the name of the perfume.  Well, actually, I smelled something nice and said (out loud) what is that nice smell and this woman actually turned around and said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s me!&amp;#34;  She later said she knew right away it was her because she had received so many compliments on CASUAL.  I purchased it and although I like it very much, it could be on the sweet side (use very little) and I&#x27;m more of a citrus or even musk kind of person, otherwise I&#x27;d give it 5 stars (which, I&#x27;m sure, is what this other woman would have given if asked).</li>
            <li> price was good. It is just what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes ever!! I love the clean scent. It was package really well and came very quickly</li>
            <li> I have always loved this spray because it is not strong but people still compliment  on how good you smell</li>
            <li> I cannot find this spray in the store.  I&#x27;m so happy it is available on-line.  It has such a soft flower scent - love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I can wear this in the winter, sping, summer and fall. I love this so much. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is amazing parfume. Someone every week asks me what I am wearing. It is a clean scent and I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this perfume!!  I always get comments on smelling good!!  Most importantly I love it - it is a good daytime scent.</li>
            <li> I started using Casual about 15years ago and it was the ONLY perfume I used. Every time I wore it people commented on how good I smelled &amp; always asked what I was wearing. The last couple of years however, the scent is just not the same. It&#x27;s weak and I can barely smell it myself. Also, Paul Sebastian&#x27;s name is nowhere on the bottle. Not sure who is or where it&#x27;s being manufactured, but something is missing and now I&#x27;m looking for a new scent. Won&#x27;t waste anymore $$$ on this product!</li>
            <li> I generally dislike perfume but my friend was wearing this the other day and I fell in love with it. I wear it whenever I go out and it never fails that someone will compliment me and ask me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  No where on the bottle did the name of Paul Sebastian show up and I have bought the real thing before and his name is there on the bottle.  I broke out into a rash where I put this perfume. Very unhappy</li>
            <li> This cologne is wonderful.  The smell is great and playful.  It is fruity, it lasts, it makes you feel happy and carefree.  I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I have always love the smell of Casual for years and it&#x27;s still the creat smell that i have always love. All i can say&lt;br /&gt;Is that i will be back again for more.</li>
            <li> No matter where I go, I am stopped and asked \\&quot;what is that perfume you are wearing?\\&quot; I am stopped by both men and women, telling me that they love&lt;br /&gt;the crisp, clean fragrance of the perfume I have on.  I have been wearing Casual for over 10 years, and those are the comments I receive at least two to three times a week. I am honest, of course, and tell them the Casual name and let them know they can only get it online thru Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Please, Paul Sebastian, EA Fragrances Co., New York, NY, or whoever is still making this product, don&#x27;t stop making the perfume and for Pete&#x27;s sake, Bring BACK THE BODY LOTION?!?  If there is an increase in sales, for Casual Perfume, It is because Casual is a \\&quot;perfect scent\\&quot; and works on anyone.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long, very disappointing</li>
            <li> great smell someone was wearing it at work and the smell lingered on very soft smell. perfect for work. .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely fragrance, soft and clean but I was really disappointed when I opened it to find a portion already used and it had an orange color and when sprayed it was horrible.  I believe I was sent an out dated tester. Disappointed to find an no return label, very dissatisfied.  So I won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again as shown in another review, it was a rip off so I won&#x27;t be taking that chance again.  I work hard for my money.</li>
            <li> Nice scent! Fresh clean and nice for daywear.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years.  I am an RN and my patients would tell me how clean I smell.  Fresh like a shower.  Believe me, I have tried many.  I use this even on a respiratory floor.  Never bothered a patient.  It&#x27;s getting hard to find. So I was thrilled when this was on Amazon.</li>
