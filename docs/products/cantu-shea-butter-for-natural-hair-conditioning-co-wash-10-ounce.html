            <li>I tried this on my own hair, and it wasn&#x27;t quite as effective, but I add product and blow dry my hair, so that might be why.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great to condition and clean my hair, and it never feels dry.</li>

            <li>its not only great for black hair its great for any types of hair from oriental to caucasian, to hispanic hair types...</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and the store stopped carrying this product I absolutely love it, it makes my hair soft and clean, and easy to style</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I had to do a review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll then use a little more to keep it detangled, and finish with their leave-ins, I&#x27;ll use some castor oil, twist-up, and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend also uses this a couple of times a week as deep conditioning for his very curly, medium-thick hair with great</li>
            <li>hear i love the scent and his hear was very soft and clean after washing.</li>
            <li>After the shower, my hair is fluffy and beautifully detangled.</li>
            <li>my scalp and hair feels clean and plus its very gentle to my color treated hair..</li>
            <li>When I sleep with my hair damp and braided, my hair looks amazing the next morning.</li>
            <li>I will consider buying this again it smells good like all of the other cantu products and</li>
            <li>Devacurl is much pricier, so I was happy to find a less costly alternative.  </li>
            <li>I would have assumed this was for African hair only if I hadn&#x27;t read elsewhere how great it is.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this out, I normally co-wash with Shea Moisture</li>
            <li>I recently tried it out because I wanted a sulfate-free cleansing conditioner that wasn&#x27;t 20 bucks or more.</li>
            <li>Her hair was incredibly soft and tangle free</li>
            <li>Love the smell, i use it prior to shampooing to remove the tangles and this product does the trick</li>
            <li>and i decided to give this a first time try</li>
            <li>Anyway, I remember feeling aggrivated by the lack of alternative natural hair care products available.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves my curls in gorgeous condition all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried Tresseme&#x27;s Curl Hydration shampoo yet but Neutrogena Triple Moisture&#x27;s shampoo gives only a gentle clean and not thorough enough (better than Cantu for some days when I want a gentle clean, though).</li>
            <li>(it felt positively</li>
            <li>Amazing how conventional shampoo can do so much damage.  </li>
            <li>It may not make my hair super soft...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this enough for fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>made my scalp itchy, does not work for my fine, curly hair as a cowash, i&#x27;m using it as a regular condish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Irish/English/German \\&quot;mut\\&quot; with really wavy hair that now falls in large ringlets.  </li>
            <li>Really like how my 4a/b hair feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sulfate free shampoos for several years and they were helpful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to watch a video about how to properly cowash.  </li>
            <li>She has poker straight hair and tends to fight oiliness.  </li>
            <li>Also, my daughter that we thought had poker straight hair....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and</li>
            <li>I absolutely loooovvveee the Cantu shampoo and conditioner(in</li>
            <li>I had read that the his doesn&#x27;t give much slip</li>
            <li>my hair really loves anything that is a cantu products</li>
            <li>Well, her hair was absolutely amazing when it dried!  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever used a co-wash and it made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I avoided using it for the first couple weeks and stuck to the sham+cond, but when I did try it, WOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on using too many products as I prefer to keep it simple and usually make things on my own, so if I was to get rid of everything and pick one product to keep, this would be it.</li>
            <li>I would assume that if you use this like normal shampoo, you could have problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use heavy silicone conditioners (Neutrogena Triple Moisture, Tresseme Curl Hydration) in large amounts, and this works very well to clean my hair - my hair is still not dried out, but feels soft and gets lots of volume.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great cleansing conditioner without scary ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have reduced frizz and the conditioning helps bring out my natural curl.</li>
            <li>It also helps make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so I just detangle use my shea butter and gel and wear my natural curly coils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use Pantene Truly Natural Co Wash Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that she will stick with it and find that the oiliness will subside since she will no longer be stripping the natural oils from her hair.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your hair really soft too.</li>
            <li>im natural 4B 4C.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, and her hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I left my hair very crunch and brittle feeling.</li>
            <li>its not oily and Not heavy at all..</li>
            <li>She Moisture Co Wash. I could not get a comb to go through my shoulder length natural hair.</li>
            <li>After completely rinsing out my hair my scalp felt like it was on fire  with all the burning I was experiencing.</li>
            <li>My curls are shiny, soft, and bouncy, and usually I avoid &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34; products because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>She has very fine curls, and her baby shampoo was leaving her hair very dry and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Even thought the directions say to wet your hair first</li>
            <li>The only downside is how much of it I go through in such a short time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is rich and a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li>I purchased this co-wash on Amazon back in the fall (after big chop and beginning natural hair journey)and</li>
            <li>I have very curly frizzy hair and have notice washing my hair and scalp with a co wash has made my hair softer and my scalp much less itchy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be a little more moisturizing and thick.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not big on using too many products as I prefer to keep it simple and usually make things on my own, so if I was to get rid of everything and pick one product to keep, this would be it.</li>
            <li> I would assume that if you use this like normal shampoo, you could have problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use heavy silicone conditioners (Neutrogena Triple Moisture, Tresseme Curl Hydration) in large amounts, and this works very well to clean my hair - my hair is still not dried out, but feels soft and gets lots of volume.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great cleansing conditioner without scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have reduced frizz and the conditioning helps bring out my natural curl.</li>
            <li> It also helps make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> so I just detangle use my shea butter and gel and wear my natural curly coils.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not using shampoo anymore  so this product  is great.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an alternative to shampoo for my increasingly coarse-feeling grey hair.  This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and the store stopped carrying this product I absolutely love it, it makes my hair soft and clean, and easy to style</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used a co-wash and it made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I use heavy silicone conditioners (Neutrogena Triple Moisture, Tresseme Curl Hydration) in large amounts, and this works very well to clean my hair - my hair is still not dried out, but feels soft and gets lots of volume. Haven&#x27;t tried Tresseme&#x27;s Curl Hydration shampoo yet but Neutrogena Triple Moisture&#x27;s shampoo gives only a gentle clean and not thorough enough (better than Cantu for some days when I want a gentle clean, though).</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I use this item and alternate between the Cantu and the Devacurl cream shampoo.  Devacurl is much pricier, so I was happy to find a less costly alternative.  It removes buildup and doesn&#x27;t give me dandruff - and its smells divine.  Leaves my hair in great shape, and can feel the difference since I stopped using regular shampoo (I have 3b hair type).  If I were to compare the Cantu and Devacurl - I&#x27;d give Cantu a 4 and DC a 5 - but since DC is twice+ the price - Cantu gets a 5!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I recently tried it out because I wanted a sulfate-free cleansing conditioner that wasn&#x27;t 20 bucks or more. I have long, very thick, naturally wavy hair with tons of frizz. This stuff works great to condition and clean my hair, and it never feels dry. I make sure to rinse well after co-washing, and I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the crunchiness that a few other reviewers mentioned. I have reduced frizz and the conditioning helps bring out my natural curl. It also helps make my hair soft and shiny. When I sleep with my hair damp and braided, my hair looks amazing the next morning. My boyfriend also uses this a couple of times a week as deep conditioning for his very curly, medium-thick hair with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great cleansing conditioner without scary ingredients. Plus, it smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I had to do a review.  I purchased this co-wash on Amazon back in the fall (after big chop and beginning natural hair journey)and really liked the way it clarified my hair but when I ran out I went looking for it in a couple of beauty supply stores and did not find it so I tried the vo5 silky  coconut conditioner because of reviews I saw on you tube.  I ran out of the vo5 and am returning to the Cantu Shea Butter Co Wash.  It does the best job in my opinion.  Really like how my 4a/b hair feels after using it.  I follow up with the Cantu Shea Butter leave in conditioner and my hair feels really soft and smells great. I have short/medium length hair so I just detangle use my shea butter and gel and wear my natural curly coils.  Doubt if I will try any other co washes because as far as I am concerned this does just what I want it to do.  Besides Cantu has a great line of products. I also use the coconut curling crème and deep treatment masque.  FYI if you don&#x27;t like the white stuff in your hair don&#x27;t mix the curling crème with gel.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product!  SHINEY HAIR!!</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t typically tangle on its own but this made it difficult to run my fingers through my hair. It did save time, not having to shampoo AND condition, but it didn&#x27;t get my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to find a Co-wash product (OMG!).  I absolutely love ALL of Cantu&#x27;s hair products and love the way they smell.  These products detangle my hair, my WEAVE hair and my daughters hair (my daugher is mixed with Black, Hispanic, French, Native american and Scotish). LOVE CANTU</li>
            <li> Its okay! I&#x27;d rather use Pantene Truly Natural Co Wash Cleansing Conditioner. I have very curly frizzy hair and have notice washing my hair and scalp with a co wash has made my hair softer and my scalp much less itchy. I can go for 3 days without washing my hair and before when using shampoo with sulfate i would have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable product!  I just started cowashing my S wavy curls (from Curly Girl Handbook).  I&#x27;m an Irish/English/German \\&quot;mut\\&quot; with really wavy hair that now falls in large ringlets.  I&#x27;ve been using sulfate free shampoos for several years and they were helpful.  Yet I was still dealing with dryness and my curls would often be lifeless.  I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable cowash product.  The way this co wash makes my hair feel and look is incredible.  I will no longer use shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to watch a video about how to properly cowash.  I watched the one on the Curly Girl kindle edition and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found.  I would assume that if you use this like normal shampoo, you could have problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one of my daughters use this as well.  She has poker straight hair and tends to fight oiliness.  Well, her hair was absolutely amazing when it dried!  I&#x27;m hoping that she will stick with it and find that the oiliness will subside since she will no longer be stripping the natural oils from her hair.  Her hair was incredibly soft and tangle free (it felt positively luxurious).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the define and shine custard.  It isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves my curls in gorgeous condition all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been a while since I wrote this review.  I have tried several other cowashes (all much more expensive) and I am done trying anything else.  I always come back to this product because it is THE BEST!!  It doesn&#x27;t build up and I my hair continues to improve!  Also, my daughter that we thought had poker straight hair.... her hair now has the most gorgeous waves I&#x27;ve ever seen!  Amazing how conventional shampoo can do so much damage.  No more shampoo around here.</li>
            <li> This co-wash is great! It smells amazing and it cleans all the build up out of my hair when I wash it. Even thought the directions say to wet your hair first I often put the co-wash in and then let it set with a cap on my hair for 30 minutes to an hour. It&#x27;s almost like a deep condition then. It also makes your hair really soft too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and im natural 4B 4C. It didnt cleanse my hair all that great and didn&#x27;t have the slip that i like.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 2 y/o daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very fine curls, and her baby shampoo was leaving her hair very dry and fluffy. I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, and her hair looks so much healthier. Her little curls bounce when she moves, its so cute. I tried this on my own hair, and it wasn&#x27;t quite as effective, but I add product and blow dry my hair, so that might be why.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, i use it prior to shampooing to remove the tangles and this product does the trick</li>
            <li> I just started co washing and i decided to give this a first time try and it did not dissapoint. As opposed to shampoo when i used this in my curly thick hair it cleansed it (i added a few drops of rosemary oil for my itchy scalp) it did the job and did not strip my hair of moisture .Every cantu product i have used has done well for my hair except for their conditioner which dried my hair out. I will consider buying this again it smells good like all of the other cantu products and the price is great as well.Also has alot of great ingredients in it. If you are looking for a co wash try this you might love it!</li>
            <li> I loooooove this! It leave my hair clean moisturizer and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have the Cantu shampoo and conditioner and bought these for in between washing. I hate it. I left my hair very crunch and brittle feeling. I would just use the rinse out conditioner in between. This stuff  was a dissapoontment. I absolutely loooovvveee the Cantu shampoo and conditioner(in the orange bottle) but not this...</li>
            <li> I used to use Shea Moisture products all the time and I still stand by them, but whenever I needed some \\&quot;struggle\\&quot; hair products, I&#x27;d purchase Cantu. Lol I say struggle because if you&#x27;re not used to the Shea price then you might drift every so often, but I&#x27;ll be the first to admit they have a great line of hair care essentials. Anyway, I remember feeling aggrivated by the lack of alternative natural hair care products available. I don&#x27;t mind making my own, but sometimes it&#x27;s easier to just buy them. One day I went to the store and Bam, the black hair care section updated their selection with the Cantu natural line. I decided to try them and purchased everything from the shampoo to the co-wash, to the leave in style products.. all of it. Briefly, let me say none of the products failed me; and if used as directed, they actually worked quite well and did improve my texture... BUT THIS CO-WASH THO!! I love it!!! I avoided using it for the first couple weeks and stuck to the sham+cond, but when I did try it, WOW. It&#x27;s very rich and smells great, and rolls through the hair with ease. From my experience with Cantu&#x27;s regular non-natural hair line, I was always disapointed so I figured this co-wash wouldn&#x27;t be any different, but I was wrong. This stuff is rich and a little can go a long way. It glides through the hair and immediately you can tell its moisturizing well. I sectioned my hair and ran a wide tooth comb through it, then massaged some in my scalp for cleansing, and afterward I didn&#x27;t even need conditioner. I might use cholesteral once in a while, but if I don&#x27;t its ok because this stuff is so rich on its own. After the shower, my hair is fluffy and beautifully detangled. I&#x27;ll then use a little more to keep it detangled, and finish with their leave-ins, I&#x27;ll use some castor oil, twist-up, and I&#x27;m good. When I take out my twists the next day, my hair looks remarkable, it&#x27;s soft and smells great. I&#x27;m not big on using too many products as I prefer to keep it simple and usually make things on my own, so if I was to get rid of everything and pick one product to keep, this would be it. Happy hair!usually make things on my own, so if I was to get rid of everything and pick one product to keep, this would be it. Happy hair!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and this wasn&#x27;t as conditioning as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I was impressed of how good this product work it define curls an clean my scalp smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I have medium-length Caucasian 3a hair, and this is my favorite product ever. It&#x27;s every bit as great as DevaCurl No-Poo, but a fourth of the price. The only downside is how much of it I go through in such a short time. I was skeptical about co-washing and about a product that doesn&#x27;t lather, but I&#x27;ve never had a bad hair day with this and I don&#x27;t need any extra conditioning. My curls are shiny, soft, and bouncy, and usually I avoid &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34; products because my hair is so fine. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough for fine curly hair. I would have assumed this was for African hair only if I hadn&#x27;t read elsewhere how great it is. It smells great, too, and the tropical scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had read that the his doesn&#x27;t give much slip but I thought I&#x27;d be fine since I am Caucasian with way hair. This was just OK for me. I did feel like my hair got clean just not was conditioned as I would like. The package does say to follow with  the Cantu leave in Conditio</li>
            <li> my hair really loves anything that is a cantu products</li>
            <li> makes my hair and head feel good</li>
            <li> made my scalp itchy, does not work for my fine, curly hair as a cowash, i&#x27;m using it as a regular condish. it is just ok.</li>
            <li> I have not used this on my hair as yet but i used it on my son hear i love the scent and his hear was very soft and clean after washing.</li>
            <li> It may not make my hair super soft...but it sure does make my hair super super easy to manage,..and style easier..its not oily and Not heavy at all..A PERFECT co wash for me to quickly wash my hair at night when i come  home working swing shift at my job...my scalp and hair feels clean and plus its very gentle to my color treated hair..i definitley will rebuy this again!!! i got mines from walmart but i hope walgreens will carry this someday!!!! love this cantu co-wash,..its not only great for black hair its great for any types of hair from oriental to caucasian, to hispanic hair types...my hair is mix breed hair..and it works EXCELLENT!!!!..its great for short straight fine hair like mines!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens over the weekend. I was so excited to try this out, I normally co-wash with Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Co wash but it is a little pricey for a small bottle. Anyway what a disaster this Cantu Co Wash. It did not provide enough slippage, my hair became a knotted mess. I tried to remedy the situation with adding more co-was to my hair but that did not help. It seems the more I put on my hair the more knotted it became. I have 3B hair and usually I can comb through my hair with the She Moisture Co Wash. I could not get a comb to go through my shoulder length natural hair. After completely rinsing out my hair my scalp felt like it was on fire  with all the burning I was experiencing. I tried to put a mixture of coconut oil and almond oil in my hair and even that was burning me also when I put the oils in my hair and this has never happened before. What was even worse was the big red rash that was present from the back of my neck to the front of my shoulders. It is safe to say that I had an allergic reaction to whatever was in the Cantu Co Wash. This is just my experience. This Cantu Co Wash went in the trash I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love all of cantu products, but this one I will be using as a backup plan for when I don&#x27;t have anything else. This is not my go to product. For the price I guess it gets some of the job done. I was hoping it would be a little more moisturizing and thick.</li>
