            <li>I would spray this on my natural hair to blend it with my extensions and it gave me the right about of shine and luster for it to blend perfectly.</li>
            <li>While the shampoo leaves my hair nice and clean, the conditioner leaves it soft and smelling AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I received these items for free for testing and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my hair easily and it stayed smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>The shampooed lathered very nicely and the conditioner made both mine and my daughter&#x27;s unruly hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>First off I absolutely love the smell!</li>

            <li>The shampoo suds up well and rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that struck me when I opened the starter kit was how amazing everything smelled.</li>

            <li>The second time I sprayed only two times about 5 inches away from the hair and refrained from spraying near the root area and received very good result: my hair was shiny,hydrated and smelled very nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet but fades over time and is not offensive.</li>
            <li>It is so sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>It smells good and when I washed my extensions with it the shampoo left them shiny and also got all the product build up off.</li>

            <li>It was a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was very moisturizing and made my hair feel silky, but my absolute favorite product was the dry oil spray, it smells super yummy, I fell in love with this fantastic hair care systemâ€¦.Absolutely amazing products....</li>
            <li>I finished it off with a couple more spritzes of the oil spray and brushed it through once more.  </li>
            <li>and I went through it rather quickly.</li>

            <li>Thanks to Influenster and receiving a free Voxbox</li>
            <li>I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection from Influenster free to try and review!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I used a moisturizer prior to applying the oil and the oil effectively locked in the moisture.</li>
            <li>Together, the products worked well, but my favorite of the three, by far, was the oil.</li>
            <li>so far, I really love the oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really shiny and soft which was nice.</li>
            <li>These product were sent to me as a complimentary sample by Influenster VoxBox to test out and provide a review so here goesâ€¦.</li>
            <li>Its super fresh and natural smelling and the mist is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a fan on the scent when I first received it, but it quickly grew on me.</li>
            <li>The first use made my hair silky smooth and the smell is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love Herbal Essence products it begin with and was extremely pleased with how it left my hair soft and shinyâ€¦.</li>
            <li>I would buy these in the regular sized bottles since they do such a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a dry oil before, but I must admit I&#x27;m loving it...</li>
            <li>You can spray it on damp hair or dry hair, and I used it both ways and really liked the way it made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li>I liked that there was a three step system, but the 1st step - the shampoo was my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I got the collection of the herbal essences wild naturals for free with influenster which comes with the shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray and they smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how light it felt in my hands and on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used this 3 step system and really like it!  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this line of products!</li>
            <li>I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals for free from Influenster to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences before but not this specific line, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like it left my hair with any residue, but I could have used a bit more moisture for my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>but it did make my hair look shiny and healthy for an entire day.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the three-step system by Herbal Essences Wild Naturals courtesy of Influenster to test for free.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ll start with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster, I received these products to try out!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair shiny and soft, smells great and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say that this entire bundle is worth a try for anyone looking for a new, fresh, clean experience!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The lather was great and it cleaned my hair and scalp clearly without leaving it dried out.  </li>
            <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner I found that my hair was super soft!</li>
            <li>I received the entire Illuminating Collection complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in the Herbal Essences VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a wonderful scent and very thick.</li>
            <li>:) The dry oil is a newbie for me.</li>
            <li>but I really love the dry oil.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this three piece collection is the Dry Oil Spray.</li>
            <li>I like the dry oil spray the most.  </li>
            <li>I most always let my hair air dry over night and straighten it in the am.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product out of the set is the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned because the products seemed to be so light that as my hair dried it didn&#x27;t seem to help keep it smooth</li>
            <li>The conditioner is definitely the most important part of the Illuminating system, because with just the shampoo my hair did become a bit dry.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t come across any salon brands that have scents that linger on even after a full day of shampooing, so that&#x27;s a major</li>
            <li>The conditioner too has a nice perfume like smell and is very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to give this a try as she also has blonde hair that she wants to appear shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>So if you use all 3 steps everyday it will give you maximum protection and make your hair smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair after rinsing with shampoo, but this seemed to work very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection complimentary, for testing purposes from influenser.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers really well so</li>
            <li>They do a fantastic job at adding volume and shine to your hair, while at the same time cleansing well with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>My husband also really likes it,Shhhh</li>
            <li>I used these products on my extensions and also my real hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of products like this and some leave my hair really oily looking</li>
            <li>So far the ends and root of my hair have a shine and are finally back to a healthy state.</li>
            <li>I think that this collection would work well with people who have more thin, healthy</li>
            <li>Next the conditioner, it left my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>The dry oil spray was also nice and left my hair with a nice shine and didn&#x27;t make it feel weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I have fine dull hair and with the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals System, my hair is shiny and healthy.</li>

            <li>The shampoo left my hair cleansed and vibrant while at the same time leaving a refreshing scent of Seaberry.</li>
            <li>Having curly, frizzy hair poses some problems and I wasn&#x27;t loving the dry oil spray as much as other products I&#x27;ve used but have to say my hair certainly was shinier than before using.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was nice and thick, too.</li>
            <li>No hard knots or tangles to deal with, no frizzy hair.  </li>

            <li>Although I might consider myself a picky hair product buyer, I was pleasantly surprised by these products.</li>
            <li>but I only sprayed it on my ends because roots gets oily too fast.</li>
            <li>All this will rejuvenate your hair and leave it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The Oil Elixir is by far my favor.</li>
            <li>I found it far too drying.</li>
            <li>the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating collection is.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>This complete set, tamed my frizzies and added volume to my hair, which I needed.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Kit for testing purposes with Influencer.  </li>
            <li>I received this product, Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating bundle, for testing and review from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt soft, silky and once I looked in the mirror; it was indeed shiny.  </li>
            <li>They all have a very pleasant smell, difficult to describe but smells a little bit fruity.  </li>
            <li>I normally use professional salon brands such as Pureology, Joico, and Redken--</li>
            <li>I usually use shampoos and conditioners that are free of sulfates because they get my hair and scalp cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use regular shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li>I dye my hair on a regular basis and because of that, it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that is able to return the shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster, my dry spell has ended.</li>
            <li>The next day my hair was soft and shiny, but not oily.  </li>
            <li>My hair was still soft the next day.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally blonde, straight, and very long.</li>
            <li>I also used the Dry Oil Spray while my hair was still damp and my hair dried so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I told her  that I was testing a new shampoo, conditioner and dry oil spray.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After using the Shampoo and Conditioner i woke up with soft and beautiful defined waves instead of my usual crazy all over the place waves.</li>
            <li>Influenster sent me the Herbal Essences wild naturals illuminating shampoo, conditioner and the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t specifically notice any major changes in my hair from the shampoo and conditioner, but I guess that meant it was working pretty well and similar to my usual hair care product.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because the shampoo was a real let down, but overall it products did leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for hair products that will clean thoroughly but will not dry out my hair nor leave it heavy and weighed down.  </li>

            <li> It was fragrant and came out in a very fine mist that was easy to spread throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also rinses very clean.  </li>
            <li> First step is to shampoo your hair so lather it good and rinse, the shampoo has a shine enhancing formula.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product</li>
            <li> First I used the shampoo and gave my hair a good wash.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and rinses away quickly.</li>
            <li> The dry oil, was delightful.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell GREAT and both make my hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I would spray this on my natural hair to blend it with my extensions and it gave me the right about of shine and luster for it to blend perfectly.</li>
            <li> While the shampoo leaves my hair nice and clean, the conditioner leaves it soft and smelling AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I received these items for free for testing and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my hair easily and it stayed smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> The shampooed lathered very nicely and the conditioner made both mine and my daughter&#x27;s unruly hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> First off I absolutely love the smell!</li>
            <li> I allowed it to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my hair and scalp while I finished showering and then rinsed easily.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo suds up well and rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that struck me when I opened the starter kit was how amazing everything smelled.</li>
            <li> but as I continued styling I saw how easily it took the styling and did in fact get smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference with my hair.</li>

            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The exciting citrus scent is a plus too!</li>
            <li> This oil gives the hair an incredible shine without weighing the hair down.  </li>
            <li> It has a light lemony scent that doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The second time I sprayed only two times about 5 inches away from the hair and refrained from spraying near the root area and received very good result: my hair was shiny,hydrated and smelled very nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet but fades over time and is not offensive.</li>
            <li> It is so sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> It smells good and when I washed my extensions with it the shampoo left them shiny and also got all the product build up off.</li>
            <li> I loved how clean and soft my hair felt and how much lighter it felt too.</li>
            <li> It was a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was very moisturizing and made my hair feel silky, but my absolute favorite product was the dry oil spray, it smells super yummy, I fell in love with this fantastic hair care systemâ€¦.Absolutely amazing products....</li>
            <li> I finished it off with a couple more spritzes of the oil spray and brushed it through once more.  </li>
            <li> and I went through it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Gave me super shiny curls.  </li>

            <li> Thanks to Influenster and receiving a free Voxbox</li>
            <li> I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection from Influenster free to try and review!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used a moisturizer prior to applying the oil and the oil effectively locked in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Together, the products worked well, but my favorite of the three, by far, was the oil.</li>
            <li> so far, I really love the oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really shiny and soft which was nice.</li>
            <li> These product were sent to me as a complimentary sample by Influenster VoxBox to test out and provide a review so here goesâ€¦.</li>
            <li> Its super fresh and natural smelling and the mist is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan on the scent when I first received it, but it quickly grew on me.</li>
            <li> The first use made my hair silky smooth and the smell is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essence products it begin with and was extremely pleased with how it left my hair soft and shinyâ€¦.</li>
            <li> I would buy these in the regular sized bottles since they do such a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a dry oil before, but I must admit I&#x27;m loving it...</li>
            <li> You can spray it on damp hair or dry hair, and I used it both ways and really liked the way it made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> I liked that there was a three step system, but the 1st step - the shampoo was my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I got the collection of the herbal essences wild naturals for free with influenster which comes with the shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray and they smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how light it felt in my hands and on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this 3 step system and really like it!  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this line of products!</li>
            <li> I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals for free from Influenster to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences before but not this specific line, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it left my hair with any residue, but I could have used a bit more moisture for my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> but it did make my hair look shiny and healthy for an entire day.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the three-step system by Herbal Essences Wild Naturals courtesy of Influenster to test for free.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ll start with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster, I received these products to try out!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair shiny and soft, smells great and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this entire bundle is worth a try for anyone looking for a new, fresh, clean experience!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The lather was great and it cleaned my hair and scalp clearly without leaving it dried out.  </li>
            <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner I found that my hair was super soft!</li>
            <li> I received the entire Illuminating Collection complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in the Herbal Essences VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a wonderful scent and very thick.</li>
            <li> :) The dry oil is a newbie for me.</li>
            <li> but I really love the dry oil.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this three piece collection is the Dry Oil Spray.</li>
            <li> I like the dry oil spray the most.  </li>
            <li> I most always let my hair air dry over night and straighten it in the am.  </li>
            <li> My favorite product out of the set is the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned because the products seemed to be so light that as my hair dried it didn&#x27;t seem to help keep it smooth</li>
            <li> The conditioner is definitely the most important part of the Illuminating system, because with just the shampoo my hair did become a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t come across any salon brands that have scents that linger on even after a full day of shampooing, so that&#x27;s a major</li>
            <li> The conditioner too has a nice perfume like smell and is very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to give this a try as she also has blonde hair that she wants to appear shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> So if you use all 3 steps everyday it will give you maximum protection and make your hair smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair after rinsing with shampoo, but this seemed to work very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection complimentary, for testing purposes from influenser.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers really well so</li>
            <li> They do a fantastic job at adding volume and shine to your hair, while at the same time cleansing well with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> My husband also really likes it,Shhhh</li>
            <li> I used these products on my extensions and also my real hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products like this and some leave my hair really oily looking</li>
            <li> So far the ends and root of my hair have a shine and are finally back to a healthy state.</li>
            <li> I think that this collection would work well with people who have more thin, healthy</li>
            <li> Next the conditioner, it left my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> The dry oil spray was also nice and left my hair with a nice shine and didn&#x27;t make it feel weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I have fine dull hair and with the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals System, my hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Nice small shampoo and conditioner to sample the smells.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Herbal Essence products and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil free to test and provide a review.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair cleansed and vibrant while at the same time leaving a refreshing scent of Seaberry.</li>
            <li> Having curly, frizzy hair poses some problems and I wasn&#x27;t loving the dry oil spray as much as other products I&#x27;ve used but have to say my hair certainly was shinier than before using.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was nice and thick, too.</li>
            <li> No hard knots or tangles to deal with, no frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I received herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray from Influenster free for testing.  </li>
            <li> I got the collection of the herbal essences wild naturals for free with influenster which comes with the shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry with frizz, after using these products it made my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I received herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray from Influenster free for testing.</li>
            <li> My overall favorite item was the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> The spray is definitely a life saver as well, giving my hair an extra boost of shine, which is nice because after washing, even with the conditioner, my hair was still just a tad dry.</li>
            <li> When used, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, in control and feels so soft!  </li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft and clean after using the shampoo and conditioner, and the dry oil made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I received herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray from Influenster complimentary  for testing the Voxbox.  </li>
            <li> My hair dried nicely and I tried the dry oil</li>
            <li> Although I might consider myself a picky hair product buyer, I was pleasantly surprised by these products.</li>
            <li> but I only sprayed it on my ends because roots gets oily too fast.</li>
            <li> All this will rejuvenate your hair and leave it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The Oil Elixir is by far my favor.</li>
            <li> I found it far too drying.</li>
            <li> the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating collection is.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> This complete set, tamed my frizzies and added volume to my hair, which I needed.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Kit for testing purposes with Influencer.  </li>
            <li> I received this product, Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating bundle, for testing and review from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt soft, silky and once I looked in the mirror; it was indeed shiny.  </li>
            <li> They all have a very pleasant smell, difficult to describe but smells a little bit fruity.  </li>
            <li> I normally use professional salon brands such as Pureology, Joico, and Redken--</li>
            <li> I usually use shampoos and conditioners that are free of sulfates because they get my hair and scalp cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use regular shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li> I dye my hair on a regular basis and because of that, it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that is able to return the shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster, my dry spell has ended.</li>
            <li> The next day my hair was soft and shiny, but not oily.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still soft the next day.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally blonde, straight, and very long.</li>
            <li> I also used the Dry Oil Spray while my hair was still damp and my hair dried so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I told her  that I was testing a new shampoo, conditioner and dry oil spray.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After using the Shampoo and Conditioner i woke up with soft and beautiful defined waves instead of my usual crazy all over the place waves.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me the Herbal Essences wild naturals illuminating shampoo, conditioner and the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t specifically notice any major changes in my hair from the shampoo and conditioner, but I guess that meant it was working pretty well and similar to my usual hair care product.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the shampoo was a real let down, but overall it products did leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for hair products that will clean thoroughly but will not dry out my hair nor leave it heavy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I used all three products, one after the other on my natural, kinky textured hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling completely stripped and a little brittle.</li>
            <li> The dry oil spray was just an extra bonus for making our hair shine.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair with the illuminating shampoo, followed by the conditioner, lastly I applied the dry oil spray to the damp hair.</li>
            <li> Lastly I used the Dry Oil spray on my damp hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry and when a product says &amp;#34;inner shine,&amp;#34; I expect for it to leave my hair feeling moisturized</li>
            <li> And last is the dry spray</li>
            <li> first time I used Dry Oil Spray I sprayed 6 times and it made my hair a little too oily and weighted down.</li>
            <li> Since I blow dry my hair daily and naturally have some frizz to my hair, I prefer using shampoos and conditioners that are extra moisturizing and thick and creamy, which I don&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> I felt it was a little squeaky clean which may be too harsh for everyday washers.  </li>
            <li> The dry on oil spray works and does gives hair shine</li>
            <li> I have problematic hair that can be too dry, too oily, and it&#x27;s color treated.</li>
            <li> The starter kit included the shampoo along with the conditioner and the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I have never used a dry oil spray before today.</li>
            <li> After toweling dry</li>
            <li> the Dry Oil Spray.  </li>
            <li> I often have issues with oily hair at my scalp but dry, split ends at the bottom.</li>
            <li> What come in this system is Shampoo, Conditioner and Dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> After applying the dry oil spray it gave my dry hair a shiny finish.</li>
            <li> I tried the Herbal Essence Dry Oil Spray.</li>
            <li> expecially the Dry Oil Spray.</li>
            <li> I have wavy dry hair and the oil spray</li>
            <li> I received a shipment of samples from Influenster (shampoo, conditioner and dry oil).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much residue left behind, which I have had before with herbal essences products.</li>
            <li> I have natural tight curly/course hair but a lot of product weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how my shines after using the shampoo, conditioner and the dry oil spray!  </li>
            <li> The dry oil spray did not make my hair look oily at all but provided a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> However, the dry oil definitely adds moisture and a little bit of shine while taming frizz.</li>
            <li> The dry oil adds some shine to the hair with a little extra moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners in the past but these have been my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> I only sprayed a little because it is oil and didn&#x27;t want my hair to look greasy.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s color treated due to gray hair so although my hair is oily the ends can get dry.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend and I&#x27;ve already told a few friends.</li>
            <li> I have long dark hair and they tend to get frizzy at times.</li>
            <li> a little bit of it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the shampoo and conditioner, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, thick, color treated and dry.  </li>
            <li> I also want to try the other two choices</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying out other Herbal Essence products.</li>
            <li> I have tried the shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil a few times.  </li>
            <li> So, I was a little wary to try this product because it wasn&#x27;t specifically for color-treated hair but after my first use, my hair already looked shinier.</li>
            <li> The products, used together, weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Step 3 is to use your Dry Oil Spray, the oil elixir helps keep damage at bay and you will have no more frizz.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw any dramatic changes, I did appreciate how soft and shiny my hair felt after using the spray.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair as usual and sprayed 2 pumps of the dry oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> I did need to use around 5-6 sprays to get the desired effect, as I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I just spray on a little before leave home.</li>
            <li> It has a little hint of citrus that automatically perks you up in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> I struggle with my hair feeling heavy or cakey.  </li>
            <li> Then I dried my hair, which is color treated, with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because it is color treated.  </li>
            <li> While it did enhance the shine of my hair, it was just too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the overly harsh smell of chemicals that many hair products leave behind.</li>
            <li> And not sure I have used Herbal Essences either.</li>
            <li> so I can wear it all day everyday!</li>
            <li> It took one use to dry my hair out terribly and several deep conditioning treatments to fix that damage.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll begin carrying it with me to use on days where I&#x27;m running behind and my hair needs a little pick me</li>
            <li> i could see that my hair looked like I had subtle highlights.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up well, feels very thick and luxurious in my hair.</li>
            <li> This may have something to do with the fact that I have very thick and curly hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection from Influenster free to try and review! I have curly and frizzy hair and I straighten my hair every now and then, so it has some damage to it. I used the shampoo and conditioner once a day and I like it. The first use made my hair silky smooth and the smell is great and long lasting. I like that neither the shampoo or conditioner have a greasy feel or leave a residue in my shower. I also used the Dry Oil Spray while my hair was still damp and my hair dried so silky smooth. I would buy these in the regular sized bottles since they do such a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free trial from Influencer and the collection is really great. It has a light lemony scent that doesn&#x27;t fade quickly. When used, the shampoo and conditioner made my hair very soft. The dry oil spray did not make my hair look oily at all but provided a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> I received herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray from Influenster free for testing.  Although I might consider myself a picky hair product buyer, I was pleasantly surprised by these products. I haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essence product since my teens therefore I had forgotten about the wonderful scent it usually has. This one a  nice citrus scent. Having curly, frizzy hair poses some problems and I wasn&#x27;t loving the dry oil spray as much as other products I&#x27;ve used but have to say my hair certainly was shinier than before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners in the past but these have been my favorites so far. I wasn&#x27;t sure how the products would work with my hair since I have color treated hair, but I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month now and so far so good. While the shampoo leaves my hair nice and clean, the conditioner leaves it soft and smelling AMAZING! Neither products have stripped the color off my hair either. :) The dry oil is a newbie for me. I&#x27;ve never used a dry oil before, but I must admit I&#x27;m loving it...It leaves the perfect amount of shine and tames away the frizz. This is definitely a must try bundle!</li>
            <li> I received this conditioner to test through a free trial, and I must say I was pretty impressed. The conditioner is definitely the most important part of the Illuminating system, because with just the shampoo my hair did become a bit dry. However, after using a generous amount of conditioner, my hair had a decent amount of shine and smelled great! The spray is definitely a life saver as well, giving my hair an extra boost of shine, which is nice because after washing, even with the conditioner, my hair was still just a tad dry.</li>
            <li> I received these items for free for testing and i absolutely love it. The Shampoo has an amazing smell and a gel like texture and leaves a softness to the hair. The conditioner too has a nice perfume like smell and is very thick and smooth. The dry on oil spray works and does gives hair shine but i&#x27;m not a fan of the final scent. After using the Shampoo and Conditioner i woke up with soft and beautiful defined waves instead of my usual crazy all over the place waves.</li>
            <li> I have problematic hair that can be too dry, too oily, and it&#x27;s color treated. I normally use professional salon brands such as Pureology, Joico, and Redken-- but I received this set to try out and review for free so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I absolutely love how all the Herbal Essences products smell. I haven&#x27;t come across any salon brands that have scents that linger on even after a full day of shampooing, so that&#x27;s a major plus that I am giving this set. It made my hair feel clean and soft. Sometimes I can&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair after rinsing with shampoo, but this seemed to work very well. The conditioner was nice and thick, too. My hair dried nicely and I tried the dry oil but I only sprayed it on my ends because roots gets oily too fast. I will continue using it to see if anything changes but so far, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Love this bundle. It is worth every penny. It makes your hair shiny and soft, smells great and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down. Its super fresh and natural smelling and the mist is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received the entire Illuminating Collection complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in the Herbal Essences VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a wonderful scent and very thick. It lathers nicely and rinses away quickly. The shampoo did a great job of cleansing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it with the Illuminating conditioner and I don&#x27;t feel that this conditioner had enough conditioning power for my hair type. I have very fine color treated hair and use curling iron daily.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used Dry Oil Spray I sprayed 6 times and it made my hair a little too oily and weighted down. The second time I sprayed only two times about 5 inches away from the hair and refrained from spraying near the root area and received very good result: my hair was shiny,hydrated and smelled very nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster and receiving a free Voxbox I received this bundle to try.  I have blonde hair that&#x27;s color treated due to gray hair so although my hair is oily the ends can get dry.  I am always looking for hair products that will clean thoroughly but will not dry out my hair nor leave it heavy and weighed down.  The shampoo smells absolutely fantastic!  The lather was great and it cleaned my hair and scalp clearly without leaving it dried out.  It felt like it only took a moment to fully rinse it out.  The conditioner was exceptionally light! I was surprised how light it felt in my hands and on my hair.  I allowed it to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my hair and scalp while I finished showering and then rinsed easily.  It felt great, smooth and tangle free after rinsing.  I followed the instructions on the oil spray by using two sprtizes on my hair brush prior to blowdrying.  At first I was concerned because the products seemed to be so light that as my hair dried it didn&#x27;t seem to help keep it smooth but as I continued styling I saw how easily it took the styling and did in fact get smooth.  I finished it off with a couple more spritzes of the oil spray and brushed it through once more.  My hair is shiny, in control and feels so soft!  I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to give this a try as she also has blonde hair that she wants to appear shiny and smooth.  It&#x27;s a pretty great product for those wanting good cleaning but smooth and shiny results.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster I received this starter kit in the mail today to use for testing purposes. I was so excited to try it. I must say the design on the bottles are very pretty and great since spring is in the air. The starter kit included the shampoo along with the conditioner and the dry oil spray. I have never used a dry oil spray before today. And not sure I have used Herbal Essences either. They smell really great, and I feel after using all three products that my hair smells good for sure, but also feels very clean. I love the products and I will be buying them for sure.</li>
            <li> I received this set free from Influenster with their Voxbox. I wasn&#x27;t a fan on the scent when I first received it, but it quickly grew on me. I have noticed a huge difference with my hair. I have fine dull hair and with the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals System, my hair is shiny and healthy. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a trial set to try.  I liked how it made my hair feel.  I struggle with my hair feeling heavy or cakey.  This made my hair feel clean.  Only thing is I color my hair so I can not use this all the time I would have to get a set for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I used this 3 step system and really like it!  First step is the Illuminating Shampoo....thick and creamy formula, rich lather and smelled wonderful!!!  Rinsed perfectly.  Step two was the Illuminating Conditioner.....again, creamy formula and didn&#x27;t need a lot for results, wonderful smell!  Rinsed out with no problem at all!  After toweling dry I used the last step....the Dry Oil Spray.  The bottle suggested to spray once or twice to damp hair.  I decided for better coverage to spray this product onto my hands and apply it all over my hair....I&#x27;m thinking better coverage this way.  Then I dried my hair, which is color treated, with a blow dryer.  No hard knots or tangles to deal with, no frizzy hair.  I think my hair looks great and smells so fresh!  It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used any Herbal Essence product and I must say I&#x27;m very delighted with these products!  I received these products for my honest opinion, powered by Influenster.</li>
            <li> I recieved this set of hair care products for free from Influester in exchange for an honest review. My hair is naturally blonde, straight, and very long. I often have issues with oily hair at my scalp but dry, split ends at the bottom. These products had a great smell, which is important to me. I didn&#x27;t specifically notice any major changes in my hair from the shampoo and conditioner, but I guess that meant it was working pretty well and similar to my usual hair care product. I didn&#x27;t notice much residue left behind, which I have had before with herbal essences products. I absolutely loved the oil spray! It was just enough to help the end of my hair look and feel healthier, and it helped maintain any frizz I get from the weather. You can spray it on damp hair or dry hair, and I used it both ways and really liked the way it made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> Nice small shampoo and conditioner to sample the smells. The scent is amazing I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> I got this kit free from Influenster in a voxbox and I am so happy I did! I have natural tight curly/course hair but a lot of product weighs my hair down. The shampoo and conditioner are good but I really love the dry oil. This oil gives the hair an incredible shine without weighing the hair down.  The smell is sweet but fades over time and is not offensive. I have been using it every day and prefer it over my argon oil. I will definetly repurchase.</li>
            <li> I will start of buy saying this is a 3 step system and it has a nice refreshing Turkish Fig Smell. What come in this system is Shampoo, Conditioner and Dry oil spray. First step is to shampoo your hair so lather it good and rinse, the shampoo has a shine enhancing formula. Step 2 is to use the conditioner be sure to massage in and rinse. This will leave your hair silky and shiny with a Seaberry smell. All this will rejuvenate your hair and leave it soft and hydrated. Step 3 is to use your Dry Oil Spray, the oil elixir helps keep damage at bay and you will have no more frizz. Just use a drop or two on hair more so on the ends of your hair. So if you use all 3 steps everyday it will give you maximum protection and make your hair smell amazing. 100% Hand-Harvested Cassia. I received this product for my honest opinion, powered by Influenster.</li>
            <li> I got the collection of the herbal essences wild naturals for free with influenster which comes with the shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray and they smell amazing. I use the oil spray daily and my hair smells amazing all day and it keeps my scalp from getting dry which happens a good bit. The shampoo and conditioner are also really great and your hair feels cleaner after using it. :)</li>
            <li> I got the collection of the herbal essences wild naturals for free with influenster which comes with the shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell GREAT and both make my hair feel very soft.  The spray adds shine and it also smells wonderful. I would definitely recommend and I&#x27;ve already told a few friends.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail to test out &amp; review , and I love it. It makes my hair look and smell great!</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me the Herbal Essences wild naturals illuminating shampoo, conditioner and the dry oil spray. I liked the product as soon as I opened it and smelled it. My hair is naturally dry with frizz, after using these products it made my hair soft and smooth. After applying the dry oil spray it gave my dry hair a shiny finish. I recommend using this. I also want to try the other two choices they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - Kara Ann</li>
            <li> I received this collection free to test and review, thanks to Influenster, and after just one use I already saw a difference! I dye my hair on a regular basis and because of that, it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that is able to return the shine to my hair. So, I was a little wary to try this product because it wasn&#x27;t specifically for color-treated hair but after my first use, my hair already looked shinier. An added bonus was that this collection made my hair smell amazing. My favorite part of this three piece collection is the Dry Oil Spray. It was lightweight and perfect to use as a last minute touch up before I leave the house. I will most definitely continue to use this line of products!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster, my dry spell has ended. I received this Herbal Essence package in the mail about a week ago.So far the ends and root of my hair have a shine and are finally back to a healthy state. I love the smell of this product. The Oil Elixir is by far my favor. I just spray on a little before leave home. I look forward to trying out other Herbal Essence products.</li>
            <li> I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals for free from Influenster to try. I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences before but not this specific line, and I love it. The Illuminating collection smells WONDERFUL. My hair felt so soft and clean after using the shampoo and conditioner, and the dry oil made my hair shiny and soft. I will be purchasing this in the future!</li>
            <li> I received this set compliments of the Influenster Voxbox. I really liked the scent of this product. It was a fresh clean scent. The shampoo worked well, the conditioner smoothed out my hair and  after drying it i could see that my hair looked like I had subtle highlights. On the day I didn&#x27;t wash my hair I tried the Herbal Essence Dry Oil Spray. I only sprayed a little because it is oil and didn&#x27;t want my hair to look greasy. But the 2 pumps I sprayed away from the roots and my hair felt silky and I did get compliments on how my hair looked. Overall I was happy with this product and I would buy this product again. Thank you Influenster!</li>
            <li> I received this bundle of products from Influenster. I found it far too drying. It took one use to dry my hair out terribly and several deep conditioning treatments to fix that damage. I will not use the remaining product I have from my VoxBox and will never purchase. To be fair, it does smell incredible!</li>
            <li> I received herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray from Influenster complimentary  for testing the Voxbox.  My daughter and I love all three of these products.  All three have a great citrus smell.  The shampooed lathered very nicely and the conditioner made both mine and my daughter&#x27;s unruly hair soft and silky.  The dry oil spray was just an extra bonus for making our hair shine.</li>
            <li> I liked that all three products have a yummy fruity smell that lasts all day. The shampoo lathers quickly and a little goes a long way. I didn&#x27;t find the conditioner to be as moisturizing as I would like. However, the dry oil definitely adds moisture and a little bit of shine while taming frizz. I did need to use around 5-6 sprays to get the desired effect, as I have long thick hair. Since I blow dry my hair daily and naturally have some frizz to my hair, I prefer using shampoos and conditioners that are extra moisturizing and thick and creamy, which I don&#x27;t feel the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating collection is. I think that this collection would work well with people who have more thin, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;*I received these three products free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> Loved all three products. They are great on your hair and leaves just absolutely splendid!!! This is my new favorite shampoo nd conditioner set. I received it as a complimentary product for testing purposes from influenster and not just cause I got as a complimentary but that I actually really liked it.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection complimentary, for testing purposes from influenser. What I liked the most about this product is the scent. It has a really nice light scent.  It is sort of smells like apricots with a floral scent to it.  I usually use shampoos and conditioners that are free of sulfates because they get my hair and scalp cleaner.  This shampoo and conditioner did a ok job of that.  I have very thick coarse hair so my hair requires more product. The shampoo lathers really well so a little bit of it goes a long way.  I like the dry oil spray the most.  I moisturize my hair regularly throughout the week so this is helping with the dryness I have been experiencing because of the winter weather.</li>
            <li> I received this collection for testing and review. Overall I did like it.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because it is color treated.  I most always let my hair air dry over night and straighten it in the am.  First of all, the products smell wonderful.  Everything smells like fresh blueberries which was bright but not over powering. The shampoo lathers up well, feels very thick and luxurious in my hair. It also rinses very clean.  I felt it was a little squeaky clean which may be too harsh for everyday washers.  The conditioner was nice but very light,  I didn&#x27;t feel like it left my hair with any residue, but I could have used a bit more moisture for my color treated hair.  The dry oil, was delightful. It was fragrant and came out in a very fine mist that was easy to spread throughout my hair.  I love oils, and the spray delivery of this product is much more convenient than pouring oil into your  hands.  The next day my hair was soft and shiny, but not oily.  I was able to straighten my hair easily and it stayed smooth all day.  Over all these are very nice products for the price.</li>
            <li> I received herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating shampoo,conditioner and dry oil spray from Influenster free for testing. I love Herbal Essences, but had never tried these before. I&#x27;m so glad I got to experience this set! It has a little hint of citrus that automatically perks you up in the mornings.You only need a small amount of the shampoo and conditioner, a little goes a long way. My scalp felt so alive and tingling after using both of these in the shower and my hair smelled awesome! I dried my hair as usual and sprayed 2 pumps of the dry oil on my hair. Oh gosh, was my hair so shiny and beautiful. I have natural curly hair and it&#x27;s on the frizzy side. This complete set, tamed my frizzies and added volume to my hair, which I needed. It made my hair feel so soft to the touch. I have to say that I love all 3 of these products from Herbal Essences. They do a fantastic job at adding volume and shine to your hair, while at the same time cleansing well with no oily residue. I will definitely be purchasing these products myself, when these run out. Awesome products and I&#x27;m honored to have been given the chance from Influenster VoxBox to try these 3 amazing products free just for testing purposes!!  Ginger Rogers</li>
            <li> I received these products from Influenster for free to test and review. All three products had an amazing smell that lingered well after use. I used all three products, one after the other on my natural, kinky textured hair. The shampoo worked well, but stripped all of the moisture out of my hair. The conditioner provided a lot of slip and made detangling easier, but did not dramatically enhance the moisture or shine of my hair. The oil was great! I used a moisturizer prior to applying the oil and the oil effectively locked in the moisture. My hair was still soft the next day. Together, the products worked well, but my favorite of the three, by far, was the oil.</li>
            <li> I received this kit free to try.. And I really liked this collection. The fragrance is sort of peachy and smells nice. I have long dark hair and they tend to get frizzy at times. I shampooed my hair with the illuminating shampoo, followed by the conditioner, lastly I applied the dry oil spray to the damp hair. It did not leave my hair greasy at all. Which is always a plus. I recommend this bundle.  I noticed sulphates in the ingredient list, hence the four stars..</li>
            <li> got this for free through Influenster! Pretty good product so far, I really love the oil that comes with it. It made my hair really shiny and soft which was nice. My husband also really likes it,Shhhh ;)  Good product though</li>
            <li> I receive this product in my Influenster product testing box and I must say. I love it!!! expecially the Dry Oil Spray. I have wavy dry hair and the oil spray keeps it looking shiny and smooth. The shampoo and conditioner smell great and lasts a long time. I will deffinetly be making this product a part of my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I got this bundle for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This was my first experience with Herbal Essence products and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing that struck me when I opened the starter kit was how amazing everything smelled. I absolutely hate the overly harsh smell of chemicals that many hair products leave behind. I didn&#x27;t have that issue with any of these products. My overall favorite item was the dry oil spray. I didn&#x27;t find that it made my hair shinier with each use but it did make my hair look shiny and healthy for an entire day. The instructions also recommend that you only use two sprays but I found that I needed about four or five to actually see an effect. This may have something to do with the fact that I have very thick and curly hair. Others may have been able to get away with using the recommended dosage. I probably won&#x27;t continue to use this on a daily basis. It&#x27;s the perfect size to fit in my handbag and I think I&#x27;ll begin carrying it with me to use on days where I&#x27;m running behind and my hair needs a little pick me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner were alright. The shampoo left my hair feeling completely stripped and a little brittle. I only used it twice before I gave it up for a loss. The conditioner was very nice. It gave back a lot of what I felt the shampoo took away. It&#x27;s a pretty small bottle though and I went through it rather quickly. I&#x27;d buy the conditioner separately and use it during days when I feel the need to change up my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that this entire bundle is worth a try for anyone looking for a new, fresh, clean experience!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the three-step system by Herbal Essences Wild Naturals courtesy of Influenster to test for free. First I used the shampoo and gave my hair a good wash. The shampoo left my hair cleansed and vibrant while at the same time leaving a refreshing scent of Seaberry. Next I used the conditioner; I lathered the product into my hair and let it sit for about five minutes then I rinsed it out. The conditioner enhanced the shine of my hair and left it conditioned, silky, and shiny. Lastly I used the Dry Oil spray on my damp hair. The spray helped with moisturizing my hair and promoting a healthy look. This is a great regime for taking care of your hair and the sea berry scent really enhances the experience. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to gain healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Kit for testing purposes with Influencer.  I am amazed at how my shines after using the shampoo, conditioner and the dry oil spray!  My hair is short, thick, color treated and dry.  I&#x27;m in my mid fifties and after using the Herbal Essences Illuminating products I feel five years younger.  I was at dinner and my friend committed that she liked my hair color.  I told her  that I was testing a new shampoo, conditioner and dry oil spray.  She is going to let me know what she thinks! The exciting citrus scent is a plus too!</li>
            <li> I received this product, Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating bundle, for testing and review from Influenster.  I haven&#x27;t ever used Herbal Essences hair products before, but I smelled it and had to try it to see if it worked as good as it smelled.  Honestly, I thought it was okay.  I liked that there was a three step system, but the 1st step - the shampoo was my least favorite. It left my hair feeling dry and when a product says &amp;#34;inner shine,&amp;#34; I expect for it to leave my hair feeling moisturized and it did not.  Also, I wanted more for this shampoo because it was a three step system, so I felt like it should also detangle - which it did not! The next step the conditioner, was actually very nice.  My hair felt soft, silky and once I looked in the mirror; it was indeed shiny.  The dry oil spray was also nice and left my hair with a nice shine and didn&#x27;t make it feel weighed down.  I gave it three stars because the shampoo was a real let down, but overall it products did leave my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I RECIVE 4 REVIEW from INFLUENSTER&lt;br /&gt;i loved  this product i love the odor smell in my hair&lt;br /&gt;my hair look more shiny and cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;just need more hydratation.&lt;br /&gt;but i recommend. i buy in a big edition.</li>
            <li> I have tried the shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil a few times.  They all have a very pleasant smell, difficult to describe but smells a little bit fruity.  The shampoo suds up well and rinses out easily.  The conditioner also rinses out good without leaving a film on my hair.  The dry oil adds some shine to the hair with a little extra moisturizing.  I would recommend all of these.  I received the shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil free to test and provide a review.</li>
            <li> I received a shipment of samples from Influenster (shampoo, conditioner and dry oil).  While it did enhance the shine of my hair, it was just too heavy for my hair.  The products, used together, weighed down my hair.  The shampoo by itself did better but I can&#x27;t stand the fragrance.  It is so sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> These product were sent to me as a complimentary sample by Influenster VoxBox to test out and provide a review so here goesâ€¦. I love Herbal Essence products it begin with and was extremely pleased with how it left my hair soft and shinyâ€¦. I loved the fragrance. The shampoo didnâ€™t lather as most shampoo does, but it felt very clean which is what matters to me. The conditioner was very moisturizing and made my hair feel silky, but my absolute favorite product was the dry oil spray, it smells super yummy, I fell in love with this fantastic hair care systemâ€¦.Absolutely amazing products....</li>
            <li> I received these products free to test and review from Influenster. I used these products on my extensions and also my real hair. First I&#x27;ll start with the shampoo. It smells good and when I washed my extensions with it the shampoo left them shiny and also got all the product build up off.Next the conditioner, it left my hair soft and smelling good. And last is the dry spray I would spray this on my natural hair to blend it with my extensions and it gave me the right about of shine and luster for it to blend perfectly.</li>
            <li> Gave me super shiny curls.  Just didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and am so glad that I did! I don&#x27;t normally use regular shampoo or conditioner but when I do, this will definitely be it. I can&#x27;t say that I saw any dramatic changes, I did appreciate how soft and shiny my hair felt after using the spray. And the scent! The scent alone is enough to get me hooked. I wish they made it in a perfume so I can wear it all day everyday! All in all I would definitely purchase this collection again!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster, I received these products to try out! First off I absolutely love the smell! It&#x27;s kind of tropical but light. After using the shampoo and conditioner I found that my hair was super soft! I loved how clean and soft my hair felt and how much lighter it felt too. My favorite product out of the set is the dry oil spray. I&#x27;ve used a lot of products like this and some leave my hair really oily looking but this one was not like that at all. It helped my hair look shiny without looking greasy and again left my hair smelling wonderful!</li>
