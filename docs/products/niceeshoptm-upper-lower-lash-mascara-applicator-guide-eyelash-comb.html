            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>cheap!!!</li>
            <li>Love this !!</li>
            <li>SOOO MUCH MORE EASIER!!</li>
            <li>The color also looks very nice.</li>
            <li>it works amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this $5 purchase! :)</li>
            <li>every girl who wears make up needs to own  one of these babies!</li>
            <li>but my friend tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>It flared them out gorgeously.</li>
            <li>comes in handy, works great for applying make up around the eye.</li>
            <li>It good for a starter in beauty</li>
            <li>Because it was mailed from China, it took awhile, but was well packaged and the price was good for this product.</li>
            <li>yes i think this is good</li>
            <li>Helps when tinting too, too 6 weeks to get though, it&#x27;s a good quality product,</li>
            <li>A good idea that just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Also, it was really cheap which was great!</li>
            <li>Good  purchase</li>
            <li>So, it had something good about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product compared to its price.</li>
            <li>loved it.</li>
            <li>good addition to my makeup kit.</li>
            <li>It took forever to get here, also when you use it to try to guard your bottom lashes so you don&#x27;t get mascara on your cheeks, you just end up not getting mascara anywhere good.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this product all the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>Great product, shipped fast, works great!</li>
            <li>so your eyelashes don&#x27;t clump up and stay all separated giving the effect a better look, and then if there is any clumping the bottom part is a great too to help separate the lashes.</li>
            <li>It does not work any better than if you used a business card!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>This works perfect to set your lashes exactly the way you want them.</li>
            <li>:) wasy to use too!</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This prevents mascara from getting on your eyelid, a problem that many mascara-wearers have faced.&lt;br /&gt;great invention!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>easy to use and great to travel with.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Comes all the way from China but got here amazingly fast...2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I personally liked how the bottom worked.</li>
            <li>this was a filler item for me but to my surprise its awesome and works very well and cant beat</li>
            <li>Works, kind of.</li>
            <li>This really helps you apply your mascara perfectly without getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li>really nice helped me a lot applying mascara.</li>
            <li>It seperates nicely.</li>
            <li>Great protection for all the work put into your eyes, great for use of blending falsies with real lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It was also shipped lightning fast, and the price was great!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks to this amazing product, I now have the perfect lashes without having to worry about them falling off when I use the lash curler.</li>
            <li>this is like a gag gift kind of product.  </li>
            <li>Eye makeup remover pads work great to clean this.</li>
            <li>Very cool!</li>
            <li>It got here in good condition and very quickly</li>
            <li>Great price, quick shipment</li>
            <li>It very easy to use.for one whom as never use mascara.</li>
            <li>It is very easy t use.</li>
            <li>very lower price and very good product.</li>
            <li>Thus is a great cost and worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that after 40 years of wearing mascara the old fashioned way works best for me.</li>
            <li>It took almost a month to ship, but I was happy with the product and it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>can honestly say I am glad I have one.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the case with most if not all of these kind of tools.</li>
            <li>Very useful &amp; a good tool for the price.</li>
            <li>A q-tip works just as well or better when cleaning up mascara mistakes</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and i love it /)</li>
            <li>The comb on the end seems to work ok though.</li>
            <li>the price shouldof gotten more for stocking stuffers</li>
            <li>It can be somewhat helpful, but I wish the combs were better at unsticking the lashes.</li>
            <li>Perfect for numerous thing for make up.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I just started using business cards in place of this and works so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this purchase was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think I saw a youtube makeup guru use a business card for this technique, but I think this is way better</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t be able to, so</li>
            <li>I was better off without it and you will too, trust me.</li>
            <li>My friends love this and keep bugging me to use it.</li>
            <li>I love it it makesmy</li>
            <li>just say it messed me up more than what it helped.</li>
            <li>I think I can do my eyelashes better without this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with larger eyes and wye lashes this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go a day without using it and don&#x27;t know how I went so many years without having one.</li>
            <li>But since I bought so many</li>
            <li>Seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li>I have ZERO complaints what so ever!!! :)</li>
            <li>It is more than 4 weeks I ordered but never got it</li>
            <li>The comb works ok, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li>It keeps the mascara from the top of yr eye lid.</li>
            <li>Interesting piece</li>
            <li>Its cute.</li>
            <li>I find alcohol or handsoap works better than brush cleaner to remove.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>It would be an add on an must sure</li>
            <li>just as described, works perfectly and actually does enhance mascara application-no more smudges on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to it you will love it</li>
            <li>I do think that instructions or tips on most efficient way to utilize would be helpful.</li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I got more mascara on the lash applicator guide than I did on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love it because I always had problem everytime</li>
            <li>Better than nothing.</li>
            <li>keeps mascara off my face love it</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>love using it because it keeps my mascara from getting on my face and ruining my makeup.</li>
            <li>IT WORKED OK</li>
            <li>but might be ok after a lil practice.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and i love this applicator eyelash comb, I couldnt beleive my lashes</li>
            <li>but there are some better things out there.</li>
            <li>Ya have to practice, make sure you have BOTH hands free and it kind of hurts..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it with all</li>
            <li>..will have to give it more time to get used to it.</li>
            <li>ok so for 2 bucks i cant expect more..</li>
            <li>Nice device, very useful.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that it took a month to be delivered and the plastic is kind of cheap and could break easily, but otherwise this is the perfect tool for my favorite mascara with my deep set eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about getting this thingy because I get stains on my eye lid every time I put mascara on&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The price which included free shipping seemed too good to be true ($1.77).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good</li>
            <li>Fast shipped, nice product!</li>
            <li>but boy it was worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>I loved this tool so much that I just ordered 2 more for family members.</li>
            <li>And very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>This is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>These were very cheap with free shipping</li>
            <li>The design is simple and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara does leave marks on eyelids that don&#x27;t look attractive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, as describe, works good</li>
            <li>It works WONDERFULLY with my super short lashes!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>But with the pictures its easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and prevents messes around the eye area when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use ,makes your eyelashes fuller .</li>
            <li>I love the clean look of mascara.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do much, but it was very cheap and the one review said it was great, so</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more, through Amazon, and I am sure it will arrive on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fine.  </li>
            <li>works fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super neat and cute.</li>
            <li>I can really get more mascara on my lashes!</li>
            <li>This is an unusual item that ive never seen before, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this on the top lashes but it is pretty good on the lower.  </li>
            <li>I love this tool for quick mascara application and to darken all of my light, ginger lashes.</li>
            <li>best little eye opening product ive ever had.</li>
            <li>These little eyelash tools are great!  </li>
            <li>Took a little time to figure out how best to position this device.</li>
            <li>its fit for eyeless lash</li>
            <li>THIS is a great idea but only in theory.</li>
            <li>now wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>this handy item really helps to separate my lashes..</li>
            <li>And it works great for upper and lower lashes.</li>
            <li>Yes it was cheap, and why not buy it you know?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use it honestly</li>
            <li>Cheap quality but does the job</li>
            <li>Not quite so easy to clean as the ridges (used to help separate the lashes) catch the mascara.  </li>
            <li>Before I purchased the item, it would have been great to know that there is no English on the packaging and one may need an interpreter.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and it takes a few times to get used to it, but it is awesome!!</li>
            <li>It really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>big win in my book.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a smooth even edge</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>But the video is more than useful.  </li>
            <li>Its really cheap and does help</li>
            <li>Yes my heavy handed self needed this great buy!</li>
            <li>I can do much thicker and more detailed lashes with this!</li>
            <li>BUT w/ this little thingie, its neat perfect and clean.  </li>
            <li>but the item did come intact and is probably very useful</li>
            <li>and it would be exactly as pictured, I would have ordered more.</li>
            <li>Was tricky to handle at first but ok product</li>
            <li>I would say its worth a try!</li>
            <li>could when used around something shaped as unique as a person&#x27;s lash line.</li>
            <li>but I did try it and it helps a lot, but I mostly got it for the comb which really helps separate lashes!</li>
            <li>It makes you blink too much and free hand is 100x better</li>
            <li>It looks super cheap in the photo</li>
            <li>It saves time, because you don&#x27;t have to clean up smudges after putting on your mascara.  </li>
            <li>It arrived about 10 days earlier then estimated which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of tricky to hold this while you&#x27;re applying mascara and most of the time I find it easier to just not use it at all which kind of makes it pointless.</li>
            <li>, it didnt fit around my eye right, but it was really cheap</li>
            <li>This does a great job with keeping mascara marks clean but the product of the mascara itself is harder to get onto the lashes.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li>This is a very cool product, looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>but in person it is much sturdier and better plastic.</li>
            <li>However it is a good tool and inexpensive, I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I liked it</li>
            <li>It come a day earlier so that was good.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would get here in time for my niece sweet 16 teen and came a week before shipping date package was in good shape</li>
            <li>So far this product&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use I like this tool very much</li>
            <li>this is pretty cool!</li>
            <li>just follow the instructions printed on a package, it is pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my favorite mascara and get coverage ON my lashes only!  </li>
            <li>quick service.</li>
            <li>planned to vote it 3 stars, but I voted 4 for quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather slather it on quickly, but doing so gets mascara all over my eyelid.</li>
            <li>but i love to try new stuff...</li>
            <li>They are very inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but this helps so much!!</li>
            <li>This little cheapy thing is great, i have longish lashes</li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget for the days I can&#x27;t seem to get mascara on without getting it everywhere</li>
            <li>Kind of works on lower lashes but does nothing for upper</li>
            <li>that it was going to be really useful</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this too practical, but it is useful.</li>
            <li>My girls were having problems putting on their mascara, so when I seen this I thought it would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be useful</li>
            <li>I ordered this in hopes of it being a useful tool in my makeup box</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth the effort to order.  </li>
            <li>Buy it is useful</li>
            <li>The product did not meet my expectations but for the price I thought it was worth a try.it</li>
            <li>The mascara goes all over the plastic and isnt perfectly eye shaped so you spend more time lining it up and trying to get it in the right position then its just awkward.  </li>
            <li>Great little tool and a GREAT little price!</li>
            <li>This is likely best for Asian eyes, but I&#x27;ve successfully used it for my blue eyes and it definitely takes the mascara smudges</li>
            <li>very good for a shaky handed person like me.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right??  </li>
            <li>I know right.. Murphys Law.  </li>
            <li>I have looked all over the internet for just the right tool to help keep mascara off of my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>If you hold it in place to get it just right? ..</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but harder to use than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Great little gadget to keep mascara off your face!  </li>
            <li>This little tool is amazing!</li>
            <li>cheap, so you certainly can try it without too much risk.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE ITEM THAT MAKES MY WHOLE MASCARA APPLYING ROUTINE</li>
            <li>works okay kind of thick</li>
            <li>In theory it seems great, but in practice it is too big and not contoured enough for the eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Because my eyelashes are so soft and fine, they tend to bend away from the mascara want</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup, so I love all the new gadgets that I&#x27;ve been getting.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty self explanatory how to use anyways</li>
            <li>It works pretty well when I am applying mascara and don&#x27;t want to get any on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to hold the shield at a weird angle to use it on my top lashes and I&#x27;m able to see what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m doing on the bottom lashes :)</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from a company in China.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is</li>
            <li>Got it fast!</li>
            <li>but it fits over and under eye pretty well...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li>I tossed it after my first unsuccessful attempt.</li>
            <li>You need to know that the top curve is for lower lashes and the bottom curve is for upper lashes as it does not come with any illustrations or instructions.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we was looking for.</li>
            <li>and the small zig zag straight end is great for combing out your lashes if you start getting clumps.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend!</li>
            <li>top part is for your lower lashes and the bottom is for your upper lashes, and the comb at the end is for, well, combing your eyelashes if they ever get clumpy.</li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier for me to apply my mascara in the mornings!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how to use the item and have tried many different ways to make it work when putting on mascara.</li>
            <li>Bought several more as stocking stuffers for my girls.  </li>
            <li>Comes in cute Japanese packaging.</li>
            <li>but it cant get close enough to stop the mascara wand bristles from touching the skin just below the lash line.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Better to get a smaller brush for the lowers.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as they claim it does.</li>
            <li>It gets in the way of actually putting the mascar on whether it&#x27;s on the top or the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>I first use eyelash gel to keep my lashes in place</li>
            <li>Thanks seller!</li>
            <li>really hope it turns out to work!...</li>
            <li>as I said, it seems all properly trained women are able to do this without ever needing this gadget, so if you can&#x27;t, let me advise you: buy this and never tell anyone about it.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good idea for those who have trouble putting on mascara.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, short eyelashes.</li>
            <li>when I opened the package, the cute display card the item came on had not a single bit of the English language,but had sketchings of the direction, which was good enough.  </li>
            <li>Keeps mascara for smearing on the bottom and top lids, kind of my secret weapon.</li>
            <li>it works really well, especially on bottom lashes and eliminated the need for me touching peoples eyelids.</li>
            <li>But if you use this, it will push your upper lashes higher so you can easily brush them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>how long they was with using the product, and most of off it keeps the mascara off your eye lids smearing every where</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two different surfaces actually allow you to easily and well cover the lower or upper lid to get a good surface to brush the wand against, so the design works very well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>If the tool would have been slightly smaller and a soft rubber piece for the top lashes I think that it would have been a better product, but it didn&#x27;t so it aggravated my eye lids because it was almost like it was trying to stab the upper lid.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and has a comb on the other end too.  </li>
            <li>I received mine in less than 2 weeks, and if you just tilt it to match the shape of your eye, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty neat idea and its cheap too.</li>
            <li>The very top portion is used to push up under you lower lashes, all the way to the lash line, and the lower portion of the rounded area does the same for your upper lashes.</li>
            <li>For the price $1.31 it was a bargain because the others cost around $5-10, and it came so quickly i was surprised.</li>
            <li>It is made of sturdy plastic so should last for years and can be easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>instructions that came with this was in Spanish but with the included pictures and YT videos, it&#x27;s really easy to understand how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just could not get it easily under my short lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cheap product, did not really work well.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very blonde and fine, so I get mascara everywhere..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty particular about how my eye makeup looks</li>
            <li>It arrived a little sooner than the company had estimated, which was nice.</li>
            <li>It was a nice little investment for the price.</li>
            <li>Handy little tool.  </li>
            <li>The tiny little comb thing works pretty good and it separates your lashes pretty well.</li>
            <li>but it came in blue which really isn&#x27;t important.</li>
            <li>I really like this one because it really helps you with  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like the combs and it makes eye make up easier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My lashes grow in every which direction, so trying to get them to appear straight means</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely helpful of course it takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li>that when I curl them and apply mascara (I have to curl them because otherwise they are stick straight)</li>
            <li>This product really avoids to ruin your make up once you are applying your mascara.</li>
            <li>and the bristles don&#x27;t really catch my lashes.</li>
            <li>Using this tool, I can trap my eyelashes between the wand and the plastic of this lash guard, forcing the mascara wand bristles to comb through my lashes, which really helped separate and lengthen without clumping.</li>
            <li>I really thought it was going to work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>VERY inexpensive</li>
            <li>It it not flexible and really serves no purpose.</li>
            <li>it alao came fast</li>
            <li>Really neat item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy and there are no directions in english.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>Much to my delight</li>
            <li>Does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>, pink is okay</li>
            <li>this item is useful for make up, clear problem user</li>
            <li>I recommend it because it really works</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>It allows you load on as much mascara as you want with no risk of messing anything up.</li>
            <li>If I took the time to use this tool, I can take the time to put on my mascara more carefully.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was poor, but the quality of the item is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too much of a pain to try to position it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the shield part</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very helpful tool when applying mascara.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>Handy but kind of awkward to use.</li>
            <li>Also great for false lashes as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea, but its not amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to this</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that the mascara coating is EVERYWHERE for every application so you always have to clean it to have it ready to go for next time</li>
            <li>For very little money, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make it any easier to apply without the mess, but it is getting better as time goes by.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s just ok, not really useful like it&#x27;s said.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s not bad, actually.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would help much, but it works really good, it&#x27;s usually very hard for me to do my lower lashes without getting mascara on me</li>
            <li>Good for someone who is new at using mascara or whose hands are shaky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>It helps make the mascara looks better and less clumpy.</li>
            <li>I mainly just use the comb part to separate lashes</li>
            <li>This is decent.</li>
            <li>And, my lashes curl just enough to NOT hit my eyelids and leave tiny dots along the top.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the end of it to comb through my eyebrows or lashes.</li>
            <li>It requires patience and a steady hand.</li>
            <li>Removing the unwanted mascara with a Q-tip or touching up with eyeshadow or eyeliner is a bit of a hassle and would usually mess up my makeup.</li>
            <li>Makes even more mess using it than applying mascara without it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with eye make-up issues.</li>
            <li>so if it breaks ill sure as heck get a new one&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I can do better by just having a little bit of patience.</li>
            <li>I just love this little gadget.  </li>
            <li>It might work for certain people that have the exact same eye shape as that of the device.  </li>
            <li>fingertips work better was not very satisfied</li>
            <li>I use is with my Vakind Black Fiber Mascara, no worries about it getting in my eyes, I actually get MORE on the lash!</li>
            <li>It came real early</li>
            <li>Lol silly</li>
            <li>Normally, you would hold the mascara tube and  mascara wand</li>
            <li>Either way, I love the product and would recommend it if you have trouble like I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a piece of tissue but its kind of clumsy to hold the tissue in place and apply mascara.</li>
            <li>they should have made this with metal spikes along the lash line part, so it actually has a chance of being useful..</li>
            <li>but it came broken from the brushes but still works good</li>
            <li>Fortunately, there are other options, this device is not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This is the first one that not only can reach back to my eye but also fits the shape of my upper eyelid and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting something new and untouched but</li>
            <li>Its not super easy to juggle this and a tube of mascara</li>
            <li>Age adult females or older youth females.  </li>
            <li>I love the little lash combs!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little gadget!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I did receive it.  </li>
            <li>The edges are a little sharp but it works well to keep you from ruining your makeup if you are not so good with mascara like me.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I first saw such a mascara tool on TV and immediately began searching for one that was not just for one-time use.</li>
            <li>There are pictures on the package and it is pretty simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I actually use this more than I had expected to!</li>
            <li>It has a convent eleyash/eyebrow comb with two sizes, upper/lower lash protection, and it came in the mail early!</li>
            <li>and I usually end up with more mascara on my lid then on my lash but not now.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product keep your upper and lower lashes clean, it lifts your lower lashes making them curled.</li>
            <li>I hardly spent anything on the Upper Lower Lash Mascara Applicator Guide Eyelash Comb device, so I&#x27;m not mad, and don&#x27;t want to discourage people from buying it, it will be like a little lottery that the buyer will win if their eye is the exact same shape as the device.&lt;br /&gt;PS - Mine is pink.</li>
            <li>It got here a week and a half earlier than the expected delivery date which was nice!</li>
            <li>The upper edge is used for working on the top lashes, and putting it around your eye, with the top lashes under the upper edge, the lower edge can go behind your lower lashes for eyeliner/mascara application.</li>
            <li>actually was able to un-clump the spider legs as I brushed the wand against the lashes on the flat surface, and I did not have to take off all my eye make-up</li>
            <li>I bought these in the hope that they would work well for keeping mascara off the skin under my lower lashes, but they are so large it was hard to get them positioned in a manner that made them easy to use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight curve to fit the curve of my lashes</li>
            <li>I am not real happy with this product, but it is ok for the price.</li>
            <li>It was super simple and actually helped with clumping.</li>
            <li>Top is kinda hard to do as I feel</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it that often, can&#x27;t get close enough to the bottom lashes with it.</li>
            <li>At my recent eye appointment, my doctor told me that I should start using mascara on my bottom lashes because they are growing straight into my eye.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>the comb can really work or sometime maybe my lash is different that i can not separate sometime</li>
            <li>sturdy and was surprised that it does work.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is that you leave so much mascara on the device.  </li>
            <li>This tool, while I haven&#x27;t mastered it 100% is very helpful, especially for my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok the little teeth leeks breaking and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m so glad i bought it no more mascara where it&#x27;s not wanted!</li>
            <li>If you do not have a steady hand or just cannot see well enough to apply mascara to your bottom lashes,  then purchase this gadget.</li>
            <li>I thought this thing was really cool, the only use I have for it, is applying mascara for my upper lid as I have really long eyelashes</li>
            <li>so be careful, even though it is not expensive,  but don&#x27;t count on it.</li>
            <li>the little comb is super helpful at removing any clumps too.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s got a little comb on the handle that works alright.</li>
            <li>You do have to clean it every so often because mascara does get all over it, but this is no different than any other makeup tool you use (e.g. eyelash curlers!)</li>
            <li>A new standard in my make-up kit!</li>
            <li>Actually, it didn&#x27;t help much, I tried with my lower lashes and it was actually like a obstable, probably just me, but I&#x27;m not used to it yet.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to order because the shipping said it was more than a month and other reviews talked about the angle of the eye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not shaped to fit all eye shapes and the applicator is hard plastic, so it will not bend or mold in any way.  </li>
            <li>When applying to my top lashes, it goes on great, but it&#x27;s hard to reach the base of my lashes and it can get a bit clumpy</li>
            <li>Now, I refuse to use the silly wands that come with most mascaras as I find the silicon type ones separate my lashes more than a standard disposable wand does, so maybe that is why I have had better results than some of the bad reviewers.</li>
            <li>only a complete idot would not figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li>My husband later found my old one under my car seat.</li>
            <li>Allows you to see your upper lash completely with mirror.  </li>
            <li>I just barely got this in the mail</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde with invisible eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the patience to carefully apply mascara, it takes too much precision.</li>
            <li>yes..the instructions are in Chinese but the you tube video helped me out aloy as far as how to use it.</li>
            <li>I can do both top and bottom lashes without worrying that I&#x27;ll smudge mascara on my skin, or worse yet, on my eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to ship, and another couple weeks to get to me (I didn&#x27;t find out until later that it was coming via post, but I could live with that because of the low price).</li>
            <li>This was slightly helpful on my left eye; I couldn&#x27;t quite make it work on my right</li>
            <li>Silly little thing but works great.</li>
            <li>The package is all in a foreign language, but it really doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out how to use this.</li>
            <li>Has what I assume is a separating comb on the other end that works VERY well.</li>
            <li>mine just arrived semi early, but cheap as hell.. doesnt do anything for my long thick lashes.</li>
            <li>At least you can wipe this clean.</li>
            <li>When I try to apply mascara to my bottom lashes, the little teeth are pretty spiky</li>
            <li>It is hard if not impossible to get the mascara all the way to the lash line.  </li>
            <li>The one that came to me was blue and not pink, but I find that to actually be a plus.</li>
            <li>It is not that much helpful, you will still have the same problem of a mascara mess.</li>
            <li>The little combs on the ends really help take out clumpy-ness.</li>
            <li>This crazy little plastic tool is the best little gadget I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I really like this little thing.</li>
            <li>This little piece of good idea gone wrong is shipped from Hong Kong and takes forever.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about this mascara applicator because it&#x27;s hard to apply mascara yo lashes using this  product.  </li>
            <li>Good for upper eyelashes, bad for the lower eyelashes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this !!</li>
            <li> SOOO MUCH MORE EASIER!!</li>
            <li> The color also looks very nice.</li>
            <li> it works amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this $5 purchase! :)</li>
            <li> every girl who wears make up needs to own  one of these babies!</li>
            <li> but my friend tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> It flared them out gorgeously.</li>
            <li> comes in handy, works great for applying make up around the eye.</li>
            <li> It good for a starter in beauty</li>
            <li> Because it was mailed from China, it took awhile, but was well packaged and the price was good for this product.</li>
            <li> yes i think this is good</li>
            <li> Helps when tinting too, too 6 weeks to get though, it&#x27;s a good quality product,</li>
            <li> A good idea that just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was really cheap which was great!</li>
            <li> Good  purchase</li>
            <li> So, it had something good about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product compared to its price.</li>
            <li> loved it.</li>
            <li> good addition to my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here, also when you use it to try to guard your bottom lashes so you don&#x27;t get mascara on your cheeks, you just end up not getting mascara anywhere good.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this product all the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped fast, works great!</li>
            <li> so your eyelashes don&#x27;t clump up and stay all separated giving the effect a better look, and then if there is any clumping the bottom part is a great too to help separate the lashes.</li>
            <li> It does not work any better than if you used a business card!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> This works perfect to set your lashes exactly the way you want them.</li>
            <li> :) wasy to use too!</li>
            <li> I love this tool!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This prevents mascara from getting on your eyelid, a problem that many mascara-wearers have faced.&lt;br /&gt;great invention!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> easy to use and great to travel with.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Comes all the way from China but got here amazingly fast...2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I personally liked how the bottom worked.</li>
            <li> this was a filler item for me but to my surprise its awesome and works very well and cant beat</li>
            <li> Works, kind of.</li>
            <li> This really helps you apply your mascara perfectly without getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> really nice helped me a lot applying mascara.</li>
            <li> It seperates nicely.</li>
            <li> Great protection for all the work put into your eyes, great for use of blending falsies with real lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It was also shipped lightning fast, and the price was great!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to this amazing product, I now have the perfect lashes without having to worry about them falling off when I use the lash curler.</li>
            <li> this is like a gag gift kind of product.  </li>
            <li> Eye makeup remover pads work great to clean this.</li>
            <li> Very cool!</li>
            <li> It got here in good condition and very quickly</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipment</li>
            <li> It very easy to use.for one whom as never use mascara.</li>
            <li> It is very easy t use.</li>
            <li> very lower price and very good product.</li>
            <li> Thus is a great cost and worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that after 40 years of wearing mascara the old fashioned way works best for me.</li>
            <li> It took almost a month to ship, but I was happy with the product and it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> can honestly say I am glad I have one.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the case with most if not all of these kind of tools.</li>
            <li> Very useful &amp; a good tool for the price.</li>
            <li> A q-tip works just as well or better when cleaning up mascara mistakes</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and i love it /)</li>
            <li> The comb on the end seems to work ok though.</li>
            <li> the price shouldof gotten more for stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> It can be somewhat helpful, but I wish the combs were better at unsticking the lashes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for numerous thing for make up.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I just started using business cards in place of this and works so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this purchase was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I think I saw a youtube makeup guru use a business card for this technique, but I think this is way better</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be able to, so</li>
            <li> I was better off without it and you will too, trust me.</li>
            <li> My friends love this and keep bugging me to use it.</li>
            <li> I love it it makesmy</li>
            <li> just say it messed me up more than what it helped.</li>
            <li> I think I can do my eyelashes better without this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with larger eyes and wye lashes this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without using it and don&#x27;t know how I went so many years without having one.</li>
            <li> But since I bought so many</li>
            <li> Seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li> I have ZERO complaints what so ever!!! :)</li>
            <li> It is more than 4 weeks I ordered but never got it</li>
            <li> The comb works ok, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It keeps the mascara from the top of yr eye lid.</li>
            <li> Interesting piece</li>
            <li> Its cute.</li>
            <li> I find alcohol or handsoap works better than brush cleaner to remove.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> It would be an add on an must sure</li>
            <li> just as described, works perfectly and actually does enhance mascara application-no more smudges on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it you will love it</li>
            <li> I do think that instructions or tips on most efficient way to utilize would be helpful.</li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I got more mascara on the lash applicator guide than I did on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love it because I always had problem everytime</li>
            <li> Better than nothing.</li>
            <li> keeps mascara off my face love it</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> love using it because it keeps my mascara from getting on my face and ruining my makeup.</li>
            <li> IT WORKED OK</li>
            <li> but might be ok after a lil practice.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and i love this applicator eyelash comb, I couldnt beleive my lashes</li>
            <li> but there are some better things out there.</li>
            <li> Ya have to practice, make sure you have BOTH hands free and it kind of hurts..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it with all</li>
            <li> ..will have to give it more time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> ok so for 2 bucks i cant expect more..</li>
            <li> Nice device, very useful.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it took a month to be delivered and the plastic is kind of cheap and could break easily, but otherwise this is the perfect tool for my favorite mascara with my deep set eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this thingy because I get stains on my eye lid every time I put mascara on&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The price which included free shipping seemed too good to be true ($1.77).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good</li>
            <li> Fast shipped, nice product!</li>
            <li> but boy it was worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> I loved this tool so much that I just ordered 2 more for family members.</li>
            <li> And very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> This is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These were very cheap with free shipping</li>
            <li> The design is simple and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara does leave marks on eyelids that don&#x27;t look attractive.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as describe, works good</li>
            <li> It works WONDERFULLY with my super short lashes!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> But with the pictures its easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and prevents messes around the eye area when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use ,makes your eyelashes fuller .</li>
            <li> I love the clean look of mascara.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do much, but it was very cheap and the one review said it was great, so</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more, through Amazon, and I am sure it will arrive on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fine.  </li>
            <li> works fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super neat and cute.</li>
            <li> I can really get more mascara on my lashes!</li>
            <li> This is an unusual item that ive never seen before, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this on the top lashes but it is pretty good on the lower.  </li>
            <li> I love this tool for quick mascara application and to darken all of my light, ginger lashes.</li>
            <li> best little eye opening product ive ever had.</li>
            <li> These little eyelash tools are great!  </li>
            <li> Took a little time to figure out how best to position this device.</li>
            <li> its fit for eyeless lash</li>
            <li> THIS is a great idea but only in theory.</li>
            <li> now wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> this handy item really helps to separate my lashes..</li>
            <li> And it works great for upper and lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Yes it was cheap, and why not buy it you know?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use it honestly</li>
            <li> Cheap quality but does the job</li>
            <li> Not quite so easy to clean as the ridges (used to help separate the lashes) catch the mascara.  </li>
            <li> Before I purchased the item, it would have been great to know that there is no English on the packaging and one may need an interpreter.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and it takes a few times to get used to it, but it is awesome!!</li>
            <li> It really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> big win in my book.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a smooth even edge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> But the video is more than useful.  </li>
            <li> Its really cheap and does help</li>
            <li> Yes my heavy handed self needed this great buy!</li>
            <li> I can do much thicker and more detailed lashes with this!</li>
            <li> BUT w/ this little thingie, its neat perfect and clean.  </li>
            <li> but the item did come intact and is probably very useful</li>
            <li> and it would be exactly as pictured, I would have ordered more.</li>
            <li> Was tricky to handle at first but ok product</li>
            <li> I would say its worth a try!</li>
            <li> could when used around something shaped as unique as a person&#x27;s lash line.</li>
            <li> but I did try it and it helps a lot, but I mostly got it for the comb which really helps separate lashes!</li>
            <li> It makes you blink too much and free hand is 100x better</li>
            <li> It looks super cheap in the photo</li>
            <li> It saves time, because you don&#x27;t have to clean up smudges after putting on your mascara.  </li>
            <li> It arrived about 10 days earlier then estimated which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of tricky to hold this while you&#x27;re applying mascara and most of the time I find it easier to just not use it at all which kind of makes it pointless.</li>
            <li> , it didnt fit around my eye right, but it was really cheap</li>
            <li> This does a great job with keeping mascara marks clean but the product of the mascara itself is harder to get onto the lashes.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received this in the mail.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool product, looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> but in person it is much sturdier and better plastic.</li>
            <li> However it is a good tool and inexpensive, I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I liked it</li>
            <li> It come a day earlier so that was good.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would get here in time for my niece sweet 16 teen and came a week before shipping date package was in good shape</li>
            <li> So far this product&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use I like this tool very much</li>
            <li> this is pretty cool!</li>
            <li> just follow the instructions printed on a package, it is pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> I was able to apply my favorite mascara and get coverage ON my lashes only!  </li>
            <li> quick service.</li>
            <li> planned to vote it 3 stars, but I voted 4 for quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather slather it on quickly, but doing so gets mascara all over my eyelid.</li>
            <li> but i love to try new stuff...</li>
            <li> They are very inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but this helps so much!!</li>
            <li> This little cheapy thing is great, i have longish lashes</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget for the days I can&#x27;t seem to get mascara on without getting it everywhere</li>
            <li> Kind of works on lower lashes but does nothing for upper</li>
            <li> that it was going to be really useful</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this too practical, but it is useful.</li>
            <li> My girls were having problems putting on their mascara, so when I seen this I thought it would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be useful</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes of it being a useful tool in my makeup box</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth the effort to order.  </li>
            <li> Buy it is useful</li>
            <li> The product did not meet my expectations but for the price I thought it was worth a try.it</li>
            <li> The mascara goes all over the plastic and isnt perfectly eye shaped so you spend more time lining it up and trying to get it in the right position then its just awkward.  </li>
            <li> Great little tool and a GREAT little price!</li>
            <li> This is likely best for Asian eyes, but I&#x27;ve successfully used it for my blue eyes and it definitely takes the mascara smudges</li>
            <li> very good for a shaky handed person like me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right??  </li>
            <li> I know right.. Murphys Law.  </li>
            <li> I have looked all over the internet for just the right tool to help keep mascara off of my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> If you hold it in place to get it just right? ..</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but harder to use than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Great little gadget to keep mascara off your face!  </li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing!</li>
            <li> cheap, so you certainly can try it without too much risk.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE ITEM THAT MAKES MY WHOLE MASCARA APPLYING ROUTINE</li>
            <li> works okay kind of thick</li>
            <li> In theory it seems great, but in practice it is too big and not contoured enough for the eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Because my eyelashes are so soft and fine, they tend to bend away from the mascara want</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup, so I love all the new gadgets that I&#x27;ve been getting.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty self explanatory how to use anyways</li>
            <li> It works pretty well when I am applying mascara and don&#x27;t want to get any on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to hold the shield at a weird angle to use it on my top lashes and I&#x27;m able to see what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m doing on the bottom lashes :)</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from a company in China.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is</li>
            <li> Got it fast!</li>
            <li> but it fits over and under eye pretty well...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li> I tossed it after my first unsuccessful attempt.</li>
            <li> You need to know that the top curve is for lower lashes and the bottom curve is for upper lashes as it does not come with any illustrations or instructions.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we was looking for.</li>
            <li> and the small zig zag straight end is great for combing out your lashes if you start getting clumps.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend!</li>
            <li> top part is for your lower lashes and the bottom is for your upper lashes, and the comb at the end is for, well, combing your eyelashes if they ever get clumpy.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier for me to apply my mascara in the mornings!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to use the item and have tried many different ways to make it work when putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> Bought several more as stocking stuffers for my girls.  </li>
            <li> Comes in cute Japanese packaging.</li>
            <li> but it cant get close enough to stop the mascara wand bristles from touching the skin just below the lash line.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> Better to get a smaller brush for the lowers.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as they claim it does.</li>
            <li> It gets in the way of actually putting the mascar on whether it&#x27;s on the top or the bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I first use eyelash gel to keep my lashes in place</li>
            <li> Thanks seller!</li>
            <li> really hope it turns out to work!...</li>
            <li> as I said, it seems all properly trained women are able to do this without ever needing this gadget, so if you can&#x27;t, let me advise you: buy this and never tell anyone about it.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good idea for those who have trouble putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, short eyelashes.</li>
            <li> when I opened the package, the cute display card the item came on had not a single bit of the English language,but had sketchings of the direction, which was good enough.  </li>
            <li> Keeps mascara for smearing on the bottom and top lids, kind of my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> it works really well, especially on bottom lashes and eliminated the need for me touching peoples eyelids.</li>
            <li> But if you use this, it will push your upper lashes higher so you can easily brush them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> how long they was with using the product, and most of off it keeps the mascara off your eye lids smearing every where</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two different surfaces actually allow you to easily and well cover the lower or upper lid to get a good surface to brush the wand against, so the design works very well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> If the tool would have been slightly smaller and a soft rubber piece for the top lashes I think that it would have been a better product, but it didn&#x27;t so it aggravated my eye lids because it was almost like it was trying to stab the upper lid.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and has a comb on the other end too.  </li>
            <li> I received mine in less than 2 weeks, and if you just tilt it to match the shape of your eye, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty neat idea and its cheap too.</li>
            <li> The very top portion is used to push up under you lower lashes, all the way to the lash line, and the lower portion of the rounded area does the same for your upper lashes.</li>
            <li> For the price $1.31 it was a bargain because the others cost around $5-10, and it came so quickly i was surprised.</li>
            <li> It is made of sturdy plastic so should last for years and can be easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> instructions that came with this was in Spanish but with the included pictures and YT videos, it&#x27;s really easy to understand how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just could not get it easily under my short lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cheap product, did not really work well.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very blonde and fine, so I get mascara everywhere..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty particular about how my eye makeup looks</li>
            <li> It arrived a little sooner than the company had estimated, which was nice.</li>
            <li> It was a nice little investment for the price.</li>
            <li> Handy little tool.  </li>
            <li> The tiny little comb thing works pretty good and it separates your lashes pretty well.</li>
            <li> but it came in blue which really isn&#x27;t important.</li>
            <li> I really like this one because it really helps you with  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like the combs and it makes eye make up easier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My lashes grow in every which direction, so trying to get them to appear straight means</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely helpful of course it takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> that when I curl them and apply mascara (I have to curl them because otherwise they are stick straight)</li>
            <li> This product really avoids to ruin your make up once you are applying your mascara.</li>
            <li> and the bristles don&#x27;t really catch my lashes.</li>
            <li> Using this tool, I can trap my eyelashes between the wand and the plastic of this lash guard, forcing the mascara wand bristles to comb through my lashes, which really helped separate and lengthen without clumping.</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> VERY inexpensive</li>
            <li> It it not flexible and really serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> it alao came fast</li>
            <li> Really neat item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy and there are no directions in english.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> Much to my delight</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> , pink is okay</li>
            <li> this item is useful for make up, clear problem user</li>
            <li> I recommend it because it really works</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> It allows you load on as much mascara as you want with no risk of messing anything up.</li>
            <li> If I took the time to use this tool, I can take the time to put on my mascara more carefully.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was poor, but the quality of the item is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too much of a pain to try to position it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the shield part</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very helpful tool when applying mascara.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> Handy but kind of awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Also great for false lashes as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, but its not amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that the mascara coating is EVERYWHERE for every application so you always have to clean it to have it ready to go for next time</li>
            <li> For very little money, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make it any easier to apply without the mess, but it is getting better as time goes by.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just ok, not really useful like it&#x27;s said.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s not bad, actually.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would help much, but it works really good, it&#x27;s usually very hard for me to do my lower lashes without getting mascara on me</li>
            <li> Good for someone who is new at using mascara or whose hands are shaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> It helps make the mascara looks better and less clumpy.</li>
            <li> I mainly just use the comb part to separate lashes</li>
            <li> This is decent.</li>
            <li> And, my lashes curl just enough to NOT hit my eyelids and leave tiny dots along the top.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the end of it to comb through my eyebrows or lashes.</li>
            <li> It requires patience and a steady hand.</li>
            <li> Removing the unwanted mascara with a Q-tip or touching up with eyeshadow or eyeliner is a bit of a hassle and would usually mess up my makeup.</li>
            <li> Makes even more mess using it than applying mascara without it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those with eye make-up issues.</li>
            <li> so if it breaks ill sure as heck get a new one&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I can do better by just having a little bit of patience.</li>
            <li> I just love this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> It might work for certain people that have the exact same eye shape as that of the device.  </li>
            <li> fingertips work better was not very satisfied</li>
            <li> I use is with my Vakind Black Fiber Mascara, no worries about it getting in my eyes, I actually get MORE on the lash!</li>
            <li> It came real early</li>
            <li> Lol silly</li>
            <li> Normally, you would hold the mascara tube and  mascara wand</li>
            <li> Either way, I love the product and would recommend it if you have trouble like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a piece of tissue but its kind of clumsy to hold the tissue in place and apply mascara.</li>
            <li> they should have made this with metal spikes along the lash line part, so it actually has a chance of being useful..</li>
            <li> but it came broken from the brushes but still works good</li>
            <li> Fortunately, there are other options, this device is not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This is the first one that not only can reach back to my eye but also fits the shape of my upper eyelid and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting something new and untouched but</li>
            <li> Its not super easy to juggle this and a tube of mascara</li>
            <li> Age adult females or older youth females.  </li>
            <li> I love the little lash combs!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I did receive it.  </li>
            <li> The edges are a little sharp but it works well to keep you from ruining your makeup if you are not so good with mascara like me.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I first saw such a mascara tool on TV and immediately began searching for one that was not just for one-time use.</li>
            <li> There are pictures on the package and it is pretty simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this more than I had expected to!</li>
            <li> It has a convent eleyash/eyebrow comb with two sizes, upper/lower lash protection, and it came in the mail early!</li>
            <li> and I usually end up with more mascara on my lid then on my lash but not now.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product keep your upper and lower lashes clean, it lifts your lower lashes making them curled.</li>
            <li> I hardly spent anything on the Upper Lower Lash Mascara Applicator Guide Eyelash Comb device, so I&#x27;m not mad, and don&#x27;t want to discourage people from buying it, it will be like a little lottery that the buyer will win if their eye is the exact same shape as the device.&lt;br /&gt;PS - Mine is pink.</li>
            <li> It got here a week and a half earlier than the expected delivery date which was nice!</li>
            <li> The upper edge is used for working on the top lashes, and putting it around your eye, with the top lashes under the upper edge, the lower edge can go behind your lower lashes for eyeliner/mascara application.</li>
            <li> actually was able to un-clump the spider legs as I brushed the wand against the lashes on the flat surface, and I did not have to take off all my eye make-up</li>
            <li> I bought these in the hope that they would work well for keeping mascara off the skin under my lower lashes, but they are so large it was hard to get them positioned in a manner that made them easy to use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight curve to fit the curve of my lashes</li>
            <li> I am not real happy with this product, but it is ok for the price.</li>
            <li> It was super simple and actually helped with clumping.</li>
            <li> Top is kinda hard to do as I feel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it that often, can&#x27;t get close enough to the bottom lashes with it.</li>
            <li> At my recent eye appointment, my doctor told me that I should start using mascara on my bottom lashes because they are growing straight into my eye.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> the comb can really work or sometime maybe my lash is different that i can not separate sometime</li>
            <li> sturdy and was surprised that it does work.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that you leave so much mascara on the device.  </li>
            <li> This tool, while I haven&#x27;t mastered it 100% is very helpful, especially for my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok the little teeth leeks breaking and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m so glad i bought it no more mascara where it&#x27;s not wanted!</li>
            <li> If you do not have a steady hand or just cannot see well enough to apply mascara to your bottom lashes,  then purchase this gadget.</li>
            <li> I thought this thing was really cool, the only use I have for it, is applying mascara for my upper lid as I have really long eyelashes</li>
            <li> so be careful, even though it is not expensive,  but don&#x27;t count on it.</li>
            <li> the little comb is super helpful at removing any clumps too.</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s got a little comb on the handle that works alright.</li>
            <li> You do have to clean it every so often because mascara does get all over it, but this is no different than any other makeup tool you use (e.g. eyelash curlers!)</li>
            <li> A new standard in my make-up kit!</li>
            <li> Actually, it didn&#x27;t help much, I tried with my lower lashes and it was actually like a obstable, probably just me, but I&#x27;m not used to it yet.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order because the shipping said it was more than a month and other reviews talked about the angle of the eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not shaped to fit all eye shapes and the applicator is hard plastic, so it will not bend or mold in any way.  </li>
            <li> When applying to my top lashes, it goes on great, but it&#x27;s hard to reach the base of my lashes and it can get a bit clumpy</li>
            <li> Now, I refuse to use the silly wands that come with most mascaras as I find the silicon type ones separate my lashes more than a standard disposable wand does, so maybe that is why I have had better results than some of the bad reviewers.</li>
            <li> only a complete idot would not figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> My husband later found my old one under my car seat.</li>
            <li> Allows you to see your upper lash completely with mirror.  </li>
            <li> I just barely got this in the mail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde with invisible eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to carefully apply mascara, it takes too much precision.</li>
            <li> yes..the instructions are in Chinese but the you tube video helped me out aloy as far as how to use it.</li>
            <li> I can do both top and bottom lashes without worrying that I&#x27;ll smudge mascara on my skin, or worse yet, on my eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to ship, and another couple weeks to get to me (I didn&#x27;t find out until later that it was coming via post, but I could live with that because of the low price).</li>
            <li> This was slightly helpful on my left eye; I couldn&#x27;t quite make it work on my right</li>
            <li> Silly little thing but works great.</li>
            <li> The package is all in a foreign language, but it really doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out how to use this.</li>
            <li> Has what I assume is a separating comb on the other end that works VERY well.</li>
            <li> mine just arrived semi early, but cheap as hell.. doesnt do anything for my long thick lashes.</li>
            <li> At least you can wipe this clean.</li>
            <li> When I try to apply mascara to my bottom lashes, the little teeth are pretty spiky</li>
            <li> It is hard if not impossible to get the mascara all the way to the lash line.  </li>
            <li> The one that came to me was blue and not pink, but I find that to actually be a plus.</li>
            <li> It is not that much helpful, you will still have the same problem of a mascara mess.</li>
            <li> The little combs on the ends really help take out clumpy-ness.</li>
            <li> This crazy little plastic tool is the best little gadget I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I really like this little thing.</li>
            <li> This little piece of good idea gone wrong is shipped from Hong Kong and takes forever.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about this mascara applicator because it&#x27;s hard to apply mascara yo lashes using this  product.  </li>
            <li> Good for upper eyelashes, bad for the lower eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also extremely helpful when putting makeup on my 8 year old for theatre performances.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this little gadget but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> have Asian eyelashes that are not too short nor long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much everyone loves this little gadget!</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to clean the mascara off, I had to soak it in hot soapy water to get the mascara out of the comb teeth.</li>
            <li> I could, however,  see how a girl with long lashes might actually get some use out of it.  </li>
            <li> I had lost mine for a few weeks and had to order a new one.</li>
            <li> Also, mine came in baby blue (which I actually prefer to the pink, so I&#x27;m not complaining).</li>
            <li> it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts when I purchased it but for the few cents I spent</li>
            <li> First if all I have very small eyes and eye lahses.</li>
            <li> It makes putting on mascara so much easier and completely foolproof, no more mascara mess!</li>
            <li> I love putting mascara on my bottom lashes, but I always get a little messy and it is hard cleaning up the residue.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t pay much.</li>
            <li> I recieved this in the mail way earlier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m using Latisse, my eyelashes get so long (YAY)</li>
            <li> when the item did arrive I understood why it took so long to get to me...</li>
            <li> and you get all out of your mascara longer and fuller lashes also bottom lashes come alive without missing a lash...</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t figured out how this tool could be useful in the application of false lashes.</li>
            <li> only complain is there are some sharp edges</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the product is a little big for my eye.so</li>
            <li> When I got this product, I was totally lost as to how to use it, as I couldn&#x27;t read the foreign language the instructions were written in.</li>
            <li> There are instructions on the package, but the instructions are written in a foreign language, Chinese maybe.  </li>
            <li> I have showed this to several other theatre mom&#x27;s and they are planning to order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK to use, a little difficult to get used to.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected..its a little uncomfortable to use for the bottom lashes but works well on the top ones.</li>
            <li> I have seen other products similar to this.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered the item and received the estimated delivery date which was far long than what is usual</li>
            <li> single day.  </li>
            <li> No more mascara smears when I put on my mascara thanks but trying to comb my lashes is not cool with this product.</li>
            <li> It is cumbersome and not worth the extra effort.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems getting mascara all the way down the last but ymmv.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to hold it and my mascara wand and end up with a bigger mess than without.</li>
            <li> So applying mascara is always a big mess as I try to cover each lash.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be pink</li>
            <li> Im not much of a girly girl</li>
            <li> It does what it says but I only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> and it got to me faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could just use a business card and it would have the same effect, but you would go through quite a few cards at that rate.</li>
            <li> See this lasting a long time, even stored in my makeup bag haphazardly - its pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> The upper edge is used by putting it over your eyelashes to apply eyeliner on the upper eyelid and putting it behind the upper lashes for mascara application.</li>
            <li> This product  does not come in a closed packaged and it also does not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> No real instructions came with the item.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while as expected.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to be so careful when applying mascara or lash tint.</li>
            <li> This gadget is a must have, especially if you have shaky hands or regularly get mascara everywhere  </li>
            <li> This is a strange little tool, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and keeps the mascara off of my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did take a little long</li>
            <li> I want to say, that you will need 2 hands to use this, one, holding the applicator and the other holding your mascara wand.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty look.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the other end for my mascara though</li>
            <li> Even though I have an average amount of eyelashes, no matter how careful I was, the bristles of the brush would still deposit mascara through my eyelashes and onto my eyelid.</li>
            <li> and it has sharp teeth (why?)</li>
            <li> I have small, slightly deep set eyes and have tried other guides (like Dior&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> im going to just use a safety pin like i usually do (very carefully) to remove excess clump..</li>
            <li> Plastic has hard, rough edges that can actually scratch your skin when using it (happened to me).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whatever the case, they should send new ones.. not like the broken one I received.</li>
            <li> and it actually contours to your eyeball instead of a hard piece of paper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little comb thing on the handle is pretty much useless--</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; did nothing but mess up my makeup and get dirty way too quickly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it is to big for me and when this is used it barely reaches fully under my eye.</li>
            <li> But the whole thing just seemed so silly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not worth the effort to use this product.</li>
            <li> lashes look like scary straight spider legs after mascara application</li>
            <li> This was use less.</li>
            <li> I got 90% less mascara on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Odd shape for my eye</li>
            <li> I noticed less clumps also.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have odd shaped eyes?</li>
            <li> Definitely difficult to find something like this for such a low cost in the US.</li>
            <li> then I use black mascara.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to get mascara on this because that&#x27;s what its for and its washable ;)</li>
            <li> I have been having problems of not making a mess while applying mascara to my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess of my lids and getting my bottom lashes is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Does eliminate the mess on face with flakes or misses as you apply.  </li>
            <li> stopped the mess over my eyelid</li>
            <li> I like that you can&#x27;t mess up your lower lashes with this item.  </li>
            <li> the plastics a little flimsy but its priced well</li>
            <li> No more mascara on my lids, and I don&#x27;t have to be as careful, so it saves me time, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t resist getting this little tool at the price.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t have that little comb on the end</li>
            <li> I compared it with other applicator guides and this one was the least expensive by far!!</li>
            <li> Too large, awkward to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth experimenting with, if you have trouble applying tint without it.</li>
            <li> and sometimes when I apply mascara, I get dots on my eyelids and it gets messy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money</li>
            <li> Fits my eye-shape (I have kinda hooded, round eyes) with no problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time waiting for it in the mail.</li>
            <li> if you are really messy with your mascara then this tool might help you.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I inevidibly get a few spots of mascara under my lower lashes when applying mascara....</li>
            <li> Yes you can reuse them a few times but eventually they end up in the garbage and</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I thought an applicator would help but its too much trouble to bother with using it.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times</li>
            <li> But in my opinion just don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> and I had trouble using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Specially, missing make up for use mascara.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it makes my eyes look neater when I apply mascara.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It can also get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a hidden benefit for me to use this tool!</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, so I never do.</li>
            <li> And no q-tips to wipe up the mess around my eyes!</li>
            <li> mine also arrived looking dirty and weird,likes someone had rubbed alcohol or nail polish remover pn it and completely see through.. odd.</li>
            <li> so no regrets but its just a silly thing.</li>
            <li> but it was not marked frazil and it was broken when re. was not able to use put it in trash.  </li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I&#x27;m always finding tools to make my job a little easier and this is it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this item since it was being shipped from China ( I prefer to buy American</li>
            <li> the teeth are wide and poorly molded, so don&#x27;t even bother with that.</li>
            <li> No more mascara all over my eyelid and brow line,</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not okay with me.</li>
            <li> and I will buy another to keep in my makeup bag I usually pack for overnight trips.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> not love</li>
            <li> I thought it would be small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> but now I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> No More Raccoon Eyes.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No more mascara on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about it yet</li>
            <li> It looks like it has been used and a few little brushes came broken.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when i ordered this, but disappointed because it is not easy to use, the curves and eyelash seperator on the applicator are weird, so I am forced to hold it in an awkward position to use it properly</li>
            <li> Didnt really work for me, awkward to use!</li>
            <li> It is always near impossible for me not to not get mascara all over my eyelids and this product helps me to not have that problem.</li>
            <li> hard to apply mascara with this gadget</li>
            <li> It has the hard plastic combs all around it.</li>
            <li> They way its made is a lil hard to usr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered this item at least 3 times now to always have one on hand.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even looking for something like this when I found it, but I decided to try it since lately</li>
            <li> Even worst is when it is in a light color area and you are running late.  </li>
            <li> Slow delivery.</li>
            <li> Plastic is way too thick where you put it against your eyelid.</li>
            <li> A real waste of money.  </li>
            <li> works well no more getting mascara on my eyes!</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not good, the mascara would stick on to the lower lash product and would have to scrap it off after it would harden</li>
            <li> For me, this was really not a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> sorry that I wasted my time.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, they were not good.  </li>
            <li> Very hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this is a very hard product to find in a store.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to sit against my eye close enough to still put on mascara at the base of my lashes.</li>
            <li> also I haven&#x27;t tired it just yet with makeup</li>
            <li> Not going to rate this poorly just because I didn&#x27;t care for it...</li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>
            <li> may work well with false lashes</li>
            <li> Very disappointed but at least the product was only $0.81.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, mascara can be tough for me sometimes.</li>
            <li> And I tend to work really hard on my eyeshadow/liner, and I would always end up getting mascara on my brow bone because of the shape of my eyes, but not anymore!!</li>
            <li> Hate getting black smudges on my eyelids, and below my eyes when I try to put on mascara.</li>
            <li> but no more!!!</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use but that could just be me.</li>
            <li> but it can be kinda difficult to use</li>
            <li> So sorry to write this</li>
            <li> It was too difficult to hold on to it and try to apply mascara.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, this is what I see.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do the job intended.</li>
            <li> sadly that is not what this looks like.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Item was a bit difficult to use for me.  </li>
            <li> Its silly.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> however I found it a bit uncomfortable in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Useless thing.</li>
            <li> totally inflexible plastic trash!</li>
            <li> wish that they at least would give me and answer &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> I am terrible with applying my mascara and making a mess.</li>
            <li> Using a cotton swab to wipe away excess just causes my lashes to go all crazy again.</li>
            <li> Awkward but will learn to use</li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> this is the worst piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on!</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult to apply mascara without getting it all over my eyelids, and then I can&#x27;t remove the mascara without ruining my eyeshadow/eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not outright disappointed by this product, but the shape makes it awkward to use for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to all the people that say that this product is bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad egg?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bad at applying mascara</li>
            <li> and if I had persisted, it could have been really painful.  </li>
            <li> I got this product yesterday and sad to say I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> This thing is crazy to use!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Eyelash combs can fix any bad mascara!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s very painful on your eyelashes when using it.</li>
            <li> Horrible...</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> terrible.</li>
            <li> It looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> The plastic makes a terrible lash brush too.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Slow delivery. Inferior material product is made of.</li>
            <li> I recieved this in the mail way earlier than I expected.  The packaging is all in Chinese but there are pictures showing how to use it.  It is pretty self explanatory how to use anyways and you can look it up online and see the suggested uses.  It works pretty well when I am applying mascara and don&#x27;t want to get any on my eyelids.  This product is great for the price and I would recommend it to anyone who accidentally gets macara on their eyelids a lot.  I was expecting it to be pink but it came in blue which really isn&#x27;t important.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for protecting the skin around the eyes from unwanted mascara. And very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would help much, but it works really good, it&#x27;s usually very hard for me to do my lower lashes without getting mascara on me but this helps so much!!</li>
            <li> Bought but have only used once. A q-tip works just as well or better when cleaning up mascara mistakes and I still haven&#x27;t figured out how this tool could be useful in the application of false lashes. Basically, it just sits in my makeup tray collecting dust.</li>
            <li> This was slightly helpful on my left eye; I couldn&#x27;t quite make it work on my right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth experimenting with, if you have trouble applying tint without it.</li>
            <li> Not good. waste of money, not that you pay much for this.</li>
            <li> Not good, the mascara would stick on to the lower lash product and would have to scrap it off after it would harden</li>
            <li> Great little tool and a GREAT little price!</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use but that could just be me.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I&#x27;m always finding tools to make my job a little easier and this is it! Love it</li>
            <li> hard to apply mascara with this gadget but it may be the operator! No instructions came with it.</li>
            <li> its fit for eyeless lash and i love it /)</li>
            <li> For me, this was really not a good purchase.  I used it but I could just as well not use it and get the same results.</li>
            <li> Amazing idea!!! Top is kinda hard to do as I feel like I&#x27;m bout to poke my eye out but my friend tried it and loved it. I personally liked how the bottom worked. It flared them out gorgeously. Awesome product</li>
            <li> I really like this one because it really helps you with  your mascara andI like the comb  on the end</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this little gadget but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my eye shape but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to sit against my eye close enough to still put on mascara at the base of my lashes. The comb on the end seems to work ok though.</li>
            <li> does what it is intended to</li>
            <li> this was a filler item for me but to my surprise its awesome and works very well and cant beat the price shouldof gotten more for stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> It can be somewhat helpful, but I wish the combs were better at unsticking the lashes. Good for someone who is new at using mascara or whose hands are shaky.</li>
            <li> best little eye opening product ive ever had. the plastics a little flimsy but its priced well so if it breaks ill sure as heck get a new one&#x3D;) it works well to push lashes up after mascara and it separates them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it that often, can&#x27;t get close enough to the bottom lashes with it.</li>
            <li> If you do not have a steady hand or just cannot see well enough to apply mascara to your bottom lashes,  then purchase this gadget. It keeps the mascara from smudging on the skin beneath the bottom lid. The teeth in the comb section are too short and therefore, I have not tried to comb and separate my lashes before  or after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Im not much of a girly girl but it can be kinda difficult to use</li>
            <li> Perfect for numerous thing for make up. Styling, curling, cleaning. Thus is a great cost and worth it. Also use it on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got hooded eyelids so I need something like this to keep the mascara off my lids and this does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product does the job</li>
            <li> Kind of works on lower lashes but does nothing for upper</li>
            <li> At my recent eye appointment, my doctor told me that I should start using mascara on my bottom lashes because they are growing straight into my eye. Since I didn&#x27;t want to get mascara gunk all over my face, I decided to look for solutions. I found a mascara shield on Pintrest and decided that I should search for it on Amazon. I found this one and recieved it yesterday. It works WONDERFULLY with my super short lashes! I like that I don&#x27;t have to hold the shield at a weird angle to use it on my top lashes and I&#x27;m able to see what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m doing on the bottom lashes :) There&#x27;s a slight curve to fit the curve of my lashes so it fits great in my eye sockets so I can put mascara on. I&#x27;m really happy with this $5 purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this item since it was being shipped from China ( I prefer to buy American when I can). But it arrived in about 10 days and I love it. If I had known it would arrive so soon and it would be exactly as pictured, I would have ordered more. This was my first purchase from a company in China. I will be ordering more, through Amazon, and I am sure it will arrive on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s serves its purpose.  Hate getting black smudges on my eyelids, and below my eyes when I try to put on mascara.</li>
            <li> It does what it says but I only used it a few times.  I just started using business cards in place of this and works so much better.</li>
            <li> works okay kind of thick</li>
            <li> Handy but kind of awkward to use. I mainly just use the comb part to separate lashes</li>
            <li> I ordered this applicator a while ago and gave up on it.  I was very surprised when I did receive it.  It&#x27;s not quite as easy to use as I expected it to be.  I&#x27;m glad this purchase was inexpensive.  My advice is to use a tissue, to avoid getting mascara on your face.  It&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li> Works, kind of. Good idea!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is</li>
            <li> this is pretty cool! It takes som getting used to though. Its not super easy to juggle this and a tube of mascara</li>
            <li> I really like the combs and it makes eye make up easier. A great buy for the money and it got to me faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Got it fast! Love it. I can really get more mascara on my lashes!</li>
            <li> I thought this thing was really cool, the only use I have for it, is applying mascara for my upper lid as I have really long eyelashes and sometimes when I apply mascara, I get dots on my eyelids and it gets messy. With this, I just hold it over my eye and apply the mascara, having the lashes touch the plastic. I think I saw a youtube makeup guru use a business card for this technique, but I think this is way better and it actually contours to your eyeball instead of a hard piece of paper. I don&#x27;t use the lower lash portion and I don&#x27;t use the comb. I want to say, that you will need 2 hands to use this, one, holding the applicator and the other holding your mascara wand. Normally, you would hold the mascara tube and  mascara wand but you won&#x27;t be able to, so take your mascara wand from the tube, set the tube aside and then take this applicator and put it over your eyeball and then proceed to apply your mascara. The tiny little comb thing works pretty good and it separates your lashes pretty well. When I&#x27;m done, I wash the mascara off the applicator with soap, cause I get a lot of mascara on it. Overall, pretty neat idea and its cheap too.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on client for last tints and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is there are some sharp edges but I filed them</li>
            <li> Horrible...&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 of these one for me and another for my mom and when tey got to me they were both broke. What a waste of money</li>
            <li> This was use less. I was better off without it and you will too, trust me. It makes you blink too much and free hand is 100x better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not outright disappointed by this product, but the shape makes it awkward to use for its intended purpose. It works, but it definitely takes some getting used to. Also, mine came in baby blue (which I actually prefer to the pink, so I&#x27;m not complaining).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do much, but it was very cheap and the one review said it was great, so I thought &#x27;why not&#x27;. Well, they weren&#x27;t lying! This really helps you apply your mascara perfectly without getting it on your skin. The comb on the bottom is really great for separating lashes too. My friends love this and keep bugging me to use it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am a pro and use this on clients all the time. I can&#x27;t tell you how much everyone loves this little gadget! it works really well, especially on bottom lashes and eliminated the need for me touching peoples eyelids. Keeps mascara for smearing on the bottom and top lids, kind of my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I love it it makesmy eyelashes look 10 times longer! I one hundred percent recommend that you get this item</li>
            <li> comes in handy, works great for applying make up around the eye. definitely illiminates all the mascara marks. great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Just holding this in place takes the guesswork out of applying mascara. No more mascara on my lids, and I don&#x27;t have to be as careful, so it saves me time, too!</li>
            <li> Wow! It came real early I didn&#x27;t expect it this soon I was hoping it would get here in time for my niece sweet 16 teen and came a week before shipping date package was in good shape also I haven&#x27;t tired it just yet with makeup but it fits over and under eye pretty well...</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews. I&#x27;m pretty particular about how my eye makeup looks but unfortunately, mascara can be tough for me sometimes. My lashes grow in every which direction, so trying to get them to appear straight means I often get mascara on my lids or under eye area. Using a cotton swab to wipe away excess just causes my lashes to go all crazy again. I thought for the money, why not? It arrived a little sooner than the company had estimated, which was nice. The package is all in a foreign language, but it really doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out how to use this. The very top portion is used to push up under you lower lashes, all the way to the lash line, and the lower portion of the rounded area does the same for your upper lashes. It was super simple and actually helped with clumping. Now, I refuse to use the silly wands that come with most mascaras as I find the silicon type ones separate my lashes more than a standard disposable wand does, so maybe that is why I have had better results than some of the bad reviewers. You do have to clean it every so often because mascara does get all over it, but this is no different than any other makeup tool you use (e.g. eyelash curlers!) Either way, I love the product and would recommend it if you have trouble like I do.</li>
            <li> very lower price and very good product. Every women would like it. The color also looks very nice. So like it.</li>
            <li> THIS is a great idea but only in theory. It does not work well at all. now wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I went to my bathroom to try it out and lets just say it messed me up more than what it helped. If the tool would have been slightly smaller and a soft rubber piece for the top lashes I think that it would have been a better product, but it didn&#x27;t so it aggravated my eye lids because it was almost like it was trying to stab the upper lid. Very disappointed but at least the product was only $0.81.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could just use a business card and it would have the same effect, but you would go through quite a few cards at that rate. At least you can wipe this clean. Fits my eye-shape (I have kinda hooded, round eyes) with no problems. See this lasting a long time, even stored in my makeup bag haphazardly - its pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is decent. I think I can do my eyelashes better without this. It does get rid of clumsiness though! Probably won&#x27;t reach for it often.</li>
            <li> It looks super cheap in the photo but in person it is much sturdier and better plastic. It got here a week and a half earlier than the expected delivery date which was nice! Shipping was about 2 weeks total. It works well but if you&#x27;re like me and in a hurry in the morning, it can be a bit time consuming. However it is a good tool and inexpensive, I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> So sorry to write this but the item did come intact and is probably very useful but I am a grandmother who ordered it for my granddaughter. Was no instructions with it so guess she will know how to use it but I dont.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to all the people that say that this product is bad. It&#x27;s absolutely helpful of course it takes a while to get used to. But i&#x27;m so glad i bought it no more mascara where it&#x27;s not wanted! (: yes the instructions are in chinese? Maybe, but they have a diagram showing how to use it only a complete idot would not figure out how to use it. For the price $1.31 it was a bargain because the others cost around $5-10, and it came so quickly i was surprised.</li>
            <li> this handy item really helps to separate my lashes.. its great for the perfect lash every time! the little comb is super helpful at removing any clumps too.</li>
            <li> Silly little thing but works great. When I&#x27;m using Latisse, my eyelashes get so long (YAY) that when I curl them and apply mascara (I have to curl them because otherwise they are stick straight) I get mascara all over my eyelid. Not a pretty look. This helps prevent it. I have had no problems getting mascara all the way down the last but ymmv.</li>
            <li> I could not use this product.  It was too difficult to hold on to it and try to apply mascara.  It might work for others, but not for me!</li>
            <li> It good for a starter in beauty and I felt that the applicator is for beginners. I didn&#x27;t like that the mascara coating is EVERYWHERE for every application so you always have to clean it to have it ready to go for next time</li>
            <li> In theory it seems great, but in practice it is too big and not contoured enough for the eyelids.  The best part about it for me is the comb-like lash separators.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the little lash combs! They work great when my lashes get all clumpy. Haven&#x27;t tried the other end for my mascara though</li>
            <li> Havent used it yet because the direction are in Chinease or Manderin. They should have sent directions in English..I cant read that!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped fast, works great!</li>
            <li> This product really avoids to ruin your make up once you are applying your mascara. I&#x27;m giving this to my friends as favor gifts on my party.</li>
            <li> This little cheapy thing is great, i have longish lashes and i get mascara all over my brow line/bone area alllllll the time - BUT w/ this little thingie, its neat perfect and clean.  Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to get mascara on this because that&#x27;s what its for and its washable ;)</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, short eyelashes. This makes it very difficult to apply mascara without getting it all over my eyelids, and then I can&#x27;t remove the mascara without ruining my eyeshadow/eyeliner. This is a strange little tool, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and keeps the mascara off of my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*But* there&#x27;s a hidden benefit for me to use this tool! Because my eyelashes are so soft and fine, they tend to bend away from the mascara want and the bristles don&#x27;t really catch my lashes. Using this tool, I can trap my eyelashes between the wand and the plastic of this lash guard, forcing the mascara wand bristles to comb through my lashes, which really helped separate and lengthen without clumping. It&#x27;s a little tricky but once I got the hang of it, my mascara application went a lot faster because I only needed to swipe the want a couple times and didn&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning up clumps and eyelid streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little comb thing on the handle is pretty much useless-- the teeth are wide and poorly molded, so don&#x27;t even bother with that. If you need a mascara comb buy a proper metal-toothed comb.</li>
            <li> It is a very great item! It&#x27;s exactly what the description says. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the product is a little big for my eye.so i have to find a way to get all my lashes the same.</li>
            <li> This thing is THE BOMB! I use is with my Vakind Black Fiber Mascara, no worries about it getting in my eyes, I actually get MORE on the lash!</li>
            <li> First if all I have very small eyes and eye lahses. So this just isn&#x27;t for everyone.  I&#x27;m sure with larger eyes and wye lashes this would be perfect. Unfortunately for me it is to big for me and when this is used it barely reaches fully under my eye. Again this is just to big and will work do I guess &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized eyes.  I do wish it was the adjustable because I had to give it to my cousin and she said it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time waiting for it in the mail. It does not work any better than if you used a business card!</li>
            <li> This thing needs a handle.I tossed it after my first unsuccessful attempt.I can do better by just having a little bit of patience.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little gadget! I don&#x27;t go a day without using it and don&#x27;t know how I went so many years without having one. I&#x27;ve re-ordered this item at least 3 times now to always have one on hand.</li>
            <li> I GOT SO USED TO HAVING THIS PRODUCT I CANNOT DO MY EYELASHES WITHOUT THEM NOW. UGH. this product is amazing. helps you even and brush the out beautifully and also prevents from getting it everywhere BUT your eyelashes LOL love this !!!!</li>
            <li> Great price. Perfect mascara applicator guide.</li>
            <li> I first saw such a mascara tool on TV and immediately began searching for one that was not just for one-time use. I have had the increasing problem of getting dots of mascara on my upper eyelids during the application process. Even though I have an average amount of eyelashes, no matter how careful I was, the bristles of the brush would still deposit mascara through my eyelashes and onto my eyelid. Removing the unwanted mascara with a Q-tip or touching up with eyeshadow or eyeliner is a bit of a hassle and would usually mess up my makeup. This tool is the answer I was looking for! You need to know that the top curve is for lower lashes and the bottom curve is for upper lashes as it does not come with any illustrations or instructions. The opposite end of the tool is the eyelash comb. It is made of sturdy plastic so should last for years and can be easily cleaned. They are very inexpensive and easy to use. A new standard in my make-up kit!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right??  I can&#x27;t seem to hold it and my mascara wand and end up with a bigger mess than without.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like to use it. It is not that much helpful, you will still have the same problem of a mascara mess. So, you can do your mascara without it. It doesn&#x27;t make big difference. Sorry, this is what I see. Didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I really thought it was going to work that it was going to be really useful but it is not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it often but it&#x27;s a nifty tool that I see make up artist using on clients. It was a nice little investment for the price. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed to finish my eye makeup.  It got here in good condition and very quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doris Payne</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this too practical, but it is useful.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it took a month to be delivered and the plastic is kind of cheap and could break easily, but otherwise this is the perfect tool for my favorite mascara with my deep set eyes.  No more mascara all over my eyelid and brow line, and it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> No more mascara smears when I put on my mascara thanks but trying to comb my lashes is not cool with this product.</li>
            <li> This does not work. Plastic is way too thick where you put it against your eyelid. I can&#x27;t get any mascara on my lashes! Waste of money! Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> It very easy to use.for one whom as never use mascara.</li>
            <li> really nice helped me a lot applying mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is very easy t use. The only problem is the directions are not in English. But with the pictures its easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written reviews on this before.  But since I bought so many I guess that is why there is another one.  I just love this little gadget.  It is  for applying eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Seems to be okay.  Because it was mailed from China, it took awhile, but was well packaged and the price was good for this product.</li>
            <li> These little eyelash tools are great!  I already had one that the bottom broke off the end but the tool was still useable.  It allows for mascara application without the need for great precision to avoid getting the goop on your eyelids.  I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom and for my mother in law. Seems like a good idea for those who have trouble putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> if you are really messy with your mascara then this tool might help you. I got 90% less mascara on my eyelids. just follow the instructions printed on a package, it is pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> This gizmo can be used in three ways: It can be used for applying mascara to the upper and lower lids, applying eyeliner, and as a lash/brow comb. The upper edge is used for working on the top lashes, and putting it around your eye, with the top lashes under the upper edge, the lower edge can go behind your lower lashes for eyeliner/mascara application. The upper edge is used by putting it over your eyelashes to apply eyeliner on the upper eyelid and putting it behind the upper lashes for mascara application. I wasn&#x27;t even looking for something like this when I found it, but I decided to try it since lately I have been having problems of not making a mess while applying mascara to my lower lashes. It works great for that, just wash it off after using it. Highly recommend for those with eye make-up issues.</li>
            <li> Was tricky to handle at first but ok product</li>
            <li> Exactly what we was looking for.Thank you.</li>
            <li> Shipping took 2 weeks, product works. This does a great job with keeping mascara marks clean but the product of the mascara itself is harder to get onto the lashes. It&#x27;s a good idea, but its not amazing. Would not purchase again but i&#x27;ll still use it.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised at how well this works. I didn&#x27;t even remember ordering it.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received this in the mail. It did take a little long but boy it was worth the wait!! I love putting mascara on my bottom lashes, but I always get a little messy and it is hard cleaning up the residue. Not only does this product keep your upper and lower lashes clean, it lifts your lower lashes making them curled. The little combs on the ends really help take out clumpy-ness. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect!! I look forward to doing business with you again!! I have ZERO complaints what so ever!!! :)</li>
            <li> It is more than 4 weeks I ordered but never got it so be careful, even though it is not expensive,  but don&#x27;t count on it.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do the job intended. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work when applying mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t lay on your eyelid properly enough to apply mascara.  It&#x27;s not shaped to fit all eye shapes and the applicator is hard plastic, so it will not bend or mold in any way.  The comb works ok, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It has the hard plastic combs all around it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for this, because it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It might work for certain people that have the exact same eye shape as that of the device.  When I tried to maneuver it,  &#x27;the device&amp;#34; pressed into my eyelid and it has sharp teeth (why?) and if I had persisted, it could have been really painful.  Fortunately, there are other options, this device is not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;But thank you, Uxcell, I hardly spent anything on the Upper Lower Lash Mascara Applicator Guide Eyelash Comb device, so I&#x27;m not mad, and don&#x27;t want to discourage people from buying it, it will be like a little lottery that the buyer will win if their eye is the exact same shape as the device.&lt;br /&gt;PS - Mine is pink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> I like it. I compared it with other applicator guides and this one was the least expensive by far!! I paid $.92. That&#x27;s ninty two cents, total. And it works great for upper and lower lashes. I inevidibly get a few spots of mascara under my lower lashes when applying mascara....it just happens. I&#x27;ve tried using a piece of tissue but its kind of clumsy to hold the tissue in place and apply mascara. There is another type that are 1/2 moon shaped and you peel off the back and they stick to the skin but they&#x27;re not meant to be reused. Yes you can reuse them a few times but eventually they end up in the garbage and that&#x27;s not okay with me.</li>
            <li> This gadget is a must have, especially if you have shaky hands or regularly get mascara everywhere  I was able to apply my favorite mascara and get coverage ON my lashes only!  There are no directions in English, only in chinese.  There are pictures on the package and it is pretty simple to use.  VERY inexpensive and I will buy another to keep in my makeup bag I usually pack for overnight trips.  This is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use I like this tool very much</li>
            <li> Great lil helper.  Nothing like putting on your eyeshadow only to get a mascara smudge.  Even worst is when it is in a light color area and you are running late.  I know right.. Murphys Law.  Well this will prevent that and the small zig zag straight end is great for combing out your lashes if you start getting clumps.  Item does take a bit of time to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;  Here wishing you a smudge proof face....</li>
            <li> Not going to rate this poorly just because I didn&#x27;t care for it... I guess it does what its supposed to? But the whole thing just seemed so silly. I feel like I wasted my money. I thought an applicator would help but its too much trouble to bother with using it. So its just another contraption in my bathroom cabinet that doesn&#x27;t get used.</li>
            <li> This product  does not come in a closed packaged and it also does not come with instructions. I got this product yesterday and sad to say I am very disappointed. It looks like it has been used and a few little brushes came broken. I thought I was getting something new and untouched but sadly that is not what this looks like. Maybe I just got a bad egg? I don&#x27;t know whatever the case, they should send new ones.. not like the broken one I received. I guess you get what you paid for.  I would not purchase this item again and would not recommend anyone to do so.</li>
            <li> For very little money, this product is amazing. It helps make the mascara looks better and less clumpy. I really recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about getting this thingy because I get stains on my eye lid every time I put mascara on&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t tell whether if this thing works or not because it never arrived and the seller just won&#x27;t answer my emails&lt;br /&gt;I wish that they at least would give me and answer &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> This works perfect to set your lashes exactly the way you want them. It seperates nicely. I had lost mine for a few weeks and had to order a new one. I was lost without it. It was awful. My husband later found my old one under my car seat. Now I have 2 so hopefully I will never be without it again</li>
            <li> its not as great to use as i thought</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> Difficult to use. No real instructions came with the item. Had to figure out how to use it. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Lol silly I got this but it works I&#x27;m really bad at applying mascara but no more!!!</li>
            <li> Does not help put on mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok the little teeth leeks breaking and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Awkward but will learn to use</li>
            <li> I was browsing amazon and I thought, what the heck I&#x27;ll try it. Shipping took a while as expected. I used it a few times but I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s very painful on your eyelashes when using it. Like when you brush upwards it hurts your lashes. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but I just found it a hassle. Yes it was cheap, and why not buy it you know? But in my opinion just don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> This little piece of good idea gone wrong is shipped from Hong Kong and takes forever.  It it not flexible and really serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> cheap!!! and great! it works amazing! every girl who wears make up needs to own  one of these babies! it alao came fast</li>
            <li> Really neat item. It keeps the mascara from the top of yr eye lid. Also great for false lashes as well. Great price!</li>
            <li> Odd shape for my eye and I had trouble using it.</li>
            <li> When I got this product, I was totally lost as to how to use it, as I couldn&#x27;t read the foreign language the instructions were written in. However, I found a video on the internet and found that this inexpensive tool is totally helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top part is for your lower lashes and the bottom is for your upper lashes, and the comb at the end is for, well, combing your eyelashes if they ever get clumpy. It keeps mascara from smudging on my eyeshadow or giving me raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to apply mascara without it.</li>
            <li> easy to use and great to travel with. great for the price! love using it with my fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but works well once you get the hang of it. Still practicing bottom lashes...</li>
            <li> My girls were having problems putting on their mascara, so when I seen this I thought it would be worth trying.  It took about 2 1/2 months to receive in the mail *ships from china*.  These were very cheap with free shipping so I cant complain one bit :D  My youngest daughter is 13 and has very short eyelashes. She can now apply her mascara without my help &amp; she loves this. Thank you who ever come up with this idea :D  I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> it does what it says, but eh i&amp;#34;m not too stoked about it. You can use a plastic spoon and it will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I used to have this product before and had lost it, but I luv you don&#x27;t have the risk of ever getting mascara on anywhere but your eyelashes and plus when applying it helps so your eyelashes don&#x27;t clump up and stay all separated giving the effect a better look, and then if there is any clumping the bottom part is a great too to help separate the lashes. for this price this product is a must have.</li>
            <li> well it does its purpose, put mascara on without looking like a raccoon. genius for whoever invented it. quick service.</li>
            <li> the comb can really work or sometime maybe my lash is different that i can not separate sometime yes i think this is good</li>
            <li> For the money this was sold for this  was a great buy. It does take forever to be shipped because it comes from China.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy and there are no directions in english.&lt;br /&gt;Do not love it.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier for me to apply my mascara in the mornings! I don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess of my lids and getting my bottom lashes is a breeze. The combs on the end work well for separating clumps. Every girl should get one!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use it honestly but I couldn&#x27;t resist getting this little tool at the price. Interesting piece</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good y&#x27;all people should get some 👏😊</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing! I no longer have to be so careful when applying mascara or lash tint. And, my lashes curl just enough to NOT hit my eyelids and leave tiny dots along the top.</li>
            <li> Its cute. I thought it would be small. Its a great help when doing your eyelashes in the car and the car keeps moving since it helps you to not stain :) wasy to use too!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality but does the job</li>
            <li> I am not real happy with this product, but it is ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I actually use this more than I had expected to! I mainly use the end of it to comb through my eyebrows or lashes. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product, did not really work well. At least I didn&#x27;t pay much.</li>
            <li> sturdy and was surprised that it does work.  still getting use to.</li>
            <li> I have small, slightly deep set eyes and have tried other guides (like Dior&#x27;s).  This is the first one that not only can reach back to my eye but also fits the shape of my upper eyelid and it is easy to use.  Not quite so easy to clean as the ridges (used to help separate the lashes) catch the mascara.  I find alcohol or handsoap works better than brush cleaner to remove.  Eye makeup remover pads work great to clean this.</li>
            <li> There are instructions on the package, but the instructions are written in a foreign language, Chinese maybe.  Don&#x27;t know how to use the item and have tried many different ways to make it work when putting on mascara. Before I purchased the item, it would have been great to know that there is no English on the packaging and one may need an interpreter.</li>
            <li> The applicator guide is just what I needed to use when appliying my eyelash tint.  The price which included free shipping seemed too good to be true ($1.77). When I ordered the item and received the estimated delivery date which was far long than what is usual I was skeptical.  The item did arrive on time...but it seemed like forever...when the item did arrive I understood why it took so long to get to me...it came directy from Singapore-thru customs etc-stamped as internation mail.  Much to my delight when I opened the package, the cute display card the item came on had not a single bit of the English language,but had sketchings of the direction, which was good enough.  If you need written instructions in English this item is not for you.</li>
            <li> Bought several more as stocking stuffers for my girls.  They keep trying to steal mine!  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.  Awkward.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be useful but I really didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> The edges are a little sharp but it works well to keep you from ruining your makeup if you are not so good with mascara like me. I noticed less clumps also. I would say its worth a try!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do as well as any preformed piece of plastic could when used around something shaped as unique as a person&#x27;s lash line. It requires patience and a steady hand. I&#x27;m only using it if I get a clump while I&#x27;m putting on my mascara- I&#x27;ve found that after 40 years of wearing mascara the old fashioned way works best for me. No complaints about the product though- it is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I toss this 10 minutes after opening it.  What was I thinking?</li>
            <li> Helps when tinting too, too 6 weeks to get though, it&#x27;s a good quality product, thought I thought i was getting it in blue, pink is okay i guess</li>
            <li> I am terrible with applying my mascara and making a mess. When I saw this, I thought I would give it a try and it takes a few times to get used to it, but it is awesome!! I ordered an extra for my sister who also has the application issues and gave it to her for her birthday - she loves it too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also extremely helpful when putting makeup on my 8 year old for theatre performances. I have showed this to several other theatre mom&#x27;s and they are planning to order.</li>
            <li> Very hard plastic.  It doesn&#x27;t have any give.  It doesn&#x27;t help keep mascara off your skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> terrible. opened it in the package and snapped in two</li>
            <li> A real waste of money.  A good idea that just doesn&#x27;t work.  I would not advise anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> Great little gadget to keep mascara off your face!  Great price, quick shipment</li>
            <li> this item is useful for make up, clear problem user and it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specially, missing make up for use mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! It saves your eye shadow from getting mascara all over it. It is always near impossible for me not to not get mascara all over my eyelids and this product helps me to not have that problem. It has a convent eleyash/eyebrow comb with two sizes, upper/lower lash protection, and it came in the mail early! Also, it was really cheap which was great! I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Age adult females or older youth females.  Allows you to see your upper lash completely with mirror.  It would be an add on an must sure but in life an must to survive ?? Does eliminate the mess on face with flakes or misses as you apply.  10 it does what it says plus I think.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a very good invention, perfect for women who always stain when applied mascara. I recommend it because it really works</li>
            <li> I just barely got this in the mail and it&#x27;s super neat and cute. It&#x27;s easy to use and prevents messes around the eye area when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> it does the job. No complaints. It really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Helpful when dying eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Great protection for all the work put into your eyes, great for use of blending falsies with real lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Good item</li>
            <li> Love this !! stopped the mess over my eyelid</li>
            <li> just as described, works perfectly and actually does enhance mascara application-no more smudges on my eyelids. big win in my book.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this mascara applicator because it&#x27;s hard to apply mascara yo lashes using this  product.  No, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just ok, not really useful like it&#x27;s said. I bought it with a purpose for my lower lashes. Actually, it didn&#x27;t help much, I tried with my lower lashes and it was actually like a obstable, probably just me, but I&#x27;m not used to it yet. About the upper lashes, I think we all can do it without it. But if you use this, it will push your upper lashes higher so you can easily brush them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often use this to brush my lashes after putting mascara on. It looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I planned to vote it 3 stars, but I voted 4 for quick shipping. It&#x27;s supposed to deliver like a month. But within a week, I got it!</li>
            <li> this is the greatest invention for makeup.  I use it everyday and it makes my eyes look neater when I apply mascara.</li>
            <li> So far this product&#x27;s pretty good. It came on time too.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that came with this was in Spanish but with the included pictures and YT videos, it&#x27;s really easy to understand how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;I have Asian eyelashes that are not too short nor long. When I try to apply mascara to my bottom lashes, the little teeth are pretty spiky so it&#x27;s a bit annoying. When applying to my top lashes, it goes on great, but it&#x27;s hard to reach the base of my lashes and it can get a bit clumpy but that&#x27;s what the comb end is for :P.&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: Good for upper eyelashes, bad for the lower eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as describe, works good</li>
            <li> Very cool! I am still learning to use it!</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. My eyelashes suffered using this product.  **Disappointed**</li>
            <li> Very helpful. Good  purchase</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, too cheap to return and get refund</li>
            <li> Once you get used to it you will love it</li>
            <li> It took about a month to ship, and another couple weeks to get to me (I didn&#x27;t find out until later that it was coming via post, but I could live with that because of the low price). That being said, it&#x27;s not bad, actually. Comes in cute Japanese packaging. The one that came to me was blue and not pink, but I find that to actually be a plus. Has what I assume is a separating comb on the other end that works VERY well.</li>
            <li> Awesome for lower lashes... I was surprised how much I liked it but now I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Maybe I have odd shaped eyes? I didnt like this, it didnt fit around my eye right, but it was really cheap so it was one of those &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; purchases, but I will never use this.</li>
            <li> Very useful &amp; a good tool for the price. I do think that instructions or tips on most efficient way to utilize would be helpful.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?!?!?  This thing is simple, but it&#x27;s a must have for any make up bag. It allows you load on as much mascara as you want with no risk of messing anything up.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this is a very hard product to find in a store. Eyelash combs can fix any bad mascara!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK to use, a little difficult to get used to. Doesn&#x27;t really make it any easier to apply without the mess, but it is getting better as time goes by. Don&#x27;t think will ever get the hang og it though.</li>
            <li> Item was a bit difficult to use for me.  It is cumbersome and not worth the extra effort.  If I took the time to use this tool, I can take the time to put on my mascara more carefully.</li>
            <li> I love this tool! I was a little hesitant to order because the shipping said it was more than a month and other reviews talked about the angle of the eye. I received mine in less than 2 weeks, and if you just tilt it to match the shape of your eye, it&#x27;s amazing. I can do much thicker and more detailed lashes with this! And I tend to work really hard on my eyeshadow/liner, and I would always end up getting mascara on my brow bone because of the shape of my eyes, but not anymore!!</li>
            <li> Trashed it. Poor quality</li>
            <li> This crazy little plastic tool is the best little gadget I have ever owned.  If you wear mascara, then you need to get this!  My eyes look perfect&lt;br /&gt;every single day.  No smudges or clumps...I am beyond thrilled!!!  It was also shipped lightning fast, and the price was great!!!</li>
            <li> This is just okay. It&#x27;s kind of tricky to hold this while you&#x27;re applying mascara and most of the time I find it easier to just not use it at all which kind of makes it pointless. However if you&#x27;re in a big hurry this would help to alleviate accidental mascara blotches.</li>
            <li> not my cup of tea lol. now i just have it to have it. but it does get the job done lol</li>
            <li> I like the idea but the only thing i did not like is the teeth sticking out. I wish it was a smooth even edge</li>
            <li> Tried this item as soon as I received it and I love it is easy to use ,makes your eyelashes fuller .</li>
            <li> No More Raccoon Eyes.  The design is simple and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Mascara does leave marks on eyelids that don&#x27;t look attractive. This&lt;br /&gt;applicator solves the problem.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; did nothing but mess up my makeup and get dirty way too quickly. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never go without this now. I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t in every woman&#x27;s bathroom! Someone needs to make this a beauty tool norm!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when i ordered this, but disappointed because it is not easy to use, the curves and eyelash seperator on the applicator are weird, so I am forced to hold it in an awkward position to use it properly</li>
            <li> Its silly. The mascara goes all over the plastic and isnt perfectly eye shaped so you spend more time lining it up and trying to get it in the right position then its just awkward.  I bought it to check it out. It was $.78 so no regrets but its just a silly thing. I hoped it would help me make my bottom lid lashes easier to apply without smudging but it cant get close enough to stop the mascara wand bristles from touching the skin just below the lash line.</li>
            <li> Fast shipped, nice product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes of it being a useful tool in my makeup box and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have trimmers in my hand and I usually end up with more mascara on my lid then on my lash but not now. Instructions are not it English but it&#x27;s self explanatory.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth the effort to order.  I got more mascara on the lash applicator guide than I did on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes putting on mascara so much easier and completely foolproof, no more mascara mess! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but harder to use than I imagined. When I try to use it on my bottom lashes, it pokes me in the eye. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> I love it because I always had problem everytime I apply mascara to my bottom lashes. This one will help me to stop the smear of the mascara on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap. The curvy end doesn&#x27;t work at all. Luckily it&#x27;s got a little comb on the handle that works alright. Better than nothing. If it didn&#x27;t have that little comb on the end I&#x27;d give it a one star. So, it had something good about it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;m new to makeup, so I love all the new gadgets that I&#x27;ve been getting.  I like that you can&#x27;t mess up your lower lashes with this item.  I love the clean look of mascara.  It&#x27;s cheap and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this amazing product, I now have the perfect lashes without having to worry about them falling off when I use the lash curler.</li>
            <li> This is an unusual item that ive never seen before, but I love it! It came in two weeks in advance. Packaging was poor, but the quality of the item is great. Never seen this in stores. It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> teally helps ti keep the mascara off your eyelid</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than was told to me but it was not marked frazil and it was broken when re. was not able to use put it in trash.  I was offered to have it replaced but declined. sorry that I wasted my time.</li>
            <li> what will they come out with next</li>
            <li> I have looked all over the internet for just the right tool to help keep mascara off of my eyeshadow.  I finally found it.  I had to look at you tube for instructions on how to use it because they&#x27;re in another language on the back.  But the video is more than useful.  It is very easy to use and has a comb on the other end too.  I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> keeps mascara off my face love it</li>
            <li> I actually disposed of this item after several attempts to use it - it just doesn&#x27;t make sense as it is NOT a one size fits all type of tool.  It may work for someone out there, but I think it would be the exception, rather than the rule.</li>
            <li> Came in A LOT faster!</li>
            <li> I love this tool for quick mascara application and to darken all of my light, ginger lashes. Haha! It also helps lift the lashes! It took almost a month to ship, but I was happy with the product and it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The comb feature is the best part. It is a little difficult to clean the mascara off, I had to soak it in hot soapy water to get the mascara out of the comb teeth.</li>
            <li> Its really cheap and does help</li>
            <li> This is a very cool product, looks exactly like the picture. It arrived about 10 days earlier then estimated which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely difficult to find something like this for such a low cost in the US.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product compared to its price. Buy it is useful</li>
            <li> It does protect from getting mascara on my eyelida but it came broken from the brushes but still works good</li>
            <li> There is no way I can review on something I haven&#x27;t gotten!! :/ How can I found out when am I getting this order?? I&#x27;m pretty new to this</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s not the best</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget for the days I can&#x27;t seem to get mascara on without getting it everywhere but my lashes....it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts when I purchased it but for the few cents I spent can honestly say I am glad I have one.</li>
            <li> This is likely best for Asian eyes, but I&#x27;ve successfully used it for my blue eyes and it definitely takes the mascara smudges so your eyes don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Comes all the way from China but got here amazingly fast...2 weeks.  It&#x27;s really too much of a pain to try to position it just so.  You can still find ways to get mascara on your skin, and now, instead of worrying about not poking yourself in the eye with your mascara wand, you are now also trying to keep this thing in place and not poke yourself in the eye with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tiny short lashes so didn&#x27;t work well for me. I still got mascara on my skin, at the root of the lashes.  I could, however,  see how a girl with long lashes might actually get some use out of it.  I just could not get it easily under my short lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, so you certainly can try it without too much risk.</li>
            <li> fingertips work better was not very satisfied</li>
            <li> I thought this was like an eyelash brush. but i guess its for putting on mascara</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I don&#x27;t really use the shield part but I did try it and it helps a lot, but I mostly got it for the comb which really helps separate lashes!</li>
            <li> It works as it says however I found it a bit uncomfortable in the beginning. It can also get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> i read about it on line and decided to try it. loved it. fast shipping. i would recommend it to every one</li>
            <li> I really like this little thing.</li>
            <li> It is hard if not impossible to get the mascara all the way to the lash line.  This seems to be the case with most if not all of these kind of tools.</li>
            <li> Handy little tool.  Says it takes 25 to 30 days to get it but got it in about a week.</li>
            <li> good addition to my makeup kit. love using it because it keeps my mascara from getting on my face and ruining my makeup. great price.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE ITEM THAT MAKES MY WHOLE MASCARA APPLYING ROUTINE SOOO MUCH MORE EASIER!! FOR SOME TIME I WOULD BEND &amp; USE A PAPER MATCHBOOK COVER AND KEEP IT UNDER MY BOTTOM LASHES WHILST APPLYING THE MASCARA..IT WORKED OK BUT COULDN&#x27;T USE IT FOR THE UPPER LASHES IN ANY WAY. SO WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?? THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS..I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the neatest when putting on mascara. But with this nifty invention, I just hold it beneath my lashes, mascara away and wash it off when I&#x27;m through. I don&#x27;t even need an eyelash curler when I use it. And no q-tips to wipe up the mess around my eyes!</li>
            <li> this is like a gag gift kind of product.  i should have know that but i love to try new stuff...</li>
            <li> Not that great to use.</li>
            <li> If you wear mascara, YOU NEED THIS! This prevents mascara from getting on your eyelid, a problem that many mascara-wearers have faced.&lt;br /&gt;great invention!</li>
            <li> This item worked as information given.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected..its a little uncomfortable to use for the bottom lashes but works well on the top ones. They way its made is a lil hard to usr the lash combs for myself but might be ok after a lil practice.</li>
            <li> works well no more getting mascara on my eyes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not worth the effort to use this product.</li>
            <li> I use it for nights I want to &amp;#34;load my lashes&amp;#34; from root to tip and not poke myself in the eye! Very handy gadget!</li>
            <li> very good for a shaky handed person like me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very helpful tool when applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Took a little time to figure out how best to position this device. It works as well as it says..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this on the top lashes but it is pretty good on the lower.  Only thing is that you leave so much mascara on the device.  Better to get a smaller brush for the lowers.</li>
            <li> Useless thing. Makes even more mess using it than applying mascara without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It come a day earlier so that was good. I can use it in case I  get spider eyelashes.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!!! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET MASCARA ON MY BOTTOM LASHES!</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, so I never do.</li>
            <li> Great invention.  It saves time, because you don&#x27;t have to clean up smudges after putting on your mascara.  It works exactly as they claim it does.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all.  Plastic has hard, rough edges that can actually scratch your skin when using it (happened to me).  This went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt price is great and i love this applicator eyelash comb, I couldnt beleive my lashes how long they was with using the product, and most of off it keeps the mascara off your eye lids smearing every where and you get all out of your mascara longer and fuller lashes also bottom lashes come alive without missing a lash...</li>
            <li> Too large, awkward to use</li>
            <li> Yes my heavy handed self needed this great buy!</li>
            <li> I like this tool for separating my lashes both before and after applying mascara.  Mascara sometimes tends to clump and the different sides of the comb work for all the lashes.</li>
            <li> this is the worst piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on! It gets in the way of actually putting the mascar on whether it&#x27;s on the top or the bottom lashes. totally inflexible plastic trash! don&#x27;t bother spending  your money on it, no matter how inexpensive it may be.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here, also when you use it to try to guard your bottom lashes so you don&#x27;t get mascara on your cheeks, you just end up not getting mascara anywhere good.  It looks terrible.  I ended up not using this at all.  The plastic makes a terrible lash brush too.  Invest in a metal lash brush, this one just ends up taking all the mascara off with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this tool so much that I just ordered 2 more for family members. It works well with separating my lashes. I first use eyelash gel to keep my lashes in place then I use black mascara. This tool definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;m a natural blonde with invisible eyelashes.  So applying mascara is always a big mess as I try to cover each lash. It&#x27;s always followed by a q-tip cleanup of my upper and lower lids. This tool, while I haven&#x27;t mastered it 100% is very helpful, especially for my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> The product did not meet my expectations but for the price I thought it was worth a try.it may work well with false lashes</li>
            <li> I bought these in the hope that they would work well for keeping mascara off the skin under my lower lashes, but they are so large it was hard to get them positioned in a manner that made them easy to use.</li>
            <li> Didnt really work for me, awkward to use!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with directions.  Shipping was fine.  I don&#x27;t mind unpackaged items.  I like gadgets but there are some better things out there.</li>
            <li> extra tool. i don&#x27;t really need it. works fine</li>
            <li> Yea!  No more mascara on my eyelids.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product works well! I don&#x27;t have the patience to carefully apply mascara, it takes too much precision. I&#x27;d rather slather it on quickly, but doing so gets mascara all over my eyelid. Solution? This nifty product!</li>
            <li> Nice device, very useful.</li>
            <li> What a great product to help put on mascara when you have shakey hands!  I can do both top and bottom lashes without worrying that I&#x27;ll smudge mascara on my skin, or worse yet, on my eyeliner.  Thanks seller!</li>
            <li> This thing is crazy to use! Ya have to practice, make sure you have BOTH hands free and it kind of hurts..lol  If you hold it in place to get it just right? ..it leaves a red mark on the outside corner of your eye. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it with all it&#x27;s potential because you HAVE to have both hands..so you need a mirror that you can use close up. The one I have I hold..so..not enough hands. My vision isn&#x27;t the greatest to not use a magnifying mirror.&lt;br /&gt;And yes..the instructions are in Chinese but the you tube video helped me out aloy as far as how to use it. Not sure about it yet..will have to give it more time to get used to it. My eyelashes are very blonde and fine, so I get mascara everywhere..really hope it turns out to work!...</li>
            <li> I have seen other products similar to this.  I read the reviews, they were not good.  When I saw this product all the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> ok so for 2 bucks i cant expect more.. but i shouldve known about this store called Daiso that has asian things for 1.50$.. coolest store ever that has these things. mine just arrived semi early, but cheap as hell.. doesnt do anything for my long thick lashes. they should have made this with metal spikes along the lash line part, so it actually has a chance of being useful.. im going to just use a safety pin like i usually do (very carefully) to remove excess clump.. mine also arrived looking dirty and weird,likes someone had rubbed alcohol or nail polish remover pn it and completely see through.. odd.</li>
            <li> It is downright embarrassing to admit to having bought this, but it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes look like scary straight spider legs after mascara application (I probably should have learned how to do it in my youth but somehow didn&#x27;t), so I figured I would try this gadget.&lt;br /&gt;I actually was able to un-clump the spider legs as I brushed the wand against the lashes on the flat surface, and I did not have to take off all my eye make-up again.&lt;br /&gt;The two different surfaces actually allow you to easily and well cover the lower or upper lid to get a good surface to brush the wand against, so the design works very well.&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, it seems all properly trained women are able to do this without ever needing this gadget, so if you can&#x27;t, let me advise you: buy this and never tell anyone about it.</li>
