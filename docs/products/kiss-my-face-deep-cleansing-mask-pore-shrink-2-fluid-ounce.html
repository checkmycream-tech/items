            <li>It needs to be washed off, which is done easily with a damp towel/washcloth.</li>

            <li> I do like this mask, but the package is surprisingly small. It&#x27;s not like most clay masks - it&#x27;s more like a clear gel that slightly tightens after 8-10 minutes, but man, does it work. It smells wonderful and calmed my blemishes, to the point where I had clear skin in 3 days (after one use).</li>
            <li> I awoke one morning and looked in the mirror as I was brushing my teeth,and noticed that I had pores on my nose that were big enough to drive a car through..so I quickly looked for anything by KMF that I thought would help...and this product does.They haven&#x27;t disappeared,of course,but at least they are somewhat refined/diminished.Hard to explain,except now I don&#x27;t have to use spackling compound before I put my make-up on in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;All of KMF products have always been cruelty-free,and the prices are great,and...the products work!!</li>
            <li> DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.&#x3D;.  IT SHRINKS THE PORES AND LEAVES YOUR FACE CLEAN AND SOFT, SO BUY AND TRY IT,.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make my pores disappear, but it does make them appear smaller - and every little bit helps.  I clean my face and then apply this directly afterwards.  It smells great and feels tingly.  When I wash it off, I follow with an exfoliant, to scrub away anything squeezed out of my pores, then moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin look perfect, but it&#x27;s always a noticeable change for the better.  **if it matters to you: I&#x27;m in my mid-20s**</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my face feels after using this mask. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my pores. There is also quite a bit of some sort of cooling agent in this product and it can lead to a burning sensation on your skin. I will probably look into their other products but this one isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask, it really tightens your pores and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Good product, does what it promises and skin feels refreshed and clean after each use.</li>
            <li> I love this!! It does a great job cleansing my skin, and I love the cleansing/burning feeling it gives when its applied. This may bother some people, but I honestly like the feeling :) As other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s not actually a mask in the sense that it can peel off. It needs to be washed off, which is done easily with a damp towel/washcloth. The smell does bother me a little, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Best pore cleanser ever. Its the best clay mask ive tried in s while. It leaves my skin smooth, poreless and make-up ready. Wish the tubes were larger though.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face Pore Shrink is wonderful! I can see a definite and immediate improvement in my skin after using it. I try to use it at least once a week. My pores are cleaner and smaller, my skin has a healthier finish and makeup/powder looks better on my face after using the product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!  Will buy again.  Within a week my friends asked what I was doing different and that was only two applications.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders for my face! I started using it twice a day for the first two weeks and saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> Not for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> smells nice and dries quickly... I should use it more often to be able to tell you if it&#x27;s worth buying. I don&#x27;t have a very fair assessment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in the size of my pores. Maybe I&#x27;m not noticing it? Anyways, it feels really great going on and dries quickly (~10 minutes). I like it. I just don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m seeing results from it. I think they might show up as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin nice and refreshed. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it has no bad chemicals, and it does a great job of cleansing. It smells nice and is easy to use. Best of all, I notice that my pores really do look smaller - thank goodness SOMETHING works! It isn&#x27;t magic, the pores are still there, but smaller.</li>
            <li> It is drying and has not made a huge difference on pore size yet. It may be that it needs to be used several times a week. I cannot do that because my skin is EXTREMELY dry.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin fill refreshed and draws away oil and impurities.  I have been using it once a week and have noticed my pores are less noticeable and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts.</li>
            <li> This was a good mask, but not great. I felt it was a little overpriced for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> From reading reviews by other customers, I thought this was going to be a fantastic product that cleared everything up.  Sadly, that was not the case, I gave it away after a few uses of no noticeable difference.  I rated as okay because I probably didn&#x27;t give the product long enough but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Although it is a gentle cleanser, I did not see any difference in my pores.  I would probably not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The product I received didn&#x27;t look like the picture.  I know that sometimes manufacturers change their packaging, but I think it&#x27;s important to update the product photo ASAP so people know that they&#x27;re getting a legitimate item that&#x27;s not expired, in cases where expiration is a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised by the size of this item.  It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected it to be, even though the amount is clearly stated here.  When I first opened the box, I was really disappointed to have spent $10 on such a small tube.  The good news is that you don&#x27;t need to slather this on thickly.  A relatively thin (compared to some other products) layer is perfectly sufficient, and the texture allows you to easily spread it thin.  Sometimes clay masks can be difficult to manipulate, but this one is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask was very cooling on my face; akin to what mentholated products feel like.  Some people may find this to be strong, but I don&#x27;t mind it.  As it was drying, I noticed that some darker spots actually appeared on my nose, presumably where the mask was working on my pores.  I let it dry fully and washed it off in the shower with hot water.  Afterwards, I followed up with my regular cleanser.  My skin was very soft afterwards, and didn&#x27;t feel dry or tight as I expected.  I did notice an immediate improvement in the pores on my nose.  I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re any smaller, but they&#x27;re visibly less dirty.  I bought this hoping to clear up the darkness of those pores, more so than to make them appear smaller (since I&#x27;m pretty sure that kind of claim is BS anyway), so in my eyes this did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice: turn yours upside-down first when you open it.  Mine leaked some liquid from where the mask had separated a bit, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a natural/organic product.  Turn it upside down so the lid faces up, carefully squeeze out any excess air, and then close it again and knead the packaging a bit to make sure everything is evenly distributed.  I&#x27;m relatively sure that if I dribbled out a teaspoon of liquid every time I opened the tube, the remaining product would end up being a dry lump in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked it a star for the smell.  It&#x27;s so strong that I smelled it when I opened the envelope it arrived in.  Yeah, I could smell the product through the packaging.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal for this item or what, but wow.  I&#x27;m really glad it didn&#x27;t impart any of that smell to my skin in the process of using it, or that would&#x27;ve been intolerable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I can feel my face tightening when I use it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy w/ this purchase.  The product works very well, and quality is excellent.  Highly recomment this item.</li>
            <li> Ok.....don&#x27;t like how it smells or have my face smelling the day after....before I wash my face again.</li>
