            <li>Full disclosure: This product was offered to us for free as a part of a review process.  </li>
            <li>I have now tested LaserFX for the same amount of time and find it just as good to use.  </li>
            <li>She found this serum was great for removing the redness and that it even seemed to retexture the skin of her nose  and made large pores less prominent.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid serum on my face for over a year and it has been amazingly effective - it&#x27;s given my skin back a healthy glow, minimized the finer lines and reduced the crepey-ness that was starting to develop.  </li>

            <li>This product essentially claims to do with a serum what many pay thousands for surgery to accomplish.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I do have a few fine lines, which the serum has helped improve.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re in contact with sensitive nut allergy sufferers, be aware that it does contain macadamia nut oil and do your own research as to the likely safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m really into Ayurvedic herbs, and Centella Asiatica, better known as Gotu Kola, and also Indian Pennywort, has been used in the Orient, as well as in India for thousands of years, and is listed in India’s ancient medical text.  </li>
            <li>It has good skin healing properties, and decreases the inflammatory response when used topically, as well as taken internally, and comes in tablet, capsule, tincture, extract, and tea form.</li>
            <li>It’s just one more medicinal herb that’s been used in Asian and Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years, and fortunately allopathic medicine is coming around, and finally doing research to prove the benefits of these herbs and herbal formuls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I did notice a reduction in appearance of large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels younger - very smooth, soft, and supple - like it did 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Gotu Kola was one I hadn’t read up on too much, and thankfully it came up as the third primary ingredient in dr brandt Laser FX</li>
            <li>I received this product as a free trial item, and I can&#x27;t imagine spending so much for it in the future.  </li>
            <li>And very non-girly.  </li>
            <li>I use an amount about the size of a pea and it covers my whole face.  </li>
            <li>Really lightweight.</li>
            <li>, I’ve been using this for 4 weeks now and really haven’t noticed anything.</li>

            <li>This is more of a light lotion, somewhat thick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Constency wise, it feels completely different that the other dr brandt serum I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

            <li>no pumping the whole top down.</li>
            <li>So far, though it&#x27;s very promising.</li>
            <li>7 hours after application I woke to slightly itchy skin on my face, with a sense that the product would be causing some peeling/ smoothing of top layer and reducing differences in skin layers (patches of skin ready to be sloughed off versus</li>
            <li>There are many different types of peptides and all have various functions.</li>
            <li>This ingredient was of particular interest to me.</li>

            <li>I checked the website for dr brandt and it also recommends applying it in a particular manner - which I did.</li>
            <li>Since I was hoping to address blotchiness rather than texture issues, the box vs online description was discouraging to me for my particular concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a clever system along its length showing where you should be each week, both in terms of product use and promised skin impacts.  </li>
            <li>I, as many of you probably are, was more than a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As far as the “laser” part goes, I don’t really feel this product lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li>and found its application easy, the fragrance pleasing (this coming from someone with a hypersensitive nose) and the results adequate for a short period of time (less than a month.)  </li>
            <li>This new serum feels like a creamy hyaluronic acid -</li>
            <li>We have tried many remedies to alleviate the issue but very few actually live up to their claims.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve expected it to smooth out my skin and make my pores smaller and reduce one of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>After discontinuing use of this serum, my breakout has begun to clear, so I&#x27;m attributing the breakout to the serum.</li>
            <li>I have checked and rechecked, and I really am clear in mind</li>
            <li>Disolves INSTANTLY into the face, yet doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I gave this serum to my fifty-five year year old mother who has a lot of redness and rosacea or adult acne on her nose from time to time.  </li>
            <li>natural collagen and elastin dis make my skin feel a bit tighter.</li>
            <li>far I have seen no results after applying it diligently twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;No difference in my skin texture or tone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have very oily skin, and it feels drier after applying this product, and I definitely need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about most hyaluronic acid serums is that they range from thick (like egg white) to watery and since most of the companies that sell them are very small, the consistencies vary  wildly.  </li>
            <li>It actually made some of my large pores smaller.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is smooth; only a few drops are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’ve also talked to our daughters about how they care for their skin, and even though they’re both young, they are subject to everyday stresses and aren&#x27;t always in the most beneficial environment for their skin - sun, swimming, or around smoke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general I think we should embrace our wrinkles, but if you have an area like my forehead frown crease that bothers you</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general I think we should embrace our wrinkles, but if you have an area like my forehead frown crease that bothers you</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other facial products have made her sensitive skin brake out,</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t think any of these instant serums last long enough to justify their prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oxidative stress contributes to aging in general and various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders.</li>
            <li>Small lines seem to have actually gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are limits to this, obviously very deep lines are not going to go away, but you will see a significant improvement in overall tone and look of your skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I’m really into Ayurvedic herbs, and Centella Asiatica, better known as Gotu Kola, and also Indian Pennywort, has been used in the Orient, as well as in India for thousands of years, and is listed in India’s ancient medical text.  </li>

            <li> Gotu Kola was one I hadn’t read up on too much, and thankfully it came up as the third primary ingredient in dr brandt Laser FX</li>

            <li> I, as many of you probably are, was more than a bit skeptical.  </li>

            <li> After discontinuing use of this serum, my breakout has begun to clear, so I&#x27;m attributing the breakout to the serum.</li>

            <li> Disolves INSTANTLY into the face, yet doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I gave this serum to my fifty-five year year old mother who has a lot of redness and rosacea or adult acne on her nose from time to time.  </li>

            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about most hyaluronic acid serums is that they range from thick (like egg white) to watery and since most of the companies that sell them are very small, the consistencies vary  wildly.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;After less than a week of use, I saw a definite increase in acne, where my products with retinol and AHA had been keeping it almost entirely cleared up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While 2 weeks is not enough to completely gauge the effectiveness of a product, I can say that it will show subtle improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review as time goes on, but for now this will be a part of our regiment and we plan on purchasing it regularly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The primary reason that I am disliking this is the odor.  It has a weird, grandfatherly smell.  I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s more Aqua-velva or shaving cream, but it&#x27;s unpleasant and slightly stranger.  And very non-girly.  And not *attractively* masculine.  And it lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constency wise, it feels completely different that the other dr brandt serum I&#x27;ve tried.  This is more of a light lotion, somewhat thick.  Disolves INSTANTLY into the face, yet doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize.  Also, when followed with moisturizer, the combination felt a touch minty/tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *don&#x27;t* like it.  I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!  I just reviewed the list of ingredients on Paula&#x27;s Choice ingredient dictionary for Dr Brandt&#x27;s $70.00 perfect serum. No wonder it is not working.  According to this respected dictionary the first ingredients are very poor.  My $12.00  bottle of CeraVe has all of the  ingredients listed as &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34;.  I was so dried out from the last Santa Ana, I was desperate for some skin moisturizer.  I used this for two weeks and saw no difference like the bottle claims one will notice. Tthe CeraVe has better ingredients and fewer ingredients. Paula  was the woman who wrote  &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t go to the cosmetics counter without me&amp;#34;.  I forgot how much of a victim all women are until this experience.  I did not do my homework or I would not have bought this based on the type of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Works to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t think any of these instant serums last long enough to justify their prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works about as good as Dermasilk 5 minute, without that great tightening that the Dermasilk has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did smooth my skin, did nothing for under eye circles, maybe I just need to use for longer period??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep trying and update in a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid serum on my face for over a year and it has been amazingly effective - it&#x27;s given my skin back a healthy glow, minimized the finer lines and reduced the crepey-ness that was starting to develop.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about most hyaluronic acid serums is that they range from thick (like egg white) to watery and since most of the companies that sell them are very small, the consistencies vary  wildly.  Dr. Brandt has the antidote to this problem.  This new serum feels like a creamy hyaluronic acid - it&#x27;s lush and  thick while still being silky and super-smooth.  It feels delicious on my skin and because it&#x27;s creamy it seems to go even farther than regular hyaluronic acid gel products.  I use an amount about the size of a pea and it covers my whole face.  Then I apply my moisturizer, which goes even farther with this underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it a short while, but I will update this review after I&#x27;ve gone through a few bottles.  So far, though it&#x27;s very promising.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars from my teen age years 30+ years ago and have noticed a lightening of them. Also brings youthfulness around my eyes. Just a bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> I have been expecting this serum to work as advertised. I have combination acne prone skin with some acne scars. I&#x27;ve expected it to smooth out my skin and make my pores smaller and reduce one of my acne scars. The instructions for the product are to use it after cleaning your face and then to put moisturizer on top, twice a day. I have gotten into the habit of doing that. However, I am not seeing any difference in my skin, except that some of my redness is a little bit decreased but I am unsure if I should attribute that to this serum or to my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it did not bother me, however it is strong and does smell like watermelon. So, results may vary when it comes to the scent.</li>
            <li> I just finished using my first bottle of dr brandt&#x27;s LaserFX Perfect Serum, and I have to admit, this serum is really great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Over the weeks that I used Laser FX, initially my skin began to feel smoother and look brighter/healthier, then I found the little lines around my eyes diminishing, and finally my &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34; line started to go away. I also noticed overall a more even complexion. My skin feels younger - very smooth, soft, and supple - like it did 10 years ago. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it ... for me, my skin was firmer and yet at the same time it feels smoother. The feeling of my skin as well as the look is definitely improved after using this product for almost 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that only 20% of the aging process in my skin is biological, it made sense to me that you can influence the aging process with how I treat and protect my skin. With 80% of the aging process coming from the environment, using products to protect and care for my skin has become a priority for me as I age. I’ve also talked to our daughters about how they care for their skin, and even though they’re both young, they are subject to everyday stresses and aren&#x27;t always in the most beneficial environment for their skin - sun, swimming, or around smoke. I know the natural biological defenses in our skin breaks down with aging, and that’s where the biologically engineered skin care products come into play - they enhance and support the biological defenses..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of ingredients in Laser FX, but the primary 3 are:&lt;br /&gt;1. Heptapeptides  - peptide are forms of proteins and have many benefits. There are many different types of peptides and all have various functions. Peptides deliver the proteins to the undermost layer of the skins ability to increase the collagen.&lt;br /&gt;2. Biomimetic Peptides - One of the reason aging skin becomes less firm and loses elasticity and the ability to “bounce back” is because the dermis and epidermis lose the ability to function well together. Biomimetic Peptides help the skin by replicating the function of more youthful skin, enabling it to regain some of it’s ability to produce collagen and stave off the visible signs of aging - wrinkles, skin tone, and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This ingredient was of particular interest to me. I’m really into Ayurvedic herbs, and Centella Asiatica, better known as Gotu Kola, and also Indian Pennywort, has been used in the Orient, as well as in India for thousands of years, and is listed in India’s ancient medical text.  Centella Asiatica has skin enhancing properties when used topically in the form of ointments - including helping with eczema, leprosy, lupus, varicose ulcers, eczema, and psoriasis. It has good skin healing properties, and decreases the inflammatory response when used topically, as well as taken internally, and comes in tablet, capsule, tincture, extract, and tea form. It  is used to fight the oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Oxidative stress contributes to aging in general and various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. There has been a great deal of interest in this herb in recent years, and many studies done on it’s beneficial uses - particularly in the West as a neuroprotectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect of Centella Asiatica for cosmetic is the calming anti inflammatory effect of this herb - it has been considered the best home remedy for skin disorders such as chronic ulcers and persistent eczema. Centella Asiatica has incredible tonifying properties for the entire body. It’s just one more medicinal herb that’s been used in Asian and Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years, and fortunately allopathic medicine is coming around, and finally doing research to prove the benefits of these herbs and herbal formuls. Gotu Kola was one I hadn’t read up on too much, and thankfully it came up as the third primary ingredient in dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of the product is specific - as I found out with another product, not dr brandt, but  they recommend applying it in a particular manner - it was an expensive neck cream. I didn’t find out how I was supposed to apply it until I was more than ⅔ done with the cream. I checked the website for dr brandt and it also recommends applying it in a particular manner - which I did. I don’t know if that helped or not, but I did get a good effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three serums in the Dr. Brandt Laser FX Series: Lift, Perfect, and Bright. Each serum is designed to target a different skin care concern. I only tried the Perfect, but at some point I’d like to try them together because I have a feeling they’re synergistic - working together for the best effect on the skin. At $78 it is pricey, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get the same effects from a drug store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum for those concerned with skin beginning to show the signs of aging.nt in dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of the product is specific - as I found out with another product, not dr brandt, but  they recommend applying it in a particular manner - it was an expensive neck cream.

            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with combination skin. Yes, I do have an expression line or two and I&#x27;d love to see it minimized, but the main draw for me was lightening acne scars. The product description here touts that benefit a bit more than the product box, which has one asterisk saying \\&quot;may help reduce the appearance of acne scars\\&quot; as a footnote to improved skin texture by 3 weeks of use. Since I was hoping to address blotchiness rather than texture issues, the box vs online description was discouraging to me for my particular concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After less than a week of use, I saw a definite increase in acne, where my products with retinol and AHA had been keeping it almost entirely cleared up. (I added the serum to my routine and didn&#x27;t discontinue the others.) After discontinuing use of this serum, my breakout has begun to clear, so I&#x27;m attributing the breakout to the serum. This isn&#x27;t shocking since it does contain oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re in contact with sensitive nut allergy sufferers, be aware that it does contain macadamia nut oil and do your own research as to the likely safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the breakout issue will probably not apply to many people, but if you&#x27;re acne prone you may want to look for something else.</li>
            <li> Just started trying this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh, pleasant smell and goes in easily when applied. Does smooth the skin out immediately. I will have to use it longer before I can comment on how well it lives up to the claims on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, this product would have to work very well for me to continue with it. The amazon price is $78 for one fluid ounce which is a bit steep - unless it works as well as claimed at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stayed tuned for updates.</li>
            <li> This lotion is lightweight. Really lightweight. If you need a lot of moisturizing then this probably won’t be enough. It goes on smoothly. It has a mild scent. It has a bit of a weird lemony scent to it which I don’t care for, but fortunately it’s mild. This lotion does not make my skin feel greasy. As far as the “laser” part goes, I don’t really feel this product lives up to its claims. It says “diminishes lines &amp; wrinkles, retexturizes, smooths”. And results are supposed to be fairly quick. It gives you a week by week breakdown of what it does.  It “softens and smooths skin” instantly. “Skin looks plumper” by one week. “Appearance of lines and wrinkles diminishes” by 2 weeks. “Skin texture significantly improves” by 3 weeks. “Skin looks transformed” by 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I’ve been using this for 4 weeks now and really haven’t noticed anything. I like this product as a lightweight moisturizer, but the cost doesn’t justify using it for just that.</li>
            <li> great serum skin feels great after us</li>
            <li> I gave this serum to my fifty-five year year old mother who has a lot of redness and rosacea or adult acne on her nose from time to time.  She found this serum was great for removing the redness and that it even seemed to retexture the skin of her nose  and made large pores less prominent.  She found it to be a great product but was alarmed by the price of about $70 for just one ounce. She does like the push applicator that just dispenses a small amount of fluid at a time.</li>
            <li> Dr Brandt&#x27;s LaserFX Perfect Serum is a good product in keeping with Dr. Brandt&#x27;s other products.  I have used his retinol products in the [[ASIN:B006LYO294 dr. brandt Glow Kit]] extensively and liked their effects very much.  I have also tested Dr. Brandt&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00FBBK5HG dr. brandt Do Not Age with dr. brandt Transforming Pearl Serum, 1.35 fl. oz.]] and found its application easy, the fragrance pleasing (this coming from someone with a hypersensitive nose) and the results adequate for a short period of time (less than a month.)  I have now tested LaserFX for the same amount of time and find it just as good to use.  However, the price throws the good effects off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter skin tends to be dry and not as radiant due to the lack of outdoor activity.  I found that this product immediately helped to brighten my skin and to simultaneously plump and tighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the instruction sheet lacking.  This causes me to wonder if this product is meant to be suggested as part of a skin care regime.  If this is so, I have no idea what other products to use with it as none are suggested.  I did apply a moisturizer after using it and I found my makeup application easy--no eye makeup smearing from a too oily product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is smooth; only a few drops are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  I liked the product--it brightens my olive toned skin and gives me a fresh feel.  I don&#x27;t like the price for only 1 ounce;(&lt;br /&gt;Diana Faillace Von Behren&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;reneofc\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice, light fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in well, without feeling greasy on face or hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person is supposed to experience very noticeable improvements within 4 wk.&lt;br /&gt;The sequence of differences to skin as stated, follows.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; First week of use - the results should have the skin looking plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Second - lines and wrinkles somewhat diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Third - skin texture significantly improves.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Forth - skin looks transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter has used this serum before and saw some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Other facial products have made her sensitive skin brake out, this one didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was pleased with the product in that skin pores are somewhat smaller.&lt;br /&gt;She had experienced skin texture feeling nice and a little smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - her results weren&#x27;t as dramatic as product statements.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not noticeable differences in lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I got this serum because I wanted to start taking better care of my skin. I have started using sunscreen daily, and I wanted something to help improve the texture of my skin. This serum actually has made a difference in the texture of my skin. I love that it is a serum and not a cream, because it absorbs quickly and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it. It actually made some of my large pores smaller. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I do have a few fine lines, which the serum has helped improve. The dispenser for this bottle is designed well. All you need to do is to press the button and it easily comes out, so no pumping the whole top down. I have nothing negative to say about it, other than it seems to be a bit expensive for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> dr. brandt LaserFX Perfect Serum, 1 fl. oz. Laser FX Perfect Serum supports natural collagen and elastin dis make my skin feel a bit tighter. I look forward to seeing if it truly creates a healthier-looking skin, texture and imperfections. A bit pricey for 1 fl. ounce at $65 with Amazon Prime shipping. We&#x27;ll have to see how well this works after four weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> This product promises different benefits in each of 4 consecutive weeks.  I&#x27;ll return each week to add information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains a pleasant watermelon fragrance and comes in a pretty, silver-topped, slender pump bottle about the height of a large bottle of  contact lens solution/ a bit taller than a Coke can (see photo).  It has a clever system along its length showing where you should be each week, both in terms of product use and promised skin impacts.  Product easily dispenses from pump exactly the right amount for one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1- The claim: Begin skin care, should notice some refining of skin texture and \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; to begin reducing appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I did notice a reduction in appearance of large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a deep, seemingly permanent crease between my eyebrows from squinting outdoors and in the car in the sun/possibly worry and stress.  It&#x27;s been there for a dozen years at least.  The first application noticeably reduced the appearance of that crease.  7 hours after application I woke to slightly itchy skin on my face, with a sense that the product would be causing some peeling/ smoothing of top layer and reducing differences in skin layers (patches of skin ready to be sloughed off versus renewed layers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2-&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked to see that the frown line/squinting forehead crease mentioned above seems less deep, harder to see, and is really improving.  I did not think that was possible, so I am impressed!  I have checked and rechecked, and I really am clear in mind mind that this is an effect and not just wishful thinking. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that this product offers at least some scientific rationale for its effects, is very expensive but still midrange in price for this type of product, and seems to be working as advertised.  I received this product as a free trial item, and I can&#x27;t imagine spending so much for it in the future.  But I can say that it seems to be helpful, and those who are comfortable spending this kind of money on cosmetics should be pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I think we should embrace our wrinkles, but if you have an area like my forehead frown crease that bothers you this is worth a try. :)e future.

            <li> This product essentially claims to do with a serum what many pay thousands for surgery to accomplish.  I, as many of you probably are, was more than a bit skeptical.  However, almost immediately when this product is used, you will see improvement in the tightness and elasticity of the skin.  It is really surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or two, the results are even more impressive.  Small lines seem to have actually gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are limits to this, obviously very deep lines are not going to go away, but you will see a significant improvement in overall tone and look of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret this purchase at all!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: This product was offered to us for free as a part of a review process.  The review is honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I are both in our middle 40&#x27;s and our skin pigmentation has given us dark circles under our eyes along with loss of elasticity in the skin.  We have tried many remedies to alleviate the issue but very few actually live up to their claims.  First and foremost the priority is to tighten the skin, make it look more energetic.  Once achieved other products can be used to help with the darkened areas or &#x27;circles&#x27;.  The LaserFX Perfect serum comes in for the first step...it will help to tighten the areas where you need it most and eventually reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  We have been using the product for about 2 weeks now....sparingly and we are noticing subtle changes to the overall appearance of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be using sparingly...one or maybe two drops onto a q-tip or cotton ball and then gently massaged into the area you are trying to correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While 2 weeks is not enough to completely gauge the effectiveness of a product, I can say that it will show subtle improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review as time goes on, but for now this will be a part of our regiment and we plan on purchasing it regularly.</li>
            <li> I am 40 with oily skin, no deep wrinkles, but my forehead has an uneven texture. I was hoping LaserFX would help with the texture but after 20 days, I have seen no change.</li>
            <li> Luxurious cream in an attractive package.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have seen no results after applying it diligently twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;No difference in my skin texture or tone.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin, and it feels drier after applying this product, and I definitely need to use a moisturizer afterwards. It maybe even worse, for people with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will update my review after using the entire bottle</li>
