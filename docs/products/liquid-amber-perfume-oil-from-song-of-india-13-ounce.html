            <li>and I must say I am very happy with everything !</li>
            <li>(i wouldnt want ya to break your beautiful bottle!)</li>
            <li>This is the perfect scent for people allergic to florals!</li>
            <li>Song of India makes very good scented oils and Amazon sells it at bargain prices.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife, she say&#x27;s: &amp;#34;The bottle is beautiful, I wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>Bottle and packaging is beautiful, but not the sent I was looking forward too.</li>
            <li>The glass bottle is so beautiful too.</li>
            <li>very nice quality amber</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lasted nicely!</li>
            <li>Also, I think this is an extremely cheap price for an attractively packaged decanter of the best perfume I&#x27;ve smelled in over 10 years!</li>
            <li>this oil comes in a beautiful bottle and looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>This is one of the best golden amber oils I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Very warm exotic scent.</li>
            <li>The seller is fantastic though, and the bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is truly unisex and I made sure we each had our own bottle!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am loving the smell.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own skin care products for my family members and I can not wait to add a couple drops of this into my suger scrubs or bath oils...</li>
            <li>I chose to buy this product because i liked a  lower quality oil i had that i had bought at a fair but wanted better.</li>
            <li>if you dont see that, it instructs you to run the neck of bottle under warm water to soften the wax seal.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another soon to mix my own blend in a screw top glass bottle for my purse.</li>
            <li>I love this product and was thrilled to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Great product, not fake smelling.</li>
            <li>love love love love love!</li>
            <li>and I must say I was pleasantly pleased by the quality of the oil and the fancy decanter.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say more.</li>
            <li>I will be buying lots more for gifts.</li>
            <li>and I feel sexy when applying this.</li>
            <li>It was literally the most divine thing I had ever smelled.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li>but in the \\&quot;golden\\&quot; range, this is a favorite.  </li>
            <li>I think it might just be that I prefer a more vanilla supported Amber.</li>
            <li>I use more than a drop because I really really love it.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful scent, nice and earthy for man or woman</li>
            <li>i like warm sweet musky and woodsy smells.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice and worth the price</li>
            <li>If for no other reason, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase for the bottle alone.</li>
            <li>Just good quality amber oil in this delicate and beautiful glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I enjoy most categories of ambers: sweet, smoky, vanillic, woody, resinous, etc...  </li>
            <li>I place a drop on each wrist and I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Just a nice, spicy amber - no other scents, no sandalwood, no vanilla added to make it smell more amber-like.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those who like a more exotic perfume scent.</li>
            <li>The night before it came, while I was laying in bed, I literally thought to myself, &amp;#34;I wonder if I will ever find a perfume I loved as much as that first amber.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich in color and the scent will stay with you all day.  </li>
            <li>WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for those special times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly special.</li>
            <li>If you are used to the sweet musky smell of quality amber oil you wont like this brand.</li>
            <li>WRONG--Both the bottle and amber oil is a worthy purchase and a value beyond the price.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed my little exotic bottle ,the fragrance is lovely, i purchased this with amber essence and Krishna Musk from Tom&#x27;s incense</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve wanted!</li>
            <li>WOW! :)</li>
            <li>Fantastic product... very warm and dark amber... much like a patcholi but sweeter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i hope iv made it easy to take that leap of faith and try something new!</li>
            <li>Smooth, sexy, and mysterious!</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle, it smelled fine, although not as rich as my old bottle of Amber perfume.</li>
            <li>yeah, the glass bottle is super pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost exactly the right smell.</li>
            <li>Lovely warm amber scent in a delicate, decorative bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also good to put on your jackets or a little on your hair for impressing the public.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very tiny, but that&#x27;s what makes it so appealing.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is adorable, but fragile.</li>
            <li>The bottle is tiny but cute.  </li>
            <li>A tiny dab under each ear is plenty for the day, and it just gets warmer and more majestic as it progresses and projects with your body heat.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute though, reminds me of the ones I bought in Egypt, but this is smaller.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very high quality for aroma diffuser</li>
            <li>it only takes a light smear of the oil against your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really did, but there is an underlying acrid smell to the amber oil.</li>
            <li>A week or 2 later, the smell has changed/decayed significantly.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think the other brand I had been buying is better.</li>
            <li>It ruins the lovely amber smell.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, but the scent does not last add long as others that I have owned.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the amber oil brought back to me from Egypt.</li>
            <li>the directions for opening it was in clear sight when i opened the box.</li>
            <li>It started when I was like, 12 years old and wandering around the hippy witchy store in town</li>
            <li>I have purchased this twice, it smells so good and lasts a very long time for such a small amount.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too heavy and lasts a pretty decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>in my opinion the delicate hand blown bottle alone makes this worth the under $12 i payed that included normal shipping.</li>
            <li>guess I should share my secret :).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm, sunny/golden, a little piney, only very slightly spicy-sweet, with an almost-tobacco-leaf note.  </li>
            <li>Thick and rich.</li>
            <li>This only needs a little dab and is very easy to go overboard with.</li>
            <li>Very delicate little bottle and the perfume smells nice.</li>

            <li> A drop of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The oil smells strange, and no longer smells like Amber.</li>
            <li> I will be trying other scents in the future.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited I typed this crazy sounding review.</li>
            <li> The smell is alluring and it only take a small dab of it on your pulse points.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, somewhate delicate, but pretty.</li>
            <li> , nearly 15 years later has been disappointing to me, having the same, I don&#x27;t know, waxy smell when the oils absorb.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t complain too much about the scent which I am not impressed with.</li>
            <li> It smells like that sour acidic odor that you get when a lot of Indian spices and herbs are stored all together.</li>
            <li> What it comes down to is that this Amber smells like my grandmother.</li>
            <li> Initially I was underwhelmed with the bottle because it is -very- small.</li>
            <li> it smells like the one i had but stronger and lasts longer on the skin while useing less.</li>
            <li> One may think that since the bottle is so fancy, the oil must be less than fancy.</li>
            <li> If you love spicy heavy amber but hate the waxy smell others leave behind, this is it!</li>
            <li> But I find this hard to smell, let alone wear.</li>
            <li> little dap behind your ears and on you neckline.....</li>
            <li> If you have ever shopped in an Indian goods store you might know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> possession of ambegrist is illegal in the U.S. since 1972 .</li>
            <li> if you think you may like the smell of this you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> ambergrist comes from whales (vomit) and is very expensive because its from endangered  sperm whales.</li>
            <li> The base wax or oil or something, I don&#x27;t know.</li>

            <li> The smell is alluring and it only take a small dab of it on your pulse points.&lt;br /&gt;For me it generally last 4 to 6 hours.  It has a long lingering effect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good to put on your jackets or a little on your hair for impressing the public.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone ask me where I get this from.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should share my secret :).</li>
            <li> I just got my bottle of amber perfume oil and I must say I was pleasantly pleased by the quality of the oil and the fancy decanter.  It&#x27;s very tiny, but that&#x27;s what makes it so appealing.  It&#x27;s rich in color and the scent will stay with you all day.  it only takes a light smear of the oil against your skin.  I will be trying other scents in the future.  I highly recommend it for those who like a more exotic perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I cannot say more. I am loving the smell. A drop of this stuff goes a long way. I place a drop on each wrist and I enjoy. I cannot wait to wear to the office and see if anyone asks me what I am wearing. I make a lot of my own skin care products for my family members and I can not wait to add a couple drops of this into my suger scrubs or bath oils...yum! I will be buying lots more for gifts.</li>
            <li> If for no other reason, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase for the bottle alone. It&#x27;s very small, somewhate delicate, but pretty. The scent isn&#x27;t too heavy and lasts a pretty decent amount of time. I still noticed it after 6 hours. Caution: use only a minor amount.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, she say&#x27;s: &amp;#34;The bottle is beautiful, I wanted to like it. I really did, but there is an underlying acrid smell to the amber oil. It smells like that sour acidic odor that you get when a lot of Indian spices and herbs are stored all together. If you have ever shopped in an Indian goods store you might know what I mean. It&#x27;s the acrid smell that overpowers your sinuses and almost has a burning sensation, it&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt; It ruins the lovely amber smell. It smells like they stored it too long next to over powering acidic Indian herbs or something. If you are used to the sweet musky smell of quality amber oil you wont like this brand. I&#x27;m sorry to say that I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Will keep the bottle for something else though.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very delicate little bottle and the perfume smells nice. Very pleased with this purchase and I feel sexy when applying this. Would recommend for those special times.</li>
            <li> This only needs a little dab and is very easy to go overboard with. Initially I was underwhelmed with the bottle because it is -very- small. But I&#x27;ve had it for a bit now and it&#x27;s lasted nicely! Great product, not fake smelling. Thick and rich.</li>
            <li> This is the amber oil I have been searching for. It smells exactly like the amber oil brought back to me from Egypt. Lovely warm amber scent in a delicate, decorative bottle.</li>
            <li> I have bought a LOT, as in, every amber scented thing I could get my hands on. It started when I was like, 12 years old and wandering around the hippy witchy store in town and I found Auric Blend&#x27;s Royal Amber perfume solid. It was literally the most divine thing I had ever smelled. I bought a constant supply of it- until! Some years later, they changed something in it. The base wax or oil or something, I don&#x27;t know. Every amber scented thing I have bought subsequently, nearly 15 years later has been disappointing to me, having the same, I don&#x27;t know, waxy smell when the oils absorb. Not spicy enough from the get go and then they fade to a smell I can&#x27;t stand or describe. I recently bought every amber scented thing I could find on amazon to add to my already massive collection. This liquid amber was the last thing to arrive. The night before it came, while I was laying in bed, I literally thought to myself, &amp;#34;I wonder if I will ever find a perfume I loved as much as that first amber. Maybe my sense of smell has changed, and I&#x27;ll never find it. I don&#x27;t even know what it smells like anymore.&amp;#34; AND THEN! This came! I am so excited I typed this crazy sounding review. It&#x27;s almost exactly the right smell. yeah, the glass bottle is super pretty and whoa yeah, you only need a teeny tiny amount at a time. Also, I think this is an extremely cheap price for an attractively packaged decanter of the best perfume I&#x27;ve smelled in over 10 years! If you love spicy heavy amber but hate the waxy smell others leave behind, this is it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve wanted! Just a nice, spicy amber - no other scents, no sandalwood, no vanilla added to make it smell more amber-like. Just good quality amber oil in this delicate and beautiful glass bottle.</li>
            <li> the bottle is adorable, but fragile. the fragrance is very high quality for aroma diffuser</li>
            <li> Fantastic product... very warm and dark amber... much like a patcholi but sweeter.  The bottle is tiny but cute.  I will be buying another soon to mix my own blend in a screw top glass bottle for my purse.</li>
            <li> love love love love love! I get so many compliments on this scent. Such a gender-neutral aroma that men and women cant help but comment on it. It&#x27;s truly special.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed my little exotic bottle ,the fragrance is lovely, i purchased this with amber essence and Krishna Musk from Tom&#x27;s incense and I must say I am very happy with everything !</li>
            <li> some people may be wondering if this is made with ambergrist. it is not. ambergrist comes from whales (vomit) and is very expensive because its from endangered  sperm whales. possession of ambegrist is illegal in the U.S. since 1972 . not to worry tho! this product is very  similar  in fragrance  and is oil from a tree . I chose to buy this product because i liked a  lower quality oil i had that i had bought at a fair but wanted better.WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. it smells like the one i had but stronger and lasts longer on the skin while useing less. some of the perfumes i like are Chanel #5 Red Door, and ciara. i like warm sweet musky and woodsy smells. this oil comes in a beautiful bottle and looks nice on my dresser. the directions for opening it was in clear sight when i opened the box. if you dont see that, it instructs you to run the neck of bottle under warm water to soften the wax seal. (i wouldnt want ya to break your beautiful bottle!) if you think you may like the smell of this you cant go wrong. in my opinion the delicate hand blown bottle alone makes this worth the under $12 i payed that included normal shipping. i ordered this on the 11th and got it on the 13th. WOW! :)&lt;br /&gt;i hope iv made it easy to take that leap of faith and try something new! thank you amazon</li>
            <li> Bottle and packaging is beautiful, but not the sent I was looking forward too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best golden amber oils I&#x27;ve tried.  I enjoy most categories of ambers: sweet, smoky, vanillic, woody, resinous, etc...  but in the \\&quot;golden\\&quot; range, this is a favorite.  It&#x27;s warm, sunny/golden, a little piney, only very slightly spicy-sweet, with an almost-tobacco-leaf note.  No stinky Playdoh.  Unisex.  My last bottle lasted years.  A tiny dab under each ear is plenty for the day, and it just gets warmer and more majestic as it progresses and projects with your body heat.</li>
            <li> What it comes down to is that this Amber smells like my grandmother. I think it might just be that I prefer a more vanilla supported Amber. But I find this hard to smell, let alone wear. The seller is fantastic though, and the bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been searching for this product for years!!!! It is truly unisex and I made sure we each had our own bottle! This is the perfect scent for people allergic to florals! Smooth, sexy, and mysterious!</li>
            <li> Very warm exotic scent. Love it! Reminds me of belly dancing. I use more than a drop because I really really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was thrilled to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice and worth the price so can&#x27;t complain too much about the scent which I am not impressed with.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle, it smelled fine, although not as rich as my old bottle of Amber perfume. A week or 2 later, the smell has changed/decayed significantly. The oil smells strange, and no longer smells like Amber.</li>
            <li> One may think that since the bottle is so fancy, the oil must be less than fancy. WRONG--Both the bottle and amber oil is a worthy purchase and a value beyond the price. Song of India makes very good scented oils and Amazon sells it at bargain prices.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, but the scent does not last add long as others that I have owned. For the price, I think the other brand I had been buying is better. The bottle is cute though, reminds me of the ones I bought in Egypt, but this is smaller.</li>
            <li> very nice quality amber</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful scent, nice and earthy for man or woman</li>
            <li> Arrive promptly...&lt;br /&gt;A little dap behind your ears and on you neckline.....anyone hugs you,always will state....Ohhhh,you smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous perfume!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice, it smells so good and lasts a very long time for such a small amount. The glass bottle is so beautiful too.</li>
