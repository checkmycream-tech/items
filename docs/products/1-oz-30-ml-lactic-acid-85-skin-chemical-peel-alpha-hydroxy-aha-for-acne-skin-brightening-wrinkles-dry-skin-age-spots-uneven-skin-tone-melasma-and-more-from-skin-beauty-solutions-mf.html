            <li>This has been excellent to use and skin texture, firmness, and wrinkles are very much improved.  </li>
            <li>but, this lactic acid 85% love it!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Also please make sure u dont put it on a pimple!</li>
            <li>Great peel easy to use at home :: I&#x27;m working on perfecting my complexion and this is helping me do the trick :</li>
            <li>This peel does an AMAZING job of dealing with the breakouts and the hyperpigmentation that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I read great reviews of others whom have recieves fantastic results, so</li>
            <li>Neither did Salicylic Acid at 20% but liked that for my face and forearms along with Glycolic Acid.</li>
            <li>SO NICE</li>
            <li>In time I learned how to effectively use this.</li>
            <li>It honestly feels like nothing.</li>
            <li>Nice to have between dermatologist office chemical peels and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I was kind of concerned about using an at home peel</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Aloe vera is great for any kind of burns, but chilled aloe vera is like dipping your face in a cool Rocky Mountain</li>
            <li>This peel is working great for me, and uncovers beautiful baby-soft unblemished skin.</li>
            <li>Strong stuff and works good on fading sun spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong so</li>
            <li>I thought it would be very strong</li>
            <li>My skin has remained smooth, even and bright ever since and it&#x27;s been almost over two months.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective and economical treatment.,</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t see them as blackheads from the peel, it almost looked like they disappeared, but upon squeezing the top of my nose, all the gunk came out very easily</li>
            <li>It is working good, and proce is right!</li>
            <li>It has improved my skin tone and it has made my post acne hyperpigmentation fade away, and it also helped remove fine lines!</li>
            <li>Ok pun&#x27;s set aside.</li>
            <li>it makes it more distinquished</li>
            <li>: I love this peel</li>
            <li>and I can stand it for five minutes,,probably more</li>
            <li>Works better than the pricey AHA lotions at the drug store.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is much more even.</li>
            <li>I LOVE PLAYING ESTHETICIAN</li>
            <li>but this is more of a peel for skin discoloration and oil anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>my skin looks healthier; I never thought I would be able to see my face without scars.</li>
            <li>...go to [...] where you can find an organic non-gmo lactic acid for a better price...</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize that more.  </li>
            <li>Am I in love with this product?</li>
            <li>This product DOES work and will burn the skin BUT make sure you are using it as instructed.</li>
            <li>After using this product the scars on my face became more noticeable .</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed was the day after I used it, I was able to extract all the blackheads on my nose with ease.  </li>
            <li>makes this a peel I will definately continue to use, and it&#x27;s at a great price with fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it works.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking to lighten my skin tone (i love my color</li>
            <li>Better go for TCA because TCA peel</li>
            <li>Second, I think this is probably the best peel around.</li>
            <li>The top was still sealed, but the instructions were ruined.  </li>
            <li>I use this peel for many purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking into purchasing more products from the company.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter &amp; it does seem to give me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I used it and love it.</li>
            <li>much better than others that used</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and it looks much more \\&quot;even\\&quot;</li>
            <li>so the added bonus of lightening old scars to reveal my skin tone is great.</li>
            <li>Great product - does what it says - I&#x27;ve used cautiously so far</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a good product.</li>
            <li>I have used this prodcut alot over the years its mild and easy shipped fast great buy and worth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Too strong for my skin</li>
            <li>This is a strong acid.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 times, my aging spot is a bit faded.</li>
            <li>This one was just too strong for me.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong, it can be used once a week for those who roll like that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>acid is too strong to recommend it to anyone to use on their face.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for over the counter -- get a nice peel and noticed malasma and acne scars are reduced.  </li>
            <li>but another was fine...</li>
            <li>but another was fine...</li>
            <li>Reduces pore size and smooths out fine lines around eyes.</li>
            <li>Lactic acids brighten and tone the skin and the benefits of glycolic for fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>This is strong so tread lightly.</li>
            <li>, I smooth vitamin e on my face.  </li>
            <li>Important to always wear screen protection from the sun when using this product.</li>
            <li>white face lol..</li>
            <li>but so far so good..  </li>
            <li>use this every now and then and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li>This one is the natural fruit stuff, so I feel good about that.</li>
            <li>So I was able to do this peel right before a date.</li>
            <li>Have tried other products from this company with very good results</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t very large, but I sure saw them.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and very easy to use for beginners as well as</li>
            <li>Second, you should use some kind of oil around your eyes and on your lips - coconut oil, vitamin eye oil, glycerine - anything!  </li>
            <li>, it took me about a month to see results, but I can definitely see the difference (wishing I had found this many years and many dollars ago!).</li>
            <li>It was so worth it!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and now have little brown/red hyperpigmentation marks all over.  </li>
            <li>will know more certainly in the weeks to come..</li>
            <li>This product has done a great job of smoothing out the rough skin and evening out complection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not too sure it does much for wrinkles</li>
            <li>But wow is it effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you should do 10 ten applications to see good results...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use once a week or so too see what more this can really do...</li>
            <li>Many Thanks..</li>
            <li>I used this 85% Lactic Acid for the first time and can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised!!!  </li>
            <li>it was strong and very intense</li>
            <li>very mild, this is my first peel ever</li>
            <li>I do know, that its pretty strong</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;m in my early 30s and am now noticing fine lines and wrinkles as well as some sun spots (I love in S. Florida and the sun has done a number on me)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been senstive to many soaps and dial soap in the 70&#x27;s adverstised safe enough for baby skin would burn my face and give me rash.</li>
            <li>I have scars on my back from acne that came and went many many years ago and have tried everything (bleaching creams, acne creams, ambi, soaps that claim to do &amp;#34;wonderous</li>
            <li>I WAS LUCKY TO REACH THIS PRODUCT IN AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I has also helped a bit with my mild acne.</li>
            <li>Lucky me, I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>Now a days, I just get dryness and some mild flakiness.</li>
            <li>It has taken 10 years off my face, clears acne overnight and smoothed my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly..</li>
            <li>First, I think this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty nervous because my acne areas stayed BRIGHT RED for hours after.  </li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s your first time, it&#x27;s probably best to wait at least 4 days before going out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will not have results after one time and if it is first time for you to use chemical peel products, you need to follow the direction!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I burnt the hell out of my face!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try this higher strength product.  </li>
            <li>I put pure coconut oil on my face to calm my skin (that is another fabulous skin product by the way).  </li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;Helps calm my oily skin from breaking out, even though I am 35 and it reduces the color of acne scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was all worth it though.</li>
            <li>After that&#x27;s absorbed, if I have any &#x27;sunburn sensation&#x27;, I apply chilled aloe vera gel from the refrigerated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Been using it for awhile now and right from the beginning</li>
            <li>it already burned my skin and started peeling right away.  </li>
            <li>The product was just right</li>
            <li>It can be used right before going out although I will use it overnight</li>
            <li>i Kept lactic acid acid on whole face for 10 min all pimples are bleeding top layer of the pimple is removed, quite strong, next time going for 20 min ...but</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t tolerate more than this, pimples top layer skin removed bleeding, neutralized with  baking soda, dont worry this is not powerful like TCA acid.</li>
            <li>I can laugh now but at the time it wasn&#x27;t funny.</li>
            <li>Read other reviews first and good luck.</li>
            <li>I certainly like that it hasn&#x27;t burned my skin!</li>
            <li>This peel did not make my face peel, I can do it on a Sunday night (since you want to avoid sun exposure for 24 hours as much as possible after a peel) and go to work on Monday with great, glowing skin and smaller pores!</li>
            <li>I am a 47 year old, fair, caucasian female.</li>
            <li>I had to run water as a reminder that  could rinse it off soon just to get through a few minutes,but once rinsed off the burning goes away for the most part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, make sure to either rinse off in the shower first or wipe off the area you are about to apply this on with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I wll recoment to all my friends very much.</li>
            <li>I used tons of sunscreen folks and ignored the ribbing...from folks who should know better with several collegues having skin cancer.)Anyway</li>
            <li>This works pretty well,  </li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I use the Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl from this same company and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>this is your first peel, START OUT WITH A LOWER CONCENTRATION.  </li>
            <li>First your forehead, then was.  </li>
            <li>2 minutes at the most and do not apply it to open pores or pimples</li>
            <li>The first day I used my husband noticed the change in my skin.</li>
            <li>first time no longer than a minute.</li>
            <li>I have used this peel 3 times already, twice in the first week and once this week.  </li>
            <li>It is doing exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>My face is so much lighter after I use this !</li>
            <li>The directions tell you that if it&#x27;s your first time using not to leave it on longer</li>
            <li>The price is right and the product is very high quality.</li>
            <li>I think if I used it more regularly I would really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would recommend product for similar but it is pretty strong so caution is needed.</li>
            <li>The next morning I instantly noticed a glow, my pores looked smaller and my skin looked healthy, vibrant, bright and glowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t leave it on too long and be sure you have a way to exfoliate the layer this brings up.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re very careful in the application, it&#x27;s very, very easy to get some in your eyes/mouth when washing it off.  </li>
            <li>I am not entirely sure it is effective, but it not be the right product for the situation I am using it for.</li>
            <li>about 6-8 hours later the red started to subside and a bright, clear complexion emerged!  </li>
            <li>So, for those of you who have a fair, freckled, complexion, with a little sun damage and who are sometimes sensitive to products, this peel may just work for you.</li>
            <li>Have a ways to go but even if it didn&#x27;t go any further still a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>This is a light peel where you skin will flake off gently with subsequent washes afterward.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>but it helped my acne a whole bunch.</li>
            <li>, I would still use it til I finished the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Just be careful and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>This product works; it&#x27;s gentle and it improves your skin apperance over time.</li>
            <li>The very 1st night I used I c</li>
            <li>whatever you do make sure you read the manual carefully.</li>
            <li>Its important not to agitate the skin prior to applying this acid!</li>
            <li>I really began to see change after about 3 applications.</li>
            <li>You really need to be using this awhile before seeing results.</li>
            <li>It does sting a bit but rinsing your face with water and baking soda really help with that.</li>
            <li>It works really well so</li>
            <li>Really have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li>It works really well, but KNOW YOUR TOLERANCE.</li>
            <li>This gets your face ready for the peel.  </li>
            <li>It was so much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I get this product really fast</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li>I actually use this by putting a few drops of the lactic acid with my body lotion and it gives me nice, smooth skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>This is great for broken capillairies around the nostrils or on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even wash it off because it was absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>Really like this lactic acid peel and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed out.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Be sure &amp; read &amp; follow the instructions carefully &amp; have the baking soda &amp; water solution ready because it really does help neutralize the effects once it&#x27;s time to rinse.</li>
            <li>So far I have done 20+ peels with a variety of acids and strengths and have gotten sensational results all for probably less than the price of just one treatment by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I brought this product because so many other people were saying how it worked for them.</li>
            <li>but im going to start using it more often because other reviews say it helps with scars and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>As I wrote above, my pores have significantly diminished and my skin feels so like satin.</li>
            <li>The first thing I do is a deep face peel using the salicylic 30% , once I have peeled I use this peel for the more sensative areas such as crows feet, frown lines between my eyes and around my mouth and nose area.</li>
            <li>You want your skin as clean as possible so the stuff can work</li>
            <li>No more nice tingle....</li>
            <li>Make sure you read up on it and watch videos on it, not difficult but can cause burns if left on for too long.</li>
            <li>First off,they always arrive early and NEVER had any issues with them.</li>
            <li>Give yourself time to work up to the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li>it did make my face a bright pink as stated in other reviews, but I was so nervous over the whole baking soda to neutralize or the skin will be eaten off your face</li>
            <li>The peeling takes a couple of days to occur and the hours after application your skin remains red and somewhat swollen, but the results that emerge a couple of days later are absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li>i left it on my face for 5 minutes as directed, then rinse and washed with mild soap for a minute.  </li>
            <li>It is okay because it does not remove deep acne scar, but makes your face glow after using it for like a day and your face goes back to it normal</li>
            <li>highly recommend this and the lower concentration.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light vinegar scent, so I would not be surprised if it is just a watered down vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I especially concentrated on the knees and elbows and now they are baby smooth with no rough patches and have gotten lighter too!</li>
            <li>This product is suppose to take the top layer of your dead skin off, yet this product made my skin rise with acne.</li>
            <li>which normally isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>I have a normal complexion.  </li>
            <li>It is uncomfortable while on your skin so have a hairdryer with a cool setting handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick in consistency, like syrup, instead of the watery TCA type peels I am used to.</li>
            <li>After looking a little flaky for a few day, new, beautiful skin emerged.</li>
            <li>The first time I put this on I felt a slight tingling, but nothing super harsh.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Oh and it made new pigmentation spots from the burns instead of reducing the ones I already had.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I highly doubt this lactic acid is even anywhere near 10%.</li>
            <li>I have used this product intermittently over the last two years and it never fails to disappoint.</li>
            <li>Worked well but did burn the skin near my eyes!  </li>
            <li>I initially thought 85% was going to be to much but for me it wasn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>It would usually take more pressure to extract.  </li>
            <li>At first, I only put it on for maybe two minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have used lactic peels before, but this could present a problem to first time users.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>really helps with pores...will continue but need to moniter sensitive areas on face as it will burn you if not careful</li>
            <li>Works but strong, so be careful and have your baking soda and water already mixed to stop the sizzle.</li>
            <li>Especially the two large spots on one calf.  </li>
            <li>second and third times were a whole nother story!!</li>
            <li>it didnt clear scars and things</li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t really see my face was peeling, but definitely helps my acne away.</li>
            <li>And makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with the results that I got from this product.</li>
            <li>too early to tell definitively...</li>
            <li>and I would not recommended for anyone with sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>I have been using it in combination of mederma at night to accelerate the healing process of my old</li>
            <li>The process takes multiple rounds, and days/weeks to really show through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also ferociously burns all the soft skin around your nose and neck area.</li>
            <li>and by far, this is it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot from this Lactic Acid partly because of the reviews I saw at the time, and partly because it was marked as 85%.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s left my skin in much condition and appearance</li>
            <li>I would pass on this product and go for a name brand or professional peel.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, during the winter I get very dry skin around my nose and mouth and am affraid to use it right now.</li>
            <li>I first tried Glycolic peels for my face with great results getting rid of not only sun spotting age like spots but some raised and crusty material associated with one bad mark.</li>
            <li>This product really gives you instant results after the first use, however it is extremely drying to my skin even if I put on a moisturizer directly after use.</li>
            <li>but my main objective was and is the two stubborn sun damage on my leg.....</li>
            <li>For deep scars and high sun burn , your skin has to peel like sheets to cure it.</li>
            <li>this will not help deep scars and high sun burn , results also temporary.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply with a small brush like an applicator brush or flat makeup brush to distribute evenly and not get all over hands and fingers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I appreciate all the helpful reviews that others submitted that led me to this and similar product.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied too long, especially above my lip and it burned even after washing it off.</li>
            <li>When I first started using peels, I would get extreme peeling and flaking and it would look like my skin was cracked and burned.</li>
            <li>When I applied it I felt slight tingly, burning sensations which is normal however it should not be too intense or unbearable.</li>
            <li>It made my skin very red and took days to peel off  and th redness took days to disappear completely.</li>
            <li>I have struggle with Acne in my adult life after using an IUD; I used all types of treatments that my dermatologyst recommended, after I finally switched birth control</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying my 2nd bottle and possibly one for my mother as well (for wrinkles, to reveal new skin).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read others have had less than stellar experiences</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American, have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The pores on my nose are so small, so tiny that I&#x27;m sure that other people can&#x27;t see them.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how my little patches of acne started to get really red</li>
            <li>I would caution against using this product if your skin is extremely sensitive or dry.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my back for old acne scars and it wound up clearing up new little blemishes as well.</li>
            <li>I use this on my skin, mainly for the the dark spots, around my nose because of my glasses.</li>
            <li>i applied it on my whole face, i feel  little stinging.</li>
            <li>Good product bad bottle</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also please make sure u dont put it on a pimple!</li>
            <li> Great peel easy to use at home :: I&#x27;m working on perfecting my complexion and this is helping me do the trick :</li>
            <li> This peel does an AMAZING job of dealing with the breakouts and the hyperpigmentation that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews of others whom have recieves fantastic results, so</li>
            <li> Neither did Salicylic Acid at 20% but liked that for my face and forearms along with Glycolic Acid.</li>
            <li> SO NICE</li>
            <li> In time I learned how to effectively use this.</li>
            <li> It honestly feels like nothing.</li>
            <li> Nice to have between dermatologist office chemical peels and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was kind of concerned about using an at home peel</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Aloe vera is great for any kind of burns, but chilled aloe vera is like dipping your face in a cool Rocky Mountain</li>
            <li> This peel is working great for me, and uncovers beautiful baby-soft unblemished skin.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff and works good on fading sun spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong so</li>
            <li> I thought it would be very strong</li>
            <li> My skin has remained smooth, even and bright ever since and it&#x27;s been almost over two months.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective and economical treatment.,</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t see them as blackheads from the peel, it almost looked like they disappeared, but upon squeezing the top of my nose, all the gunk came out very easily</li>
            <li> It is working good, and proce is right!</li>
            <li> It has improved my skin tone and it has made my post acne hyperpigmentation fade away, and it also helped remove fine lines!</li>
            <li> Ok pun&#x27;s set aside.</li>
            <li> it makes it more distinquished</li>
            <li> : I love this peel</li>
            <li> and I can stand it for five minutes,,probably more</li>

            <li> My skin tone is much more even.</li>
            <li> I LOVE PLAYING ESTHETICIAN</li>
            <li> but this is more of a peel for skin discoloration and oil anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my skin looks healthier; I never thought I would be able to see my face without scars.</li>
            <li> ...go to [...] where you can find an organic non-gmo lactic acid for a better price...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize that more.  </li>
            <li> Am I in love with this product?</li>
            <li> This product DOES work and will burn the skin BUT make sure you are using it as instructed.</li>
            <li> After using this product the scars on my face became more noticeable .</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed was the day after I used it, I was able to extract all the blackheads on my nose with ease.  </li>
            <li> makes this a peel I will definately continue to use, and it&#x27;s at a great price with fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking to lighten my skin tone (i love my color</li>
            <li> Better go for TCA because TCA peel</li>
            <li> Second, I think this is probably the best peel around.</li>
            <li> The top was still sealed, but the instructions were ruined.  </li>
            <li> I use this peel for many purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into purchasing more products from the company.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter &amp; it does seem to give me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I used it and love it.</li>
            <li> much better than others that used</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and it looks much more \\&quot;even\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so the added bonus of lightening old scars to reveal my skin tone is great.</li>
            <li> Great product - does what it says - I&#x27;ve used cautiously so far</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a good product.</li>
            <li> I have used this prodcut alot over the years its mild and easy shipped fast great buy and worth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin</li>
            <li> This is a strong acid.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 times, my aging spot is a bit faded.</li>
            <li> This one was just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong, it can be used once a week for those who roll like that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> acid is too strong to recommend it to anyone to use on their face.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for over the counter -- get a nice peel and noticed malasma and acne scars are reduced.  </li>
            <li> but another was fine...</li>
            <li> but another was fine...</li>
            <li> Reduces pore size and smooths out fine lines around eyes.</li>
            <li> Lactic acids brighten and tone the skin and the benefits of glycolic for fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> This is strong so tread lightly.</li>
            <li> , I smooth vitamin e on my face.  </li>
            <li> Important to always wear screen protection from the sun when using this product.</li>
            <li> white face lol..</li>
            <li> but so far so good..  </li>
            <li> use this every now and then and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li> This one is the natural fruit stuff, so I feel good about that.</li>
            <li> So I was able to do this peel right before a date.</li>
            <li> Have tried other products from this company with very good results</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very large, but I sure saw them.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and very easy to use for beginners as well as</li>
            <li> Second, you should use some kind of oil around your eyes and on your lips - coconut oil, vitamin eye oil, glycerine - anything!  </li>
            <li> , it took me about a month to see results, but I can definitely see the difference (wishing I had found this many years and many dollars ago!).</li>
            <li> It was so worth it!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and now have little brown/red hyperpigmentation marks all over.  </li>
            <li> will know more certainly in the weeks to come..</li>
            <li> This product has done a great job of smoothing out the rough skin and evening out complection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not too sure it does much for wrinkles</li>
            <li> But wow is it effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you should do 10 ten applications to see good results...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use once a week or so too see what more this can really do...</li>
            <li> Many Thanks..</li>
            <li> I used this 85% Lactic Acid for the first time and can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised!!!  </li>
            <li> it was strong and very intense</li>
            <li> very mild, this is my first peel ever</li>
            <li> I do know, that its pretty strong</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m in my early 30s and am now noticing fine lines and wrinkles as well as some sun spots (I love in S. Florida and the sun has done a number on me)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been senstive to many soaps and dial soap in the 70&#x27;s adverstised safe enough for baby skin would burn my face and give me rash.</li>
            <li> I have scars on my back from acne that came and went many many years ago and have tried everything (bleaching creams, acne creams, ambi, soaps that claim to do &amp;#34;wonderous</li>
            <li> I WAS LUCKY TO REACH THIS PRODUCT IN AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I has also helped a bit with my mild acne.</li>
            <li> Lucky me, I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> Now a days, I just get dryness and some mild flakiness.</li>
            <li> It has taken 10 years off my face, clears acne overnight and smoothed my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly..</li>
            <li> First, I think this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous because my acne areas stayed BRIGHT RED for hours after.  </li>
            <li> But if it&#x27;s your first time, it&#x27;s probably best to wait at least 4 days before going out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not have results after one time and if it is first time for you to use chemical peel products, you need to follow the direction!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I burnt the hell out of my face!</li>
            <li> I am excited to try this higher strength product.  </li>
            <li> I put pure coconut oil on my face to calm my skin (that is another fabulous skin product by the way).  </li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;Helps calm my oily skin from breaking out, even though I am 35 and it reduces the color of acne scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was all worth it though.</li>
            <li> After that&#x27;s absorbed, if I have any &#x27;sunburn sensation&#x27;, I apply chilled aloe vera gel from the refrigerated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Been using it for awhile now and right from the beginning</li>
            <li> it already burned my skin and started peeling right away.  </li>
            <li> The product was just right</li>
            <li> It can be used right before going out although I will use it overnight</li>
            <li> i Kept lactic acid acid on whole face for 10 min all pimples are bleeding top layer of the pimple is removed, quite strong, next time going for 20 min ...but</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t tolerate more than this, pimples top layer skin removed bleeding, neutralized with  baking soda, dont worry this is not powerful like TCA acid.</li>
            <li> I can laugh now but at the time it wasn&#x27;t funny.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews first and good luck.</li>
            <li> I certainly like that it hasn&#x27;t burned my skin!</li>
            <li> This peel did not make my face peel, I can do it on a Sunday night (since you want to avoid sun exposure for 24 hours as much as possible after a peel) and go to work on Monday with great, glowing skin and smaller pores!</li>
            <li> I am a 47 year old, fair, caucasian female.</li>
            <li> I had to run water as a reminder that  could rinse it off soon just to get through a few minutes,but once rinsed off the burning goes away for the most part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, make sure to either rinse off in the shower first or wipe off the area you are about to apply this on with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I wll recoment to all my friends very much.</li>
            <li> I used tons of sunscreen folks and ignored the ribbing...from folks who should know better with several collegues having skin cancer.)Anyway</li>
            <li> This works pretty well,  </li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I use the Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl from this same company and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> this is your first peel, START OUT WITH A LOWER CONCENTRATION.  </li>
            <li> First your forehead, then was.  </li>
            <li> 2 minutes at the most and do not apply it to open pores or pimples</li>
            <li> The first day I used my husband noticed the change in my skin.</li>
            <li> first time no longer than a minute.</li>
            <li> I have used this peel 3 times already, twice in the first week and once this week.  </li>
            <li> It is doing exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> My face is so much lighter after I use this !</li>
            <li> The directions tell you that if it&#x27;s your first time using not to leave it on longer</li>
            <li> The price is right and the product is very high quality.</li>
            <li> I think if I used it more regularly I would really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend product for similar but it is pretty strong so caution is needed.</li>
            <li> The next morning I instantly noticed a glow, my pores looked smaller and my skin looked healthy, vibrant, bright and glowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave it on too long and be sure you have a way to exfoliate the layer this brings up.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re very careful in the application, it&#x27;s very, very easy to get some in your eyes/mouth when washing it off.  </li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure it is effective, but it not be the right product for the situation I am using it for.</li>
            <li> about 6-8 hours later the red started to subside and a bright, clear complexion emerged!  </li>
            <li> So, for those of you who have a fair, freckled, complexion, with a little sun damage and who are sometimes sensitive to products, this peel may just work for you.</li>
            <li> Have a ways to go but even if it didn&#x27;t go any further still a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a light peel where you skin will flake off gently with subsequent washes afterward.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> but it helped my acne a whole bunch.</li>
            <li> , I would still use it til I finished the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> This product works; it&#x27;s gentle and it improves your skin apperance over time.</li>
            <li> The very 1st night I used I c</li>
            <li> whatever you do make sure you read the manual carefully.</li>
            <li> Its important not to agitate the skin prior to applying this acid!</li>
            <li> I really began to see change after about 3 applications.</li>
            <li> You really need to be using this awhile before seeing results.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit but rinsing your face with water and baking soda really help with that.</li>
            <li> It works really well so</li>
            <li> Really have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but KNOW YOUR TOLERANCE.</li>
            <li> This gets your face ready for the peel.  </li>
            <li> It was so much stronger.  </li>
            <li> I get this product really fast</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I actually use this by putting a few drops of the lactic acid with my body lotion and it gives me nice, smooth skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> This is great for broken capillairies around the nostrils or on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even wash it off because it was absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> Really like this lactic acid peel and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed out.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Be sure &amp; read &amp; follow the instructions carefully &amp; have the baking soda &amp; water solution ready because it really does help neutralize the effects once it&#x27;s time to rinse.</li>
            <li> So far I have done 20+ peels with a variety of acids and strengths and have gotten sensational results all for probably less than the price of just one treatment by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I brought this product because so many other people were saying how it worked for them.</li>
            <li> but im going to start using it more often because other reviews say it helps with scars and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> As I wrote above, my pores have significantly diminished and my skin feels so like satin.</li>
            <li> The first thing I do is a deep face peel using the salicylic 30% , once I have peeled I use this peel for the more sensative areas such as crows feet, frown lines between my eyes and around my mouth and nose area.</li>
            <li> You want your skin as clean as possible so the stuff can work</li>
            <li> No more nice tingle....</li>
            <li> Make sure you read up on it and watch videos on it, not difficult but can cause burns if left on for too long.</li>
            <li> First off,they always arrive early and NEVER had any issues with them.</li>
            <li> Give yourself time to work up to the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li> it did make my face a bright pink as stated in other reviews, but I was so nervous over the whole baking soda to neutralize or the skin will be eaten off your face</li>
            <li> The peeling takes a couple of days to occur and the hours after application your skin remains red and somewhat swollen, but the results that emerge a couple of days later are absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li> i left it on my face for 5 minutes as directed, then rinse and washed with mild soap for a minute.  </li>
            <li> It is okay because it does not remove deep acne scar, but makes your face glow after using it for like a day and your face goes back to it normal</li>
            <li> highly recommend this and the lower concentration.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light vinegar scent, so I would not be surprised if it is just a watered down vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I especially concentrated on the knees and elbows and now they are baby smooth with no rough patches and have gotten lighter too!</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to take the top layer of your dead skin off, yet this product made my skin rise with acne.</li>
            <li> which normally isn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> I have a normal complexion.  </li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable while on your skin so have a hairdryer with a cool setting handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of thick in consistency, like syrup, instead of the watery TCA type peels I am used to.</li>
            <li> After looking a little flaky for a few day, new, beautiful skin emerged.</li>
            <li> The first time I put this on I felt a slight tingling, but nothing super harsh.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Oh and it made new pigmentation spots from the burns instead of reducing the ones I already had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I highly doubt this lactic acid is even anywhere near 10%.</li>
            <li> I have used this product intermittently over the last two years and it never fails to disappoint.</li>
            <li> Worked well but did burn the skin near my eyes!  </li>
            <li> I initially thought 85% was going to be to much but for me it wasn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> It would usually take more pressure to extract.  </li>
            <li> At first, I only put it on for maybe two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have used lactic peels before, but this could present a problem to first time users.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> really helps with pores...will continue but need to moniter sensitive areas on face as it will burn you if not careful</li>
            <li> Works but strong, so be careful and have your baking soda and water already mixed to stop the sizzle.</li>
            <li> Especially the two large spots on one calf.  </li>
            <li> second and third times were a whole nother story!!</li>
            <li> it didnt clear scars and things</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t really see my face was peeling, but definitely helps my acne away.</li>
            <li> And makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the results that I got from this product.</li>
            <li> too early to tell definitively...</li>
            <li> and I would not recommended for anyone with sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> I have been using it in combination of mederma at night to accelerate the healing process of my old</li>
            <li> The process takes multiple rounds, and days/weeks to really show through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also ferociously burns all the soft skin around your nose and neck area.</li>
            <li> and by far, this is it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this Lactic Acid partly because of the reviews I saw at the time, and partly because it was marked as 85%.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s left my skin in much condition and appearance</li>
            <li> I would pass on this product and go for a name brand or professional peel.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, during the winter I get very dry skin around my nose and mouth and am affraid to use it right now.</li>
            <li> I first tried Glycolic peels for my face with great results getting rid of not only sun spotting age like spots but some raised and crusty material associated with one bad mark.</li>
            <li> This product really gives you instant results after the first use, however it is extremely drying to my skin even if I put on a moisturizer directly after use.</li>
            <li> but my main objective was and is the two stubborn sun damage on my leg.....</li>
            <li> For deep scars and high sun burn , your skin has to peel like sheets to cure it.</li>
            <li> this will not help deep scars and high sun burn , results also temporary.</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply with a small brush like an applicator brush or flat makeup brush to distribute evenly and not get all over hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I appreciate all the helpful reviews that others submitted that led me to this and similar product.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied too long, especially above my lip and it burned even after washing it off.</li>
            <li> When I first started using peels, I would get extreme peeling and flaking and it would look like my skin was cracked and burned.</li>
            <li> When I applied it I felt slight tingly, burning sensations which is normal however it should not be too intense or unbearable.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very red and took days to peel off  and th redness took days to disappear completely.</li>
            <li> I have struggle with Acne in my adult life after using an IUD; I used all types of treatments that my dermatologyst recommended, after I finally switched birth control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying my 2nd bottle and possibly one for my mother as well (for wrinkles, to reveal new skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read others have had less than stellar experiences</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The pores on my nose are so small, so tiny that I&#x27;m sure that other people can&#x27;t see them.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how my little patches of acne started to get really red</li>
            <li> I would caution against using this product if your skin is extremely sensitive or dry.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my back for old acne scars and it wound up clearing up new little blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin, mainly for the the dark spots, around my nose because of my glasses.</li>
            <li> i applied it on my whole face, i feel  little stinging.</li>
            <li> Good product bad bottle</li>
            <li> If your scars are very bad, you may need more than one bottle (depending on the size of the area you are applying it to), and you may need to do this whole thing for 1-3 months to really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> I see no change so far, not even a brighter complexion; I mean absolutely nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> even the seal was not broken it just jump back each time I try to close it tight , so not really save</li>
            <li> Left it on a lil too long then ended up looking like I had leprosy.</li>
            <li> it will burn your face if left on too long.</li>
            <li> 20 min - little difference on face but scars remain same, it makes your face to look young..</li>
            <li> I am peeling and dry especially around my chin and nose.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin with dry patches that are hard to get rid of, I have oily skin naturally and even my natural skin could not moisturizer those stubborn dry spots away after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started developing dark acne scars and was hoping this product would work, I am on my second cycle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burned with retinol and it&#x27;s taken weeks to heel my face so approaching carefully makes sense.</li>
            <li> My acne still is present, not much fading.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as directed and don&#x27;t leave on too long, just not seeing the results others have.</li>
            <li> The only thing it did was leave the creases along my nose red &amp; slightly burning for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I want promo send me to my e-mail with other products if possible.</li>
            <li> Now on my second application 10 min on face little burning sensation , but i dont think this will help the sun burn , deep scars .</li>
            <li> be very careful while applying, this should not be sold for public use</li>
            <li> Was good the 1st few times then I got burnt bad-</li>
            <li> Since I only peel every few weeks, this bottle will last for months.</li>
            <li> I had some dark, sun damaged areas on the left side of my face.</li>
            <li> so am careful on how long I leave the chemical peel on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not so much burning, but the itchy-tingly-burning thing, which is hard to take!</li>
            <li> I have been using peels for over a year and a half, and I started out with very low percentages and gradually worked my way up.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a step up from the 35% I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it correctly or maybe my skin was not use to something so harsh and sudden</li>
            <li> Be careful to follow the instructions to avoid damaging skin.</li>
            <li> and I follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Be careful and patient.  </li>
            <li> There are still a few around my nostril, but they get smaller and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> It was rough.</li>
            <li> But I will continue to use this now once/week for the next few weeks</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you buy this brand.</li>
            <li> I was careful not to get too close to my eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> Worse is when I have an active breakout and apply the solution the next day or two the base of the blemish will scar really badly, good news is it last for a couple of days before flaking off.</li>
            <li> It works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> my skin is tight, in pain, cracking, and dry.  </li>
            <li> I had been rebuffed by not one but 3 different dermatologists over the past 15 years when I wanted something done about sun damage to my face, arms and legs.</li>
            <li> because they are about 2-3 inches apart vertically from each other</li>
            <li> EXTREME FACE</li>
            <li> I have went to work with an extremely burnt face for about a month now and</li>
            <li> I am a long time sufferer of sun damage, uneven skin tone, and spots of hypopigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for years (and used other ones too)</li>
            <li> After standing around with a prickly, burning, itchy feeling all over my face for 20mins I expected to see some results by the 5th peel!</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to something about a year ago, and my face broke out badly due to this.</li>
            <li> I am also thinking of adding it to lotion and using on arms, neck and chest as other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> Skin was a little ashy for a few days following but this was outlined by insert, some oil-free moisturizer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, be VERY Careful.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe cracked dry skin and very, very dark scars from my eczema.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it does what it says in the ad,since I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I am a dark-skinned (black) man with dark skin patches in the beard area due to hyperpigmentation due to shaving/razor bumps over the years.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the price</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;d apply a thin layer of vaseline or aloe on lips, nose, eye area too as an added protection to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;d apply a thin layer of vaseline or aloe on lips, nose, eye area too as an added protection to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my acne decreased but the damage was done; lots of scars that would not go away; I literally had to wear layers and layers of make-up everyday even to the gym to feel somewhat normal.</li>
            <li> I think I may go down to using just once a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less age spots.  </li>
            <li> im black</li>
            <li> not real pleased did not do as promised</li>
            <li> If you can handle the skin slight irritation leave it on for 10 minute max.</li>
            <li> I must admit to being really afraid the first time I tried this peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just had my fourth peel of the season and sometimes they are not pleasant</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this yet, still a little scared ....</li>
            <li> I got a little in my eye, burned like Hades.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed serious dry patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for the past few months, the dark area has faded a lot.</li>
            <li> It is quite harsh.</li>
            <li> I also add a few drops to my lotion for all over my body once a week .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> So when the time was up, I rinsed using plain water and on the spots that still burned</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave it on too long or the issue will get worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> but I am waiting for the right time when I do not have to leave the house for at least two days because when i used it my skin peeled really bad but</li>
            <li> All you have to use is very little .</li>
            <li> that I just went back to the expensive store kits.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use one in the past but with this product I do.</li>

            <li> I received today and a small amount of product had leaked during shipment.  </li>
            <li> I used a cotton ball and applied a small amount in an even layer all over.</li>
            <li> It brightens the skin especially for someone like me who suffers from acne and use&#x27;s harsh products.</li>

            <li> and my skin is really thick and resilient.</li>

            <li> I love this peel!! It has improved my skin tone and it has made my post acne hyperpigmentation fade away, and it also helped remove fine lines! This peel did not make my face peel, I can do it on a Sunday night (since you want to avoid sun exposure for 24 hours as much as possible after a peel) and go to work on Monday with great, glowing skin and smaller pores!</li>
            <li> I used tca for my face 1 year a go it was strong and very intense but, this lactic acid 85% love it! Way to go. After my peel looks like I just went to a spa. Also I didn&#x27;t really see my face was peeling, but definitely helps my acne away.</li>
            <li> Ok pun&#x27;s set aside. I had been rebuffed by not one but 3 different dermatologists over the past 15 years when I wanted something done about sun damage to my face, arms and legs. Especially the two large spots on one calf.  One gave me an expensive laser treatment for veins around the mouth and nose area he said was also caused by sun damage. (I did field research work for about 20 years and that was up to 14 hours 24/7 from May thru October. I used tons of sunscreen folks and ignored the ribbing...from folks who should know better with several collegues having skin cancer.)Anyway I first tried Glycolic peels for my face with great results getting rid of not only sun spotting age like spots but some raised and crusty material associated with one bad mark. But didn&#x27;t touch the leg spots at all. Neither did Salicylic Acid at 20% but liked that for my face and forearms along with Glycolic Acid. So bought this Lactic Acid to apply to the stubborn leg spots and looks like it&#x27;ll take a couple of months but I&#x27;m seeing actual results. Haven&#x27;t used on my face or arms yet. I intend to give my arms a trial run while it&#x27;s still winter. And maybe just an over all peel or two on my face but my main objective was and is the two stubborn sun damage on my leg.....because they are about 2-3 inches apart vertically from each other it makes it more distinquished and they are about the size of a nickle each. So happy with the product. Have a ways to go but even if it didn&#x27;t go any further still a huge improvement. Would recommend product for similar but it is pretty strong so caution is needed. Do a skin test or two before proceeding with any acid peel type product. I&#x27;ve been burned with retinol and it&#x27;s taken weeks to heel my face so approaching carefully makes sense. Also all our skin types are different. I&#x27;ve been senstive to many soaps and dial soap in the 70&#x27;s adverstised safe enough for baby skin would burn my face and give me rash. To this day I do not use dial soap but my husband prefers it. Never understood why I couldn&#x27;t handle one thing but another was fine...seems these peels are the same for a variety of people. Some they don&#x27;t work as well either. I am leaving it on up to 10 minutes as the max that&#x27;s recommended by the company. I would back off that for my face however. And I&#x27;d apply a thin layer of vaseline or aloe on lips, nose, eye area too as an added protection to sensitive skin. Good luck to all who need these types of products may you have results at last.prefers it.

            <li> This works pretty well,  it did make my face a bright pink as stated in other reviews, but I was so nervous over the whole baking soda to neutralize or the skin will be eaten off your face that I just went back to the expensive store kits.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff and works good on fading sun spots.</li>
            <li> Product delivers just what it promises.  After looking a little flaky for a few day, new, beautiful skin emerged. Reduces pore size and smooths out fine lines around eyes. Dewy, rejuvenated skin.</li>
            <li> Great peel easy to use at home :: I&#x27;m working on perfecting my complexion and this is helping me do the trick :: I love this peel I use it on my face and neck</li>
            <li> I used this product only one time and it made my skin two shades lighter in two days!! My skin has remained smooth, even and bright ever since and it&#x27;s been almost over two months.I have been planning on doing another peel but I am waiting for the right time when I do not have to leave the house for at least two days because when i used it my skin peeled really bad but it cleared in the matter of three days. It was all worth it though.</li>
            <li> This product is a great price.  I&#x27;ve noticed less age spots.  And makes skin soft.  Smoothes out wrinkles.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I brought this product because so many other people were saying how it worked for them. I&#x27;ve recently started developing dark acne scars and was hoping this product would work, I am on my second cycle and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. My acne still is present, not much fading. Worse is when I have an active breakout and apply the solution the next day or two the base of the blemish will scar really badly, good news is it last for a couple of days before flaking off. I have used this product as directed and don&#x27;t leave on too long, just not seeing the results others have.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference after three applications...very mild, this is my first peel ever and I can stand it for five minutes,,probably more but I limit myself to five minutes.</li>
            <li> This product really gives you instant results after the first use, however it is extremely drying to my skin even if I put on a moisturizer directly after use. It leaves my skin with dry patches that are hard to get rid of, I have oily skin naturally and even my natural skin could not moisturizer those stubborn dry spots away after using this product. I bought this product to get rid of acne scarring and sun spots . After using the product twice I noticed my sun spots became darker and my face began to look like I had eczema. I tried using exfoliates to scrub away the dryness and that also didn&#x27;t work. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Made me break out. It might be good for others. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it correctly or maybe my skin was not use to something so harsh and sudden</li>
            <li> This peel is great!!! Without the spa prices ... Save time and money... I will purchase again... All you have to use is very little .</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly. It burned my skin day 2 my skin is tight, in pain, cracking, and dry.  A very dangerous product. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> i thought this was a peel for acne because thats what it worked for. it didnt clear scars and things but it helped my acne a whole bunch. i only use it like once a month though but im going to start using it more often because other reviews say it helps with scars and hyperpigmentation. and boy do i need help in those 2 areas. im black and i used a skin whitening cream and my skin is like 6 million different colors, i hope this helps. ill update in about a month.</li>
            <li> I just finished by bottle, and I&#x27;m ordering another today. I add 10ml to 4 oz of lotion and use it daily on my feet, legs and arms. Works better than the pricey AHA lotions at the drug store. It works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin</li>
            <li> It arrived quick.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using 4 times (once in a week) now.&lt;br /&gt;You will not have results after one time and if it is first time for you to use chemical peel products, you need to follow the direction! This is a strong acid.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 times, my aging spot is a bit faded. My skin tone is definitely brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with the results that I got from this product. My skin tone is much more even. Acne scars are lighter with every use. It works. Be careful to follow the instructions to avoid damaging skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this yet, still a little scared .... but as for everything else, I can&#x27;t complain. Packaged nicely, with what seems to be very good instructions.</li>
            <li> I use the Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl from this same company and I LOVE it. This one was just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; works!!! Dilution is a MUST, find what works for your skin!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product!</li>
            <li> This has greatly improved the appearance of sun spots on my legs. It did not sting or burn. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and although I&#x27;m in my late 20s I still deal with intermittent acne. This peel does an AMAZING job of dealing with the breakouts and the hyperpigmentation that comes with it. I have used this product intermittently over the last two years and it never fails to disappoint. The peeling takes a couple of days to occur and the hours after application your skin remains red and somewhat swollen, but the results that emerge a couple of days later are absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li> too early to tell definitively...but so far so good..  will know more certainly in the weeks to come..severalmore applications will determine final outcome.</li>
            <li> I LOVE PLAYING ESTHETICIAN AND I LIKE TO DO ALL TYPES OF PEELS. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PEELS THAT I DO AN A REGULAR BASIS.</li>
            <li> I do like this chemical peel but, it left my skin somewhat blotchy. I&#x27;m not giving up though, I would still use it til I finished the whole bottle. I do know, that its pretty strong and I would not recommended for anyone with sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> This is a good peel.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too strong, it can be used once a week for those who roll like that.&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing chemical peels for years so this is a weekly peel for me.&lt;br /&gt;Helps calm my oily skin from breaking out, even though I am 35 and it reduces the color of acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Not too sure it does much for wrinkles but this is more of a peel for skin discoloration and oil anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lactic and glycolic acids for a while and thought I&#x27;d take a break for about 5 months. What a mistake.. My rosacea came back with a vengeance, so I started alternating the lactic and glycolic acids again and in about a week I saw approx. 90% improvement. Lifesaver!</li>
            <li> not real pleased did not do as promised and I just do not like spending money on products that do not work as stated.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very red and took days to peel off  and th redness took days to disappear completely.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve read others have had less than stellar experiences but their skin must be made of leather. Just be careful and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> Generous amount for the price.  I am not entirely sure it is effective, but it not be the right product for the situation I am using it for.</li>
            <li> I have struggle with Acne in my adult life after using an IUD; I used all types of treatments that my dermatologyst recommended, after I finally switched birth control my acne decreased but the damage was done; lots of scars that would not go away; I literally had to wear layers and layers of make-up everyday even to the gym to feel somewhat normal. This product works; it&#x27;s gentle and it improves your skin apperance over time. I am hooked everytime I use it my skin looks healthier; I never thought I would be able to see my face without scars. I have been using it in combination of mederma at night to accelerate the healing process of my old scars.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order this.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it does what it says in the ad,since I have dry skin I don&#x27;t do too often and I follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Great peel for lifting acne scars, reducing wrinkles, toning, and evening out complexion..The only negative is the price...go to [...] where you can find an organic non-gmo lactic acid for a better price...for $15.75 you can get 20oz!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does not require an office visit.  I have used this once and I may have overdone it but after 6 days I did notice a difference.  Be careful and patient.  Do follow the directions and the baking soda mixture does ease the sting.  Read other reviews first and good luck.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every now and then and have had good results so far. I think if I used it more regularly I would really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, during the winter I get very dry skin around my nose and mouth and am affraid to use it right now. But when it warms up I am going to start using regularly.  I will update post with results!</li>
            <li> First, I think this stuff is fantastic.  Second, you should use some kind of oil around your eyes and on your lips - coconut oil, vitamin eye oil, glycerine - anything!  I use coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re very careful in the application, it&#x27;s very, very easy to get some in your eyes/mouth when washing it off.  I got a little in my eye, burned like Hades.  Got some on my lips and in my mouth, left an awful taste for a rather long time.  The oil keeps acid away from both areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!  I used to have pores on my nose and around my nostrils.  They weren&#x27;t very large, but I sure saw them.  The pores on my nose are so small, so tiny that I&#x27;m sure that other people can&#x27;t see them.  There are still a few around my nostril, but they get smaller and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a peel, I smooth vitamin e on my face.  After that&#x27;s absorbed, if I have any &#x27;sunburn sensation&#x27;, I apply chilled aloe vera gel from the refrigerated.  Fantastic!  Aloe vera is great for any kind of burns, but chilled aloe vera is like dipping your face in a cool Rocky Mountain lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first peel, START OUT WITH A LOWER CONCENTRATION.  There.  I yelled it.  I can&#x27;t emphasize that more.  If the burning sensation is very bad, doing area of your face. First your forehead, then was.  Next your temples/cheeks/nose, then wash.  Last, your chin/mouth/jaw area, then was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and the lower concentration.  As I wrote above, my pores have significantly diminished and my skin feels so like satin.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product (and ones similar to it), I was a bit weary about trying it, but decided to anyways. I have scars on my back from acne that came and went many many years ago and have tried everything (bleaching creams, acne creams, ambi, soaps that claim to do &amp;#34;wonderous things&amp;#34;..none of it worked! So I said hey why not, I&#x27;ve got nothing to lose?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you are using this for an area like your back (as I was), don&#x27;t expect to put it on then rinse it off and see your skin melt away. The process takes multiple rounds, and days/weeks to really show through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, be VERY Careful. The first time I put this on I felt a slight tingling, but nothing super harsh.&lt;br /&gt;The second and third times were a whole nother story!! No more nice tingle....I had to run water as a reminder that  could rinse it off soon just to get through a few minutes,but once rinsed off the burning goes away for the most part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, make sure to either rinse off in the shower first or wipe off the area you are about to apply this on with rubbing alcohol. You want your skin as clean as possible so the stuff can work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, it took me about a month to see results, but I can definitely see the difference (wishing I had found this many years and many dollars ago!). If your scars are very bad, you may need more than one bottle (depending on the size of the area you are applying it to), and you may need to do this whole thing for 1-3 months to really see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate in between your peels (maybe 2-3 times a week), that helps the process along too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is helpful to others.</li>
            <li> Worked well but did burn the skin near my eyes!  Next time I will just apply about 1 1/2 below my eye.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe cracked dry skin and very, very dark scars from my eczema. I found a method where you add the lactic acid to your daily body lotion and apply nightly and rinse in the morning. The very 1st night I used I c</li>
            <li> No bigger changes for now. I still have dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> I WAS LUCKY TO REACH THIS PRODUCT IN AMAZON. I AM STILL USING IT AND EACH TIME I PUT IT ON , THE NEXT DAY PEOPLE IS ASKING ME WHY I HAVE A FACE SKIN SO NICE THAT MORNING.... I ALTERN THE TWO PRODUCT OF THE SAME BRAND:THE GLICOLIC ACID AND THE LACT ACID. I DON&#x27;T ABUSE . TWICE PER MONTH .GOOOOOOOOOD</li>
            <li> whatever you do make sure you read the manual carefully. It&#x27;s very strong so don&#x27;t leave it on too long or the issue will get worse than it was before. 2 minutes at the most and do not apply it to open pores or pimples</li>
            <li> I have only tried it once, but it seems to do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> I used this 85% Lactic Acid for the first time and can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised!!!  The first time I used it I burnt the hell out of my face! I can laugh now but at the time it wasn&#x27;t funny. Especially since I had an event to attend 2 days later!  In time I learned how to effectively use this. I am so happy I gave it another chance.  It was so worth it!  My skin has totally rejuvenated itself. Its important not to agitate the skin prior to applying this acid! I always recommend a 1 day break from any abrasive activity on skin……..Follow the instructions to a T!  Don&#x27;t assume that because you don&#x27;t feel any stinging that it&#x27;s not working.  I didn&#x27;t see any peeling until a couple of days later! As time progressed I started to see some progress.  I initially thought 85% was going to be to much but for me it wasn&#x27;t!  I really began to see change after about 3 applications.</li>
            <li> It is okay because it does not remove deep acne scar, but makes your face glow after using it for like a day and your face goes back to it normal</li>
            <li> Been using it for awhile now and right from the beginning i notice a difference on my break outs, would recommend this to any one. Make sure you read up on it and watch videos on it, not difficult but can cause burns if left on for too long.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin, mainly for the the dark spots, around my nose because of my glasses. It works. If you can handle the skin slight irritation leave it on for 10 minute max. Rinse your face with cold water. You will notice your skin will start peeling with in the week. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Was good the 1st few times then I got burnt bad- Left it on a lil too long then ended up looking like I had leprosy. It was rough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry about peeling. The instructions actually say that the peeling happens at the microscopic level. So I was able to do this peel right before a date. This is opposed to Obagi Vit C, which caused my chin to peel off in sheets for days. There was no way to get rid of it either. But if it&#x27;s your first time, it&#x27;s probably best to wait at least 4 days before going out. Everyone is different. The first time I applied too long, especially above my lip and it burned even after washing it off.It went away after a day, but I&#x27;ll never do that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect is actually very subtle for me. I&#x27;ve only done it 3 times though and not spaced closely enough. But I do know it works.</li>
            <li> You really need to be using this awhile before seeing results. Also please make sure u dont put it on a pimple! made that mistake once...aint never gona happen again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it arrived quickly. The first day I used my husband noticed the change in my skin. I has also helped a bit with my mild acne. I have only used it three times since I&#x27;ve received it, but I can see results. It does sting a bit but rinsing your face with water and baking soda really help with that.</li>
            <li> EXTREME FACE BURN!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This acid is too strong to recommend it to anyone to use on their face. I have went to work with an extremely burnt face for about a month now and the longest I could fathom it was 2 to 3 minutes. Oh and it made new pigmentation spots from the burns instead of reducing the ones I already had. It also ferociously burns all the soft skin around your nose and neck area. I would not advise using this product period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, have sensitive skin.  You will get good results if you use it correctly.  Use it incorrectly, and it will just be counterproductive.  My skin feels smooth and it looks much more \\&quot;even\\&quot; than it did before.  I do my peels every sunday; This sunday will make my 5th.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used the salicylic acid before. 30%. But this is no joke. Even if you are a peel pro...first time no longer than a minute. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin and this actually made me peel unlike the sal. Acid. Also use/make a neutralizer. I didn&#x27;t have to use one in the past but with this product I do. It doesn&#x27;t frost. But wow is it effective. It has been excellent for my post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have used this prodcut alot over the years its mild and easy shipped fast great buy and worth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Am I in love with this product? Yes, about four times a year. I&#x27;ve just had my fourth peel of the season and sometimes they are not pleasant BUT this product DOES work to the HIGHEST Strength at 85%. I am past 55 and still have problematic blemishes and flair ups. This product DOES work and will burn the skin BUT make sure you are using it as instructed. With any miracle product it takes time. I purchased this product almost two years and I am still using it. The benefits from this product does as claimed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, to help with my acne on my face. I read great reviews of others whom have recieves fantastic results, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My skin is very sensitive and I think this product worsen my skin. I have acne scares on my face that we barley noticeable. After using this product the scars on my face became more noticeable . This product is suppose to take the top layer of your dead skin off, yet this product made my skin rise with acne. Overall every person reacts different to every treatment. This product was not for me. If you are looking to remove acne and soften your skin I recommend going to a spa and allowing them to do this procedure for you</li>
            <li> This is strong so tread lightly. It works really well so don&#x27;t leave it on too long and be sure you have a way to exfoliate the layer this brings up.</li>
            <li> I think mine must be defective. I tested it on my wrist and hand with no reaction&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned the areas with rubbing alcohol then poured a generous bead of the solution on the back of my hand and inside of my wrist to test before trying on my face. I left for 15 min and no burning, not even a tingle.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try a different brand but skin beauty solutions does not work.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician and know the benefits of glycolic and lactic peels.  I am a long time sufferer of sun damage, uneven skin tone, and spots of hypopigmentation.  Growing up in southern California I loved tanning any way I could. Now that I am in my 30s I see the effects it had on my face.  I have used this peel 3 times already, twice in the first week and once this week.  I can stand it for a good 5-7 min.  I am an over exfoliator though so I would not reccommend that long your first few times if your skin is not used to exfoliation.  I immediately noticed a lightening of my freckles and age spots, and my skin tone is evening out.  I am peeling and dry especially around my chin and nose.  But I will continue to use this now once/week for the next few weeks then give my skin time to heal.  Another thing I noticed was the day after I used it, I was able to extract all the blackheads on my nose with ease.  You couldn&#x27;t see them as blackheads from the peel, it almost looked like they disappeared, but upon squeezing the top of my nose, all the gunk came out very easily which normally isn&#x27;t the case.  It would usually take more pressure to extract.  Lactic acids brighten and tone the skin and the benefits of glycolic for fine lines and wrinkles makes this a peel I will definately continue to use, and it&#x27;s at a great price with fast delivery.  I hope this review helps anyone who may be suffering from the same skin problems as I have.  Make sure to apply with a small brush like an applicator brush or flat makeup brush to distribute evenly and not get all over hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> Good product. Really have not tried it yet. I am hoping that it does what they say. Have tried other products from this company with very good results</li>
            <li> This product works wonders, I used it on hyperpigmented spots in my face and body. This product does peel but it can peel up to 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li> This is good. I think I saw some improvement immediately after use.</li>
            <li> Works great on oily skin. I would caution against using this product if your skin is extremely sensitive or dry. Lucky me, I have super oily skin and my skin is really thick and resilient. I use this to help with my facial redness from acne scars and my rolling and indented acne scars. It works really well, but KNOW YOUR TOLERANCE. I have been using peels for over a year and a half, and I started out with very low percentages and gradually worked my way up. When I first started using peels, I would get extreme peeling and flaking and it would look like my skin was cracked and burned. Now a days, I just get dryness and some mild flakiness. That&#x27;s what happens when your skin becomes tolerant to the chemicals. I am very satisfied with this purchase and I have gotten several applications out of this bottle. It&#x27;s kind of thick in consistency, like syrup, instead of the watery TCA type peels I am used to.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a step up from the 35% I was using previously.  I did learn that you should use a scrub before applying, and then a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol.  This gets your face ready for the peel.  At first, I only put it on for maybe two minutes.  It was so much stronger.  It definitely stung.  I worked up to about 10 minutes.  It helped to take away some of the scars I had from recent zits.  I have a normal complexion.  One thing for sure, MOISTURIZE after using!!!!  I use this product 1-2 times per week.  I have noticed serious dry patches on my face.  I started using Argon oil at night to moisturize.  It seems to have helped.  I think I may go down to using just once a week.  Prepare for some burning and redness, but it does subside with rinsing your face continually with water.</li>
            <li> Works but strong, so be careful and have your baking soda and water already mixed to stop the sizzle.</li>
            <li> Fair from what That i expecte</li>
            <li> i left it on my face for 5 minutes as directed, then rinse and washed with mild soap for a minute.  it already burned my skin and started peeling right away.  then skin healed i got hyperpigmentation for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this to treat age/brown spots on my face.  The claim is &amp;#34;Skin Lightening, Skin Brightening and treats Age Spots&amp;#34; but the result is opposite.  It actually darkened my skin.  I would not recommend this product for skin lightening, skin brightening and treating age spots.</li>
            <li> Please see my review of the Taklon Fan Mask Brush.  Highly recommend this product.  I am in my 70&#x27;s so am careful on how long I leave the chemical peel on my skin.  This has been excellent to use and skin texture, firmness, and wrinkles are very much improved.  Important to always wear screen protection from the sun when using this product.</li>
            <li> I get this product really fast and I love how it works. I want promo send me to my e-mail with other products if possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m logging on to buy my 2nd bottle. I have scars on my knees, elbows and feet. This peel is working great for me, and uncovers beautiful baby-soft unblemished skin. I&#x27;m buying my 2nd bottle and possibly one for my mother as well (for wrinkles, to reveal new skin). I wasn&#x27;t looking to lighten my skin tone (i love my color/light enough for me) so the added bonus of lightening old scars to reveal my skin tone is great. I absolutely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I actually use this by putting a few drops of the lactic acid with my body lotion and it gives me nice, smooth skin with no irritation.  I especially concentrated on the knees and elbows and now they are baby smooth with no rough patches and have gotten lighter too!</li>
            <li> this my first peel , i applied lactic acid 85% on small area of my face for 3 min to test it then after  i applied it on my whole face, i feel  little stinging.Now on my second application 10 min on face little burning sensation , but i dont think this will help the sun burn , deep scars . Better go for TCA because TCA peel results are permanent. For deep scars and high sun burn , your skin has to peel like sheets to cure it. Lactic acid is micro peel this will not help deep scars and high sun burn , results also temporary. For TCA peel i cant go out for 7 days this is the big drawback in TCA. Any how if u want permanent cure Go for TCA. Lactic acid peel is like makeup on your face, this is not a solution for skin problems. i Kept lactic acid acid on whole face for 10 min all pimples are bleeding top layer of the pimple is removed, quite strong, next time going for 20 min ...but no peeling on my face. I will update every week..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd application 20 min - little difference on face but scars remain same, it makes your face to look young..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th application 30 min - 30 min lactic acid 85% on face i can&#x27;t tolerate more than this, pimples top layer skin removed bleeding, neutralized with  baking soda, dont worry this is not powerful like TCA acid. you can keep  lactic acid 30, 40 minutes .now on 3rd day i will update after a week how this 4th application results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you should do 10 ten applications to see good results... I will update every application results ..  Thank you...&lt;br /&gt;All the best for your peels...</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one. it will burn your face if left on too long. I did 5 minutes with excellent results. really helps with pores...will continue but need to moniter sensitive areas on face as it will burn you if not careful</li>
            <li> Excellent all of my scars were gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and Im already getting compliments on my skin.  The instructions are easy to follow. When I applied it I felt slight tingly, burning sensations which is normal however it should not be too intense or unbearable. I left it on for 5 minutes, no longer! Then applied a neutralizer which I also bought off of Amazon and the tingly sensation immediately stopped. The next morning I instantly noticed a glow, my pores looked smaller and my skin looked healthy, vibrant, bright and glowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use once a week or so too see what more this can really do... Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Works great and is very strong. Use with caution.</li>
            <li> I have bought peels from this company for years. First off,they always arrive early and NEVER had any issues with them. Second, I think this is probably the best peel around. It brightens the skin especially for someone like me who suffers from acne and use&#x27;s harsh products. This is the peel. I have been using this for years (and used other ones too) and by far, this is it. Great product. Great company.</li>
            <li> Look, if you have problems with discoloration, acne scars, or acne - this stuff works. It has taken 10 years off my face, clears acne overnight and smoothed my skin tremendously. I use once per week for three to four minutes (I can&#x27;t take any longer) but it instantly improves my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 47 year old, fair, caucasian female. I had some dark, sun damaged areas on the left side of my face. After using this product for the past few months, the dark area has faded a lot. I have tried many expensive creams and even laser treatments. This is a very effective and economical treatment.,</li>
            <li> Good product!! It is working good, and proce is right! I would recommend it to my friends and everyone else...</li>
            <li> This peel works great. It is uncomfortable while on your skin so have a hairdryer with a cool setting handy. This peel was priced great too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and is still one of my favorites</li>
            <li> I am excited to try this higher strength product.  I received today and a small amount of product had leaked during shipment.  The top was still sealed, but the instructions were ruined.  I have used lactic peels before, but this could present a problem to first time users.</li>
            <li> It is quite harsh. be very careful while applying, this should not be sold for public use</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results I have gotten from this product. I am a dark-skinned (black) man with dark skin patches in the beard area due to hyperpigmentation due to shaving/razor bumps over the years.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I appreciate all the helpful reviews that others submitted that led me to this and similar product.  So far I have done 20+ peels with a variety of acids and strengths and have gotten sensational results all for probably less than the price of just one treatment by a dermatologist. This product has done a great job of smoothing out the rough skin and evening out complection. It is doing exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I use this peel for many purposes. The first thing I do is a deep face peel using the salicylic 30% , once I have peeled I use this peel for the more sensative areas such as crows feet, frown lines between my eyes and around my mouth and nose area. This is great for broken capillairies around the nostrils or on the cheeks. My face is so much lighter after I use this ! The best skin brightener out there!  This did NOT get rid of my age spots or scars, that is the job of the deep peel. This does however top it all off and balance my skin very nice. I also add a few drops to my lotion for all over my body once a week . This will not make you actually &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; like the deeper tca or salicylic peels . This is a light peel where you skin will flake off gently with subsequent washes afterward. I notice and IMMEDIATE lightening and brightening of my skin after use! .  be sure to do your neck and chest so that they match lol. last year I had a tan neck and chest and white face lol.. not so good. It is gentle and very easy to use for beginners as well as if you are used to peels you can go the max time with this. I chose this one over the glycolic because I wanted to do my crows feet and this is the best one to do the around the eye area.. do not get to close to the eye. This bottle lasts me about 6 months. I do a peel once per week .</li>
            <li> I ma very happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this Lactic Acid partly because of the reviews I saw at the time, and partly because it was marked as 85%. I thought it would be very strong but I felt nothing. It was basically like putting water on my skin. Nothing happened. I waited 20 minutes and still nothing. I didn&#x27;t even wash it off because it was absolute garbage. Yesterday I decided to try again on a different part of my body, but nothing happened. *Sigh* I highly doubt this lactic acid is even anywhere near 10%. It honestly feels like nothing. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I don&#x27;t know but I am sorely disappointed. I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could. Be careful when you buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Great product - does what it says - I&#x27;ve used cautiously so far but it&#x27;s left my skin in much condition and appearance then it was before I started the peels.  Really like this lactic acid peel and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a good product.</li>
            <li> The product was just right and I can&#x27;t say anything bad about, but the bottle are not save , as the acid was all over escaping the bottle even the seal was not broken it just jump back each time I try to close it tight , so not really save , I could not read the instruction since it was already gone .  Good product bad bottle</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It does nothing.  It has a very light vinegar scent, so I would not be surprised if it is just a watered down vinegar.  I would pass on this product and go for a name brand or professional peel.</li>
            <li> Great for maintaining skin and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve applied this peel 5 times now, and even leave it on longer than is recommended &amp; I see no difference at all in my skin. After standing around with a prickly, burning, itchy feeling all over my face for 20mins I expected to see some results by the 5th peel! The only thing it did was leave the creases along my nose red &amp; slightly burning for a couple days. I had an allergic reaction to something about a year ago, and my face broke out badly due to this. I have very fair skin, and now have little brown/red hyperpigmentation marks all over.  I was really hoping this would help. I see no change so far, not even a brighter complexion; I mean absolutely nothing has changed. I&#x27;m really bummed out. Im going to keep trying it though for another month, and see if anything happens. I&#x27;ll update my review then.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product..Arrived quickly..Many Thanks..</li>
            <li> I have used this, as prescribed, about five times now. It can be used right before going out although I will use it overnight so I am not tempted to put on makeup. I am 65 years old and I do see quite a difference, especially in pictures that are taken of me. I plan to continue to use this. One should always follow the instructions when using, though, as it can cause some discomfort. Give yourself time to work up to the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for over the counter -- get a nice peel and noticed malasma and acne scars are reduced.  Nice to have between dermatologist office chemical peels and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was kind of concerned about using an at home peel but it did wonders. I only use it on my back for old acne scars and it wound up clearing up new little blemishes as well. Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my face I would not recommend it to anyone .I would not but it again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and I could not wait to try it. I have oily skin with flares of cystic acne, I used as described on package insert and my skin felt awesome after. Skin was a little ashy for a few days following but this was outlined by insert, some oil-free moisturizer and I was good to go. I intend to use monthly to keep my cystic acne controlled.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. I have olive skin and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I must admit to being really afraid the first time I tried this peel. BACK STORY: I gave myself an \\&quot;accidental\\&quot; face peel as a teenager when I used my moms Retin-A and then went in the sun...I peeled for weeks after that! But since I&#x27;m in my early 30s and am now noticing fine lines and wrinkles as well as some sun spots (I love in S. Florida and the sun has done a number on me) I needed to try something, wrinkle creams just don&#x27;t cut it.  Also, I am fair with freckles and want to try to lighten them a bit as well.  So, I got the nerve to try this peel and it was a piece of cake!  I used a cotton ball and applied a small amount in an even layer all over. I was careful not to get too close to my eyes and lips.  The first thing I noticed was how my little patches of acne started to get really red and I my skin was tingly.  The directions tell you that if it&#x27;s your first time using not to leave it on longer than a couple minutes. So when the time was up, I rinsed using plain water and on the spots that still burned I used baking soda and water solution to neutralize.  I was pretty nervous because my acne areas stayed BRIGHT RED for hours after.  I put pure coconut oil on my face to calm my skin (that is another fabulous skin product by the way).  I had no need to worry though--about 6-8 hours later the red started to subside and a bright, clear complexion emerged!  I was so thrilled.  So, for those of you who have a fair, freckled, complexion, with a little sun damage and who are sometimes sensitive to products, this peel may just work for you. It&#x27;s worth a try. I am also thinking of adding it to lotion and using on arms, neck and chest as other reviewers suggested. The price is right and the product is very high quality. Since I only peel every few weeks, this bottle will last for months. I&#x27;m looking into purchasing more products from the company.</li>
            <li> I certainly like that it hasn&#x27;t burned my skin! I followed the directions to the letter &amp; it does seem to give me a healthy glow. Nothing like the chemical peels that I&#x27;ve gotten at the salon, but for home use, it&#x27;s perfect. Be sure &amp; read &amp; follow the instructions carefully &amp; have the baking soda &amp; water solution ready because it really does help neutralize the effects once it&#x27;s time to rinse. Not so much burning, but the itchy-tingly-burning thing, which is hard to take! Look up the difference between lactic acid &amp; the others. This one is the natural fruit stuff, so I feel good about that.</li>
            <li> I used it and love it. I wll recoment to all my friends very much. much better than others that used before.&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Marinitza V.</li>
