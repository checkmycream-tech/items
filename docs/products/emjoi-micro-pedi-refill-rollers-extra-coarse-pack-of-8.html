            <li>Received quickly and compatible with the Emjoi I own.</li>
            <li>They were so easy to replace on my Micro-Pedi device.</li>

            <li>Quick delivery, product as promised!</li>
            <li>These make my feet so smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as the Emoji name brand rollers.</li>
            <li>Fit my emjoi and a fraction of cost elsewhere</li>
            <li>I thought the sand paper would start to pull away from the roller after continued use but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I bought the original emjoi micro-pedi from QVC and their refills</li>
            <li>These seem so work and hold up just as the original rollers.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t used a refill roller yet, I like how the original one worked.</li>
            <li>I have not replaced the original yet</li>
            <li>It was a significant savings</li>
            <li>Just like the original rollers that came with the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>These are labor intensive, since you have to constantly clean them of the dust from the calluses.</li>
            <li>work great on that dry skin.</li>
            <li>They all love the Emjoi, so extra rollers will come in handy.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, just started using it</li>
            <li>I used the Emoji brand roller many times before I needed a new roller.</li>
            <li>fair price on a large package size of the coarse rollers</li>
            <li>Great and received in a few days, just as promised.  </li>
            <li>This Emjoi saves me tons on pedicures and keeps my feet soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Love how soft my feet are after using this product.</li>
            <li>This is so worth buying for my Emjoi.</li>
            <li>My feet have never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Love the Emjoi, it works so much better than a pumice stone or other mechanical exfoliating methods.</li>
            <li>when I use these which should be pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Very effective on takeing off the dead skin build up.</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>I do think I will try the coarser rollers which look like very coarse sandpaper to see if they are much more effective or substantially different.</li>
            <li>Works good for less price.</li>
            <li>Worked as expected and l love the smooth and silky way my feet feel.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable purchased in the pack of 8,</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted,and they arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as offered.  </li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>I have not used these yet, but they are exactly like the ones that come with the micro-pedi.  </li>
            <li>qulaity is good but not coarse enough.</li>
            <li>Ok dont last too long compare to the original !</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I received these Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers so quick.</li>
            <li>These do not work as good and last as long  as the ones from QVC.  </li>
            <li>I use these with the battery-operated remover and finish with the fine side of a regular paddle shaper.  </li>
            <li>great product, arrived earlier then expected, yeah!!!</li>
            <li>These are affordable and do the job very well.</li>
            <li>THESE WORK REALLY</li>
            <li>they were very satisfactory</li>
            <li>but i really like it.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not liking these too much.</li>
            <li>my wife really enjoys the way it works</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>fast shipping.....</li>
            <li>I use the super coarse to get off the main callus and then use the blue one to smooth the area out.</li>
            <li>the refills last quite a long time and they do a great job in removing calluses And dry skin</li>
            <li>but next time will get a little rougher one, but these work good too</li>
            <li>Love what the extra coarse does to my heels.</li>
            <li>I will be trying the super coarse soon as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the super coarse.  </li>
            <li>, they could actually be a little more rougher.</li>
            <li>I used the first refill cartridge a few days ago and they work just as well as the original rollers that came with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li>I live in a beach town and we all live in our flip flops and at the Pedicurist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already started using a second one after using the first one only twice.</li>
            <li>Actually a little better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the original, but a slight difference in diameter makes it a little noisier.  </li>

            <li> Love what the extra coarse does to my heels.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the super coarse soon as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the super coarse.  </li>
            <li> , they could actually be a little more rougher.</li>
            <li> I used the first refill cartridge a few days ago and they work just as well as the original rollers that came with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> I live in a beach town and we all live in our flip flops and at the Pedicurist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already started using a second one after using the first one only twice.</li>
            <li> Actually a little better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the original, but a slight difference in diameter makes it a little noisier.  </li>
            <li> also will be getting the next level of rollers for those very difficult areas that need a bit more attention.</li>
            <li> but why list it under the patent name when clearly not that product??</li>
            <li> Now I feel much better, less guilty, buying replacement pedi rollers.</li>
            <li> than I expected considering I had never once had a pedicure in over 50 years.  </li>
            <li> these are NOT Emjoi brand; these are pedi active brand.  </li>
            <li> Works great....put down newspaper before you use.</li>
            <li> and it comes out to about half the price.  </li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;m a half inch shorter now.</li>
            <li> We go thru the roller like crazy due to being on our feet so much.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have heavy callous on my feet.</li>
            <li> Grinds the dead skin like a mini belt sander and makes my feet smoother</li>
            <li> there expensive for no more times than they last per use.</li>
            <li> In the past, frankly, they were unaffordable.</li>
            <li> Get the green ones!  </li>
            <li> /&gt; instead of the hard plastic covers..</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t believe these are tough to put into the machine.</li>
            <li> These little refill rollers can be very expensive depending on who you order from....</li>
            <li> But they are so expensive on QVC, I ordered these...</li>

            <li> Great quality rollers.  I love my Micropedi!</li>
            <li> These are labor intensive, since you have to constantly clean them of the dust from the calluses. I like what it does but don&#x27;t like the amount of time it takes to do the job.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having such an excellent price on this product.  These little refill rollers can be very expensive depending on who you order from.... I will be ordering more in the future.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great and very happy with the rollers.</li>

            <li> Works as advertised.  The electric Micro-Pedi is the perfect tool for smoothing the soles of your feet.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product as promised!</li>
            <li> Great replacement rollers for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> Bought this as Christmas present for my daughter- she couldnt wait to show me her gorgeous feet- now I&#x27;m jealous and I want one! :)</li>
            <li> Work great. Actually a little better than I expected for the price. I thought the sand paper would start to pull away from the roller after continued use but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Love these pedi rollers. work great on that dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love what the extra coarse does to my heels. Very smooth.</li>
            <li> No problems with this item</li>
            <li> I got these to go with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  They are wonderful.  I do not want to ever run out.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Best price by far.</li>
            <li> Never have to get your fee one out side the house love these</li>
            <li> there ok but they only last about one to two times  per use, they could actually be a little more rougher. there expensive for no more times than they last per use.</li>
            <li> Same great refills at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> These are affordable and do the job very well.</li>
            <li> Ok dont last too long compare to the original !</li>
            <li> Exactly as offered.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this pack of the refill rollers.  I bought the original emjoi micro-pedi from QVC and their refills are about 3 times what this price is.  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> So I had another set of 2 saved in my wish list forever that were almost the same price of these 8!!!  So glad I looked one more time before buying.  They fit the Emjoi Micro-Pedi perfect and do a great job.</li>
            <li> These make my feet so smooth. I love them and they work wonders on my heels. I have the Emjoi Micro-Pedi which has worked great between pedis at the salon.  Such a deal and the price was excellent, better than QVC.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK REALLY WELL...WISH I WOULD HAVE SEEN THE OFFER ON TV WITH THE &amp;#34;LIFE TIME REFILL ROLLERS&amp;#34; BUT IM OKAY WITH THAT</li>
            <li> Works good for less price.</li>
            <li> qulaity is good but not coarse enough.</li>
            <li> they were very satisfactory</li>
            <li> good to have these on hand but next time will get a little rougher one, but these work good too</li>
            <li> These seem so work and hold up just as the original rollers. I am so happy so find a more reasonable price. Love the Emjoi, it works so much better than a pumice stone or other mechanical exfoliating methods. I will be trying the super coarse soon as well.</li>
            <li> I found the micro-pedi and I love how it works</li>
            <li> Quick ship, just started using it but i really like it.  Very glad to have this plug in model over the battery style.</li>
            <li> I use the super coarse to get off the main callus and then use the blue one to smooth the area out.</li>
            <li> RELPENISHING MY STOCK.</li>
            <li> Yes they were just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I received these Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers so quick. They were so easy to replace on my Micro-Pedi device. They work amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I ordered these through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the original, but a slight difference in diameter makes it a little noisier.  Great price for replacements.</li>
            <li> The refills are not the same as the rollers that came with the Emjoi. I&#x27;ll try the super coarse.  I live in a beach town and we all live in our flip flops and at the Pedicurist</li>
            <li> Love my Emjoi Micro-Pedi!</li>
            <li> Just what ya need with the machine! Bulk is better</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used a refill roller yet, I like how the original one worked.</li>
            <li> What a nice deal. I got the Emjoi thru one of the shipping channels. The emjoi  is ne of the best callus removing products on the market, but the rollers are very pricey. I paid $15.00 for TWO. This is so worth buying for my Emjoi. We go thru the roller like crazy due to being on our feet so much. Th extra coarse works well for us.These are so easy to replace. They come individually wrapped&lt;br /&gt; instead of the hard plastic covers.. Much prefer that.&lt;br /&gt;I also will be getting the next level of rollers for those very difficult areas that need a bit more attention.</li>
            <li> These work well as replacement cartridges.  I get callouses on my feet.  I use these with the battery-operated remover and finish with the fine side of a regular paddle shaper.  Works.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I finally found an item that is truly Great and works!  My feet have never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing refills for a foot sander.  I have not replaced the original yet but I can&#x27;t believe these are tough to put into the machine.</li>
            <li> Great savingsonthisproductwhich Iuse all the time.</li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi MIcro-Pedi machine and when I saw the price on these refill rollers I had to try them.  It was a significant savings and they did not disappoint,  I could not tell the difference from the more expensive rollers.</li>
            <li> fair price on a large package size of the coarse rollers</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. Finally, the replacements are offered at a discounted, bulk order price. In the past, frankly, they were unaffordable. Now I feel much better, less guilty, buying replacement pedi rollers.</li>
            <li> Works well but takes time.</li>
            <li> Just like the original rollers that came with the Emjoi.  Very reasonable purchased in the pack of 8,</li>
            <li> The best price we could find. Amazon comes out on top again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not liking these too much. I&#x27;ve already started using a second one after using the first one only twice. It doesn&#x27;t smooth as well as the Emoji name brand rollers. I use a pumice stone almost daily in the shower so I don&#x27;t have heavy callous on my feet. I used the Emoji brand roller many times before I needed a new roller.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted,and they arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> my wife really enjoys the way it works</li>
            <li> These do not work as good and last as long  as the ones from QVC.  But they are so expensive on QVC, I ordered these... Probably will order&lt;br /&gt; from QVC when I use these which should be pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and compatible with the Emjoi I own. Worked as expected and l love the smooth and silky way my feet feel. I do think I will try the coarser rollers which look like very coarse sandpaper to see if they are much more effective or substantially different.</li>
            <li> Fit my emjoi and a fraction of cost elsewhere</li>
            <li> Fast service! The rollers are perect!</li>
            <li> will know soon as well try them..looks ok</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount of rollers!</li>
            <li> WIFE USES IT AND LIKES IT</li>
            <li> Availability of the refills is affordable!  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Bought as part of package Christmas gifts to our daughters and daughters-in-law with the Emjoi Pro Foot Buffer. They all love the Emjoi, so extra rollers will come in handy.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the name brand rollers.  I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference from the original roller and it comes out to about half the price.  Grinds the dead skin like a mini belt sander and makes my feet smoother than I expected considering I had never once had a pedicure in over 50 years.  I swear I&#x27;m a half inch shorter now.</li>
            <li> Love this Micro Pedi.. got one for me and one for my daughter... didn&#x27;t know her husband would also love it!</li>
            <li> Very good deal I will buy again when I need more</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be the same quality as those the unit came with</li>
            <li> Great and received in a few days, just as promised.  They are great quality and work just wonderful.  This is the greatest foot shaver ever!</li>
            <li> I have not used these yet, but they are exactly like the ones that come with the micro-pedi.  I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi is a great little gadget and the price for these replacements is very good.</li>
            <li> Nice to have replacements</li>
            <li> These work great and don&#x27;t burn your skin.</li>
            <li> real good price and deliery</li>
            <li> Excellent rollers to sand off callus on feet.&lt;br /&gt;Fit and work fine on the machine.</li>
            <li> great product, arrived earlier then expected, yeah!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Works well and is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Get the green ones!  These DO NOT LAST.</li>
            <li> I bought the refills through here, cheaper than what the manufacturer&#x27;s web site has them priced at.  I used the first refill cartridge a few days ago and they work just as well as the original rollers that came with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> Very effective on takeing off the dead skin build up. My feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> these are NOT Emjoi brand; these are pedi active brand.  The packaging picture on the site shows &amp;#34;emjoi&amp;#34; overlayed onto the package - it&#x27;s not there.  The item comes from Pedi-active and is listed as a pedi-active product that fits emjoi.  It&#x27;s fineit&#x27;s a knock-off - no big deal - but why list it under the patent name when clearly not that product?? Why no truth in the advertising?</li>
            <li> I uses these to give myself a pedi In between my spa pedicure.  Works great....put down newspaper before you use.</li>
            <li> The refills work great.</li>
            <li> Works perfect... love the coarse surface!!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, great price.</li>
            <li> Amazing how well this product works.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A great bargain, fast shipping and works.</li>
            <li> Glad have them refill. I am :)</li>
            <li> These rollers go with the Emjoy Callous Remover. They work great.</li>
            <li> fast shipping..... low prices</li>
