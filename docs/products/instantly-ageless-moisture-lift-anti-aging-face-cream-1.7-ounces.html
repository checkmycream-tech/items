    <ol>
            <li> Love Love this product!!!! I use it every night before I go to bed, and the next day my skin feels firm an soft. I would definately recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Use on my hands no face</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of this and it&#x27;s the perfect companion to their Facelift in a Bottle serum. I like that you can use it around the eyes as well as the face. It&#x27;s smooth and not greasy, soaks in easily. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about two weeks.  Can&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. No different than any other moisturizer</li>
            <li> See the above comments. It isn&#x27;t clear exactly what is required there.  Clearer directions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> decent size jar. little goes a long way . nice smell and very good for sensitive skin too. really like this product sure to buy again. nothing like the littel vials though. Dont expect those fast crazy results like the vials. but nice product.</li>
            <li> Not sure didn&#x27;t see any chance</li>
            <li> Moisturizer fine but did not lift or tighten at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to my friends.  In 3 weeks I saw a big difference around my eyes and mouth!</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product. It simply did not work.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Good thing I am so young... I can find another product and try to stop the wrinkles from creeping up!</li>
            <li> Although it took a long time getting here, seems this was the post office...not the shipper!  The product is nice and I think it covers wrinkles pretty well. I&#x27;m 57 and although it doesn&#x27;t make me look 20 again...it does help!</li>
            <li> This cream does nothing. My skin feels a little greasy after application and it feels heavy or like I have a film on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not work! Extremely disappointed....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I can see any difference.</li>
            <li> Does not decrease lines &amp; wrinkles.  Also flakes on your skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> did not do what it said it was supose to do</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird cause I thought this was the product that stretched the area, but it didn&#x27;t. In fact, it made it worse. Not a good buy. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the OMG Ageless eye cream. So not that satisfied with the product. This is a face moisturizer. Not the eye cream with instant results.</li>
            <li> An excellent firming moisturizer for my neck. It&#x27;s light feel makes be forget i have anything on.  yet i can see the difference in my neck looking tighter and more toned.  This was a Great find.</li>
            <li> Not yet sure what the effect is. It feels pleasant on the skin. Does it really reduce lines, not as yet evident.</li>
            <li> perfect  product  ... fast  shipping ...  amazing  product  and  seller</li>
            <li> Not any different than a regular moisturizer. Not worth the money.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it will do!  Very disappointed  :(</li>
            <li> I have applied many times. Up to now, this product does not work on me. I&#x27;ll keep trying until I finish this jar,  may be I&#x27;ll find the right amount  in the future.</li>
            <li> More effective than standard serum.  Visible difference within a week.  Definitely recommend.  Fragrance is somewhat plastic-like though.  They need to improve the fragrance.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it, only been using it for a week, but not having any adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t notice a difference, certainly nothing immediate. Have used it for a week and no change. Not sure that there will be(?)</li>
            <li> Not working as advertised.</li>
            <li> not exactly instant, still deciding if I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50...had my doubts but decided to give it a go on one side of my face to compare...Holy..****...It did such a great job made me look like one eye was off because the corner was lifted.  Then tried my jowl..hate that word.  Gone, and frown line between my eyes.  Gone...it&#x27;s so weird but it does work.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I would like to order  3 jars of this can you take this order for me, I really like this product</li>
