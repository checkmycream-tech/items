            <li> Ok eat to replace old with new</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  Get it.  It does what it says it does.  As you probably found out most of these types of razors don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> this is a great foil fits great. I would order again but gave my son razor.</li>
            <li> We were traveling in Arizona and my Andis electric razor head wore out.  I needed the razor so I ordered a new head from Amazon and had it sent to the resort in Sedona where we were staying.  The head was sent and my razor was back in use for the balance ofr our month long travels.  Good work Amazon.</li>
            <li> good replacement blades that are put to the test in a barber shop, time will be the judge as to how long they last.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason the new and improved version of the thinner cutting blades dont cut as close to the original cutters. Andis what happened.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me,  I just star to use it, Ii don&#x27;t know how long it last,  but now is good.</li>
            <li> My Andis were still good but my foil had been knicked and was cutting my face.  These replacements worked as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Still sharp after a daily use for a year.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my nephew for my husband.  He absolutely loves it..says its the best shaver he has ever had...gives a very close safe</li>
            <li> The purchase was exactly what i wanted and it came on time</li>
            <li> I went with the bald head look and this shaver was recommended by my barber. The shaver works great. Based on the use, the foil cutters lasts about 18 months to 2 years. It works so well that I knew I would not remember when it&#x27;s time to replace it and I wanted to make sure that I had a backup replacement just in case. I will surely order another one.</li>
            <li> I brought this to replace the one take came with the unit... It works as describes and it actually helped me clear up my razor bumps I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone especially black men who have an issue with razor bumps like myself...</li>
            <li> These replacement foils and cutters are what I consider quality items, however; bump-less they are not. You can get a smooth shave but if you are prone to bumps you will get them. If not quite a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shave is ok, then use these with no pressure on your face, leaving a minute stubble. Then the bumps are less likely.</li>
            <li> This product works really well with my shaver and are of excellent quality and will produce many years of excellent services.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting. I don&#x27;t care for the Andis17010 in the first place, its too noisy. Also the trimmer doesn&#x27;t stop when it is retracted which causes a lot problems.There are other problems as well but I won&#x27;t go into them.&lt;br /&gt;You can count yourself blessed if you get six months use out of this replacement hesd.</li>
            <li> Disappointed by the new foil- the blades were great but had to use the old foil to help the razor work well.</li>
            <li> I needed to get a replacement foil-cutter for my andis because it bent and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s performance went down. the new foil-cutter did the trick and now I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have any problems!</li>
            <li> I received my package today 5/31/13 but in the pictures it shows two small blades along w/ the cover. I did not receive the two small blades that are suppose to come with it. Please give me a feed back on this.</li>
            <li> Good tool to have if you want to maintain a bald head. However, the gold mesh keeps wearing out and it scratches my head. Ordered 2 replacements already</li>
            <li> These replacement foils seems to be a lot lower in quality compared to the originals that came on the razor. I love the razor and the original foils and cutter, but find the replacements make the razor sub-standard. Quality control issue maybe?</li>
            <li> Did not expect the foil would break after less than three months...  It seems expensive.  The shaver works well but the foil does not seem to be durable enough for the price.</li>
