            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>I like the Perfect Whip cleanser.  </li>
            <li>i purchased the perfect whip along with perfect senganseka cleansing oil, hada labo hyluronic gokujyn lotion, innisfree no sebum pact, laneige water sleeping, and mizon snail recovery gel lotion.</li>
            <li>Works great for me!</li>
            <li>but they just didn&#x27;t compare to Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li>I never change it, because its just too perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly in combination with the Clarisonic Brush.  </li>
            <li>This face wash is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but I must say that I was truly impressed with the quality of this wash.</li>

            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>(if you haven&#x27;t yet, go search youtube for &amp;#34;Shiseido Perfect Whip commercial&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Until I found Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li>I tend to use Bioderma and Kose Cleansing Oil to remove makeup and cleanse, but this is awesome!</li>
            <li>What a great product!</li>
            <li>Very nicely foaming cleanser!!!</li>
            <li>very good!!!  </li>
            <li>Really Great Foaming Cleanser!!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>The best way to use the Perfect Whip is lather the cream into a foam before apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>The best way to foam</li>
            <li>I even like the name, Perfect Whip.  </li>
            <li>You can buy without fears, because Perfect Whip will change your life.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is wonderful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift this time around for my best friend to try.</li>
            <li>However, it was very pleasant to use</li>
            <li>This face was has been ideal in controlling oil without over-drying.</li>
            <li>Happy, Happy!</li>
            <li>When there is a good amount just apply the foam bubble to your face and lather it in and then rinse!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works beautifully with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>and this clears up my face beautifully.</li>
            <li>Smells beautiful, lasts forever</li>
            <li>i am in love with everything on the list, and perfect whip is especially enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I love Shiseido products but they&#x27;re often a bit out of my price range, so their Perfect Whip is perfect for my budget.</li>
            <li>feels great on my face...  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great, great product.</li>
            <li>Great price as well.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it that great of a product as others did.</li>
            <li>Great product for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Feels great.</li>
            <li>What a great product!er for life.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizing whip face cream wash.</li>
            <li>Once you rinse your face, it does a great job taking all the oils off of your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this to wash my face after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup with a cleansing oil, and I feel like it does a great job at removing all of the residual product.</li>
            <li>This product is good and the customer service is also good!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this face wash! !</li>
            <li>Very good product, love it !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>it foams up really nicely, is dense and creamy, and made me feel squeaky clean--but that was the problem!</li>
            <li>It does have a scent, but to me it is pleasant and not over-bearing.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>In addition, the Perfect Whip has a pleasant, light smell when it foams up.</li>
            <li>[The Face Shop] Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to wash my face.</li>
            <li>the price is also fair.</li>
            <li>will repurchase, good value.</li>
            <li>Really nice product!!!The foam are great</li>
            <li>Good price and good quality.</li>
            <li>This had good ratings</li>
            <li>It works surprising well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>It gets good reviews on this site and others but when I tried it myself</li>
            <li>nicely feels great wish</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good all</li>
            <li>I loved this face wash for about 6 months.</li>
            <li>By then, I had probably used up a good 50%+ of the tube.</li>
            <li>but it still good</li>
            <li>when comes to this good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is a good Shiseido Face wash, because I still have whiteheads a lot of them.  </li>
            <li>This is best for people who don&#x27;t suffer from breakouts and want a squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li>you just need a peas size on your face to make a great wash, very smooth and  shiseido makes it so it is really good.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap but really good!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>an aside, I love how affordable this stuff is!</li>
            <li>I love how this cleanser leaves your skin feeling!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser !  </li>
            <li>and i have to say that i love it!</li>
            <li>Love this face wash!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I love how foamy this cleanser gets!</li>
            <li>Lol.. anyway,  I was quite hesitant to use the product since I tend to break out easily.</li>
            <li>As a guy who has had skin problems and tried dozens of different face cleansers all my life, I can say Perfect Whip is easily one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>though this is nothing particularly amazing, the oil and whip get the job done well.</li>
            <li>you get is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing cleanser, before I had been using proactive which has microbeads, but I never felt like it truly cleaned out all the oil and dirt off my face</li>
            <li>This cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>I really liked this until I found out</li>
            <li>and I liked</li>
            <li>It cleans my face nicely.</li>
            <li>I am just loving with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and it cleans nicely.</li>
            <li>I have saw so many good reviews</li>
            <li>1st time buyer, great product, after usage, feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of voodoo magic Japan puts in it&#x27;s skincare products, but it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Great gentle but effective cleanser!  </li>
            <li>Amazing couldn&#x27;t be more happy if I tried with this product my skin feels amazing and clean when I wash and is helpful to oily skin like my husbands.</li>
            <li>It washes off very easily and does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does foam very easily</li>
            <li>It has a very nice light almost baby powder like smell to it which I just love.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this product is more akin to a toothpaste than a foam, and I&#x27;m being kind.  </li>
            <li>Great face wash worth every penny.</li>
            <li>skin is sensitive, so I tend to wash my face in the morning with water and use the Perfect Whip at night during shower.</li>
            <li>I would probably re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my full review here if you want!!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect combination of strong and gentle for my skin.  </li>
            <li>perfect whip is a pleasant, soft, and mild cleansing foam.</li>
            <li>recommended to anyone needing a good and inexpensive product to clean their face,</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t own a bath poof, or a net for the Perfect Whip, this is what I resort to.</li>
            <li>I liked this cleanser pretty good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out, very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser atm</li>
            <li>Coconut Oil works better for me.</li>
            <li>I have a combo skin type,  more oily.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the product as well as the speed of shipping.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>OK, this is THE MOST foamiest cleansers I have EVER come across.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Clinique girl most my life</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t quite get the same foam as the ads but the cleansing power is superb.</li>
            <li>I love Shiseido product.</li>
            <li>and I love this face soap.</li>
            <li>It can get even the most stubborn makeup (I&#x27;m talking lime crime velvetines here) off of my face.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me more acne, but it also didn&#x27;t do a thorough job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>This product will perform a lot better with foaming net/bubble maker.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this...</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the texture/consistency of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>There are much better cleansers you can use with more beneficial ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alright so I read all of the reviews and did more research online as well.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers have a pH between 4-6.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered my second bottle and am happy with this product!!!!</li>
            <li>With this price there is a lot more options out there for me to choose.</li>
            <li>safe to use twice a day after makeup at night, and before makeup in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing and cleans without harming your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing and cleans without harming your skin.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this! :D</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m already thinking about ordering more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It did its job as a face wash, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to order again.</li>
            <li>have not found anythig better than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture of it is more like a lotion</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Despite this, it&#x27;s definitely the best foam cleanser I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>Fantastic face wash!</li>
            <li>In my hours of research I found out there was actually a technique in using the Perfect Whip!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my face look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>Not too sure how it is as an anti-acne product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how this lathers and rinses.</li>
            <li>bought many times, still useful&lt;</li>
            <li>love love love........</li>
            <li>I am breakout prone, so I like to make sure all makeup/dirt is removed from my face before bed.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product several times from toy shop japan hobbyone, great seller!</li>
            <li>and I need something more soothing.</li>
            <li>This will probably work better on greasy/oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now, and I love the smell and the foamy feeling on my face</li>
            <li>I love the application and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect step if you use the double cleanse method (or even if you don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>This is like cetaphil but better.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product it foams up very very nicely which is my favorite part of this product</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this item</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives very rich form.</li>
            <li>very rich lather.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of making my face feel squeaky clean without my fingers ever even touching the skin because the foam is so rich, but it isn&#x27;t the best for my skin because I get pretty frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am a male in my 30&#x27;s and have gone through my fair share of face washes and by far I am loving the Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li>It gets your face very clean without over drying.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin very clean.</li>
            <li>Feels very clean after use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s mild but effective cleaning the face.</li>
            <li>product is awesome for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff amazing, it is light, easy to go on and east to lather, easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>There is a nice mild scent but no chemical smell.</li>
            <li>My face is always squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>After you wash it off your face feels really clean!</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>It foams up well and it takes off all my oils (squeaky clean!)</li>
            <li>Leaves my fave squeaky clean literally!</li>
            <li>Skin feel great fresh and moist after use, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin and this in addition to Stri-Dex Medicated Pads, Sensitive has greatly helped improve my skin.</li>
            <li>This was the first Shiseido item I used, and I am very impressed with the quality of their products so far.</li>
            <li>However, Shiseido Perfect Whip made my eyes burn even though I was careful not to get any of it in my eyes or even close to them.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t take the natural oils off of my face.</li>
            <li>Good product, Very concentrated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and works really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- easy to use and creates foam within</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really clean my skin, but maybe fits oil skin better.</li>
            <li>It has a soft feeling to it, smell is nice, and leaves your skin feeling nice and</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is way too strong to put on your face.</li>
            <li>But this one is the most gentle and effective on my skin type.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different face washes for around 10 dollars, but this one is certainly the best face wash I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li>The experience of using it is so pleasant that I&#x27;m tempted to use it on days I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup and would normally just use a light oil cleanse.r</li>
            <li>understand that there is a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; with this, and that is fine.  </li>
            <li>However, does not work too well on black heads but makeup removal and cleaning of pores is great!</li>
            <li>I can use this cleanser in the morning and it seems fine, however I can&#x27;t use it at night.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to use it, but so much cheaper and better than anything else on the market!</li>
            <li>i heard a lot good command on this product but it kind a bit dry after wash your face</li>
            <li>The tiniest amount makes a huge lather.</li>
            <li>I use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil before using this, which is great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim...  Needed something else in the cart to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>This an extremely gentle soap but by itself I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>but when you pair it with a clarisonic or a foam scrubby, it really does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>All I have to do is wash with this and use a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>The smell is lightly soapy, kinda meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never have to exfoliate after this soap because it cleans my pores so well and rinses off nicely (definitely use a moisturizer after); it would be a great post-workout cleanser.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irrita my skin, leaves face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great if you want that fresh into puberty look, but this cleanser leaves my skin clean and soft without taking all the moisture.</li>
            <li>so fast!!!</li>
            <li>Generat rich foam</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a huge range of American drugstore cleansers and this handily outpaces them at all at a lower price than most.</li>
            <li>When the Perfect Whip arrived I went straight to test it out and without much thought I squeeze the cream onto my hands and started applying it directly to my face.</li>
            <li>At first, I enjoyed using this facewash...</li>
            <li>Great product just a pea size goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean without drying.</li>
            <li>This stuff clean me well, and it help brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>In general, it is a pretty great cleanser.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>By god, does it clean.</li>
            <li>and my face felt really clean after use.</li>
            <li>no scent, just smells clean</li>
            <li>It smells clean but not perfume-y</li>
            <li>Honestly the most moisturizing facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin clean and removes all the make-up.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used better products for a real squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Clean without drying, reasonable price, love this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone looking for the perfect foamy facial cleanser that is very gentle on face.</li>
            <li>Nice gentle on the skin, great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Sweet baby jesus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that foamy, but it eels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this face wash will be a good for basic make-up removal/</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a good cleanser to begin with, now that I&#x27;ve accumulated enough information about my skin preferences.</li>
            <li>changed it to 3 stars - &amp;#34;Its okay&amp;#34; because it really is just okay.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I always read such good reviews for Shiseido, so I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to like this, but am very taken aback at how much I LOVE it -</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>It smells really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nothing gets my face feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily as a light-duty cleanser for several weeks - and for me, it is truly perfect.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal customer for life.  </li>
            <li>Super drying.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it too much and leaves it feeling clean, no feeling of residue.</li>
            <li>There really is no compare to this product that I have successfully found.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Most soaps are too dry for me, or the perfumes are overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time my face felt clean</li>
            <li>However this cleanser can&#x27;t wash my light make-up off (my sana cleanser does).It foams very well</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the soft, velvety foam</li>
            <li>This foam is incredible and costs just as much as American products found in the local stores.  </li>
            <li>This foam is incredible and costs just as much as American products found in the local stores.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I must say, I love how soft this foam makes my skin~</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather, and cleans deeply.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, using a little bit of the foam is very effective in clearing sebaceous filaments and restoring smoothness and softness to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Shiseido customer and love foaming cleaners in general.</li>
            <li>If you have acne prone skin, I would probably recommend something else, but if you have sensitive skin and need or simply like something that is really gentle, this cleanser does a great job at being foamy and making your skin quite literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for this cleanser not washing out makeup like the top review here, but I can say that it clears out oil and dirt really well, and it leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial washer: clean, non-dry and affordable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried other cream cleanser and it is just not as good as a gel cleaner,  for my skin type.</li>
            <li>the consistency is so unique, it really is very &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34;, almost bouncy when you apply it on your skin</li>
            <li>no where is it right now...</li>
            <li>goes on creamy and foams up right away.</li>
            <li>This is SO gentle but leaves my face really clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who wants a very clean and glowing skin</li>
            <li>, the smell is so mild and refreshing ... makes cleaning my face such a treat !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective for the second step in double cleansing, but probably better for oily skin types.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of face wash from the U.S., China, Japan and other Asian countries, this one is the best fit so far.</li>
            <li>It does the amazing job and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li>I always follow this wash with a good moisturizer and my skin is cleaner, clearer, and less prone to breakouts than before.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle about a year ago, and I am only now buying the second one, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>good toner would remove that instantly of course but at the end of the day, when I dont want to do the full clean/tone/moisturise routine - feeling sticky but soft isnt high on my list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont purchase again</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance but a bit strong for what I usually prefer.</li>
            <li>It creates a very dense foam that is soft, fluffy, and feels wonderful when gently rubbed onto the face.  </li>
            <li>also, the delivery is very fast.</li>
            <li>The foam is rich and smooth, it&#x27;s the third bottle I used, I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of buying a special net, I just snipped a square off of my cheap dollar store loofa.</li>
            <li>Although not sure if this is really Shiseido brand, the cleanser is great.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is the most moisturizing cleanser I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I actually got more acne.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my oil cleansing method which has worked better for me and have kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>I did exactly this, for 3-5 minutes, and it did take a while.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on face and the tube is long lasting.</li>
            <li>no allergic reaction whatsoever (very, very safe for sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t strip essential oils from your face</li>
            <li>This is the first time that i tried this cleanser</li>
            <li>but since I have gotten this and using it almost daily it has kept my skin nice and smooth; although not younger.    </li>
            <li>it works very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>What I really love about this cleanser is how foamy it gets with just a teeny tiny amount in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I love asian skincare, so of course I had to try this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break me out, but there are definitely better asian facewashes out there!</li>
            <li>I top it off with my daily moisturizer, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I haven&#x27;t broke out since.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this product, i found it via Refinery29.</li>
            <li>Bought for my teenager and seems to work ok and not drying but the directions are in Japanese.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a pea size amount to cover most of your face.</li>
            <li>The skin feels clean, nice, not tight or dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s possible this may not be ideal for oily skin, but for normal to dry</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for someone who wants to find a unique face wash.</li>
            <li>Its also great since it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>Its a good product, it really cleans but its a little drying.</li>
            <li>However, this is only good if you don&#x27;t wear makeup or remove your makeup prior to washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sensitive, light skin whole life.</li>
            <li>mean, I will still use my Clean &amp; Clear morning gel pumps for daily wash, but this one is perfect for my nighttime wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is super sensitive, but this burned!</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and smooth, not overly dry, but still satisfyingly clean.</li>
            <li>Squeeze Shiseido Perfect Whip like a coffee bean size on a wet foaming net then squeeze the foam off the net.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty gentle</li>
            <li>Ya pretty much know what to do.  </li>
            <li>and it actually takes off all of my makeup, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I read that you are supposed to put a dime sized about in the dry palm of one hand, and with the other hand, start rubbing in a circular motion for a couple minutes, then add some drops of water to the product, rub some more, add a couple more drops, rub some more, for several minutes, then it because a large ball of foam.</li>
            <li>softer and more moisture, not too dry like another products I had</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the commercial, trying to make the product into a foam is not an easy task.</li>
            <li>If you are new to Asain skincare and want to start small, I highly recommend buying this here at a great price.</li>
            <li>Maybe this face wash is more suitable for occasional use - maybe for the middle of summer/hot weather when your face gets extra oily</li>
            <li>The good thing is, you only need to use a teeny tiny amount and the cleanser will create an incredibly rich lather, and doesnt dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle daily cleanser free of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>or maybe i am just being frugal with how much i use.</li>
            <li>But anyhow, i really like the end results.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this for people with combination skin</li>
            <li>I like the texture, foam, very creamy</li>
            <li>Tried this and it works really well.</li>
            <li>and this works really well on me.</li>
            <li>but it lathered very well with my face brush.</li>
            <li>Even a dime size amount of the product is way too much for one use.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to shiseido Ibuku cream.</li>
            <li>It foams really well</li>
            <li>The foam is what really helps get rid of the dirt, make up, and blackheads so it gives it time to uproot them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I needed something that was gentle yet cleaned my skin thoroughly of makeup and dirt.  </li>
            <li>After almost 6 months of use, my skin just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and began exhibiting irritation (too much stinging, redness)</li>
            <li>This has never broken me out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes my make up very</li>
            <li>but once you add water it foams up really well</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>, it cleans my face very well too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, at least this is the real one.</li>
            <li>not the way as I&#x27;ve expected, but it is still a good cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li>The lather is nice and rich and you only need a little product.  </li>
            <li>This is such a unique and gentle way of washing your face.  </li>
            <li>This is such a unique and gentle way of washing your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thick even when foamy, which is great(!)</li>
            <li>Have been using it for the past six months and still absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I only need a pea size amount for my face and neck and it rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve been using for a decade to clean all the make-up residue with foaming net/bubble maker.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for someone waiting a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>(if you use the foam net right)&lt;br /&gt;- foam rinses away clean without residue&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive, mostly to Sodium Laurel Sulfate.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite face wash for sensitive Asian skin!</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than other products such as Lancôme eye make-up remover or toner and it works even better!</li>
            <li>It is also strong enough to remover most of my makeup, I just have to go over my eyelids a little if I&#x27;ve got eyeliner on!</li>
            <li>I use it after my black oil face wash and it makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I have slightly oily skin, and after using this product for about a week I noticed that my face was definitely more radiant.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price for an outstanding daily facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>so a tiny pea-sized amount is more than enough.</li>
            <li>Love Shiseido products, especially those made for the Japanese market.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product from reading the reviews, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in using this product for a month.  </li>
            <li>Just like the Shiseido I buy at high end stores at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans</li>
            <li>Needless to say rubbing Perfect Whip in my hands does create a nice, thick lather of foam, so it is not imperative to use a net.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I use the Lucido moisturizing lotion, which is another product I highly recommend for guys to go along with a face wash like this.</li>
            <li>Add little drips of water as you work the cream in the palm to create the more foam bubbles.    </li>
            <li>It forms a huge blob of thick, creamy, and dense foam which you then use to clean your face with.  </li>
            <li>a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The results are a clean and soft skin free of residues.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was too harsh, but then I started to really appreciate the clean feeling that it gives.</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I am oily skin, it wash my face so deeply clean and not too dry.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so soft and gentle</li>
            <li>It gently removes eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling refreshed but NOT dried out.  </li>
            <li>They are cheap and when you rub a pea-size amount of this mixed with a splash of water, the result is  a very dense foam, similar to shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfectly clean but leaves my normal skin a bit dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Clean well without dry.</li>
            <li>I literally feel squeaky clean afterwards, but never stripped of oils or too dry.</li>
            <li>It was fun to lather it up and apply it like how the japanese actress Aoi Miyazaki did it in youtube.</li>
            <li>but it also gets dried out by many products that help control the oil.</li>
            <li>Just using a little bit, you can make a lot of foam and the foam is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>if not less, it really is foamliscious) and the one 120g tube has lasted me months.  </li>
            <li>honestly I won&#x27;t use any other face wash as long as I live.</li>
            <li>my new favourite cleanser.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It only take a tiny 1/2 pea sized dollop to make a huge amount of foamy cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am taking off a star because upon further reflection, I really don&#x27;t think that you should HAVE to take this much time for a face wash to work as intended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin and foam cleansers usually don&#x27;t have a good relationship, but this cleanser is a whole other story.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it!..</li>
            <li>It cleans pretty well, but no well enough.  </li>
            <li>The one other cleanser I&#x27;ve been able to use was Cetaphil, but that didn&#x27;t do nearly the job this does on actually removing dirt and oils from my face.</li>
            <li>At first, this face wash definitely helped clear some of my acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the consistency of this product that wins it its gold stars--never a too dry or too oily day again.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin with occasional break outs here and there</li>
            <li>I use a pea-sized amount in a lathering net and that&#x27;s more than enough for my whole face, neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders (all areas that my skin is really sensitive).</li>
            <li>You can whip it in your hands to a thick whipped cream consistency, if you&#x27;re not sure you can youtube the shiseido perfect whip commercial.</li>
            <li>I quickly change back to my Neutrogena deep cleaning GEL face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thick and rich, but doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li>It takes very little of this product to clean my whole face.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I have super sensitive, combination, Japanese-American skin, but I also live in both dry Colorado and humid Georgia.  </li>
            <li>This is great during the winter when the cold and wind dries up your skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin squeeky clean and a bit dry.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear everything since a lot my acne is hormonal and stress-driven.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t protect you from break outs and it doesn&#x27;t clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I am nowhere near finishing it any time soon.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Touching my face after using it, my skin feels beautifully soft</li>
            <li>And this stuff foams in epic proportion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have allergies or sensitive skin, but this just didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li>Very formy but haven&#x27;t used enough to grade.</li>
            <li>They may be just squeezing it straight from the tube and using it like that without trying to foam it, and it may not work the same if you do that.</li>
            <li>seconds&lt;br /&gt;- very affordable compared to American brands of face cleaners</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is believed that rubbing the face too much will disturb the natural structure of the skin, hence, the amount of foam created to avoid touching and irritating one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Wow, I just wrote an essay on face wash</li>
            <li>Gentle enough and gives you an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(St Ives, Biore, Neutragena) didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And.....I like how my face feels afterward; smoot and soft, not dried out and thirsty.</li>
            <li>i waas able to double wash with this and did not get tight and dried out, but it felt clean.</li>
            <li>and I finally picked it up at a Japanese market in Chicago at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>It removes all my makeup, including mascara and leaves my skin soft and clean, but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>, I never got the foam to whip up as insanely awesome as the commercial shows it to (definitely YouTube the commercial), which was slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li>At fist I was impressed by how thick the lather was and how little of the product you had to use to wash your whole face, but after rinsing and drying my skin felt tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>Not too dry and too wet, and it has comfortable bubble.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of natural moisture, my face never feels dry or scratchy anymore...</li>
            <li>It was fun in the beginning, but afterwards, I merely want to cleanse my skin easily.</li>
            <li>but the texture allows it to sink deep enough into skin to really cleanse thoroughly and clear away any makeup etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product in their line--and I have tried plain tap water alone, and both of those have managed to dry my face out on occasion, which I was honestly OK with.</li>
            <li>you can experience that feel clean and clear with a small amount of this cleansing.</li>
            <li>But it will last a long time since a tiny bit cleans the whole face very well</li>
            <li>It removed dirt and oils with only a small amount and makes my face feel so clean afterwards!</li>
            <li>You only need a pea-size in you palm and work out the bubbles .. and it will foam up enough to cover up the whole face and neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am polish/russian descent, 21, combination/dry with mild ac trouble and this combination has improved my skin visibly in one day.</li>
            <li>you can wash your face with a little cream, but I don&#x27;t think it can make deep clean.</li>
            <li>I only have to use a tiny amount and it makes my oily skin look less oily without stripping it and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might sting a little the first few times you use it, but it makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>You only need a very small amount, it builds into a thick foam that covers the entir e face, and the scent is light and lovely.</li>
            <li>So smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount to clean your face and my skin feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients and the high pH are enough factors for those with acne-prone skin to avoid such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a really cheap and common cleansing foam at drugstores in Japan.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny dab does it and the foaming action and lather</li>
            <li>It creates massive and soft foam that cleans all the make-up residue.</li>
            <li>Designed for Asian sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When I use witch hazel afterwards, it barely, if at all, takes off any dirt from my face.</li>
            <li>Unlike other soaps I&#x27;ve used, it does not leave my face feeling tight and rubbery but soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, this cleanser is fabulously foamy, but just because it is foamy, doesn&#x27;t mean it is removing impurities.  </li>
            <li>This foaming cleanser is wonderfully unique in that it puffs up like a thick shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I have combination oily skin and live in a dry, dessert climate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Asian chick with oily skin, and I love how this product sucks the oil out of my face after I wash it, but also doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>you have dry skin, I suggest that you don&#x27;t dry your face too quickly but let it air dry</li>
            <li>This wash does not dry my skin and will remove all traces of makeup with one wash.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and my skin feels moisturized and never dry after this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little drying, but if you use a moisturizer afterwards this works really well!</li>
            <li>/wet my face at my sink for a few seconds first.</li>
            <li>The only downside that comes to mind is the tiny bubbles create a slightly slimy feel that was off-putting at first.</li>
            <li>The smell is not good but not bad, and not extremely</li>
            <li>Take clear of all the dirt, makeup etc and your skin doesnt feel dry after</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need that much product (less than a dime size) and you will over-foam.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry, instead, it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having to add a small amount of water to make it foam, then add more onto my face during lathering to keep it foamy and light made it awkward to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It foams really well when i use that little japanese sponge pouch.</li>
            <li>The consistency was a little strange at first</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome Shiseido facewash at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I like the Perfect Whip cleanser.  </li>
            <li> i purchased the perfect whip along with perfect senganseka cleansing oil, hada labo hyluronic gokujyn lotion, innisfree no sebum pact, laneige water sleeping, and mizon snail recovery gel lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great for me!</li>
            <li> but they just didn&#x27;t compare to Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li> I never change it, because its just too perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly in combination with the Clarisonic Brush.  </li>
            <li> This face wash is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but I must say that I was truly impressed with the quality of this wash.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!</li>

            <li> Great!</li>
            <li> (if you haven&#x27;t yet, go search youtube for &amp;#34;Shiseido Perfect Whip commercial&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Until I found Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li> I tend to use Bioderma and Kose Cleansing Oil to remove makeup and cleanse, but this is awesome!</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> Very nicely foaming cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> very good!!!  </li>
            <li> Really Great Foaming Cleanser!!</li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> The best way to use the Perfect Whip is lather the cream into a foam before apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> The best way to foam</li>
            <li> I even like the name, Perfect Whip.  </li>
            <li> You can buy without fears, because Perfect Whip will change your life.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift this time around for my best friend to try.</li>
            <li> However, it was very pleasant to use</li>
            <li> This face was has been ideal in controlling oil without over-drying.</li>
            <li> Happy, Happy!</li>
            <li> When there is a good amount just apply the foam bubble to your face and lather it in and then rinse!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works beautifully with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> and this clears up my face beautifully.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful, lasts forever</li>
            <li> i am in love with everything on the list, and perfect whip is especially enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I love Shiseido products but they&#x27;re often a bit out of my price range, so their Perfect Whip is perfect for my budget.</li>
            <li> feels great on my face...  </li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great product.</li>
            <li> Great price as well.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it that great of a product as others did.</li>
            <li> Great product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Feels great.</li>
            <li> What a great product!er for life.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizing whip face cream wash.</li>
            <li> Once you rinse your face, it does a great job taking all the oils off of your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this to wash my face after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup with a cleansing oil, and I feel like it does a great job at removing all of the residual product.</li>
            <li> This product is good and the customer service is also good!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this face wash! !</li>
            <li> Very good product, love it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> it foams up really nicely, is dense and creamy, and made me feel squeaky clean--but that was the problem!</li>
            <li> It does have a scent, but to me it is pleasant and not over-bearing.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> In addition, the Perfect Whip has a pleasant, light smell when it foams up.</li>
            <li> [The Face Shop] Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to wash my face.</li>
            <li> the price is also fair.</li>
            <li> will repurchase, good value.</li>
            <li> Really nice product!!!The foam are great</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> This had good ratings</li>
            <li> It works surprising well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It gets good reviews on this site and others but when I tried it myself</li>
            <li> nicely feels great wish</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good all</li>
            <li> I loved this face wash for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> By then, I had probably used up a good 50%+ of the tube.</li>
            <li> but it still good</li>
            <li> when comes to this good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a good Shiseido Face wash, because I still have whiteheads a lot of them.  </li>
            <li> This is best for people who don&#x27;t suffer from breakouts and want a squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li> you just need a peas size on your face to make a great wash, very smooth and  shiseido makes it so it is really good.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap but really good!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> an aside, I love how affordable this stuff is!</li>
            <li> I love how this cleanser leaves your skin feeling!</li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser !  </li>
            <li> and i have to say that i love it!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I love how foamy this cleanser gets!</li>
            <li> Lol.. anyway,  I was quite hesitant to use the product since I tend to break out easily.</li>
            <li> As a guy who has had skin problems and tried dozens of different face cleansers all my life, I can say Perfect Whip is easily one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> though this is nothing particularly amazing, the oil and whip get the job done well.</li>
            <li> you get is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cleanser, before I had been using proactive which has microbeads, but I never felt like it truly cleaned out all the oil and dirt off my face</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> I really liked this until I found out</li>
            <li> and I liked</li>
            <li> It cleans my face nicely.</li>
            <li> I am just loving with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and it cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I have saw so many good reviews</li>
            <li> 1st time buyer, great product, after usage, feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of voodoo magic Japan puts in it&#x27;s skincare products, but it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Great gentle but effective cleanser!  </li>
            <li> Amazing couldn&#x27;t be more happy if I tried with this product my skin feels amazing and clean when I wash and is helpful to oily skin like my husbands.</li>
            <li> It washes off very easily and does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does foam very easily</li>
            <li> It has a very nice light almost baby powder like smell to it which I just love.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is more akin to a toothpaste than a foam, and I&#x27;m being kind.  </li>
            <li> Great face wash worth every penny.</li>
            <li> skin is sensitive, so I tend to wash my face in the morning with water and use the Perfect Whip at night during shower.</li>
            <li> I would probably re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my full review here if you want!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combination of strong and gentle for my skin.  </li>
            <li> perfect whip is a pleasant, soft, and mild cleansing foam.</li>
            <li> recommended to anyone needing a good and inexpensive product to clean their face,</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t own a bath poof, or a net for the Perfect Whip, this is what I resort to.</li>
            <li> I liked this cleanser pretty good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser atm</li>
            <li> Coconut Oil works better for me.</li>
            <li> I have a combo skin type,  more oily.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the product as well as the speed of shipping.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> OK, this is THE MOST foamiest cleansers I have EVER come across.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Clinique girl most my life</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t quite get the same foam as the ads but the cleansing power is superb.</li>
            <li> I love Shiseido product.</li>
            <li> and I love this face soap.</li>
            <li> It can get even the most stubborn makeup (I&#x27;m talking lime crime velvetines here) off of my face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me more acne, but it also didn&#x27;t do a thorough job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> This product will perform a lot better with foaming net/bubble maker.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this...</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the texture/consistency of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> There are much better cleansers you can use with more beneficial ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alright so I read all of the reviews and did more research online as well.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Most cleansers have a pH between 4-6.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered my second bottle and am happy with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> With this price there is a lot more options out there for me to choose.</li>
            <li> safe to use twice a day after makeup at night, and before makeup in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing and cleans without harming your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing and cleans without harming your skin.  </li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this! :D</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m already thinking about ordering more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It did its job as a face wash, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to order again.</li>
            <li> have not found anythig better than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture of it is more like a lotion</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Despite this, it&#x27;s definitely the best foam cleanser I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> Fantastic face wash!</li>
            <li> In my hours of research I found out there was actually a technique in using the Perfect Whip!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my face look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Not too sure how it is as an anti-acne product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how this lathers and rinses.</li>
            <li> bought many times, still useful&lt;</li>
            <li> love love love........</li>
            <li> I am breakout prone, so I like to make sure all makeup/dirt is removed from my face before bed.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product several times from toy shop japan hobbyone, great seller!</li>
            <li> and I need something more soothing.</li>
            <li> This will probably work better on greasy/oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now, and I love the smell and the foamy feeling on my face</li>
            <li> I love the application and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect step if you use the double cleanse method (or even if you don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> This is like cetaphil but better.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product it foams up very very nicely which is my favorite part of this product</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this item</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives very rich form.</li>
            <li> very rich lather.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of making my face feel squeaky clean without my fingers ever even touching the skin because the foam is so rich, but it isn&#x27;t the best for my skin because I get pretty frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am a male in my 30&#x27;s and have gone through my fair share of face washes and by far I am loving the Perfect Whip.</li>
            <li> It gets your face very clean without over drying.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin very clean.</li>
            <li> Feels very clean after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s mild but effective cleaning the face.</li>
            <li> product is awesome for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff amazing, it is light, easy to go on and east to lather, easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> There is a nice mild scent but no chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My face is always squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> After you wash it off your face feels really clean!</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> It foams up well and it takes off all my oils (squeaky clean!)</li>
            <li> Leaves my fave squeaky clean literally!</li>
            <li> Skin feel great fresh and moist after use, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin and this in addition to Stri-Dex Medicated Pads, Sensitive has greatly helped improve my skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first Shiseido item I used, and I am very impressed with the quality of their products so far.</li>
            <li> However, Shiseido Perfect Whip made my eyes burn even though I was careful not to get any of it in my eyes or even close to them.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t take the natural oils off of my face.</li>
            <li> Good product, Very concentrated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and works really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- easy to use and creates foam within</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really clean my skin, but maybe fits oil skin better.</li>
            <li> It has a soft feeling to it, smell is nice, and leaves your skin feeling nice and</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is way too strong to put on your face.</li>
            <li> But this one is the most gentle and effective on my skin type.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different face washes for around 10 dollars, but this one is certainly the best face wash I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li> The experience of using it is so pleasant that I&#x27;m tempted to use it on days I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup and would normally just use a light oil cleanse.r</li>
            <li> understand that there is a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; with this, and that is fine.  </li>
            <li> However, does not work too well on black heads but makeup removal and cleaning of pores is great!</li>
            <li> I can use this cleanser in the morning and it seems fine, however I can&#x27;t use it at night.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use it, but so much cheaper and better than anything else on the market!</li>
            <li> i heard a lot good command on this product but it kind a bit dry after wash your face</li>
            <li> The tiniest amount makes a huge lather.</li>
            <li> I use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil before using this, which is great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim...  Needed something else in the cart to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> This an extremely gentle soap but by itself I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> but when you pair it with a clarisonic or a foam scrubby, it really does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is wash with this and use a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> The smell is lightly soapy, kinda meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never have to exfoliate after this soap because it cleans my pores so well and rinses off nicely (definitely use a moisturizer after); it would be a great post-workout cleanser.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irrita my skin, leaves face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great if you want that fresh into puberty look, but this cleanser leaves my skin clean and soft without taking all the moisture.</li>
            <li> so fast!!!</li>
            <li> Generat rich foam</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a huge range of American drugstore cleansers and this handily outpaces them at all at a lower price than most.</li>
            <li> When the Perfect Whip arrived I went straight to test it out and without much thought I squeeze the cream onto my hands and started applying it directly to my face.</li>
            <li> At first, I enjoyed using this facewash...</li>
            <li> Great product just a pea size goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean without drying.</li>
            <li> This stuff clean me well, and it help brighten my skin.</li>
            <li> In general, it is a pretty great cleanser.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> By god, does it clean.</li>
            <li> and my face felt really clean after use.</li>
            <li> no scent, just smells clean</li>
            <li> It smells clean but not perfume-y</li>
            <li> Honestly the most moisturizing facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin clean and removes all the make-up.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used better products for a real squeaky clean</li>
            <li> Clean without drying, reasonable price, love this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone looking for the perfect foamy facial cleanser that is very gentle on face.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle on the skin, great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Sweet baby jesus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that foamy, but it eels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this face wash will be a good for basic make-up removal/</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a good cleanser to begin with, now that I&#x27;ve accumulated enough information about my skin preferences.</li>
            <li> changed it to 3 stars - &amp;#34;Its okay&amp;#34; because it really is just okay.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> I always read such good reviews for Shiseido, so I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to like this, but am very taken aback at how much I LOVE it -</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> It smells really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nothing gets my face feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily as a light-duty cleanser for several weeks - and for me, it is truly perfect.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal customer for life.  </li>
            <li> Super drying.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it too much and leaves it feeling clean, no feeling of residue.</li>
            <li> There really is no compare to this product that I have successfully found.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Most soaps are too dry for me, or the perfumes are overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time my face felt clean</li>
            <li> However this cleanser can&#x27;t wash my light make-up off (my sana cleanser does).It foams very well</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the soft, velvety foam</li>
            <li> This foam is incredible and costs just as much as American products found in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> This foam is incredible and costs just as much as American products found in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I must say, I love how soft this foam makes my skin~</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather, and cleans deeply.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, using a little bit of the foam is very effective in clearing sebaceous filaments and restoring smoothness and softness to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Shiseido customer and love foaming cleaners in general.</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone skin, I would probably recommend something else, but if you have sensitive skin and need or simply like something that is really gentle, this cleanser does a great job at being foamy and making your skin quite literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for this cleanser not washing out makeup like the top review here, but I can say that it clears out oil and dirt really well, and it leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial washer: clean, non-dry and affordable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cream cleanser and it is just not as good as a gel cleaner,  for my skin type.</li>
            <li> the consistency is so unique, it really is very &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34;, almost bouncy when you apply it on your skin</li>
            <li> no where is it right now...</li>
            <li> goes on creamy and foams up right away.</li>
            <li> This is SO gentle but leaves my face really clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who wants a very clean and glowing skin</li>
            <li> , the smell is so mild and refreshing ... makes cleaning my face such a treat !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective for the second step in double cleansing, but probably better for oily skin types.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of face wash from the U.S., China, Japan and other Asian countries, this one is the best fit so far.</li>
            <li> It does the amazing job and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> I always follow this wash with a good moisturizer and my skin is cleaner, clearer, and less prone to breakouts than before.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle about a year ago, and I am only now buying the second one, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> good toner would remove that instantly of course but at the end of the day, when I dont want to do the full clean/tone/moisturise routine - feeling sticky but soft isnt high on my list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont purchase again</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but a bit strong for what I usually prefer.</li>
            <li> It creates a very dense foam that is soft, fluffy, and feels wonderful when gently rubbed onto the face.  </li>
            <li> also, the delivery is very fast.</li>
            <li> The foam is rich and smooth, it&#x27;s the third bottle I used, I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of buying a special net, I just snipped a square off of my cheap dollar store loofa.</li>
            <li> Although not sure if this is really Shiseido brand, the cleanser is great.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is the most moisturizing cleanser I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I actually got more acne.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my oil cleansing method which has worked better for me and have kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I did exactly this, for 3-5 minutes, and it did take a while.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on face and the tube is long lasting.</li>
            <li> no allergic reaction whatsoever (very, very safe for sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t strip essential oils from your face</li>
            <li> This is the first time that i tried this cleanser</li>
            <li> but since I have gotten this and using it almost daily it has kept my skin nice and smooth; although not younger.    </li>
            <li> it works very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> What I really love about this cleanser is how foamy it gets with just a teeny tiny amount in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I love asian skincare, so of course I had to try this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out, but there are definitely better asian facewashes out there!</li>
            <li> I top it off with my daily moisturizer, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I haven&#x27;t broke out since.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product, i found it via Refinery29.</li>
            <li> Bought for my teenager and seems to work ok and not drying but the directions are in Japanese.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a pea size amount to cover most of your face.</li>
            <li> The skin feels clean, nice, not tight or dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible this may not be ideal for oily skin, but for normal to dry</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for someone who wants to find a unique face wash.</li>
            <li> Its also great since it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, it really cleans but its a little drying.</li>
            <li> However, this is only good if you don&#x27;t wear makeup or remove your makeup prior to washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sensitive, light skin whole life.</li>
            <li> mean, I will still use my Clean &amp; Clear morning gel pumps for daily wash, but this one is perfect for my nighttime wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is super sensitive, but this burned!</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and smooth, not overly dry, but still satisfyingly clean.</li>
            <li> Squeeze Shiseido Perfect Whip like a coffee bean size on a wet foaming net then squeeze the foam off the net.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty gentle</li>
            <li> Ya pretty much know what to do.  </li>
            <li> and it actually takes off all of my makeup, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I read that you are supposed to put a dime sized about in the dry palm of one hand, and with the other hand, start rubbing in a circular motion for a couple minutes, then add some drops of water to the product, rub some more, add a couple more drops, rub some more, for several minutes, then it because a large ball of foam.</li>
            <li> softer and more moisture, not too dry like another products I had</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the commercial, trying to make the product into a foam is not an easy task.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Asain skincare and want to start small, I highly recommend buying this here at a great price.</li>
            <li> Maybe this face wash is more suitable for occasional use - maybe for the middle of summer/hot weather when your face gets extra oily</li>
            <li> The good thing is, you only need to use a teeny tiny amount and the cleanser will create an incredibly rich lather, and doesnt dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle daily cleanser free of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> or maybe i am just being frugal with how much i use.</li>
            <li> But anyhow, i really like the end results.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this for people with combination skin</li>
            <li> I like the texture, foam, very creamy</li>
            <li> Tried this and it works really well.</li>
            <li> and this works really well on me.</li>
            <li> but it lathered very well with my face brush.</li>
            <li> Even a dime size amount of the product is way too much for one use.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to shiseido Ibuku cream.</li>
            <li> It foams really well</li>
            <li> The foam is what really helps get rid of the dirt, make up, and blackheads so it gives it time to uproot them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I needed something that was gentle yet cleaned my skin thoroughly of makeup and dirt.  </li>
            <li> After almost 6 months of use, my skin just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and began exhibiting irritation (too much stinging, redness)</li>
            <li> This has never broken me out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes my make up very</li>
            <li> but once you add water it foams up really well</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> , it cleans my face very well too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, at least this is the real one.</li>
            <li> not the way as I&#x27;ve expected, but it is still a good cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li> The lather is nice and rich and you only need a little product.  </li>
            <li> This is such a unique and gentle way of washing your face.  </li>
            <li> This is such a unique and gentle way of washing your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick even when foamy, which is great(!)</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past six months and still absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I only need a pea size amount for my face and neck and it rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve been using for a decade to clean all the make-up residue with foaming net/bubble maker.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for someone waiting a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> (if you use the foam net right)&lt;br /&gt;- foam rinses away clean without residue&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive, mostly to Sodium Laurel Sulfate.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face wash for sensitive Asian skin!</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than other products such as Lancôme eye make-up remover or toner and it works even better!</li>
            <li> It is also strong enough to remover most of my makeup, I just have to go over my eyelids a little if I&#x27;ve got eyeliner on!</li>
            <li> I use it after my black oil face wash and it makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin, and after using this product for about a week I noticed that my face was definitely more radiant.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price for an outstanding daily facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> so a tiny pea-sized amount is more than enough.</li>
            <li> Love Shiseido products, especially those made for the Japanese market.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product from reading the reviews, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in using this product for a month.  </li>
            <li> Just like the Shiseido I buy at high end stores at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans</li>
            <li> Needless to say rubbing Perfect Whip in my hands does create a nice, thick lather of foam, so it is not imperative to use a net.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I use the Lucido moisturizing lotion, which is another product I highly recommend for guys to go along with a face wash like this.</li>
            <li> Add little drips of water as you work the cream in the palm to create the more foam bubbles.    </li>
            <li> It forms a huge blob of thick, creamy, and dense foam which you then use to clean your face with.  </li>
            <li> a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The results are a clean and soft skin free of residues.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too harsh, but then I started to really appreciate the clean feeling that it gives.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I am oily skin, it wash my face so deeply clean and not too dry.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so soft and gentle</li>
            <li> It gently removes eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling refreshed but NOT dried out.  </li>
            <li> They are cheap and when you rub a pea-size amount of this mixed with a splash of water, the result is  a very dense foam, similar to shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfectly clean but leaves my normal skin a bit dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Clean well without dry.</li>
            <li> I literally feel squeaky clean afterwards, but never stripped of oils or too dry.</li>
            <li> It was fun to lather it up and apply it like how the japanese actress Aoi Miyazaki did it in youtube.</li>
            <li> but it also gets dried out by many products that help control the oil.</li>
            <li> Just using a little bit, you can make a lot of foam and the foam is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> if not less, it really is foamliscious) and the one 120g tube has lasted me months.  </li>
            <li> honestly I won&#x27;t use any other face wash as long as I live.</li>
            <li> my new favourite cleanser.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It only take a tiny 1/2 pea sized dollop to make a huge amount of foamy cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am taking off a star because upon further reflection, I really don&#x27;t think that you should HAVE to take this much time for a face wash to work as intended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin and foam cleansers usually don&#x27;t have a good relationship, but this cleanser is a whole other story.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it!..</li>
            <li> It cleans pretty well, but no well enough.  </li>
            <li> The one other cleanser I&#x27;ve been able to use was Cetaphil, but that didn&#x27;t do nearly the job this does on actually removing dirt and oils from my face.</li>
            <li> At first, this face wash definitely helped clear some of my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the consistency of this product that wins it its gold stars--never a too dry or too oily day again.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin with occasional break outs here and there</li>
            <li> I use a pea-sized amount in a lathering net and that&#x27;s more than enough for my whole face, neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders (all areas that my skin is really sensitive).</li>
            <li> You can whip it in your hands to a thick whipped cream consistency, if you&#x27;re not sure you can youtube the shiseido perfect whip commercial.</li>
            <li> I quickly change back to my Neutrogena deep cleaning GEL face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and rich, but doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue.</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this product to clean my whole face.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I have super sensitive, combination, Japanese-American skin, but I also live in both dry Colorado and humid Georgia.  </li>
            <li> This is great during the winter when the cold and wind dries up your skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin squeeky clean and a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear everything since a lot my acne is hormonal and stress-driven.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t protect you from break outs and it doesn&#x27;t clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I am nowhere near finishing it any time soon.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Touching my face after using it, my skin feels beautifully soft</li>
            <li> And this stuff foams in epic proportion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have allergies or sensitive skin, but this just didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> Very formy but haven&#x27;t used enough to grade.</li>
            <li> They may be just squeezing it straight from the tube and using it like that without trying to foam it, and it may not work the same if you do that.</li>
            <li> seconds&lt;br /&gt;- very affordable compared to American brands of face cleaners</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is believed that rubbing the face too much will disturb the natural structure of the skin, hence, the amount of foam created to avoid touching and irritating one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Wow, I just wrote an essay on face wash</li>
            <li> Gentle enough and gives you an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (St Ives, Biore, Neutragena) didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And.....I like how my face feels afterward; smoot and soft, not dried out and thirsty.</li>
            <li> i waas able to double wash with this and did not get tight and dried out, but it felt clean.</li>
            <li> and I finally picked it up at a Japanese market in Chicago at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> It removes all my makeup, including mascara and leaves my skin soft and clean, but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> , I never got the foam to whip up as insanely awesome as the commercial shows it to (definitely YouTube the commercial), which was slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> At fist I was impressed by how thick the lather was and how little of the product you had to use to wash your whole face, but after rinsing and drying my skin felt tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Not too dry and too wet, and it has comfortable bubble.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of natural moisture, my face never feels dry or scratchy anymore...</li>
            <li> It was fun in the beginning, but afterwards, I merely want to cleanse my skin easily.</li>
            <li> but the texture allows it to sink deep enough into skin to really cleanse thoroughly and clear away any makeup etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product in their line--and I have tried plain tap water alone, and both of those have managed to dry my face out on occasion, which I was honestly OK with.</li>
            <li> you can experience that feel clean and clear with a small amount of this cleansing.</li>
            <li> But it will last a long time since a tiny bit cleans the whole face very well</li>
            <li> It removed dirt and oils with only a small amount and makes my face feel so clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> You only need a pea-size in you palm and work out the bubbles .. and it will foam up enough to cover up the whole face and neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am polish/russian descent, 21, combination/dry with mild ac trouble and this combination has improved my skin visibly in one day.</li>
            <li> you can wash your face with a little cream, but I don&#x27;t think it can make deep clean.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a tiny amount and it makes my oily skin look less oily without stripping it and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might sting a little the first few times you use it, but it makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount, it builds into a thick foam that covers the entir e face, and the scent is light and lovely.</li>
            <li> So smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to clean your face and my skin feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients and the high pH are enough factors for those with acne-prone skin to avoid such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap and common cleansing foam at drugstores in Japan.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab does it and the foaming action and lather</li>
            <li> It creates massive and soft foam that cleans all the make-up residue.</li>
            <li> Designed for Asian sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I use witch hazel afterwards, it barely, if at all, takes off any dirt from my face.</li>
            <li> Unlike other soaps I&#x27;ve used, it does not leave my face feeling tight and rubbery but soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> , this cleanser is fabulously foamy, but just because it is foamy, doesn&#x27;t mean it is removing impurities.  </li>
            <li> This foaming cleanser is wonderfully unique in that it puffs up like a thick shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and live in a dry, dessert climate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian chick with oily skin, and I love how this product sucks the oil out of my face after I wash it, but also doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> you have dry skin, I suggest that you don&#x27;t dry your face too quickly but let it air dry</li>
            <li> This wash does not dry my skin and will remove all traces of makeup with one wash.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and my skin feels moisturized and never dry after this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying, but if you use a moisturizer afterwards this works really well!</li>
            <li> /wet my face at my sink for a few seconds first.</li>
            <li> The only downside that comes to mind is the tiny bubbles create a slightly slimy feel that was off-putting at first.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good but not bad, and not extremely</li>
            <li> Take clear of all the dirt, makeup etc and your skin doesnt feel dry after</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need that much product (less than a dime size) and you will over-foam.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry, instead, it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having to add a small amount of water to make it foam, then add more onto my face during lathering to keep it foamy and light made it awkward to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It foams really well when i use that little japanese sponge pouch.</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little strange at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not good either...</li>
            <li> /&gt;- much improvement on my overall skin tone (make a pale, even complexion)&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you apply the product properly (use only a small amount, lather, gently rub in circles on skin)</li>
            <li> I really like that a little goes a long way that tells me that it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> whaddaya know… when you put a small amount on your palm and lather it up (only need a little and you need to lather it a bit to unleash the true potential of this cleanser), you literally get a WHIP, as in whip cream.</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin slightly, but I don&#x27;t mind because I normally follow with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It cleans deep in my pores and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave residue at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, and if I had to hazard a guess, I would say this one single bottle will probably last me the rest of my life, and be passed down to my future children and grandchildren for a couple of generations before finally running out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, my skin is dry/normal, and it feels a bit tight and dehydrated after washing with this.</li>
            <li> B00LN2SFO2 Estone Simply Foaming Facial Body Face Cleansing Net Bubble Foam,Use Less Cleanser]]    </li>
            <li> Add just a dab and a little water and then agitate it to start the foaming action.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s always been sensitive to harsh soaps or things with fragrance.</li>
            <li> The consistency was still creamy for quite a long time, and I kept at it then after like 5 long minutes of this process it changed to a foamy texture.  </li>
            <li> (my skin leans towards the rough Irish genetics)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The smallest amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it also has a strong scent (a lot Japanese cleanser doesn&#x27;t contains any artificial fragrance and color) and as an oily skin person I don&#x27;t like the feeling after I used it.</li>
            <li> I can use a pea-sized amount between my palms, add a little bit of water, and it foams up enough to be used on my entire face and neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think one thing to keep in mind in other reviews on here is that not everyone could be using it properly.  </li>
            <li> You put just a tiny (and I mean tiny) pea-size smear on the net, trickle on some water, then scrub the net between your hands.  </li>
            <li> I have stubborn, combination, acne-prone skin, and I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for...far too long!</li>
            <li> I use a make-up remover nightly regardless, so this is a very minor consequence for me.  </li>
            <li> Or you would apply a small amount onto the center of the palm of one hand, then add some drips of water and using the fingers of your other hand, smart using circular motions to smear the cream to create foam.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin it may be a bit too dry.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry my face out</li>
            <li> so dry after i washed my face with it</li>
            <li> and before your face gets dry, apply face toner and moisturizer to keep the moisture in.</li>
            <li> Make my face dry</li>
            <li> I have mostly dry skin, but oily on my nose/chin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> works well in humid weather, but in dry weather you must follow up immediately with toner + serums&lt;</li>
            <li> Before, my skin would break out because it was so dry</li>
            <li> Removes my makeup but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin</li>
            <li> My face feel really dry and itchy after using it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t work with dry skin might dry you out.</li>
            <li> I am Asian, fair-skinned, combination skin, acne prone (whiteheads and occasional cyst acne), and I put on make-up (CC Cream &amp; Power Compact) everyday.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this process every single day till I get the hang of it, and I will update this review accordingly.  </li>
            <li> it off wasn&#x27;t easy either as I had to keep washing several times as there was an unpleasant sticky residue after cleansing</li>
            <li> so I brought this product, but I am kind of disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I like the slight scent and it hasnt aided in future breakouts.</li>
            <li> Only use a small amount to wash your face, and the product will last for a while.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I rarely buy Japanese stuff because the ads are very dramatic.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and acne prone, but it left my face feeling tight and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> you will only need a little to make a lot of foam.</li>
            <li> Item shipped WAY faster than time expected.</li>
            <li> I use a makeup wipe before and wipe off with wet makeup remover cloth ( also.purchased by Amazon) .</li>
            <li> Not as I expected.</li>
            <li> ingredients are listed in Japanese, which I have trouble reading (might need to look it up</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t foam up nearly as much as I&#x27;d expected it to when just using my hands.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, it was just silky and just smeared all over my face</li>
            <li> Saying &#x27;A little product goes a long way&#x27; with this is a bit of an understatement; a less than pea-size amount covers my entire face.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feeling of the foam on my face, even if I look silly doing it!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feeling of the foam on my face, even if I look silly doing it!  </li>
            <li> Just a pea-sized amount will provide a ridiculous amount of lather when you wash your face AND it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this soap.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Like all Shiseido&#x27;s cleansing foams, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have not felt a dry or tight feeling after cleansing with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> you might not want to use other products then.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with a multitude of facial washes in the past.  </li>
            <li> I received my item 2 weeks before it was expected to arrive from JAPAN!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> &quot; a particularly unfortunate breakout on my right jaw (half a dozen hormonal nasties).</li>
            <li> You might feel a little bit dry on your face after you wash with it</li>
            <li> Alas, I had to stop and find a new face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was fake since it was in non-Japanese writing, but it was extremely drying, and my face usually does not get dried out easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your average cleanser.</li>
            <li> Not soapy, not fresh or fruity.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a fairly thick white cream cleanser)</li>
            <li> because it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes or down my collar.</li>
            <li> helps keep oil levels down</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used it, acne and blemishes have gone down considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably did it wrong because it takes a while for me to actually have it foamy but not foamy enough to look like shaving cream...</li>
            <li> but i had to with my previous cleanser (cetaphil).</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight film on your face after you wash it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I usually use a toner with a cotton ball to wipe off the remnants of make up and with this, there was either minimal to no dirt left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ in other products!</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t shiny, tight, itchy, etc.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it lathers up so thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> 10- a strong base.  </li>
            <li> Smells like paint a little ?</li>
            <li> /&gt;- foam can get a little messy&lt;br</li>
            <li> It requires a little bit of work using the fingers and hands</li>
            <li> The bubbly, foamy process can be a little messy, so I would recommend using it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Even with a moisterizer it dried out my face.</li>
            <li> and she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a bit harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> foam is thick and creamy so it can stay on your face while you do other things.</li>
            <li> But sadly it was far too harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li> makeup, I usually wear just a little concealer and mascara.</li>
            <li> I even had small chemical burn on my chin after a few uses...</li>
            <li> It is also un-scented, a cream consistency which works well into a lather therefore requiring very little product.</li>
            <li> You need very little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how it compares to my usual Clarisonic cleanser, but I like it nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Usually foam cleansers strip my skin of moisture.</li>
            <li> When I become lazy and don&#x27;t use it, I start breaking out again.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t lather it enough, it will feel really gummy and nasty and may be hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> However, I found this product to be a little weak in washing off my make-up</li>
            <li> it had Ph too high :(</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of makeup.  </li>
            <li> like it, but late shippment</li>
            <li> This lasted me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> However, be careful to choose seller, and some of them might selling fake products.</li>
            <li> I hate cleansers, I have never finished a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> It comes out thick and lathers well, but my skin didn&#x27;t seem to have that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Thick, thick, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I mean beyond all their pseudo-scientific marketing stuffs…</li>
            <li> Seriously, squeeze just the tiniest dab in the palm of your hands, rub together, and cleanse.  </li>
            <li> I googled it and found it is not a good ingredient for acne prone, oily skin people like me.  </li>
            <li> To me, if there is still dirt or makeup residue on your face after cleansing, then that is not a good cleanser, which is why I don&#x27;t recommend this cleanser if you wear foundation, concealer, or powder.</li>
            <li> No good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shiseido products in the past but found them to be a bit expensive</li>
            <li> (Duh~!)    </li>
            <li> Of course I know how to use face wash but a teenaged boy was confused.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m assume that artificial lathering agents (SLS) are to blame for both the thick lather and drying nature of this product.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult to remove though.</li>
            <li> Confused!</li>
            <li> but then I figured I was doing something wrong, since the bottle came with no instructions and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It talks about &amp;#34;cushioning&amp;#34; your delicate face skin which I was a bit doubtful about, but</li>
            <li> im afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> This stuff foams up like crazy</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to wash off!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this out of curiosity, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong using Shiseido!!</li>
            <li> CAUSED TERRIBLE BREAKOUTS</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite cleanser atm</li>
            <li> I lost my package and I did not no where is it right now...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, at least this is the real one. I understand that here in US, the price is much more expensive than in Jp</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  Coconut Oil works better for me.</li>
            <li> SO i heard that its suppose to foam --- A LOT. I probably did it wrong because it takes a while for me to actually have it foamy but not foamy enough to look like shaving cream...or maybe i am just being frugal with how much i use. But anyhow, i really like the end results. My face is always squeaky clean! And after using the toner, i don&#x27;t find traces of dirt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your average cleanser.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with this stuff. Just a pea-sized amount will provide a ridiculous amount of lather when you wash your face AND it makes your skin so soft. I&#x27;m an Asian chick with oily skin, and I love how this product sucks the oil out of my face after I wash it, but also doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I&#x27;ve had the 120g tube for months and I am nowhere near finishing it any time soon. I&#x27;m never using another face wash brand again.</li>
            <li> Good product, Very concentrated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to wash my face. Not too dry and too wet, and it has comfortable bubble.</li>
            <li> feels great on my face...  the price is also fair.</li>
            <li> Generat rich foam and it&#x27;s mild but effective cleaning the face. The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Love this! Use with a foam net. Luxurious feel. Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. Love the soft, velvety foam so a little goes a long way. Rinses clean without drying. Nice fragrance but a bit strong for what I usually prefer.</li>
            <li> my go-to face wash. It gets your face very clean without over drying.</li>
            <li> Speedy deliver. Awesome Shiseido facewash at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this face wash! ! It reminds me of Japan. Lol.. anyway,  I was quite hesitant to use the product since I tend to break out easily. I have a combo skin type,  more oily. The product is like a cream thus within hours my skin oil up. It cause my skin to break out. I quickly change back to my Neutrogena deep cleaning GEL face wash. I have tried other cream cleanser and it is just not as good as a gel cleaner,  for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it after my black oil face wash and it makes my skin feel so smooth! I no longer have breakouts. I really recommend this for people with combination skin</li>
            <li> I like the Perfect Whip cleanser.  Use just a dab and mix with water and it creates a lot of foam for washing the face.  The skin feels clean, nice, not tight or dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> perfect whip is a pleasant, soft, and mild cleansing foam. i purchased the perfect whip along with perfect senganseka cleansing oil, hada labo hyluronic gokujyn lotion, innisfree no sebum pact, laneige water sleeping, and mizon snail recovery gel lotion. i am polish/russian descent, 21, combination/dry with mild ac trouble and this combination has improved my skin visibly in one day. i needed to step my skincare up, and i am overjoyed by all of the products i purchased because i have seen a difference in one day. i believe it has a lot to do with the lotions, as i am known to favor hyluronic acid and i do not doubt for a minute that the 74% snail mucin had basically healed and \\&quot;uninfected\\&quot; a particularly unfortunate breakout on my right jaw (half a dozen hormonal nasties). i am in love with everything on the list, and perfect whip is especially enjoyable. i waas able to double wash with this and did not get tight and dried out, but it felt clean. though this is nothing particularly amazing, the oil and whip get the job done well. will repurchase, good value.</li>
            <li> Really nice product!!!The foam are great</li>
            <li> Although not sure if this is really Shiseido brand, the cleanser is great.</li>
            <li> Just re-purchased this cleanser. Works great for me!</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and live in a dry, dessert climate. This face was has been ideal in controlling oil without over-drying. It is also un-scented, a cream consistency which works well into a lather therefore requiring very little product. Overall, I am very happy with the product as well as the speed of shipping.</li>
            <li> The foam is rich and smooth, it&#x27;s the third bottle I used, I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why there is a limit for number of words?</li>
            <li> I really liked this until I found out it had Ph too high :(</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality. Like it.</li>
            <li> you just need a peas size on your face to make a great wash, very smooth and  shiseido makes it so it is really good.</li>
            <li> It was okay. It was fun to lather it up and apply it like how the japanese actress Aoi Miyazaki did it in youtube. It left my skin squeeky clean and a bit dry. But it didn&#x27;t help with my acne. So I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> try to use it with a bubble maker. you might not want to use other products then.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this.  The consistency of this product is more akin to a toothpaste than a foam, and I&#x27;m being kind.  You could use it as caulking.</li>
            <li> OK, this is THE MOST foamiest cleansers I have EVER come across. You don&#x27;t even need that much product (less than a dime size) and you will over-foam. I love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for people who are not battling with acne, if you still get acne don&#x27;t expect this to help with that. Because it won&#x27;t. This is best for people who don&#x27;t suffer from breakouts and want a squeaky clean feel. Mind you I use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil before using this, which is great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works beautifully with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> I always use this face wash. I has combination skin. This stuff clean me well, and it help brighten my skin. Leave my skin very clean.</li>
            <li> This is my go to facial cleanser. I strayed and tried a couple (more expensive) brands but they just didn&#x27;t compare to Perfect Whip. I only need a pea size amount for my face and neck and it rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face wash for sensitive Asian skin! Used to break out a lot but this has cleared it all!</li>
            <li> I give this foaming cleanser 4 stars instead of 5 because of its lack of acne-fighting ability. In general, it is a pretty great cleanser. It does a great job of making my face feel squeaky clean without my fingers ever even touching the skin because the foam is so rich, but it isn&#x27;t the best for my skin because I get pretty frequent breakouts. If you have acne prone skin, I would probably recommend something else, but if you have sensitive skin and need or simply like something that is really gentle, this cleanser does a great job at being foamy and making your skin quite literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily as a light-duty cleanser for several weeks - and for me, it is truly perfect. I can use a pea-sized amount between my palms, add a little bit of water, and it foams up enough to be used on my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a washcloth to steam/wet my face at my sink for a few seconds first. It&#x27;s pretty thick even when foamy, which is great(!) because it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes or down my collar. I wash it off with a washcloth, and my skin immediately feels hydrated and dewy - it isn&#x27;t shiny, tight, itchy, etc. My skin&#x27;s always been sensitive to harsh soaps or things with fragrance. I follow this with gokujyn hyaluronic lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For makeup, I usually wear just a little concealer and mascara. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this to remove foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I love how affordable this stuff is! I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> CAUSED TERRIBLE BREAKOUTS&lt;br /&gt;I REGRET BUYING IT ...</li>
            <li> I love it. It leaves my face feeling very clean and soft. I don&#x27;t like the smell... It smells like chemicals. But as a warning, all of the directions are in Japanese! I had to watch a video to find out that you are supposed to rub it into a foam into your hands before applying it. A little bit goes a long way with this soap.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my favourite face wash for years. I never change it, because its just too perfect for me. I like the texture, foam, very creamy, I am oily skin, it wash my face so deeply clean and not too dry.</li>
            <li> It has a soft feeling to it, smell is nice, and leaves your skin feeling nice and clean!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price! Try it..you can never go wrong using Shiseido!!</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time my face felt clean</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price for an outstanding daily facial cleanser! This is a gentle daily cleanser free of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I have being using it for 4 days. It works perfectly in combination with the Clarisonic Brush.  You  will only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;The results are a clean and soft skin free of residues. So far, I like it!.. Happy, Happy!</li>
            <li> you can experience that feel clean and clear with a small amount of this cleansing.</li>
            <li> you can wash your face with a little cream, but I don&#x27;t think it can make deep clean. it doesn&#x27;t fit for me.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, it really cleans but its a little drying. Great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past six months and still absolutely love this product! It feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry it too much and leaves it feeling clean, no feeling of residue. I have acne-prone skin and this in addition to Stri-Dex Medicated Pads, Sensitive has greatly helped improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little bit goes a long way and it lathers up so thick and creamy. After you wash it off your face feels really clean! I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been a Clinique girl most my life but I must say that I was truly impressed with the quality of this wash. Just a tiny dab does it and the foaming action and lather you get is amazing. Removed all traces of makeup in one wash, including waterproof mascara. It leaves my skin silky smooth and soft. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype. In my opinion this is way too strong to put on your face. It strips everything off my skin, even if i slather my face in cleansing oil before. Sometimes I use it when I take a bath for my back and underarms. Doesn&#x27;t work for my face, but if you have oily skin go for it.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great product. It exceeded my expectations. It leaves your skin so clean and refreshed. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t quite get the same foam as the ads but the cleansing power is superb. Squeaky clean! If you have dry skin it may be a bit too dry. Moisturize well afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sent from the gods honestly I won&#x27;t use any other face wash as long as I live.</li>
            <li> like it, but late shippment</li>
            <li> This had good ratings so I looked forward to trying this cleanser..&lt;br /&gt;Touching my face after using it, my skin feels beautifully soft so 3 stars doesnt make sense but I&#x27;m not enthralled with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having to add a small amount of water to make it foam, then add more onto my face during lathering to keep it foamy and light made it awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing it off wasn&#x27;t easy either as I had to keep washing several times as there was an unpleasant sticky residue after cleansing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good toner would remove that instantly of course but at the end of the day, when I dont want to do the full clean/tone/moisturise routine - feeling sticky but soft isnt high on my list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont purchase again</li>
            <li> I love Shiseido product. you will only need a little to make a lot of foam. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Cleans makeup and dirt without overdrying.  Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is the most moisturizing cleanser I have ever tried.  It will keep your skin moisturized throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I love this face soap. I have used it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I got my face skin softer and more moisture, not too dry like another products I had used.&lt;br /&gt;JSYK, Whip no scrup.</li>
            <li> Sweet baby jesus. Let&#x27;s talk about this. It&#x27;s not that foamy, but it eels nice and soft. It smells really clean and fresh. Also, it cleans.  By god, does it clean. It can get even the most stubborn makeup (I&#x27;m talking lime crime velvetines here) off of my face. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my face out</li>
            <li> my new favourite cleanser. So smooth and a little goes a long way. Take clear of all the dirt, makeup etc and your skin doesnt feel dry after</li>
            <li> not the way as I&#x27;ve expected, but it is still a good cleanser for daily use. You might feel a little bit dry on your face after you wash with it (I have a combination skin type).</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Feels very clean after use. Just using a little bit, you can make a lot of foam and the foam is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Works well on oily skin!</li>
            <li> I had Shiseido White Lucent and my skin can&#x27;t take it and was having irritations. I used baby soap for years and now needs something a bit stronger. Tried this and it works really well. It foams up well and it takes off all my oils (squeaky clean!) The price is cheaper compared to Japanese Markets, I will continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li> My friend used this and I wanted to try it. It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> One of my holy grail products. Nothing gets my face feeling so clean and fresh and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes though that ish HURTS.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this works really well on me. I have to use an eye make up remover before using this cleanser to get my mascara off but i had to with my previous cleanser (cetaphil). It foams really well when i use that little japanese sponge pouch.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY cleanser that I use. I&#x27;ve been using this products for years. It does the amazing job and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little strange at first but it lathered very well with my face brush. The smell is not good but not bad, and not extremely strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have experimented with a multitude of facial washes in the past.  But this one is the most gentle and effective on my skin type.  I have slightly oily skin, and after using this product for about a week I noticed that my face was definitely more radiant.  It does have a scent, but to me it is pleasant and not over-bearing.  I use what looks like a mini loofah to create massive amounts of foam.  And this stuff foams in epic proportion.  I&#x27;ve found that the loofah helps create the micro-bubbles that penetrate deep into pores to cleanse within the skin.  It creates a very dense foam that is soft, fluffy, and feels wonderful when gently rubbed onto the face.  I use about a pea-sized amount every day (if not less, it really is foamliscious) and the one 120g tube has lasted me months.  The bubbly, foamy process can be a little messy, so I would recommend using it in the shower.  It washes off very easily and does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside with this facial wash is that it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup such as foundation or facial powder.  I use a make-up remover nightly regardless, so this is a very minor consequence for me.  But for others this may be a concern.  This was the first Shiseido item I used, and I am very impressed with the quality of their products so far.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this item but I didn&#x27;t find it that great of a product as others did. I have used this daily for almost two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am Asian, fair-skinned, combination skin, acne prone (whiteheads and occasional cyst acne), and I put on make-up (CC Cream &amp; Power Compact) everyday. I was hoping this face wash will be a good for basic make-up removal/simply morning face wash. However, I found this product to be a little weak in washing off my make-up and I don&#x27;t put a lot on! It does foam very easily so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out quickly. Even a dime size amount of the product is way too much for one use. It didn&#x27;t give me more acne, but it also didn&#x27;t do a thorough job of cleaning my skin. I understand this is not a deep cleansing product but I&#x27;ve used better products for a real squeaky clean finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again. I personally will return to either&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) [The Face Shop] Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/The-Face-Shop-Bright-Cleansing/dp/B0065FYPB4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1397597932&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;rice+face+face+shop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Skinfood Egg White Pore Foam 150ml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TJ0OX4/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A1ZHKOB2WUM8HX</li>
            <li> Great face wash worth every penny. Leaves my fave squeaky clean literally! Will buy again! A little goes a long way. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> so dry after i washed my face with it</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product from reading the reviews, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference in using this product for a month.  I actually got more acne.  I have oily/combination skin with hormonal acne along my chin.  I went back to my oil cleansing method which has worked better for me and have kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a good cleanser to begin with, now that I&#x27;ve accumulated enough information about my skin preferences. The ingredients and the high pH are enough factors for those with acne-prone skin to avoid such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the commercial, trying to make the product into a foam is not an easy task. It was fun in the beginning, but afterwards, I merely want to cleanse my skin easily.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve been using for a decade to clean all the make-up residue with foaming net/bubble maker. This product will perform a lot better with foaming net/bubble maker. Squeeze Shiseido Perfect Whip like a coffee bean size on a wet foaming net then squeeze the foam off the net. It creates massive and soft foam that cleans all the make-up residue. I also use whip with Clearisonic.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this... But sadly it was far too harsh on my skin! I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is super sensitive, but this burned! I even had small chemical burn on my chin after a few uses...So bummed...</li>
            <li> I love how this cleanser leaves your skin feeling! You only need a small amount to clean your face and my skin feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Shiseido customer and love foaming cleaners in general. However, Shiseido Perfect Whip made my eyes burn even though I was careful not to get any of it in my eyes or even close to them. I don&#x27;t have allergies or sensitive skin, but this just didn&#x27;t agree with me. I&#x27;m back to using my DHL foam.</li>
            <li> Can facial cleansers get scientific? I mean beyond all their pseudo-scientific marketing stuffs…Well, this one did.&lt;br /&gt;It talks about &amp;#34;cushioning&amp;#34; your delicate face skin which I was a bit doubtful about, but whaddaya know… when you put a small amount on your palm and lather it up (only need a little and you need to lather it a bit to unleash the true potential of this cleanser), you literally get a WHIP, as in whip cream. It is cushiony on your face and cleans thoroughly without over drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I will still use my Clean &amp; Clear morning gel pumps for daily wash, but this one is perfect for my nighttime wash.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone looking for the perfect foamy facial cleanser that is very gentle on face.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face but it also gets dried out by many products that help control the oil. This wash does not dry my skin and will remove all traces of makeup with one wash. An awesome product.</li>
            <li> 1st time buyer, great product, after usage, feel nice and clean. recommended to anyone needing a good and inexpensive product to clean their face,</li>
            <li> Very formy but haven&#x27;t used enough to grade. But it will last a long time since a tiny bit cleans the whole face very well</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim...  Needed something else in the cart to qualify for free shipping.  It works surprising well on my oily skin. It&#x27;s pretty thick and rich, but doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> love this! Very comparable to shiseido Ibuku cream.</li>
            <li> It foams really well and my face felt really clean after use. In fact, I usually use a toner with a cotton ball to wipe off the remnants of make up and with this, there was either minimal to no dirt left.&lt;br /&gt;The foam is thick and creamy so it can stay on your face while you do other things. The foam is what really helps get rid of the dirt, make up, and blackheads so it gives it time to uproot them.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, I suggest that you don&#x27;t dry your face too quickly but let it air dry and before your face gets dry, apply face toner and moisturizer to keep the moisture in.</li>
            <li> Great! I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 yrs. This product is good and the customer service is also good!</li>
            <li> Even with a moisterizer it dried out my face.</li>
            <li> Smells like paint a little ?</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so soft and gentle I lack words for describing it. I use it in the shower and my skin feels moisturized and never dry after this. Doesn&#x27;t break me out, very good for sensitive skin. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was fake since it was in non-Japanese writing, but it was extremely drying, and my face usually does not get dried out easily.</li>
            <li> I liked this cleanser pretty good. I really enjoyed the texture/consistency of the cleanser. It was a bit difficult to remove though. I would probably re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my full review here if you want!! [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since I was in Japan. It&#x27;s very creamy and works really good. I use this after I wash with make up remover.</li>
            <li> **EDIT*** **UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed it to 3 stars - &amp;#34;Its okay&amp;#34; because it really is just okay. It is a gimmick.  It leaves a slight film on your face after you wash it.  There are much better cleansers you can use with more beneficial ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright so I read all of the reviews and did more research online as well.  I also watched the commercial on youtube (if you haven&#x27;t yet, go search youtube for &amp;#34;Shiseido Perfect Whip commercial&amp;#34;.  I read that you are supposed to put a dime sized about in the dry palm of one hand, and with the other hand, start rubbing in a circular motion for a couple minutes, then add some drops of water to the product, rub some more, add a couple more drops, rub some more, for several minutes, then it because a large ball of foam. Then wash your face with it.  You can see her do it in the commercial as well.  I did exactly this, for 3-5 minutes, and it did take a while.  The consistency was still creamy for quite a long time, and I kept at it then after like 5 long minutes of this process it changed to a foamy texture.  However, it never &amp;#34;foamed up&amp;#34; or because a foam ball.. when  I put it on my face to wash with it, it was just creamy like the beginning, not foamy.  However, it was very pleasant to use and I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that there is a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; with this, and that is fine.  I am going to try this process every single day till I get the hang of it, and I will update this review accordingly.  I am taking off a star because upon further reflection, I really don&#x27;t think that you should HAVE to take this much time for a face wash to work as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one thing to keep in mind in other reviews on here is that not everyone could be using it properly.  They may be just squeezing it straight from the tube and using it like that without trying to foam it, and it may not work the same if you do that.</li>
            <li> There really is no compare to this product that I have successfully found. With combination skin, I used to use Neutrogena--I&#x27;ve tried every product in their line--and I have tried plain tap water alone, and both of those have managed to dry my face out on occasion, which I was honestly OK with. Until I found Perfect Whip. It&#x27;s the consistency of this product that wins it its gold stars--never a too dry or too oily day again.</li>
            <li> This an extremely gentle soap but by itself I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing but when you pair it with a clarisonic or a foam scrubby, it really does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Great product for all skin types. It worked especially well for my skin which is combination skin. Item shipped WAY faster than time expected. I received my item 2 weeks before it was expected to arrive from JAPAN! Overall great product! However, does not work too well on black heads but makeup removal and cleaning of pores is great!</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this product to clean my whole face.  The lather is quite silky.  It gently removes eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling refreshed but NOT dried out.  Love, love, love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser !  You only need a pea-size in you palm and work out the bubbles .. and it will foam up enough to cover up the whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans up squeaky-clean, and it even removes left over water-proof mascara and eyeliner that I thought was already removed by my eye make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the smell is so mild and refreshing ... makes cleaning my face such a treat !</li>
            <li> I use with my clairsonic. I use a makeup wipe before and wipe off with wet makeup remover cloth ( also.purchased by Amazon) . You need very little. I would get again but maybe just use in,summer and use one with moisture in winter. Definitely recommend for someone waiting a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected. Make my face dry</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap and common cleansing foam at drugstores in Japan. It&#x27;s effective for the second step in double cleansing, but probably better for oily skin types. I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, my skin is dry/normal, and it feels a bit tight and dehydrated after washing with this. Nevertheless, using a little bit of the foam is very effective in clearing sebaceous filaments and restoring smoothness and softness to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this, it&#x27;s recommended to buy a foaming net. They are cheap and when you rub a pea-size amount of this mixed with a splash of water, the result is  a very dense foam, similar to shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I bought mine in Tokyo, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not a verified buyer.)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  It gets good reviews on this site and others but when I tried it myself I was disappointed.  At fist I was impressed by how thick the lather was and how little of the product you had to use to wash your whole face, but after rinsing and drying my skin felt tight and dry.  i&#x27;m assume that artificial lathering agents (SLS) are to blame for both the thick lather and drying nature of this product.  Your skin has something called an acid mantle that protects your skin from the elements- it has a pH of 4.  When I tested this product using pH paper it registered at a pH of 10- a strong base.  Most cleansers have a pH between 4-6.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too harsh, but then I started to really appreciate the clean feeling that it gives. I always follow this wash with a good moisturizer and my skin is cleaner, clearer, and less prone to breakouts than before. Like all Shiseido&#x27;s cleansing foams, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Really like this product it foams up very very nicely which is my favorite part of this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleans nicely feels great wish it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cleanser, before I had been using proactive which has microbeads, but I never felt like it truly cleaned out all the oil and dirt off my face but this does! I have mostly dry skin, but oily on my nose/chin and this clears up my face beautifully. It does dry your skin slightly, but I don&#x27;t mind because I normally follow with moisturizer. It is also strong enough to remover most of my makeup, I just have to go over my eyelids a little if I&#x27;ve got eyeliner on!</li>
            <li> Just like the Shiseido I buy at high end stores at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well. Feels great.</li>
            <li> Feels great on face and the tube is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I hate cleansers, I have never finished a whole bottle. My skin is dry and sensitive, mostly to Sodium Laurel Sulfate. I tend to use Bioderma and Kose Cleansing Oil to remove makeup and cleanse, but this is awesome! You can whip it in your hands to a thick whipped cream consistency, if you&#x27;re not sure you can youtube the shiseido perfect whip commercial. I have ordered my second bottle and am happy with this product!!!! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this cleanser to me 10000x times and I finally bought it to give it a try. However this cleanser can&#x27;t wash my light make-up off (my sana cleanser does).It foams very well but it also has a strong scent (a lot Japanese cleanser doesn&#x27;t contains any artificial fragrance and color) and as an oily skin person I don&#x27;t like the feeling after I used it. When I checked the ingredient list I found bees&#x27; wax in it. I googled it and found it is not a good ingredient for acne prone, oily skin people like me.  With this price there is a lot more options out there for me to choose. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Mine came from China, so....im afraid to use it. How is that the Japanese product came from China and it had some english writing on the back of the bottle? Confused! I dont trust things from China.</li>
            <li> I bought this face cleanser as a part of my 5-Step Japanese Skincare Routine.  Not only do I have super sensitive, combination, Japanese-American skin, but I also live in both dry Colorado and humid Georgia.  I needed something that was gentle yet cleaned my skin thoroughly of makeup and dirt.  Most soaps are too dry for me, or the perfumes are overwhelming.  This foaming cleanser is wonderfully unique in that it puffs up like a thick shaving cream.  To achieve this, you have to buy an additional: a Japanese foam net.  You put just a tiny (and I mean tiny) pea-size smear on the net, trickle on some water, then scrub the net between your hands.  It forms a huge blob of thick, creamy, and dense foam which you then use to clean your face with.  The idea is that your fingers don&#x27;t rub your face and damage it; the microscopic foam does the deep cleaning for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no scent, just smells clean&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use and creates foam within seconds&lt;br /&gt;- very affordable compared to American brands of face cleaners&lt;br /&gt;- a bottle with last you almost 6 months (if you use the foam net right)&lt;br /&gt;- foam rinses away clean without residue&lt;br /&gt;- no allergic reaction whatsoever (very, very safe for sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t strip essential oils from your face&lt;br /&gt;- much improvement on my overall skin tone (make a pale, even complexion)&lt;br /&gt;- works on American skin, not just Japanese! (my skin leans towards the rough Irish genetics)&lt;br /&gt;- helps keep oil levels down&lt;br /&gt;- safe to use twice a day after makeup at night, and before makeup in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- works well in humid weather, but in dry weather you must follow up immediately with toner + serums&lt;br /&gt;- foam can get a little messy&lt;br /&gt;- need to buy the additional tool (the foam net is about $8 for a multi-pack)&lt;br /&gt;- ingredients are listed in Japanese, which I have trouble reading (might need to look it up online)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal customer for life.  This is such a unique and gentle way of washing your face.  It&#x27;s so refreshing and cleans without harming your skin.  Rubbing your face with your fingers can cause wrinkles, stretch your skin, or rub around the oils.  Towels can collect bacteria or be abrasive.  This foam is incredible and costs just as much as American products found in the local stores.  I really enjoy the feeling of the foam on my face, even if I look silly doing it!

            <li> I love Shiseido products but they&#x27;re often a bit out of my price range, so their Perfect Whip is perfect for my budget. It&#x27;s inexpensive and also quality. Before, my skin would break out because it was so dry but I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and my complexion has improved a lot. It smells clean but not perfume-y, it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of natural moisture, my face never feels dry or scratchy anymore... All I have to do is wash with this and use a light moisturizer and I&#x27;m good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome for my dry skin. Love love love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product! Totally recommend this! :D</li>
            <li> Very nicely foaming cleanser!!! It seems pretty gentle and I have sensitive skin. I have not felt a dry or tight feeling after cleansing with this cleanser. Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great gentle but effective cleanser!  The ingredients are not from the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; group, but I like this one.  I use 1/2 pea-size drop and it makes a ton of foam - will probably last me a life time ))</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin. If I even attempt to change my cleanser, I will break out. I&#x27;ve used Shiseido products in the past but found them to be a bit expensive (around $25-30 for a tube of around the same size). I was elated to discover Amazon sells this Japanese &amp;#34;drugstore version&amp;#34; of Shiseido cleanser for under $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a week and been using it daily with my Clairsonic and no break outs. Add just a dab and a little water and then agitate it to start the foaming action. (There are videos out there demonstrating the height of the foam. Crazy. Reminds me of whipping eggs to a peak) After cleaning, I do feel that &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; afterwards. But I moisture immediately after anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already thinking about ordering more.</li>
            <li> Perfectly clean but leaves my normal skin a bit dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this brand, this product for years.. smoooooothy foam. Designed for Asian sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Bought several times!</li>
            <li> This bottle will last forever. I use a pea size amount and mix it vigorously in my hands to create the foam. Since I don&#x27;t own a bath poof, or a net for the Perfect Whip, this is what I resort to. Needless to say rubbing Perfect Whip in my hands does create a nice, thick lather of foam, so it is not imperative to use a net. However, if you are looking to maximize the foaming effect, I would suggest using the net. I believe Japanese people use the net to create a lot of foam because they want to avoid rubbing their faces with their hands. It is believed that rubbing the face too much will disturb the natural structure of the skin, hence, the amount of foam created to avoid touching and irritating one&#x27;s face. In addition, the Perfect Whip has a pleasant, light smell when it foams up. It cleans my face nicely. When I use witch hazel afterwards, it barely, if at all, takes off any dirt from my face. Obviously, the longer you wash your face, the cleaner your face will be. Wow, I just wrote an essay on face wash....lol.</li>
            <li> very good!!!  so fast!!!</li>
            <li> Clean without drying, reasonable price, love this product.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn, combination, acne-prone skin, and I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for...far too long! I loved this face wash for about 6 months. At first, this face wash definitely helped clear some of my acne. I actually noticed results within 1-2 weeks of daily use. It didn&#x27;t clear everything since a lot my acne is hormonal and stress-driven. The face wash was relatively drying, however, and sometimes my face would sting from it; I know the description says it moisturizes, but it&#x27;s drying properties definitely outweigh any moisturizing properties, if it has any at all. After almost 6 months of use, my skin just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and began exhibiting irritation (too much stinging, redness) every time I used it. By then, I had probably used up a good 50%+ of the tube. Alas, I had to stop and find a new face wash. Maybe this face wash is more suitable for occasional use - maybe for the middle of summer/hot weather when your face gets extra oily (that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never got the foam to whip up as insanely awesome as the commercial shows it to (definitely YouTube the commercial), which was slightly disappointing. The smell is lightly soapy, kinda meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Stearic Acid, Peg-8, Myristic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Lauric Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Polyquaternium-7, Beeswax, Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroly Glutamate, Disodium Edta, Tocopherol, Fragrance</li>
            <li> Really Great Foaming Cleanser!! I bought this out of trying Asian Skin care products instead of American Brands like Neutrogena and Olay. I read reviews on it before purchasing and each blogger raved about it! Definitely won&#x27;t disappoint</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser. I use a pea-sized amount in a lathering net and that&#x27;s more than enough for my whole face, neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders (all areas that my skin is really sensitive). This is SO gentle but leaves my face really clean. Unlike other soaps I&#x27;ve used, it does not leave my face feeling tight and rubbery but soft and smooth. The one other cleanser I&#x27;ve been able to use was Cetaphil, but that didn&#x27;t do nearly the job this does on actually removing dirt and oils from my face. I&#x27;ve had a drastic decrease in blackheads since I started using this product (compared to Cetaphil).</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combination of strong and gentle for my skin.  My skin feels super soft and smooth, not overly dry, but still satisfyingly clean.</li>
            <li> Execellent product. I like it very much! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing whip face cream wash. Gentle enough and gives you an airbrush finish. Cleans out impurities. Highly recommend for someone who wants to find a unique face wash.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff. I looked at it online forever and I finally picked it up at a Japanese market in Chicago at a much higher price. It was worth every penny. This stuff foams up like crazy so a tiny pea-sized amount is more than enough. It has a very nice light almost baby powder like smell to it which I just love. I never have to exfoliate after this soap because it cleans my pores so well and rinses off nicely (definitely use a moisturizer after); it would be a great post-workout cleanser. This has never broken me out. If you are new to Asain skincare and want to start small, I highly recommend buying this here at a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser, it makes my skin feel soft. I&#x27;m not really sure how it compares to my usual Clarisonic cleanser, but I like it nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this when I ran out of a different Japanese face wash. I always read such good reviews for Shiseido, so I figured I would give it a try. It did its job as a face wash, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to order again. It comes out thick and lathers well, but my skin didn&#x27;t seem to have that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling when I got out of the shower. It lasted a while, which was also a plus. However, as others have said, it was a bit drying and my face was back to being oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This lasted me at least 6 months. The tiniest amount makes a huge lather. It&#x27;s also extremely moisturizing. This is great during the winter when the cold and wind dries up your skin. Honestly the most moisturizing facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Thick, thick, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is amazing. It only take a tiny 1/2 pea sized dollop to make a huge amount of foamy cleanser. It removes all my makeup, including mascara and leaves my skin soft and clean, but not dry or tight. I bought my first bottle about a year ago, and I am only now buying the second one, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I am just loving with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I have not found anythig better than this.&lt;br /&gt;It removes my make up very clearly.&lt;br /&gt;It gives very rich form.</li>
            <li> The smallest amount goes a long way. It took me about 10 months to use up the bottle! Pleasant scent. Removes my makeup but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying, but if you use a moisturizer afterwards this works really well!</li>
            <li> I was expecting to like this, but am very taken aback at how much I LOVE it - the consistency is so unique, it really is very &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34;, almost bouncy when you apply it on your skin (it&#x27;s a fairly thick white cream cleanser) but the texture allows it to sink deep enough into skin to really cleanse thoroughly and clear away any makeup etc., *without* drying out your skin at all. I do have dry skin so it&#x27;s possible this may not be ideal for oily skin, but for normal to dry it&#x27;s AMAZING. I&#x27;ve tried a huge range of American drugstore cleansers and this handily outpaces them at all at a lower price than most. The experience of using it is so pleasant that I&#x27;m tempted to use it on days I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup and would normally just use a light oil cleanse.r</li>
            <li> goes on creamy and foams up right away. leaves your skin clean and removes all the make-up. will order again</li>
            <li> Everything is written in Japanese but you get the drift, put a dime size amount on your fingers, lather and wash you face. I like the slight scent and it hasnt aided in future breakouts. My face feels clean and ready for the day. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that i tried this cleanser and i have to say that i love it! I really like that a little goes a long way that tells me that it&#x27;s going to last me a long time. The texture of it is more like a lotion but once you add water it foams up really well and it actually takes off all of my makeup, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Very good product, love it !</li>
            <li> Great product just a pea size goes a very long way. .. enough for my face ands neck. ..very rich lather.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy Japanese stuff because the ads are very dramatic. But the quality of this item exceeds the price I&#x27;m paying. I have tried all kinds of face wash from the U.S., China, Japan and other Asian countries, this one is the best fit so far.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle on the skin, great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love this product. But it doesn&#x27;t foam up nearly as much as I&#x27;d expected it to when just using my hands. Despite this, it&#x27;s definitely the best foam cleanser I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> Fantastic face wash! I&#x27;ve used many different face washes for around 10 dollars, but this one is certainly the best face wash I&#x27;ve found to date. You don&#x27;t need much and it lathers very well. Once you rinse your face, it does a great job taking all the oils off of your face. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a very clean and glowing skin</li>
            <li> I am a male in my 30&#x27;s and have gone through my fair share of face washes and by far I am loving the Perfect Whip. I have pretty sensitive skin with occasional break outs here and there but since I have gotten this and using it almost daily it has kept my skin nice and smooth; although not younger.    When the Perfect Whip arrived I went straight to test it out and without much thought I squeeze the cream onto my hands and started applying it directly to my face. Boy, was I in for a shock. It was not what I expected, it was just silky and just smeared all over my face and it was difficult to wash off! I was disappointed but then I figured I was doing something wrong, since the bottle came with no instructions and I could not read Japanese I had to look up instructions. In my hours of research I found out there was actually a technique in using the Perfect Whip! Who knew! (probably all the females out there) but I learned you need to actually foam the cream in order to use it properly! (Duh~!)    So here are some instructions for the newbs, like myself!    The best way to use the Perfect Whip is lather the cream into a foam before apply it to your face. The best way to foam it is to use a foam net like the one found here [[ASIN:B00LN2SFO2 Estone Simply Foaming Facial Body Face Cleansing Net Bubble Foam,Use Less Cleanser]]    Or you would apply a small amount onto the center of the palm of one hand, then add some drips of water and using the fingers of your other hand, smart using circular motions to smear the cream to create foam. Add little drips of water as you work the cream in the palm to create the more foam bubbles.    It requires a little bit of work using the fingers and hands but once its starts to foam its gets easier. When there is a good amount just apply the foam bubble to your face and lather it in and then rinse! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Used to buy similar stuff from Lancome, but not anymore. This stuff amazing, it is light, easy to go on and east to lather, easy to wash off. Skin feel great fresh and moist after use, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> i heard a lot good command on this product but it kind a bit dry after wash your face but it still good when comes to this good price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel clean without feeling dry. I also have sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions. I like that there is no scent to it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Only use a small amount to wash your face, and the product will last for a while.</li>
            <li> Yep. It&#x27;s real. It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than estimated delivery date. I love this product, it makes my face look and feel so much better. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> If you apply the product properly (use only a small amount, lather, gently rub in circles on skin) it works very well! I have eastern asian skin and products that I&#x27;ve tried before (St Ives, Biore, Neutragena) didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might sting a little the first few times you use it, but it makes my skin feel clean. Not too sure how it is as an anti-acne product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I posted the same review on the same product, except it was being sold in a pack of two)</li>
            <li> I love how this lathers and rinses. My skin is oily and it cleans nicely. Although it doesn&#x27;t protect you from break outs and it doesn&#x27;t clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful, lasts forever</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she uses it everyday. It is much cheaper than other products such as Lancôme eye make-up remover or toner and it works even better! I have yet to use it, but so much cheaper and better than anything else on the market!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Instead of buying a special net, I just snipped a square off of my cheap dollar store loofa. I put a pea size dab of the product on it and some water, then rubbed it between my hands to lather. Works great and doesn&#x27;t take the natural oils off of my face. If you don&#x27;t lather it enough, it will feel really gummy and nasty and may be hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> What I really love about this cleanser is how foamy it gets with just a teeny tiny amount in your hand.  Seriously, squeeze just the tiniest dab in the palm of your hands, rub together, and cleanse.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that I can&#x27;t read the label; it&#x27;s cleanser.  Ya pretty much know what to do.  It&#x27;s under $10 and will last a year!  And.....I like how my face feels afterward; smoot and soft, not dried out and thirsty.</li>
            <li> I have saw so many good reviews so I brought this product, but I am kind of disappointed with it. My face feel really dry and itchy after using it. It&#x27;s really clean my skin, but maybe fits oil skin better.</li>
            <li> bought many times, still useful&lt;br /&gt;face feel confortable&lt;br /&gt;the price is a litte expensive.&lt;br /&gt;love love love love........just buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;haha</li>
            <li> Clean well without dry.</li>
            <li> Be careful! The product is from Taiwan, not Japan! The traditional Chinese characters on the bottle indicate that.</li>
            <li> I love asian skincare, so of course I had to try this cleanser. I even like the name, Perfect Whip.  However, this is only good if you don&#x27;t wear makeup or remove your makeup prior to washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this cleanser is fabulously foamy, but just because it is foamy, doesn&#x27;t mean it is removing impurities.  The good thing is, you only need to use a teeny tiny amount and the cleanser will create an incredibly rich lather, and doesnt dry out the skin.  I can use this cleanser in the morning and it seems fine, however I can&#x27;t use it at night.  The bad thing about this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of makeup.  I wear foundation and powder and even though I washed my face twice with this cleanser, I had to use about 6 cotton balls with toner to get rid of all the remaining traces of dirt and makeup left on my skin.  I am breakout prone, so I like to make sure all makeup/dirt is removed from my face before bed.  To me, if there is still dirt or makeup residue on your face after cleansing, then that is not a good cleanser, which is why I don&#x27;t recommend this cleanser if you wear foundation, concealer, or powder.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a good Shiseido Face wash, because I still have whiteheads a lot of them.  It cleans pretty well, but no well enough.  It&#x27;s a trial by use thing.  It may work for some people but nothing on this end.</li>
            <li> At first, I enjoyed using this facewash...it foams up really nicely, is dense and creamy, and made me feel squeaky clean--but that was the problem! My skin is oily and acne prone, but it left my face feeling tight and dehydrated. It didn&#x27;t break me out, but there are definitely better asian facewashes out there!</li>
            <li> My favorite facial washer: clean, non-dry and affordable. However, be careful to choose seller, and some of them might selling fake products. I bought this product several times from toy shop japan hobbyone, great seller!</li>
            <li> As a guy who has had skin problems and tried dozens of different face cleansers all my life, I can say Perfect Whip is easily one of the best I&#x27;ve used. I can&#x27;t speak for this cleanser not washing out makeup like the top review here, but I can say that it clears out oil and dirt really well, and it leaves your skin feeling soft and clean. Since I&#x27;ve used it, acne and blemishes have gone down considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive, so I tend to wash my face in the morning with water and use the Perfect Whip at night during shower. Afterwards I use the Lucido moisturizing lotion, which is another product I highly recommend for guys to go along with a face wash like this.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash! It removed dirt and oils with only a small amount and makes my face feel so clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> This is a bit harsh on my skin. Maybe it&#x27;s because I already use Clarisonic and I need something more soothing. This will probably work better on greasy/oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My skin and foam cleansers usually don&#x27;t have a good relationship, but this cleanser is a whole other story. Usually foam cleansers strip my skin of moisture. My skin starts making bucket loads of oil, and my already acne prone skin breaks out. Great if you want that fresh into puberty look, but this cleanser leaves my skin clean and soft without taking all the moisture. I top it off with my daily moisturizer, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I haven&#x27;t broke out since. When I become lazy and don&#x27;t use it, I start breaking out again. This is a holy grail product. Can&#x27;t live without it. Its also great since it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and a little goes a very long way. One tube lasts me six months using it both day and night. You can buy without fears, because Perfect Whip will change your life.</li>
            <li> Amazing couldn&#x27;t be more happy if I tried with this product my skin feels amazing and clean when I wash and is helpful to oily skin like my husbands. Wouldn&#x27;t work with dry skin might dry you out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ in other products! Have, did, done it. This is unbeatable, end the search. Sensitive, light skin whole life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen this in the japanese magazines I read, and its was almost always picked as a no.1 Cleanser; so I had to try it~ I must say, I love how soft this foam makes my skin~ I doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all~ this might be a keeper</li>
            <li> Returned.  Super drying.  No good.  The lather is nice and rich and you only need a little product.  But the results on the skin I do not care for.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product, i found it via Refinery29. I only have to use a tiny amount and it makes my oily skin look less oily without stripping it and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. You only need a very small amount, it builds into a thick foam that covers the entir e face, and the scent is light and lovely.</li>
            <li> Bought for my teenager and seems to work ok and not drying but the directions are in Japanese. Of course I know how to use face wash but a teenaged boy was confused.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash I&#x27;ve ever used! It cleans deep in my pores and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave residue at all. There is a nice mild scent but no chemical smell. The only downside that comes to mind is the tiny bubbles create a slightly slimy feel that was off-putting at first.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful! Doesn&#x27;t irrita my skin, leaves face feeling smooth. Love Shiseido products, especially those made for the Japanese market.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now, and I love the smell and the foamy feeling on my face, it cleans my face very well too</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap but really good! it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry, instead, it makes my skin soft. also, the delivery is very fast.</li>
            <li> The same as the product I bought in Japan. I love the application and how it makes my skin glow! Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I bought this out of curiosity, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It has a color and texture of marshmallow cream; probably doesn&#x27;t taste like it, though. It has a nice lather, and cleans deeply. Saying &#x27;A little product goes a long way&#x27; with this is a bit of an understatement; a less than pea-size amount covers my entire face. I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, and if I had to hazard a guess, I would say this one single bottle will probably last me the rest of my life, and be passed down to my future children and grandchildren for a couple of generations before finally running out. I don&#x27;t know what kind of voodoo magic Japan puts in it&#x27;s skincare products, but it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I love how foamy this cleanser gets! It&#x27;s the perfect step if you use the double cleanse method (or even if you don&#x27;t). I&#x27;ll use this to wash my face after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup with a cleansing oil, and I feel like it does a great job at removing all of the residual product. I literally feel squeaky clean afterwards, but never stripped of oils or too dry. Love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only unperfect thing is the smell. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not good either...I can&#x27;t even explain it...it&#x27;s just weird. Not soapy, not fresh or fruity. You&#x27;ll definitely have to smell it for yourself to know what it&#x27;s like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift this time around for my best friend to try.</li>
            <li> This is like cetaphil but better.  You only need to use a pea size amount to cover most of your face.</li>
