            <li>She loved the colors and they work great for nail art.</li>
            <li>Love, love them!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, great colors and all in all just an amazing product.</li>
            <li>they works amazing, the color is soooo shiny and metallic, i wish i could stress how beautiful they are,</li>
            <li>Real lovely bright metallic colors.</li>
            <li>They apply easily, with excellent coverage in two coats.</li>
            <li>Kleancolor makes great polish and you can&#x27;t top the price anywhere!</li>
            <li>I had no problem with these chipping, but I have a very good top coat</li>
            <li>And they are a very good price, under $2 per bottle when most good polishes are over $5 per bottle.</li>
            <li>I love these metallic colors they are all very good quality and bright colors.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably because of the metallic chemical compounds that make up the bright colors.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly bright.</li>
            <li>Colors are amazing and go on great.  </li>
            <li>Colors are bright.</li>
            <li>the colors are so bright.  </li>
            <li>Colors are bright and polish goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>Maybe because it is so bright and metallic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d liked to gotten more of a variety of colors, but for the price and for stamping, they are perfect.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors</li>

            <li>The polish is awesome and it arrived real quik</li>
            <li>Polish colors are GREAT, they smell very strongly of acetone and polish peels off easily</li>

            <li>They are worth every penny you spend!!!</li>

            <li>Great pricing for anyone wanting to build up their polish collection, and shipping was quick and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>But this nail polish is beautiful and fun</li>
            <li>Great buy, 12 Full size bottles for the price of two.</li>
            <li>Colors look great and they are full size bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the sleek look just as much as the awesome color</li>
            <li>Good thing was it was easy to remove without polish remover.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I was able to get these products at a very reasonable price and the colors are absolutely awesome.  </li>
            <li>Also chips very easily.</li>
            <li>After it dries it chips very very easily.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use it to accent my nails with patterns or decorations since it chips and cracks very easily</li>
            <li>but the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li>it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>The paint also peals off the fingernails very easy.</li>
            <li>and they are very strong smelling.</li>
            <li>All of them are very pretty and have gotten great complements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage in 2 coats and covers are even more vibrant than as pictured.</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase and shipping was pretty quick!</li>
            <li>i really like the colors they are very bright</li>
            <li>Awesome Stamping Polish may leave a stain if applied directly to the nail</li>
            <li>Not used it yet, but they sure look nice in the shelf...</li>
            <li>Great sleepover fun for kids birthday party.  </li>
            <li>So for my opinion of this set is that even if it turns out to just be ok for wear and durability, it will work for me because I ruin everything and can&#x27;t have nice things.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m really impressed</li>
            <li>Selection of colors are not overbearing but classy and trendy!!!</li>
            <li>Got my package uber early so that was awesome.</li>
            <li>They look great and if your nails are in good shape, they will last a good 3-5 days with no chipping.  </li>
            <li>Or what kind of top coat you use.</li>
            <li>makes it so easy!....</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this by far is my favorite purchase from Amazon just because the gorgeous colors &amp; the look make me so happy.</li>
            <li>BUT... the colors aren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; colors anyway, so they&#x27;re perfect for weekends and special occasions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again this is a very good movie that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had a defective bottle, and they replaced it pleasantly and quickly.</li>
            <li>this set was ideal: Reasonably priced and so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Good for one-night special occasionas though.</li>
            <li>But the rest of the colors are just as good as some of the konad special polishes.</li>
            <li>The shine is stellar and you could even get away with one coat (the sign of a great lacquer).  </li>
            <li>Well, at first I was very happy, the colors are beautiful and only needed one coat, and the polish stayed on well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>A good deal for 12 full size bottles.</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>This is very cheap in quality.</li>
            <li>Very bright and vivid colors.</li>
            <li>but it did, bright and boldly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also shipped quickly with good packaging.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, the paint is good, but it doesn&#x27;t survive a shower without peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>These colors are so vibrant and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>all the others are highly pigmented and work beautifully as stamping polish.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and they look like high quality.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I love all the colors in this set.  </li>
            <li>It does smell more than usu</li>

            <li>She enjoyed it</li>
            <li>(I used an OPI top coat).</li>
            <li>I wanted to get more and stumbled across this lot.  </li>

            <li>The consistency is just right, The brush is good as well.</li>

            <li>the bottles are full size,  at a nail shop you could easily pay from $9  to $15 a bottle...</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>When this order first arrived, I wanted to try them all!!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered, just as they appear in the pic!!</li>
            <li>very worth buying the set.</li>
            <li>These really are a nice set that spans a wide range of beautiful metallic colors.</li>
            <li>The colors were interesting, but when they cannot last a full day, what good does it do?</li>
            <li>The colors are so amazing and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish itself dries rather quickly and it doesnt chip off easily.</li>
            <li>I noticed my nails becoming very brittle and the top layer peeling off.</li>
            <li>The colors are bold the smell is a Lil strong but its not all that bothersome.</li>
            <li>It came in 5 days early then expected in great condition and the colors are beautiful higher than my expectations</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not really what I think of when I think &#x27;metallic&#x27; these colors have a great shine to them and apply easily.</li>
            <li>originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a basecoat first.  </li>
            <li>You have a color for almost every outfit When people ask where I got them I tell them Amazon where I buy ALL of my unique nail polishes</li>
            <li>They are bright, beautiful, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Go for it, this is totally worth your money!</li>
            <li>Its pretty potent.  </li>
            <li>but this was an awesome deal even considering I wouldn&#x27;t usually buy some of the colors.</li>
            <li>They got here before the expected delivery date and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pass it up, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>She opened them up and was SO excited to see the range of colors.</li>
            <li>All the colors are so pretty:-)</li>
            <li>but she is so excited about it that she has repainted her nails every 2 or 3 days since christmas (when she got them).</li>
            <li>Still, worth it!</li>
            <li>Not high quality polish but many bright colors.  </li>

            <li>These colors are just fantastic, fun, and rich.</li>
            <li>Also, one of the bottles had leaked during shipping so that bottle isn&#x27;t full &amp; it was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>the only downfall of this nail polish is that it chips VERY easily!</li>
            <li>colors are amazing and bright in FULL bottles that are usual size.</li>

            <li>All in all, not a bad buy for the amount of polish you get.</li>
            <li>The shiny green looks great on my toes and was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>That is solved though easily with a clear top coat.</li>
            <li>I will agree that the smell is pretty strong, but it&#x27;s nail polish...</li>
            <li>these are pretty colors, but they chip really easily.</li>

            <li>basic colors and good colore ,,quick service and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of ideas from playing around and a lot of compliments on my manicure ... which was bold and metallic.  </li>
            <li>I love how metallic this particular polish is.</li>
            <li>and it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>Polish is awesome... will definitely purchase in the future...</li>
            <li>They are bright and shiny metallics that are nice and not to thick but not to thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lucky me</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>...chips too quick..</li>
            <li>They do have a tendency to bleed some so be sure to top coat before doing nail art especially lighter colored acrylic paint.</li>
            <li>This polish goes on smooth and evenly, covering completely with one coat and no base coat needed!</li>
            <li>Drys quick.</li>
            <li>Though this isn&#x27;t a known brand of nail polish, it has the same awesome qualities as any big brand like Essie or Opi.</li>
            <li>Colors are great only thing is you have to paint fast beause</li>
            <li>The Red, Mango, Orange and Yellow are perfect for fall.</li>
            <li>so u have to move quickly</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast an every polish was wrapped an secure .</li>
            <li>and they are all very rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are nearly one coat for full coverage, and for you stampers out there, most of these colors can be used to stamp with, and amazingly well, particularly since these are basically chromes, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>These colors are very pretty on.</li>
            <li>However, the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>so shipping is very fast!</li>
            <li>and theyre very pretty colors</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I like the array of colors provided in the set- very pretty.</li>
            <li>Nail polish is very pretty</li>
            <li>the beautiful metallic green and after doing some cleaning around the house and playing basketball, her thumb nail had chipped after about 10 hours of wear.</li>
            <li>It could be useful for dotting but not for full color polish.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole bunch of coats to get the true color!</li>
            <li>shimmer polish was much thicker than the rest, and polish may chip easily.</li>
            <li>So far they look pretty and a nice size esp.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, drys fast.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the colors - the green had a magnificent holo effect to it - but think I am going to reserve their use to stamping images on other polish since staining does seem to be a huge problem for this polish line.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I first did the swatches!</li>
            <li>I was excited with my first polish.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>They look better in person than in the picture , but they leave her nails looking professional!</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>The colors look exactly like the photo!</li>
            <li>I got the nail polish super fast, a day before the expected delivery date, and was very pleased with that!</li>
            <li>The colors are so rich and full of pigment that one coat is more than enough.</li>
            <li>They are bright and there is such a large variety.</li>
            <li>I recommend these nail polishes to anyone who wants beautiful and vibrant, durable colors for a low price.</li>
            <li>Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant on buying so much nail polish so cheaply</li>
            <li>and I really would recommend them since they are so cheap</li>
            <li>In my opinion these are nice nail polishes that are basically the same size as the Sinful Colors nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really slow and the polish starts chipping in hours, even with a good top coat.</li>
            <li>Got here early, and I LOVE the colors....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would stay clear of this product if you want to keep healthy nails.</li>
            <li>I have  used several of these colors they came out really nice and lasted a week.</li>
            <li>and when they came a couple of bottles were broken and had spilled all over the rest of them and the package...cleaned them up as best I could .</li>
            <li>I gave these to my ten year old granddaughter and my daughter asked if she could borrow them because the colors are so great.</li>
            <li>I think for the price this product is worth it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>However, when it comes time to get them off, they aren&#x27;t so fun.</li>
            <li>they were inexpensive and not a disappointment.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s because I use gel builder it adhires better to it then natural nails</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Metallic White\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t metallic at all but more like clear lumpy, glittery glue.</li>
            <li>I have no noticed any residual staining and the color lasts well with a clear top coat applied.  </li>
            <li>And I want to try a clear coat on top to see if it helps the chipping.</li>
            <li>certainly worth it</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs worth it though to not have a polish that chips and wears off the day after you spend an hour giving yourself a manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are fun colors.</li>
            <li>And you must use a clear top coat.</li>
            <li>Still, it was a fun gift to get for her as she uses a lot of nail polish to paint nails.</li>
            <li>Fun gift for preteen/teen girl</li>
            <li>The colors are fun and metallic.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how many of the colors</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty cool colors.</li>
            <li>So just be sure to use a bottom clear coat.</li>
            <li>colors are a lot of fun to mix and match and they stay on for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had faster drying polishes, but this is still worth it.</li>
            <li>Certainly not the best wear time possible, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought so much of the kleancolor polish because I love the beautiful vibrant colors that I really have never found in any other brand!  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly also..</li>
            <li>They are so vibrant and they came really quick!</li>
            <li>chips VERY easily even putting a clear coat on it doesn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li>I literally have on about 5 of the colors right now (rainbow nails)</li>
            <li>(I have some on right now)</li>
            <li>I had done all of my nails on my right hand with the color.</li>
            <li>Chipped off right after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>but after I applied them they would start to chip right away.</li>
            <li>but I guess your taking a gamble if you&#x27;ll get the right colors.</li>
            <li>I can paint my nails right before bed with no worries.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time and was packaged well</li>
            <li>I tried the blue on and it is such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>So pretty is worth it though.</li>
            <li>its the real brand as described (Kleancolor) &amp; all the bottles were full, not damaged.</li>
            <li>Only 2 weren&#x27;t suitable for stamping.  </li>
            <li>Four good days without chipping IF you use a good base and top coat</li>
            <li>and  if you were to buy these in a store they would cost at least $7 or more each I love these and get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly endorse this product; Great color, easy to use, you get large bottles, and it&#x27;s really cheap at a little more than a dollar per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put on the metallic red right away, right on top of yesterday&#x27;s manicure.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Realy nice bright colors, but difficult to remove</li>
            <li>Nice and opaque, the colors dry well except for the silver.</li>
            <li>and it was very neatly packaged and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Colors and long lasting finish!</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and was at my door a week before the estimated date.</li>
            <li>The variety of colors is very nice, but they chipped very easily even though I put a base coat, two layers of color and a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Years ago L&#x27;Oreal had a polish called Seafleur, and this is very much like that.  </li>

            <li>I fell in love with kleancolor when I accidentally purchased it in red at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the price and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I really love the selection of metallic hues and how well they actually cover the nail.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty on the toes.</li>
            <li>But pretty color</li>
            <li>Is thick and it looks great for like Christmas designs.</li>

            <li>I just used for the first time today</li>
            <li>I would defiantly say if your thinking about getting them do it!They are pretty stinky like others have  said even tho</li>
            <li>Dries fast too!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and they only need one coat to be opaque.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this brand</li>
            <li>(I thought I had gotten duplicates at first until reading the labels and swiping some polish on nail to see the difference).  </li>
            <li>Love all the different metallic&#x27;s colors</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this.</li>
            <li>All the colors are exactly as they appear in the pic</li>
            <li>,I would most definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>Too pretty.</li>
            <li>This is my third order of this brand of polish, I just love the colors, the finish, and the consistency.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors and cheep price.  </li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 days before it chips and peels off.  </li>
            <li>colors are pretty sitting on decorative tray on my dresser..</li>
            <li>I was able to stamp with each color except the white.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty but the colors peels after wearing for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The headphones arrived first.</li>
            <li>it doesnt was a white that looks more glittery than metallic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty but chips within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I just love them, really only needs one coat</li>
            <li>One coat was all it took, I used the Orange first.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate your feedback and time!</li>
            <li>So I hesitated on ordering these at first.</li>
            <li>First time ordering nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Online .</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Colors are exactly like the ones shown.</li>
            <li>the top layer, starting from the ends, would separate and break off, or just chip off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>now I mostly use this polish for my art projects and such.</li>
            <li>set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached swatches in natural light.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I love the colors</li>
            <li>For the most part only needed one coat!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>I LOVE these, colors are awesome, the only thing is that they have a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li>: Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>Again, very inexpensive a dollar a bottle!</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t use nail polish on my fingernails at all - only my toes :)</li>
            <li>I ordered my first set of these metallics.</li>
            <li>I love all the different shades to choose from.</li>
            <li>Pretty pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Still pretty tho.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my grand daughter for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li>A few friends have even bought these because they loved the colors.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that the odor is kind of odd and very strong, but they are so pretty that it&#x27;s not gonna stop me from using them.</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright and bold, it is hard to decide which one to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also fairly versatile--I was able to use the white and the red in combination with a few other polishes to produce an excellent water marble, which is certainly not true of most metallics.</li>
            <li>The metallic white is a great color but not great for stamping at all but the metallic yellow, metallic mango, is great for stamping.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a top quality nail polish you should really look into more expensive nail polish, but you get what you pay for and for the price I paid I should have known better.</li>
            <li>These colors are so vibrant and pretty!  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a nice polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried four colors and so far I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>every other polish I own)</li>
            <li>them with a top coat such as Seche vite, it really brings out the colors and they are extremely vivid!!!</li>
            <li>When i finally got these polishes i was definitely excited!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this nailpolish its ridiculous.</li>
            <li>They were delivered to me super fast, none of the bottles were broken or damaged, and the colors are great.</li>
            <li>The Pink, Aqua, Fuchsia, Purple and Green are perfect for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The polishes do chip like a mofo, so make sure you use at least a top coat</li>
            <li>Great vibrant colors and long lasting wear!</li>
            <li>The polish dries quickly, and the color stays vivid.</li>
            <li>In sunlight it has a very cool yellow flash.  </li>
            <li>; colors(the rest were the right ones in the photo), which would have been fine if it was actually a color I liked, but I never wear black nail polish...</li>
            <li>They came packaged extremely well, which was good as the package had a particularly strong odor, alerting me to be careful opening.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what this polish is made of, but it cannot be good for your nails.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, without a REALLY good top coat the polish chips fast.  </li>
            <li>After trying them out, she raved about the metallic sheen, the thick coverage, and the beautiful, vivid colors.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how good they are</li>
            <li>so easily you will have to reapply it daily</li>
            <li>Colors are very vibrant and I like the metallic look.  </li>
            <li>Very vibrant</li>
            <li>It drys really quick and so far no chipping..</li>
            <li>Metallic Red was easy to work with &amp; made the heart look almost like a glittery sticker.  </li>
            <li>Chips so easily it will last about a day</li>
            <li>, it is shimmery it dries fast and stays pretty also very sturdy</li>
            <li>Very vibrant color.</li>
            <li>Good polish, long lasting!</li>
            <li>they came in just a few days after ordering them and every color is so beautiful especially on the toes</li>
            <li>I am in love with every single color in this set.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for children.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the colors are beautiful especially the black one!</li>
            <li>B007U90J5U Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]]</li>
            <li>The colors are great and they came quickly, but sadly they tend to chip alot.</li>
            <li>Every color is very vibrant and beautiful, but goes on a little thick and chips pretty easily.</li>
            <li>The variety of colors is excellent, spanning the entire rainbow plus black and white.</li>
            <li>The polish has very high opacity</li>
            <li>I absolutely love EVERY single color!  </li>
            <li>the colors are EXACTLY as bright (if not more vibrant) in real life as shown in the photo.  </li>
            <li>This is so good that it is hard to remove with polish remover.  </li>
            <li>The polish looks great on, it&#x27;s wicked-witch-of-the-west green, only metallic.  </li>
            <li>Although this nail polish is cheap and you get 12 different one I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it chips</li>
            <li>Colors are very vibrant!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries fast compared to brands like OPI and China Glaze.</li>
            <li>You have to put these on a color wheel to see the real color.</li>
            <li>they are wonderful and for the cost you would be crazy not to buy.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t stain the whole nail</li>
            <li>very mucht</li>
            <li>My favorite thus far is the metallic white, which lasted me a whole week without the slightest chip.</li>
            <li>They are packaged well and they shipped very well; no breakage.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set because I needed an extra purchase in order to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li>These arrived so fast</li>
            <li>it was ready to go.  </li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t rate then quality of polish until I hear from my granddaughter after she uses the items.</li>
            <li>However, even if you only use 11 of the shades out of this set, it&#x27;s still a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>They really &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; when looking at them on my nails.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product</li>
            <li>Did not like it much</li>
            <li>I thought these colors were wonderful until I put the green on my nails and then a week later took off the polish to find my nail beds were YELLOW!!</li>
            <li>If you like nail stamping as much as I do, then get this set.</li>
            <li>The red is a deep cranberry red, great for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>These came really fast.</li>
            <li>and it covers very well.</li>
            <li>OK does not bother me... and NO the smell will not stay on your nails after the bottle is closed</li>
            <li>and she really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast, all polishes arrived unbroken, and I received all of the colors that I was supposed to.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re all very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>I really like them .but</li>
            <li>I was really looking for purple chrome nail polish</li>
            <li>I really like this set.  </li>
            <li>This polish is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I used a gel top coat that can be taken off with acetone ( not real gel that you need to soak your nails) and my polish started to wear after 3 days.  </li>
            <li>They are all very pigmented and work for my stamping and water marble nail art.</li>
            <li>but it chips really fast.</li>
            <li>unlike some cheap brands that need several coats just to match how the color looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The whole nail art Thing .....</li>
            <li>I really like the products.  </li>
            <li>Great colors, broken brush on a couple bottles.</li>
            <li>I have bought much stronger polish from the store.</li>
            <li>The finish is very metallic.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I tried using a bottom coat of protective polish but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>The polish seems to stay on really well</li>
            <li>The color payoff with is more than expected.</li>
            <li>I applied a top coat the last time and it increased the staying time a few days more.  </li>
            <li>I use them for stamping and they work very well for stamping also.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use these</li>
            <li>The complaints about the smell are very overblown.</li>
            <li>Started getting really worried so contacted the company</li>
            <li>These are very metallic looking</li>
            <li>Also cover with a clear top coat to make it last a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the shipping because when I got them they were all in bubble wrap in two packs and 3 of the bottles were broken open and they was nail polish everywhere.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pigmented and were more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast, which is huge since I often ruin a manicure because I just don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li>All of the colors have a bit of shimmer to them but not like glitter which is perfect as the real glitter in other nail polishes tends to be hard to remove.</li>
            <li>; is no where near right.</li>
            <li>The Green works best over pale colors as well, but the rest work with almost any combination, and you get an entire rainbow of colors for the price of one or two Konad Special polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add more photos as I try the other colors.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, however one of the bottles broke all over the other bottles.</li>
            <li>love the colors but the nail polish seems to chip easier than other polishes</li>
            <li>The polish has a stronger smell than other brands, but for the amount &amp; quality I get for the price, I don&#x27;t mind :)</li>
            <li>Even the white metallic is fun, it&#x27;s like snow on your fingertips!  </li>
            <li>The colors are so rich one coat is enough.</li>
            <li>These are ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed any nail staining yet like other reviewers have said but</li>
            <li>actually purchased them for stamping after seeing some swatches on the internet that used the KleanColor Metallic Orange, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold about as well as other brands I have used, I got about a week with no chips adding a top coat to it.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and I only need one coat to cover the whole nail.</li>
            <li>The only color that doesn&#x27;t show up really well is the yellow, although if you use it over white or another really light color it would work ok.</li>
            <li>The husband noticed my nails in the green shade and said it was the prettiest polish he&#x27;d ever seen me wear :) I highly recommend this polish!!</li>
            <li>Since there are so many other reviews I will make mine short and sweet.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering from Kleancolor again in the near future to add more colors to my collection!</li>
            <li>But this batch didn&#x27;t smell as strong, so maybe they fixed that, or the last batch burned out the smell-center in my brain.  </li>
            <li>since its a really soft, slightly sticky kind of stamper.</li>
            <li>since its a really soft, slightly sticky kind of stamper.</li>
            <li>quality is not good, very easy to chip!</li>
            <li>Stays much longer than normal nail polish, don&#x27;t have to worry about the glitter not staying suspended in the liquid.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m put off by the smell, but if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a nice collection.</li>
            <li>I use a base and top coat and the color will last about 4 days, which for me is perfect (I&#x27;m always changing the color of my nails.)</li>
            <li>When they first arrived, one of m boxes was completely busted and there was nail polish everywhere.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m put off by the smell, but if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a nice collection.dget, particularly if you want them for stamping.</li>
            <li>They dry pretty quick</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty...even better than I expected!!</li>
            <li>the polish chips easily, aftre about 3 days and barely any real maneuvering (didnt open soda cans or scratch and pick at things to make them chip)</li>
            <li>Daughter loves her new polish!</li>
            <li>Some are deep tones, like the purple and the blue, others are more bright tones, such as the green.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than used to the smell of typical nail polish, but this is a step beyond that.</li>
            <li>More than half of the nail polishes stain my nails.  </li>
            <li>All of the colors look good, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about only using a few.  </li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant and not washed out.</li>
            <li>I keep them separated to use only as decoration on top of a different coat</li>
            <li>LOVE THE THICKNESS OF THE POLISH, THOUGH I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE THICK BRUSHES</li>
            <li>r vibrant for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more Kleancolor polish for her in the future!</li>
            <li>I love a lot of these colors but BE CAREFUL and use a clear bottom coat.</li>
            <li>The colors of these polishes are beautiful but the quality itself is very poor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone who loves metallic</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It had wild colors in it for Mom who likes those colors and more subdued colors for other Mom who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t put any of these on a clean nail yet, just over my old polish, but the colours are very pretty and very metallic and seem to cover up the nail polish i put them over, so they must be pretty thick in substance.  </li>
            <li>I put on the metallic fuschia and layered Chunky Holo Fuschia over it and WOW!!</li>
            <li>I put on the metallic fuschia and layered Chunky Holo Fuschia over it and WOW!!</li>
            <li>The green in particular stained my nails more</li>
            <li>(typically this makes it last a few days longer, last time I applied the red this way it lasted 10 days!).&lt;br /&gt;Always apply clear top coat for the best metallic shine.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how vibrant the colors are on your nails!  </li>
            <li>I read in other reviews on the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be buying these again once the old ones finish out, so I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite shade&#x27;s is the metallic green.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is not lasting long but the colors are stylish.</li>
            <li>I will have tons of fun with this kit, and may get the bigger metallic assortment just so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, these are way worth the price.</li>
            <li>Gets scrapped after few hours, never lasts more than a day.</li>
            <li>I wash too many dishes for it to last too long on the fingernails.</li>
            <li>No they are normal size.</li>
            <li>Only lasts on nails one day, however it is worth it.</li>
            <li>those just aren&#x27;t my normal colors.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice but delivery was slow</li>
            <li>The polish does dry fast,  but the polish doesn&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t apply a good clear coat.</li>
            <li>The drying time takes a long time, but I also purchased Seche Vite fast dry top coat, and with the two combined</li>
            <li>The polishes are beautiful and are not too thin or thick, making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Definitely made it fun to expand my horizons on incorporating new colors in my designs.</li>
            <li>Very minor chipping after several days of wear without a top coat.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have time to wait around for them to dry, then you definitely need the top coat I talked about.</li>
            <li>The color is strong enough to where you only need one coat.</li>
            <li>They also dry in a normal amount of time (use a fast dry top coat to speed things up.)</li>
            <li>It seems like a formula for kids that would be easy to remove, but certainly not worth the price.</li>
            <li>The finish looks just like a brand new car, sparkling in the sun.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t see the glitter much, but the nail is constantly changing color as you move your hand.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t see the glitter much, but the nail is constantly changing color as you move your hand.  </li>
            <li>the white and light blue are kinda sparkly just so you</li>
            <li>Dry as quick as the drugstore NYC nail polishes.</li>
            <li>just make sure you use a good base coat</li>
            <li>The only down side to these polishes is the smell as it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and this polish does NOT smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do be aware you always need to use a good base coat or heck use a layer of top coat, especially on the pinks and greens.</li>
            <li>The dry time seemed pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>soooo pretty, and very solid, does not need to be going over and over.</li>
            <li>I am a professional Nail Stylist and I use these even with my stamping plates !</li>
            <li>There are pretty colors, but the polish starts coming off the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is in the formula that causes that smell, but it makes me think these aren&#x27;t the most non-toxic polishes out there.</li>
            <li>second downside is that some of them stain pretty severely.</li>
            <li>far as the seller - they get a 5 gold star rating!</li>
            <li>These polishes are vivid and lustrous.</li>
            <li>So far these polishes are beyond my expectations!</li>
            <li>Be aware that the yellow color</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to try the other colors.</li>
            <li>I have used several of the other metallics now, and I really love them.</li>
            <li>Completely opaque in one coat!</li>
            <li>The colors are vivid.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful &amp; stay in artificial nail products well.</li>
            <li>I took some pictures but couldn&#x27;t show the full beauty of them my fav is the pink and fuchsia.</li>
            <li>Good nail polish except for yellow and green- these two colors stain your nails yellow and that doesn&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li>I had made sure beforehand to put on my best base coat, but while painting on the green I messed up on my thumb nail.</li>
            <li>In fact, they are so easy to apply, even the little princesses can use them.</li>
            <li>Yes the smell is a little strong</li>
            <li>You will need a high gloss top coat as the polish dries dull.</li>
            <li>A few of them leave your nails fairly tinted after use if you don&#x27;t use a base coat, but other than that these are great!</li>
            <li>Instead I got a very pretty pearl pink and 3 &amp;#</li>
            <li>over the white to get it to dry better, but only the very top layer dried with the polish still wet underneath.</li>
            <li>Along with the quality the price is amazing, spent less on this set</li>
            <li>Love these, but my twelve set did not include a yellow, instead was a black matte, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used super expensive nail polish brands and not had better luck.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried three, and I&#x27;m sure these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>My favorite manicure so far was the orange, mango and yellow sponged into a gradient with black tiger stripes stamped</li>
            <li>Close up, you can see that there is extremely fine glitter in the polish, but a few inches away, all you see is color and SHINE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous to order them when I had never heard of the brand and the fact that the cost was so cheap,but they themselves aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>The only colors that don&#x27;t stamp are white and yellow which is fine</li>
            <li>I love the colors and how they look on my nails, but some of these colors stain my nails and skin which is hard to remove.</li>
            <li>Other reviews I read said the delivery was quick, but this is not the case.</li>
            <li>The metallic polish can be a bit difficult to remove, so I use pure acetone and can get it off fairly easily with pure acetone!  </li>
            <li>As for the shipping I had no problem with broken bottles or anything, I got all the colors in the picture and they all look amazing.</li>
            <li>and I used two coats and a clear to coat</li>
            <li>so I recommend two clear coats to seal in color.</li>
            <li>I use two coats of &amp;#34;Sinful Colors&amp;#34; clear coat #1064 or one coat of G.N.P. &amp;#34;Ultimate Nail Hardener&amp;#34; by Diamond Cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I wear a coat of clear under all my nail polish</li>
            <li>The colors are even brighter with the clear coat.</li>
            <li>they take a long time to dry, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>The only real downside I have found so far is my polish started chipping after a day.</li>
            <li>I make glass animal eyes with this set using clear glass cabochons.</li>
            <li>One coat completely covers, even masking old layers.</li>
            <li>Use an old nail buffing bar and just a couple swipes of the non-buffing side then apply color</li>
            <li>The colors are AWSOME , very pretty my fav is the pink!  </li>
            <li>So far 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I assume this would bleed on natural nail as well?&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li>massive variety of colors and types i really like the set</li>
            <li>: This nail polish completely ruined my nails.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>my adult niece&#x27;s birthday was grab bag of cosmetics items</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Kleancolor started charging premium price soon per bottle.</li>
            <li>I was real nervious when I purchased these cause some of the reviews, But I figured it was only 12$</li>
            <li>Package came early, all items accounted for.. no cracked bottles and the quality</li>
            <li>Completely destroyed the nail with color all the way through.</li>
            <li>If you put on natural nails beware.....</li>
            <li>If you put on natural nail use the PH bond to dehidrate the nail so it will stay on longer/better as the nail has no oil on it.</li>
            <li>The nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip and our nail look professionally done.</li>
            <li>As for how they hold up on natural nails, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s even with a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order the neon colors next</li>
            <li>No duplicates, no broken or open bottles either.</li>
            <li>None thus far</li>
            <li>The white here is not an opaque white you would use for stamping if you wanted actual white, but you can still stamp with it and its more of a silvery glitter.</li>
            <li>Got these for my 13 yr old daughter who loves to do nails.</li>
            <li>That said, it chips the next day, not matter how much prep you do to your nails.  </li>
            <li>The color stayed on my toes for a few days without chipping, but always chipped off my finger nails the same day, even with using a bottom and top coat to help it stay on.</li>
            <li>True, the polish doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Fun for kids&#x27; play manicures maybe, but not if you actually want your mani to last.</li>
            <li>The color stayed  on my toes for  a few days without  chipping, but always chipped off my finger nails the same day, even with using a bottom and top coat to help is stay on.  </li>
            <li>of the colors are heavily pigmented, rich, vivid, jewel-like colors.</li>
            <li>and these do stand out because silky and with false nails these are colorful and great but even without false these are very neat to exper....</li>
            <li>Was not impressed, may look good on acrylic nails but chipped away on natural nails</li>
            <li>metallic white is more obviously glittery, and the black seems more flat than the other colors.  </li>
            <li>I figured at least some of the positive ones must be true.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, well all but the white which is more like a thick glitter.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant &amp; the polish is thick &amp; goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Now, the picture doesn&#x27;t really show how shimmery they are--they are not the flat metallics you might expect.</li>
            <li>One coat coverage, no fuss no mess.</li>
            <li>On the down side, the polish does not stay on for more than 2 days and despite applying a top coat, the colors stain your nails and its difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>Although the colors are pretty, the polish chips off the same or next day.</li>
            <li>although the colors are pretty, the polish chips off the same  or next day.  </li>
            <li>actually, because they stained both my nails and my daughters nails, and we scrubbed more than usual with nail polish remover...</li>
            <li>My only complaint was the strange smell, though it was more appealing then the average nail polish.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and you really only need one coat which lasts.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vivid and it is thick enough that you don&#x27;t have to put more than one coat.</li>
            <li>but they do chip easily and the green turned my nail yellow</li>
            <li>however, sadly, it doesnt stay on nails more than one day because it is not as strong as other nail polishers.</li>
            <li>Some bottles apparently were old, Polish not usable</li>
            <li>I used Metallic Green and as of today MOST of the yellow staining is finally grown out.</li>
            <li>No late than 3 days later, I got my replacements.</li>
            <li>So far I have used the pink (which I&#x27;m absolutely in love with), the aqua, and the green.</li>
            <li>The first color that I tried was the magenta/metallic pink.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long lasting, super sparkly, and comes in 12 different shades!</li>
            <li>The metallic white doesn&#x27;t stamp well, but all the other colors work better than expected.</li>
            <li>They dry fast, too.</li>
            <li>and they dry really fast.</li>
            <li>The polish is pretty, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li>However because the polish is  thick it peels off easily.</li>
            <li>The Kleancolor Nail Polish don&#x27;t get thick at all - they still go on just as easily as they did the day I bought them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it with a thick top coat next time and see if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>give myself 3-4 new manis a week, so I never have anything on long enough to worry about a lot of chipping, but so far these hold up just as long as my higher end brands.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the colors, but as other reviewers have stated, the paint smells very strong even after a few days on the nails!</li>
            <li>The Pink when I put on my sister&#x27;s nails was more of a dark red color.</li>
            <li>Most polish gets thick after a year and you have to replace - Not these!</li>
            <li>This set  has vibrant colors and is very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>I do know that most of this polish has a very thick consistency and it makes it hard to do nail art with and draw fine lines.</li>
            <li>For the price I am certainly not complaining though as it stays better than I expected for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The first color I tried for nail art was Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Red\\&quot;, which I used to make a small simple heart over the top of my smile line with a light gray base &amp; darker gray tip.</li>
            <li>The other down side to them is they chip easily and are not are as shinny as in the photo.</li>
            <li>So far I have used the metallic purple and metallic white.</li>
            <li>No regrets in buying this product.</li>
            <li>I painted my finger nails with about 4 different colors so far</li>
            <li>I thought they might be smaller, but was surprised with there size..</li>
            <li>Ive only tried the metallic so far</li>
            <li>By third day it I completely chipped and almost 1/2 off your nails.</li>
            <li>I have to agree that the green stained my nails a light yellow, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal as I was repainting them</li>
            <li>So far I have only used one color one time.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than I would have expected, you could get by with one coat.</li>
            <li>Most of my bottles of polish were broken......</li>
            <li>Price may be good, but the quality suffers.</li>
            <li>This polish will stain nails, so use good base coat first.</li>
            <li>Over a year later and these polishes are still thin and easy to put on!</li>
            <li>On the other hand.. It stains your real nail.</li>
            <li>It was very well packaged and even combined with my other order of cleancolor polishes</li>
            <li>For the price and for stamping your nail I love this nail polish only complaint is it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>However it arrived with one broken bottle - they were packaged nice and carefully.  </li>
            <li>My only true complaint is that the white was very goopy &amp; didn&#x27;t want to dry.</li>
            <li>When I stamped my nails with Metallic Black, on first impression it looked \\&quot;grayer\\&quot; than the same design stamped with [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W</li>
            <li>When I stamped my nails with Metallic Black, on first impression it looked \\&quot;grayer\\&quot; than the same design stamped with [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used two colors so far, the blue and white.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get the green that I  ordered it for in the first place.</li>
            <li>They are in beautiful colors but they stain your nail even with a base coat on it.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful but even with a 2 layer base coat</li>
            <li>Chips right away, even with a base and top clear coat</li>
            <li>added bonus is the metallic yellow stamps as a fabulous sparkly gold, even over black and dark colors.  </li>
            <li>Not super fast shipping but</li>
            <li>Even if I get my nails professionally done, they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly and none of them were broken so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, but hard to remove because of the glitter</li>
            <li>the smell was so strong i knew they had broken before i even opened it.</li>
            <li>I got this thing in for my girlfriend, and the shipping fast very fast, although  one of the Nail Polish came open in the package, this could be a damage the happened in transit or poor packaging.</li>
            <li>Usually I have to keep adding coats to get the colors I want with other cheap brands.</li>
            <li>Only negative is it took a little more effort to take off.</li>
            <li>Without a clear coat they are not very shiny.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> they works amazing, the color is soooo shiny and metallic, i wish i could stress how beautiful they are,</li>

            <li> Kleancolor makes great polish and you can&#x27;t top the price anywhere!</li>
            <li> I had no problem with these chipping, but I have a very good top coat</li>
            <li> And they are a very good price, under $2 per bottle when most good polishes are over $5 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I love these metallic colors they are all very good quality and bright colors.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because of the metallic chemical compounds that make up the bright colors.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly bright.</li>
            <li> Colors are amazing and go on great.  </li>
            <li> Colors are bright.</li>
            <li> the colors are so bright.  </li>
            <li> Colors are bright and polish goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it is so bright and metallic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d liked to gotten more of a variety of colors, but for the price and for stamping, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors</li>

            <li> It works great with the designs i like to do and paints on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Although my grand daughter loved them, as I though she would, that was too close for comfort for me.</li>
            <li> The polish is awesome and it arrived real quik</li>
            <li> Polish colors are GREAT, they smell very strongly of acetone and polish peels off easily</li>

            <li> Great pricing for anyone wanting to build up their polish collection, and shipping was quick and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> But this nail polish is beautiful and fun</li>
            <li> Great buy, 12 Full size bottles for the price of two.</li>
            <li> Colors look great and they are full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the sleek look just as much as the awesome color</li>
            <li> Good thing was it was easy to remove without polish remover.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I was able to get these products at a very reasonable price and the colors are absolutely awesome.  </li>
            <li> Also chips very easily.</li>
            <li> After it dries it chips very very easily.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it to accent my nails with patterns or decorations since it chips and cracks very easily</li>
            <li> but the smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li> it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> The paint also peals off the fingernails very easy.</li>
            <li> and they are very strong smelling.</li>
            <li> All of them are very pretty and have gotten great complements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage in 2 coats and covers are even more vibrant than as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase and shipping was pretty quick!</li>
            <li> i really like the colors they are very bright</li>
            <li> Awesome Stamping Polish may leave a stain if applied directly to the nail</li>
            <li> Not used it yet, but they sure look nice in the shelf...</li>
            <li> Great sleepover fun for kids birthday party.  </li>
            <li> So for my opinion of this set is that even if it turns out to just be ok for wear and durability, it will work for me because I ruin everything and can&#x27;t have nice things.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m really impressed</li>
            <li> Selection of colors are not overbearing but classy and trendy!!!</li>
            <li> Got my package uber early so that was awesome.</li>
            <li> They look great and if your nails are in good shape, they will last a good 3-5 days with no chipping.  </li>
            <li> Or what kind of top coat you use.</li>
            <li> makes it so easy!....</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this by far is my favorite purchase from Amazon just because the gorgeous colors &amp; the look make me so happy.</li>
            <li> BUT... the colors aren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; colors anyway, so they&#x27;re perfect for weekends and special occasions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again this is a very good movie that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a defective bottle, and they replaced it pleasantly and quickly.</li>
            <li> this set was ideal: Reasonably priced and so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Good for one-night special occasionas though.</li>
            <li> But the rest of the colors are just as good as some of the konad special polishes.</li>
            <li> The shine is stellar and you could even get away with one coat (the sign of a great lacquer).  </li>
            <li> Well, at first I was very happy, the colors are beautiful and only needed one coat, and the polish stayed on well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> A good deal for 12 full size bottles.</li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> This is very cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> Very bright and vivid colors.</li>
            <li> but it did, bright and boldly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also shipped quickly with good packaging.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, the paint is good, but it doesn&#x27;t survive a shower without peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> These colors are so vibrant and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> all the others are highly pigmented and work beautifully as stamping polish.</li>

            <li> sum up, it&#x27;s a good set for the nail artist on a budget, particularly if you want them for stamping.</li>
            <li> The nail polish has a really strong odor I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it is strong at all.</li>
            <li> They have a STRONG smell too.</li>
            <li> I have used about 4 of the colors so far and have loved each one, can&#x27;t wait to use more.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars for this product because I absolutely loved the color and how nice it looks with only one coat.</li>
            <li> She is a 5 yoa fasionista and having her own nail polish (with mom&#x27;s supervision) was exciting and made her feel important.  </li>
            <li> Very vivid and bright colors.</li>
            <li> awesome with chunky glitter on top or just plain.</li>
            <li> Got 12 different colors which are all beautiful.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re all beautiful though, especially the aqua.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors, only issue is one color was broke when I got it</li>
            <li> While it covers nicely and the colors are so very nice, since I started using it (changing colors every other day and layering it on,</li>

            <li> but cheap</li>

            <li> This is cheap in both the price and the quality.</li>
            <li> but I did not get the free earrings</li>
            <li> I was able to stamp with each of the colors onto white paper and got good results with all of them except</li>
            <li> I really wasnt expecting such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this set, because I brought another one right after.</li>
            <li> right I&#x27;am enjoying it alot.</li>
            <li> the bottles are full size,  at a nail shop you could easily pay from $9  to $15 a bottle...</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> When this order first arrived, I wanted to try them all!!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered, just as they appear in the pic!!</li>
            <li> very worth buying the set.</li>
            <li> These really are a nice set that spans a wide range of beautiful metallic colors.</li>
            <li> The colors were interesting, but when they cannot last a full day, what good does it do?</li>
            <li> The colors are so amazing and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish itself dries rather quickly and it doesnt chip off easily.</li>
            <li> I noticed my nails becoming very brittle and the top layer peeling off.</li>
            <li> The colors are bold the smell is a Lil strong but its not all that bothersome.</li>
            <li> It came in 5 days early then expected in great condition and the colors are beautiful higher than my expectations</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not really what I think of when I think &#x27;metallic&#x27; these colors have a great shine to them and apply easily.</li>
            <li> originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a basecoat first.  </li>
            <li> You have a color for almost every outfit When people ask where I got them I tell them Amazon where I buy ALL of my unique nail polishes</li>
            <li> They are bright, beautiful, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Go for it, this is totally worth your money!</li>
            <li> Its pretty potent.  </li>
            <li> but this was an awesome deal even considering I wouldn&#x27;t usually buy some of the colors.</li>
            <li> They got here before the expected delivery date and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pass it up, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> She opened them up and was SO excited to see the range of colors.</li>
            <li> All the colors are so pretty:-)</li>
            <li> but she is so excited about it that she has repainted her nails every 2 or 3 days since christmas (when she got them).</li>
            <li> Still, worth it!</li>
            <li> Not high quality polish but many bright colors.  </li>
            <li> I loved different colors and it stands the advantage that its cheap.</li>
            <li> The polish goes on effortlessly and is super smooth.</li>
            <li> , I wash my hands and clean all day.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> These colors are just fantastic, fun, and rich.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the bottles had leaked during shipping so that bottle isn&#x27;t full &amp; it was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> the only downfall of this nail polish is that it chips VERY easily!</li>
            <li> colors are amazing and bright in FULL bottles that are usual size.</li>
            <li> Wow this product that i bought was amazing</li>
            <li> I ordered these on a Sunday and they were at my house on Wednesday, love the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> love the colors bt nail polish tend to chip off very easly</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that I only needed one coat of polish to get complete coverage and a bright, beautiful color.</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive nail polish and the colors are true to the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Dries really fast love it</li>
            <li> it really only requires one good coat.</li>
            <li> True to color, arrived on time.</li>

            <li> One coat for full coverage of every color.</li>
            <li> I really love them so much.</li>
            <li> These are totally and completely gorgeous.  </li>

            <li> These are full of metallic color colors are as they appear</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show the shimmer as well as in person, the but the hues are true to color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The colors are gorgeous, they dry quickly and apply easy.</li>
            <li> I can tell that most of them will work very well for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> Love the polish and it came very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad buy for the amount of polish you get.</li>
            <li> The shiny green looks great on my toes and was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> That is solved though easily with a clear top coat.</li>
            <li> I will agree that the smell is pretty strong, but it&#x27;s nail polish...</li>
            <li> these are pretty colors, but they chip really easily.</li>
            <li> I am impressed, not only the colors of product but the fast delivery and the price was outstanding  compared to local merchants.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Flakes quickly and stains the nails.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive way to start off your nail polish collection, this is a good option--with a few notable downsides.</li>
            <li> basic colors and good colore ,,quick service and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of ideas from playing around and a lot of compliments on my manicure ... which was bold and metallic.  </li>
            <li> I love how metallic this particular polish is.</li>
            <li> and it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> Polish is awesome... will definitely purchase in the future...</li>
            <li> They are bright and shiny metallics that are nice and not to thick but not to thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky me</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> ...chips too quick..</li>
            <li> They do have a tendency to bleed some so be sure to top coat before doing nail art especially lighter colored acrylic paint.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on smooth and evenly, covering completely with one coat and no base coat needed!</li>
            <li> Drys quick.</li>
            <li> Though this isn&#x27;t a known brand of nail polish, it has the same awesome qualities as any big brand like Essie or Opi.</li>
            <li> Colors are great only thing is you have to paint fast beause</li>
            <li> The Red, Mango, Orange and Yellow are perfect for fall.</li>
            <li> so u have to move quickly</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast an every polish was wrapped an secure .</li>
            <li> and they are all very rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are nearly one coat for full coverage, and for you stampers out there, most of these colors can be used to stamp with, and amazingly well, particularly since these are basically chromes, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> These colors are very pretty on.</li>
            <li> However, the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> so shipping is very fast!</li>
            <li> and theyre very pretty colors</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> I like the array of colors provided in the set- very pretty.</li>
            <li> Nail polish is very pretty</li>
            <li> the beautiful metallic green and after doing some cleaning around the house and playing basketball, her thumb nail had chipped after about 10 hours of wear.</li>
            <li> It could be useful for dotting but not for full color polish.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole bunch of coats to get the true color!</li>
            <li> shimmer polish was much thicker than the rest, and polish may chip easily.</li>
            <li> So far they look pretty and a nice size esp.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, drys fast.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors - the green had a magnificent holo effect to it - but think I am going to reserve their use to stamping images on other polish since staining does seem to be a huge problem for this polish line.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I first did the swatches!</li>
            <li> I was excited with my first polish.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> They look better in person than in the picture , but they leave her nails looking professional!</li>
            <li> Definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> The colors look exactly like the photo!</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish super fast, a day before the expected delivery date, and was very pleased with that!</li>
            <li> The colors are so rich and full of pigment that one coat is more than enough.</li>
            <li> They are bright and there is such a large variety.</li>
            <li> I recommend these nail polishes to anyone who wants beautiful and vibrant, durable colors for a low price.</li>
            <li> Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on buying so much nail polish so cheaply</li>
            <li> and I really would recommend them since they are so cheap</li>
            <li> In my opinion these are nice nail polishes that are basically the same size as the Sinful Colors nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really slow and the polish starts chipping in hours, even with a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Got here early, and I LOVE the colors....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would stay clear of this product if you want to keep healthy nails.</li>
            <li> I have  used several of these colors they came out really nice and lasted a week.</li>
            <li> and when they came a couple of bottles were broken and had spilled all over the rest of them and the package...cleaned them up as best I could .</li>
            <li> I gave these to my ten year old granddaughter and my daughter asked if she could borrow them because the colors are so great.</li>
            <li> I think for the price this product is worth it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> However, when it comes time to get them off, they aren&#x27;t so fun.</li>
            <li> they were inexpensive and not a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s because I use gel builder it adhires better to it then natural nails</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Metallic White\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t metallic at all but more like clear lumpy, glittery glue.</li>
            <li> I have no noticed any residual staining and the color lasts well with a clear top coat applied.  </li>
            <li> And I want to try a clear coat on top to see if it helps the chipping.</li>
            <li> certainly worth it</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs worth it though to not have a polish that chips and wears off the day after you spend an hour giving yourself a manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are fun colors.</li>
            <li> And you must use a clear top coat.</li>
            <li> Still, it was a fun gift to get for her as she uses a lot of nail polish to paint nails.</li>
            <li> Fun gift for preteen/teen girl</li>
            <li> The colors are fun and metallic.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how many of the colors</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty cool colors.</li>
            <li> So just be sure to use a bottom clear coat.</li>
            <li> colors are a lot of fun to mix and match and they stay on for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had faster drying polishes, but this is still worth it.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the best wear time possible, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought so much of the kleancolor polish because I love the beautiful vibrant colors that I really have never found in any other brand!  </li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly also..</li>
            <li> They are so vibrant and they came really quick!</li>
            <li> chips VERY easily even putting a clear coat on it doesn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li> I literally have on about 5 of the colors right now (rainbow nails)</li>
            <li> (I have some on right now)</li>
            <li> I had done all of my nails on my right hand with the color.</li>
            <li> Chipped off right after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> but after I applied them they would start to chip right away.</li>
            <li> but I guess your taking a gamble if you&#x27;ll get the right colors.</li>
            <li> I can paint my nails right before bed with no worries.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time and was packaged well</li>
            <li> I tried the blue on and it is such a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> So pretty is worth it though.</li>
            <li> its the real brand as described (Kleancolor) &amp; all the bottles were full, not damaged.</li>
            <li> Only 2 weren&#x27;t suitable for stamping.  </li>
            <li> Four good days without chipping IF you use a good base and top coat</li>
            <li> and  if you were to buy these in a store they would cost at least $7 or more each I love these and get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly endorse this product; Great color, easy to use, you get large bottles, and it&#x27;s really cheap at a little more than a dollar per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put on the metallic red right away, right on top of yesterday&#x27;s manicure.  </li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Realy nice bright colors, but difficult to remove</li>
            <li> Nice and opaque, the colors dry well except for the silver.</li>
            <li> and it was very neatly packaged and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors and long lasting finish!</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and was at my door a week before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors is very nice, but they chipped very easily even though I put a base coat, two layers of color and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Years ago L&#x27;Oreal had a polish called Seafleur, and this is very much like that.  </li>

            <li> This is definitely worth the price and shipped fast.</li>

            <li> I would defiantly say if your thinking about getting them do it!They are pretty stinky like others have  said even tho</li>
            <li> Dries fast too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and they only need one coat to be opaque.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this brand</li>
            <li> (I thought I had gotten duplicates at first until reading the labels and swiping some polish on nail to see the difference).  </li>
            <li> Love all the different metallic&#x27;s colors</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this.</li>
            <li> All the colors are exactly as they appear in the pic</li>
            <li> ,I would most definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Too pretty.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this brand of polish, I just love the colors, the finish, and the consistency.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors and cheep price.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 days before it chips and peels off.  </li>
            <li> colors are pretty sitting on decorative tray on my dresser..</li>
            <li> I was able to stamp with each color except the white.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but the colors peels after wearing for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The headphones arrived first.</li>
            <li> it doesnt was a white that looks more glittery than metallic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but chips within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I just love them, really only needs one coat</li>
            <li> One coat was all it took, I used the Orange first.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate your feedback and time!</li>
            <li> So I hesitated on ordering these at first.</li>
            <li> First time ordering nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Online .</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly like the ones shown.</li>
            <li> the top layer, starting from the ends, would separate and break off, or just chip off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> now I mostly use this polish for my art projects and such.</li>
            <li> set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached swatches in natural light.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I love the colors</li>
            <li> For the most part only needed one coat!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty</li>
            <li> I LOVE these, colors are awesome, the only thing is that they have a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li> : Very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Again, very inexpensive a dollar a bottle!</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t use nail polish on my fingernails at all - only my toes :)</li>
            <li> I ordered my first set of these metallics.</li>
            <li> I love all the different shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> Pretty pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Still pretty tho.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my grand daughter for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li> A few friends have even bought these because they loved the colors.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the odor is kind of odd and very strong, but they are so pretty that it&#x27;s not gonna stop me from using them.</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and bold, it is hard to decide which one to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also fairly versatile--I was able to use the white and the red in combination with a few other polishes to produce an excellent water marble, which is certainly not true of most metallics.</li>
            <li> The metallic white is a great color but not great for stamping at all but the metallic yellow, metallic mango, is great for stamping.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a top quality nail polish you should really look into more expensive nail polish, but you get what you pay for and for the price I paid I should have known better.</li>
            <li> These colors are so vibrant and pretty!  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a nice polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four colors and so far I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> every other polish I own)</li>
            <li> them with a top coat such as Seche vite, it really brings out the colors and they are extremely vivid!!!</li>
            <li> When i finally got these polishes i was definitely excited!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this nailpolish its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They were delivered to me super fast, none of the bottles were broken or damaged, and the colors are great.</li>
            <li> The Pink, Aqua, Fuchsia, Purple and Green are perfect for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The polishes do chip like a mofo, so make sure you use at least a top coat</li>
            <li> Great vibrant colors and long lasting wear!</li>
            <li> The polish dries quickly, and the color stays vivid.</li>
            <li> In sunlight it has a very cool yellow flash.  </li>
            <li> ; colors(the rest were the right ones in the photo), which would have been fine if it was actually a color I liked, but I never wear black nail polish...</li>
            <li> They came packaged extremely well, which was good as the package had a particularly strong odor, alerting me to be careful opening.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what this polish is made of, but it cannot be good for your nails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, without a REALLY good top coat the polish chips fast.  </li>
            <li> After trying them out, she raved about the metallic sheen, the thick coverage, and the beautiful, vivid colors.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how good they are</li>
            <li> so easily you will have to reapply it daily</li>
            <li> Colors are very vibrant and I like the metallic look.  </li>
            <li> Very vibrant</li>
            <li> It drys really quick and so far no chipping..</li>
            <li> Metallic Red was easy to work with &amp; made the heart look almost like a glittery sticker.  </li>
            <li> Chips so easily it will last about a day</li>
            <li> , it is shimmery it dries fast and stays pretty also very sturdy</li>
            <li> Very vibrant color.</li>
            <li> Good polish, long lasting!</li>
            <li> they came in just a few days after ordering them and every color is so beautiful especially on the toes</li>
            <li> I am in love with every single color in this set.</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for children.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the colors are beautiful especially the black one!</li>
            <li> B007U90J5U Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]]</li>
            <li> The colors are great and they came quickly, but sadly they tend to chip alot.</li>
            <li> Every color is very vibrant and beautiful, but goes on a little thick and chips pretty easily.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors is excellent, spanning the entire rainbow plus black and white.</li>
            <li> The polish has very high opacity</li>
            <li> I absolutely love EVERY single color!  </li>
            <li> the colors are EXACTLY as bright (if not more vibrant) in real life as shown in the photo.  </li>
            <li> This is so good that it is hard to remove with polish remover.  </li>
            <li> The polish looks great on, it&#x27;s wicked-witch-of-the-west green, only metallic.  </li>
            <li> Although this nail polish is cheap and you get 12 different one I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it chips</li>
            <li> Colors are very vibrant!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries fast compared to brands like OPI and China Glaze.</li>
            <li> You have to put these on a color wheel to see the real color.</li>
            <li> they are wonderful and for the cost you would be crazy not to buy.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t stain the whole nail</li>
            <li> very mucht</li>
            <li> My favorite thus far is the metallic white, which lasted me a whole week without the slightest chip.</li>
            <li> They are packaged well and they shipped very well; no breakage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because I needed an extra purchase in order to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li> These arrived so fast</li>
            <li> it was ready to go.  </li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t rate then quality of polish until I hear from my granddaughter after she uses the items.</li>
            <li> However, even if you only use 11 of the shades out of this set, it&#x27;s still a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> They really &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; when looking at them on my nails.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product</li>
            <li> Did not like it much</li>
            <li> I thought these colors were wonderful until I put the green on my nails and then a week later took off the polish to find my nail beds were YELLOW!!</li>
            <li> If you like nail stamping as much as I do, then get this set.</li>
            <li> The red is a deep cranberry red, great for fall and winter.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These came really fast.</li>
            <li> and it covers very well.</li>
            <li> OK does not bother me... and NO the smell will not stay on your nails after the bottle is closed</li>
            <li> and she really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast, all polishes arrived unbroken, and I received all of the colors that I was supposed to.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re all very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> I really like them .but</li>
            <li> I was really looking for purple chrome nail polish</li>
            <li> I really like this set.  </li>
            <li> This polish is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I used a gel top coat that can be taken off with acetone ( not real gel that you need to soak your nails) and my polish started to wear after 3 days.  </li>
            <li> They are all very pigmented and work for my stamping and water marble nail art.</li>
            <li> but it chips really fast.</li>
            <li> unlike some cheap brands that need several coats just to match how the color looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The whole nail art Thing .....</li>
            <li> I really like the products.  </li>
            <li> Great colors, broken brush on a couple bottles.</li>
            <li> I have bought much stronger polish from the store.</li>
            <li> The finish is very metallic.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I tried using a bottom coat of protective polish but it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> The polish seems to stay on really well</li>
            <li> The color payoff with is more than expected.</li>
            <li> I applied a top coat the last time and it increased the staying time a few days more.  </li>
            <li> I use them for stamping and they work very well for stamping also.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use these</li>
            <li> The complaints about the smell are very overblown.</li>
            <li> Started getting really worried so contacted the company</li>
            <li> These are very metallic looking</li>
            <li> Also cover with a clear top coat to make it last a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the shipping because when I got them they were all in bubble wrap in two packs and 3 of the bottles were broken open and they was nail polish everywhere.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pigmented and were more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast, which is huge since I often ruin a manicure because I just don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> All of the colors have a bit of shimmer to them but not like glitter which is perfect as the real glitter in other nail polishes tends to be hard to remove.</li>
            <li> ; is no where near right.</li>
            <li> The Green works best over pale colors as well, but the rest work with almost any combination, and you get an entire rainbow of colors for the price of one or two Konad Special polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add more photos as I try the other colors.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, however one of the bottles broke all over the other bottles.</li>
            <li> love the colors but the nail polish seems to chip easier than other polishes</li>
            <li> The polish has a stronger smell than other brands, but for the amount &amp; quality I get for the price, I don&#x27;t mind :)</li>
            <li> Even the white metallic is fun, it&#x27;s like snow on your fingertips!  </li>
            <li> The colors are so rich one coat is enough.</li>
            <li> These are ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed any nail staining yet like other reviewers have said but</li>
            <li> actually purchased them for stamping after seeing some swatches on the internet that used the KleanColor Metallic Orange, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold about as well as other brands I have used, I got about a week with no chips adding a top coat to it.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and I only need one coat to cover the whole nail.</li>
            <li> The only color that doesn&#x27;t show up really well is the yellow, although if you use it over white or another really light color it would work ok.</li>
            <li> The husband noticed my nails in the green shade and said it was the prettiest polish he&#x27;d ever seen me wear :) I highly recommend this polish!!</li>
            <li> Since there are so many other reviews I will make mine short and sweet.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering from Kleancolor again in the near future to add more colors to my collection!</li>
            <li> But this batch didn&#x27;t smell as strong, so maybe they fixed that, or the last batch burned out the smell-center in my brain.  </li>
            <li> since its a really soft, slightly sticky kind of stamper.</li>
            <li> since its a really soft, slightly sticky kind of stamper.</li>
            <li> quality is not good, very easy to chip!</li>
            <li> Stays much longer than normal nail polish, don&#x27;t have to worry about the glitter not staying suspended in the liquid.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m put off by the smell, but if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a nice collection.</li>
            <li> I use a base and top coat and the color will last about 4 days, which for me is perfect (I&#x27;m always changing the color of my nails.)</li>
            <li> When they first arrived, one of m boxes was completely busted and there was nail polish everywhere.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m put off by the smell, but if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a nice collection.dget, particularly if you want them for stamping.</li>
            <li> They dry pretty quick</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty...even better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> the polish chips easily, aftre about 3 days and barely any real maneuvering (didnt open soda cans or scratch and pick at things to make them chip)</li>
            <li> Daughter loves her new polish!</li>
            <li> Some are deep tones, like the purple and the blue, others are more bright tones, such as the green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than used to the smell of typical nail polish, but this is a step beyond that.</li>
            <li> More than half of the nail polishes stain my nails.  </li>
            <li> All of the colors look good, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about only using a few.  </li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant and not washed out.</li>
            <li> I keep them separated to use only as decoration on top of a different coat</li>
            <li> LOVE THE THICKNESS OF THE POLISH, THOUGH I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE THICK BRUSHES</li>
            <li> r vibrant for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more Kleancolor polish for her in the future!</li>
            <li> I love a lot of these colors but BE CAREFUL and use a clear bottom coat.</li>
            <li> The colors of these polishes are beautiful but the quality itself is very poor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone who loves metallic</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It had wild colors in it for Mom who likes those colors and more subdued colors for other Mom who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t put any of these on a clean nail yet, just over my old polish, but the colours are very pretty and very metallic and seem to cover up the nail polish i put them over, so they must be pretty thick in substance.  </li>
            <li> I put on the metallic fuschia and layered Chunky Holo Fuschia over it and WOW!!</li>
            <li> I put on the metallic fuschia and layered Chunky Holo Fuschia over it and WOW!!</li>
            <li> The green in particular stained my nails more</li>
            <li> (typically this makes it last a few days longer, last time I applied the red this way it lasted 10 days!).&lt;br /&gt;Always apply clear top coat for the best metallic shine.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how vibrant the colors are on your nails!  </li>
            <li> I read in other reviews on the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be buying these again once the old ones finish out, so I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shade&#x27;s is the metallic green.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is not lasting long but the colors are stylish.</li>
            <li> I will have tons of fun with this kit, and may get the bigger metallic assortment just so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, these are way worth the price.</li>
            <li> Gets scrapped after few hours, never lasts more than a day.</li>
            <li> I wash too many dishes for it to last too long on the fingernails.</li>
            <li> No they are normal size.</li>
            <li> Only lasts on nails one day, however it is worth it.</li>
            <li> those just aren&#x27;t my normal colors.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice but delivery was slow</li>
            <li> The polish does dry fast,  but the polish doesn&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t apply a good clear coat.</li>
            <li> The drying time takes a long time, but I also purchased Seche Vite fast dry top coat, and with the two combined</li>
            <li> The polishes are beautiful and are not too thin or thick, making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Definitely made it fun to expand my horizons on incorporating new colors in my designs.</li>
            <li> Very minor chipping after several days of wear without a top coat.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have time to wait around for them to dry, then you definitely need the top coat I talked about.</li>
            <li> The color is strong enough to where you only need one coat.</li>
            <li> They also dry in a normal amount of time (use a fast dry top coat to speed things up.)</li>
            <li> It seems like a formula for kids that would be easy to remove, but certainly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The finish looks just like a brand new car, sparkling in the sun.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t see the glitter much, but the nail is constantly changing color as you move your hand.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t see the glitter much, but the nail is constantly changing color as you move your hand.  </li>
            <li> the white and light blue are kinda sparkly just so you</li>
            <li> Dry as quick as the drugstore NYC nail polishes.</li>
            <li> just make sure you use a good base coat</li>
            <li> The only down side to these polishes is the smell as it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to odors and this polish does NOT smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be aware you always need to use a good base coat or heck use a layer of top coat, especially on the pinks and greens.</li>
            <li> The dry time seemed pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> soooo pretty, and very solid, does not need to be going over and over.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Nail Stylist and I use these even with my stamping plates !</li>
            <li> There are pretty colors, but the polish starts coming off the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is in the formula that causes that smell, but it makes me think these aren&#x27;t the most non-toxic polishes out there.</li>
            <li> second downside is that some of them stain pretty severely.</li>
            <li> far as the seller - they get a 5 gold star rating!</li>
            <li> These polishes are vivid and lustrous.</li>
            <li> So far these polishes are beyond my expectations!</li>
            <li> Be aware that the yellow color</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to try the other colors.</li>
            <li> I have used several of the other metallics now, and I really love them.</li>
            <li> Completely opaque in one coat!</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful &amp; stay in artificial nail products well.</li>
            <li> I took some pictures but couldn&#x27;t show the full beauty of them my fav is the pink and fuchsia.</li>
            <li> Good nail polish except for yellow and green- these two colors stain your nails yellow and that doesn&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li> I had made sure beforehand to put on my best base coat, but while painting on the green I messed up on my thumb nail.</li>
            <li> In fact, they are so easy to apply, even the little princesses can use them.</li>
            <li> Yes the smell is a little strong</li>
            <li> You will need a high gloss top coat as the polish dries dull.</li>
            <li> A few of them leave your nails fairly tinted after use if you don&#x27;t use a base coat, but other than that these are great!</li>
            <li> Instead I got a very pretty pearl pink and 3 &amp;#</li>
            <li> over the white to get it to dry better, but only the very top layer dried with the polish still wet underneath.</li>
            <li> Along with the quality the price is amazing, spent less on this set</li>
            <li> Love these, but my twelve set did not include a yellow, instead was a black matte, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used super expensive nail polish brands and not had better luck.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried three, and I&#x27;m sure these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite manicure so far was the orange, mango and yellow sponged into a gradient with black tiger stripes stamped</li>
            <li> Close up, you can see that there is extremely fine glitter in the polish, but a few inches away, all you see is color and SHINE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to order them when I had never heard of the brand and the fact that the cost was so cheap,but they themselves aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> The only colors that don&#x27;t stamp are white and yellow which is fine</li>
            <li> I love the colors and how they look on my nails, but some of these colors stain my nails and skin which is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Other reviews I read said the delivery was quick, but this is not the case.</li>
            <li> The metallic polish can be a bit difficult to remove, so I use pure acetone and can get it off fairly easily with pure acetone!  </li>
            <li> As for the shipping I had no problem with broken bottles or anything, I got all the colors in the picture and they all look amazing.</li>
            <li> and I used two coats and a clear to coat</li>
            <li> so I recommend two clear coats to seal in color.</li>
            <li> I use two coats of &amp;#34;Sinful Colors&amp;#34; clear coat #1064 or one coat of G.N.P. &amp;#34;Ultimate Nail Hardener&amp;#34; by Diamond Cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I wear a coat of clear under all my nail polish</li>
            <li> The colors are even brighter with the clear coat.</li>
            <li> they take a long time to dry, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> The only real downside I have found so far is my polish started chipping after a day.</li>
            <li> I make glass animal eyes with this set using clear glass cabochons.</li>
            <li> One coat completely covers, even masking old layers.</li>
            <li> Use an old nail buffing bar and just a couple swipes of the non-buffing side then apply color</li>
            <li> The colors are AWSOME , very pretty my fav is the pink!  </li>
            <li> So far 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I assume this would bleed on natural nail as well?&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li> massive variety of colors and types i really like the set</li>
            <li> : This nail polish completely ruined my nails.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> my adult niece&#x27;s birthday was grab bag of cosmetics items</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Kleancolor started charging premium price soon per bottle.</li>
            <li> I was real nervious when I purchased these cause some of the reviews, But I figured it was only 12$</li>
            <li> Package came early, all items accounted for.. no cracked bottles and the quality</li>
            <li> Completely destroyed the nail with color all the way through.</li>
            <li> If you put on natural nails beware.....</li>
            <li> If you put on natural nail use the PH bond to dehidrate the nail so it will stay on longer/better as the nail has no oil on it.</li>
            <li> The nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip and our nail look professionally done.</li>
            <li> As for how they hold up on natural nails, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s even with a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to order the neon colors next</li>
            <li> No duplicates, no broken or open bottles either.</li>
            <li> None thus far</li>
            <li> The white here is not an opaque white you would use for stamping if you wanted actual white, but you can still stamp with it and its more of a silvery glitter.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 13 yr old daughter who loves to do nails.</li>
            <li> That said, it chips the next day, not matter how much prep you do to your nails.  </li>
            <li> The color stayed on my toes for a few days without chipping, but always chipped off my finger nails the same day, even with using a bottom and top coat to help it stay on.</li>
            <li> True, the polish doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Fun for kids&#x27; play manicures maybe, but not if you actually want your mani to last.</li>
            <li> The color stayed  on my toes for  a few days without  chipping, but always chipped off my finger nails the same day, even with using a bottom and top coat to help is stay on.  </li>
            <li> of the colors are heavily pigmented, rich, vivid, jewel-like colors.</li>
            <li> and these do stand out because silky and with false nails these are colorful and great but even without false these are very neat to exper....</li>
            <li> Was not impressed, may look good on acrylic nails but chipped away on natural nails</li>
            <li> metallic white is more obviously glittery, and the black seems more flat than the other colors.  </li>
            <li> I figured at least some of the positive ones must be true.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, well all but the white which is more like a thick glitter.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant &amp; the polish is thick &amp; goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Now, the picture doesn&#x27;t really show how shimmery they are--they are not the flat metallics you might expect.</li>
            <li> One coat coverage, no fuss no mess.</li>
            <li> On the down side, the polish does not stay on for more than 2 days and despite applying a top coat, the colors stain your nails and its difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Although the colors are pretty, the polish chips off the same or next day.</li>
            <li> although the colors are pretty, the polish chips off the same  or next day.  </li>
            <li> actually, because they stained both my nails and my daughters nails, and we scrubbed more than usual with nail polish remover...</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the strange smell, though it was more appealing then the average nail polish.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant and you really only need one coat which lasts.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vivid and it is thick enough that you don&#x27;t have to put more than one coat.</li>
            <li> but they do chip easily and the green turned my nail yellow</li>
            <li> however, sadly, it doesnt stay on nails more than one day because it is not as strong as other nail polishers.</li>
            <li> Some bottles apparently were old, Polish not usable</li>
            <li> I used Metallic Green and as of today MOST of the yellow staining is finally grown out.</li>
            <li> No late than 3 days later, I got my replacements.</li>
            <li> So far I have used the pink (which I&#x27;m absolutely in love with), the aqua, and the green.</li>
            <li> The first color that I tried was the magenta/metallic pink.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long lasting, super sparkly, and comes in 12 different shades!</li>
            <li> The metallic white doesn&#x27;t stamp well, but all the other colors work better than expected.</li>
            <li> They dry fast, too.</li>
            <li> and they dry really fast.</li>
            <li> The polish is pretty, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> However because the polish is  thick it peels off easily.</li>
            <li> The Kleancolor Nail Polish don&#x27;t get thick at all - they still go on just as easily as they did the day I bought them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it with a thick top coat next time and see if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> give myself 3-4 new manis a week, so I never have anything on long enough to worry about a lot of chipping, but so far these hold up just as long as my higher end brands.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the colors, but as other reviewers have stated, the paint smells very strong even after a few days on the nails!</li>
            <li> The Pink when I put on my sister&#x27;s nails was more of a dark red color.</li>
            <li> Most polish gets thick after a year and you have to replace - Not these!</li>
            <li> This set  has vibrant colors and is very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> I do know that most of this polish has a very thick consistency and it makes it hard to do nail art with and draw fine lines.</li>
            <li> For the price I am certainly not complaining though as it stays better than I expected for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The first color I tried for nail art was Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Red\\&quot;, which I used to make a small simple heart over the top of my smile line with a light gray base &amp; darker gray tip.</li>
            <li> The other down side to them is they chip easily and are not are as shinny as in the photo.</li>
            <li> So far I have used the metallic purple and metallic white.</li>
            <li> No regrets in buying this product.</li>
            <li> I painted my finger nails with about 4 different colors so far</li>
            <li> I thought they might be smaller, but was surprised with there size..</li>
            <li> Ive only tried the metallic so far</li>
            <li> By third day it I completely chipped and almost 1/2 off your nails.</li>
            <li> I have to agree that the green stained my nails a light yellow, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal as I was repainting them</li>
            <li> So far I have only used one color one time.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than I would have expected, you could get by with one coat.</li>
            <li> Most of my bottles of polish were broken......</li>
            <li> Price may be good, but the quality suffers.</li>
            <li> This polish will stain nails, so use good base coat first.</li>
            <li> Over a year later and these polishes are still thin and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> On the other hand.. It stains your real nail.</li>
            <li> It was very well packaged and even combined with my other order of cleancolor polishes</li>
            <li> For the price and for stamping your nail I love this nail polish only complaint is it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> However it arrived with one broken bottle - they were packaged nice and carefully.  </li>
            <li> My only true complaint is that the white was very goopy &amp; didn&#x27;t want to dry.</li>
            <li> When I stamped my nails with Metallic Black, on first impression it looked \\&quot;grayer\\&quot; than the same design stamped with [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W</li>
            <li> When I stamped my nails with Metallic Black, on first impression it looked \\&quot;grayer\\&quot; than the same design stamped with [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two colors so far, the blue and white.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the green that I  ordered it for in the first place.</li>
            <li> They are in beautiful colors but they stain your nail even with a base coat on it.  </li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but even with a 2 layer base coat</li>
            <li> Chips right away, even with a base and top clear coat</li>
            <li> added bonus is the metallic yellow stamps as a fabulous sparkly gold, even over black and dark colors.  </li>
            <li> Not super fast shipping but</li>
            <li> Even if I get my nails professionally done, they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It shipped very quickly and none of them were broken so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but hard to remove because of the glitter</li>
            <li> the smell was so strong i knew they had broken before i even opened it.</li>
            <li> I got this thing in for my girlfriend, and the shipping fast very fast, although  one of the Nail Polish came open in the package, this could be a damage the happened in transit or poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to keep adding coats to get the colors I want with other cheap brands.</li>
            <li> Only negative is it took a little more effort to take off.</li>
            <li> Without a clear coat they are not very shiny.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but the dark blue color stained my nails really badly.  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, it was a little different than normal but not horrible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to use it as a base color to stamp on top of because it has the potential to be pretty</li>
            <li> Smell is not as bad as others have stated and dry time is appropriate for standard non fast drying polish.  </li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and I&#x27;ve tried the blue, purple, white and green!</li>
            <li> Also not easy to remove - with pink and red colors specially, it leaves red hues on half of the finger.</li>
            <li> But I painted my fingernails and they held up through heavy lawn work, dog baths, even bowling; lasted 4 days so far without chipping, and I&#x27;m hard on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> At least the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> and they last long.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long through showers, cooking and washing</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that my metallic white bottle of polish was missing the brush completely.</li>
            <li> Polish last very long and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> The white is also the slowest to dry.</li>
            <li> These came very quickly and not a one broken!</li>
            <li> I only put 1 coat on and was surprised at the coverage I got with 1 coat until it dried.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and they were packaged well, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for 20+ years and rarely do I run into a product as horrible as this one was.....</li>
            <li> On the next manicure I tried stamping a mesh type pattern with Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Black\\&quot; over a clear base coat, painted the tips also with Metallic Black &amp; went over it with a top coat to give the impression of thigh high fishnet stockings.</li>
            <li> Metallic White has a strange consistency, different from the other colors, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or dry properly.</li>
            <li> They stain a little bit, but you can alleviate this by putting a couple coats of a nice base on first and letting them dry before applying.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for staining my nails and the smell, which isn&#x27;t strong but does smell worse than other polishes!</li>
            <li> but it helps if you use 100% acetone.n with Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Black\\&quot; over a clear base coat, painted the tips also with Metallic Black &amp; went over it with a top coat to give the impression of thigh high fishnet stockings.</li>
            <li> In the future I will only be wearing that one layered over other polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said, it smells extra bad/strong compared to regular polish.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when I took it off a few days later to try another color my nail&#x27;s were kinda a light green color I am not sure if it&#x27;s the nail polish</li>
            <li> The white did not show up well over the purple, it is white glitter on a clear base so its too transparent but it may look cool for subtle full nail designs - like white on cream.</li>
            <li> only 1 was open but it didn&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter loves nail polish and we&#x27;ve been using various combinations of these for the past month.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27; t stay on nearly as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> Oh and the pink only took one coat, these are thicker polishes.</li>
            <li> Removing it was a bit harder than regular nail polish</li>
            <li> If you are looking for long wear this IS NOT for you.</li>
            <li> WELL, AND TAKES A LONG TIME TO</li>
            <li> I received them earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> Not with all of them, just with a few of them, green for instance, or blue, or even hot pink.  </li>
            <li> I took it off with 100% acetone and it left a pink stain on my nails and cuticles as well as the skin around the nail.  </li>
            <li> but they are thick and most of them with the exception of the white go on with one coat, I put a white base first before using the metallic white.</li>
            <li> The polish is thin, and you can definitely tell the difference between this and higher quality polish.</li>
            <li> They are very fully pigmented and a bit thick, you could probably do your nails in one coat, but for stamping they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also used a good base coat and had no problems with stains on my nails.</li>
            <li> that any polish I&#x27;ve ever owned, and this despite the fact that I always apply a really good base coat.</li>
            <li> and this is with using a good base coat</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this brand does bleed, using a really good quality base coat will aid in overcoming this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (base would probably be a good idea, too).</li>
            <li> I usually redo my nails every week due to chipping and mainly wanting to try different colors.</li>
            <li> So I chose all but the black and white and went to town on my ten fingers!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the pink and black so far</li>
            <li> And no white, yellow or black.  </li>
            <li> I like how the colors look but like a lot of other people have said, they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Two of them had leaked some nail polish, but because the bottles were individually wrapped in paper, as well as being in bubbly bags, it wasn&#x27;t a big mess.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the nail polish chips very easily even with base and top coats applied.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails frequently with many different brands and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> of a hit-and-miss on the quality; I painted my toes and they chipped just from wearing my socks and boots the first day (and I used a base coat and top coat).</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell any different than any other polish out there.</li>
            <li> the polishes on the other hand I will order but from a different company..</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s requested several other sets as gifts now that she&#x27;s tried one out.  </li>
            <li> did stain a little bit, but nothing too major</li>
            <li> its not like other nailpolishes that are super thin and where you have to apply coat after coat after coat.</li>
            <li> smells worse then most and some of the colors arent as pictured and its really hard to get off</li>
            <li> They really are metallic, and have a subtle sparkle to them.</li>
            <li> The staining issue can also make it difficult to completely clean off the stamping plates</li>
            <li> The staining issue can also make it difficult to completely clean off the stamping plates</li>
            <li> Be warned, they take some time to dry.</li>
            <li> Seriously - for the price - you really should.</li>
            <li> The green reminds me of Tinkerbell, The red I&#x27;m calling Ruby slipper red cause</li>
            <li> its almost 2 weeks later and the yellow tint from the green wont go away.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of mixing the color with the clear to hopefully bind it better to the base.  </li>
            <li> Using a topcoat limited the chipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to end up wasting the expensive special polish I had while still trying to master the learning curve.</li>
            <li> The nail polish goes on dark, only need one coat!</li>
            <li> nail polish is horrible way to thick and smells very strong unlike reg nail polish and chips easy</li>
            <li> Some of the lids were a bit loose; perhaps they needed to be as they were coming to the desert in August.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only down side to this brand, for me anyway, is the smell.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down:</li>
            <li> I put it on and the very next day it was already half chipped off.</li>
            <li> The white chipped off half way through the day.</li>
            <li> The only one I don&#x27;t care for is the black</li>
            <li> its a week and a half later</li>
            <li> Also,  the orange, black , and red are a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I never received a green, dark blue, and the yellow one.</li>
            <li> even when using a base coat and top coat, it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> I had to use like 3 cotton balls on each hand or more just to get one coat of this nail polish off, when i usually only use 2 for both, which i find very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I gave the black away, however, it was really flat, even in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I gave the black away, however, it was really flat, even in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Its not opaque enough to use for stamping and too hard to work with as a regular polish.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but they stain your nails bad.</li>
            <li> Recieved it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s think enough that one coat is enough but thin enough</li>
            <li> and IF you are moderately careful with your nails.</li>
            <li> The colors are not really as shown and they chip whithin hours of getting nails  done.</li>
            <li> Lasts for only a few days-a plus if you change colors often.</li>
            <li> after a few short hours of wear!</li>
            <li> This is chappy polish, starts chipping within 24 hours after painting your nails also mine started clumping after only using a few times.</li>
            <li> and my fingernails are still highlighter YELLOW from the green.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT for the green and white  </li>
            <li> My only dislike about the set is that my neon/light green polish stained my nails</li>
            <li> But otherwise, be careful about staining.</li>
            <li> Nail polish never really dries...</li>
            <li> Especially the green.</li>
            <li> Got my package a few days earlier then said.</li>
            <li> I used the green for St. Patricks day and now my nails are yellow.  </li>
            <li> I only use these on top of another base coat.</li>
            <li> plan on trying a different brand of base and top coats to see if that helps with the chipping.  </li>
            <li> I took that off a few days later and it seemed to have lifted the pink stain?  </li>
            <li> If you are using them for stamping they go well over white and some go over black!</li>
            <li> I can confirm a lot of the typical complaints about these polishes--they smell a little funny, the surface may feel dry but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re dry beneath the surface, so they can be a little tricky, and some of them</li>
            <li> over it the black looked much darker &amp; shiny plus you could see the metallic sparkles again which added a certain something to the overall design.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problems I have encountered besides the Metallic White color being just awful in multiple ways, are the colors staining your fingernails &amp; the stamper.</li>

            <li> (Lasts as long as the typical drugstore brands)</li>
            <li> only issue I have is even using a really good base coat I have found that some of the colors really stained my nails badly.</li>
            <li> Received these in the gift the other day.</li>
            <li> got the other 4 colors.</li>
            <li> n purples along with all of the other colors in the picture.</li>
            <li> but im about to order other colors soon.</li>
            <li> It got over three of the other bottles.</li>
            <li> They came way before they were expected too !</li>
            <li> I usually pick them up for 1.50 a piece at my local daiso</li>
            <li> to me they just smell like any other nail polish.</li>
            <li> but they are quite expensive in stores and the cheaper ones aren&#x27;t as pretty.</li>
            <li> I am going to order other finishes from this brand, no doubt.</li>
            <li> These are lots of fun they are a tad bit difficult to remove but the colors are crazy fun</li>
            <li> When my girls and I are stuck in doors due to weather, we dig out the tackle box and paint out nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I cannot paint my nails that color at all due to no brush.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell like other nail polishes has.</li>
            <li> Be very careful getting them off.</li>
            <li> Stain your nails permanent, If you intend to use these as a base color beware, I only left the green polish for 3 days on my nail and they all turned yellow even after I soak my nails on pure acetone.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem though is that the polish goes on super thick so seamless, even lines are impossible.</li>
            <li> they gypped me on which is very disappointing because I love purple</li>
            <li> Her only complaint was that they seem to be a bit stinkier than other polishes.  </li>
            <li> but some of it was hard to get open</li>
            <li> The only thing that I did not care for was that it was hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> However, the polishes starts to chip off the next day and what doesn&#x27;t come off is hard to take off with remover.</li>
            <li> I have gotten other sets of Kleancolor polishes since I got these and have not been disappointed in any of them, I know people say they have a strong odor</li>
            <li> I expected that, but they are also very dark, opaque colors</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but if you are looking for a one night wear where you do not have to touch much, then this is for you.  </li>
            <li> Could be luck of the draw, but that was not fun to deal with.</li>
            <li> I used a base coat and a top coat</li>
            <li> We have tried it with base coat, top coat and alone and</li>
            <li> Chips in hours, even with base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I could always use it as a base to stamp on top of.</li>
            <li> Since the bottles were not boxed or inside a closed display case, I decided to keep a few for myself.  </li>
            <li> Not great for natural nail retention.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a base coat or the colors will stain your nails.</li>
            <li> Two of the nail polishes leaked a little but other than that I like the colors of the nail polishes</li>
            <li> The polish itself usually needs at least one treatment of OPI Lacquer Thinner as the polish is a little too thick and doesn&#x27;t coat well at first.</li>
            <li> - I am wearing a two tone ombre effect on my toes and black with chunky holo bluebell on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Mine started to come off in less tham 12 hours</li>
            <li> It chipped after less than a day</li>
            <li> &amp; my black didn&#x27;t come with the brush part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the black for stamping, and that turned out quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the black</li>
            <li> I also used this &#x27;base&#x27; to try out some glitter polishes on top of a few of these colors.  </li>
            <li> Konad Black]].</li>
            <li> Konad Black]].</li>
            <li> The shimmer in the black settles and makes the polish like sludge.</li>
            <li> what I did (bleach, buffing)  the nails just had to grow out, which took over half a year.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the polish began chipping off in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not even the black one.</li>
            <li> I received them in less than a week.</li>
            <li> a very unhealthy looking yellow color - instantly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the polishes on Saturday and received them on Monday - all bottles intact and wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> The darker blue color is a bit of a pain to get off (it smears everywhere), so use extra cotton balls, and the green has bleed through and can stain your nails, so a clear base coat is a must.</li>
            <li> One day after a pedi with them, half my toes were missing all the polish.</li>
            <li> I guess that is why they call it \\&quot;Klean\\&quot; color and not clean color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One thing I would advise is to make sure you use a base coat with the green because if you don&#x27;t it will stain your fingernails a yellow-green FOREVER! ...</li>
            <li> Usually use a base coat and then a top coat.  </li>
            <li> A little sanding with an emery board took care of it.  </li>
            <li> Was a little worried because when I opened the package I could smell polish.  </li>
            <li> I have little bubbles on the polish, no I didn&#x27;t shake the polish before applying.  </li>
            <li> A little too well,</li>
            <li> Just makes things a little messier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with how well the colors pop, I didn&#x27;t care about a little color on my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little stiff for my taste and there is a little bit of nail staining if you don&#x27;t use an undercoat</li>
            <li> i used the green color that comes with this kit, and it STAINED MY FINGERS</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t cracked or dried out.</li>
            <li> but I too found the green polish opened when I got the package.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I placed a review a few weeks ago and they didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> It also stains your nails for a few days once removed.</li>
            <li> Some of them have uneven bottoms...</li>
            <li> but on my nails...what a waste</li>
            <li> the green polish was smashed in delivery.</li>
            <li> this is from everyday wear, dishes, showering, washing my hands.</li>
            <li> Their response was identify the missing color and they&#x27;d ship it.  </li>
            <li> Now how on earth would I know which color was missing when the product is just a lot of metallics?</li>
            <li> Overall all we are not happy with product.</li>
            <li> Mine seem to lean a bit heavily towards purple shades--fuschia, metallic purple and a darker sparkly metallic purple.  </li>
            <li> the Green color</li>
            <li> Whenever I bent my nail down (even just a small nudge)</li>
            <li> I mostly use them for nail art and stamping because they stain my nails very badly.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the quality very bad.</li>
            <li> Cannot comment yet if it is hard to remove or stains like the other reviews</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not worried about staining, as other people have complained of.  </li>
            <li> not easy to get off at all.</li>
            <li> so getting polish to stay on is no easy task)</li>
            <li> For a little girl I am not sure it matters as she will probably paint the dogs toenails and the coffee table.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, is that they can stain really badly without a good base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unlikely to use the black, anyway, so it&#x27;s no big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> Polish is cheap, chips, stains your nails, and smells terrible even when dry.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, since the colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li> Plus, the color then stains your finger pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Stains nails so bad chips in the first hour</li>
            <li> Great metallics, but a few of the colors stain quite badly despite base coat.</li>
            <li> The green will stain your nails yellow if you neglect to prep your nails with a clear base.</li>
            <li> Now, for the good, the bad and the ugly.</li>
            <li> , this costs a little about that, for 12 bottles!</li>
            <li> the negative side, every one of these polishes has a very strong, nasty smell.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m doing gel polish, I really don&#x27;t care, but too bad colors like this don&#x27;t exist in gels...</li>
            <li> The polishes were a bit smelly but no more so than some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> They looked horrible for the better part of 2 months and nothing - not lemon juice, not baking soda, not whitening toothpaste - got the stains to budge (</li>
            <li> But if you use the green, don&#x27;t say you haven&#x27;t been warned!</li>
            <li> i just usually buy any polish i am attracted to,but this collection pops out because i have been wanting my polish to show and exspecially on pictures</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Beware the green!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> In fact a base coat is a must to not get pigment absorbed into the nail.</li>
            <li> You will have to redo everyday to keep this stuff on!</li>
            <li> But the bottles are really small.</li>
            <li> Not sure I</li>
            <li> However after a few uses it gets thick.</li>
            <li> and I like having a small variety.</li>
            <li> She just paints her nails in a well ventilated area, or turns on a small fan.  </li>
            <li> and I thought that they would come in small bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied at all with the nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that even with a base coat, all the orange, yellow and green shades stain my nails</li>
            <li> I work at Home Depot, using my hands a lot, so the nail polish usually chips within 2 days.</li>
            <li> And usually when I am going to a salon to get my nails done, I bring a color with me in case I need a touch up and don&#x27;t have time to stop in.</li>
            <li> I have tried the wraps base and only the green seems to leave a slight yellow tinge behind.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I got two metallic reds and no metallic yellow :(</li>
            <li> The bottles came very carefully wrapped in bubble wrap, and no bottles were cracked or broken.  </li>
            <li> They started chipping, peeling in layers, dried out and became soft and almost painful in some areas.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to take off but</li>
            <li> It is also hard to remove with nail polish remover and stains your nails.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to remove with nail polish remover and stains your nails.  </li>
            <li> Was hard to apply</li>
            <li> but they are hard to get off</li>
            <li> It is also hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remove and stains the nails.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a problem I&#x27;ve only seen with a handful of polish brands, but it&#x27;s always disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I had to put at least one to leave a comment........</li>
            <li> but out of the burgundy, purple, yellow, blue, and orange, the green stained it the worst.</li>
            <li> cuz mine is now stained which sucks</li>
            <li> i ordered this set even though there were some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> To thick to use.</li>
            <li> Just wish polish wasn&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> poorly packed, products wasted through package.</li>
            <li> I had to thin it out after a few trial runs</li>
            <li> The cons are that they really stain your nails and cuticles, even if you use a base coat.  </li>
            <li> Two polishes were broken in transit, made for a nasty mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I have ever purchased and I mean ever purchased</li>
            <li> The green stained my nails yellow for a couple months :(</li>
            <li> packaging was aweful bottles were open, it has a terrible smell, chips easy,and do not dry well</li>
            <li> Seriously, you need to try this!r glitter polishes.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, the pictures don&#x27;t do them justice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing it away, its not really good for any purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those complaining about it staining the nail I would suggest putting two coats of clear base on.</li>
            <li> Recommendation of putting on a clear base coat and then two coats of the polish.</li>
            <li> it was such a bummer receiving them in the mail. :(</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed because I did not revieve the white or an orange polish</li>
            <li> I was hoping she&#x27;d like at least 3-4 colors, but she loves them all!</li>
            <li> But they stain your nails and chip the same day :(</li>
            <li> Should have sent it back when I had the chance! :(</li>
            <li> Be very careful with the green, one coat without a base will turn your nails lemon</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s very thick, Doesn&#x27;t  STAMP</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s very very thick</li>
            <li> I know ... sounds a little crazy ...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> and I have to basically file the color off making my nails thin.</li>
            <li> However, even with a base coat they stain your nails a different color.</li>
            <li> The white also makes a neat base for glitter polishes.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick and yucky...or yick and thucky...completely useless.</li>
            <li> Not happy, won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
            <li> so none of those bottles were broken.</li>
            <li> With the hell base the blues really left their mark and with a rubber bonder base it was the reds that left a stain.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say other than...</li>
            <li> Seriously, you need to try this!</li>
            <li> These colors are vibrant- holy crap!!</li>
            <li> Then I started to notice how thin my nails were getting to the point of one slowly, painfully cracking in half.</li>
            <li> you have issues with chipping (I never have, it lasts the typical 2-3 days before it starts to chip badly)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I wanted to try the other colors, but after this experience I will be throwing them away.</li>
            <li> But, the Metallic Green stained my nails very badly through TWO layers of a high end base coat.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is base coat or not, some of them stain ur nails really bad...</li>
            <li> All of my other polishes tend to need a base.</li>
            <li> The bad and ugly: The white is not metallic-</li>
            <li> The green color stained my fingernails terribly, even with a clear base coat beneath it.  </li>
            <li> Like other comments, I failed to place a base coat on before I used it</li>
            <li> did leave a little residue color on my nails even though I used a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> That would also decrease the risk of bad staining, which is common with these colors, too.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they dont marble well at all</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I do my nails</li>
            <li> Ive bought expensive nail polishes</li>
            <li> and you cant go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> He could find nothin wrong</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these Nail Polish.</li>
            <li> I did use a base coat and the green</li>
            <li> But this nail polish i find is extremely difficult to remove with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> They just stayed this horrible yellow color until they grew out.</li>
            <li> Second it stains your nails horribly.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> When the packaging arrived, 3 bottles of polish had broken, making a horrible mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the smell is horrible, even when dry, and that&#x27;s not the case for me.</li>
            <li> And nail polish usually does smell bad, but this stuff is almost toxic!</li>
            <li> It also chips like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I believe that bottle exploded because it got so cold - that is why I give a 5.</li>
            <li> Also, I wanted to return the set because I&#x27;m unhappy with the quality, but I got a message that these items aren&#x27;t returnable</li>
            <li> so was very disappointed to find out that the polish is thick and therefore doesn&#x27;t apply well.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> It does smell but not that bad.</li>
            <li> This is not too bad a collection</li>
            <li> It also made the package stink really badly.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and my nails are not stained.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these polishes.</li>
            <li> It comes with 12 colors and the smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> Yes they DO stain your nails badly...</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they smell as bad as some people are saying,</li>
            <li> one thing i did notice is the sapphire one did stain my nails like crazy, and i even used a base coat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your nail ugly when you take off polish.</li>
            <li> my wife went crazy when she opened these up!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, Kleancolor STINKS!</li>
            <li> and this purchase started me buying Kleancolor like crazy!</li>
            <li> I applied 3 coats of base polish, like I always do, so hopefully they don&#x27;t stain too bad.</li>
            <li> Nail polish chips easily so disappointed</li>
            <li> then you should try roughing up your base coat</li>
            <li> I do base coat</li>
            <li> but, I always put a base coat on my nails before applying any nail polish.</li>
            <li> Some of them can be used for stamping purposes, but as a base color it can be a disaster to your nails, note</li>
            <li> you naltiques base coat before applying it</li>
            <li> and yes I had used a base coat).</li>
            <li> If you use a base coat (I prefer Q-Tica)</li>
            <li> but I use these over a gel manicure on my hands and I use two coats of base on my toes so staining is not an issue.</li>
            <li> i wear two base coats that protect my nails</li>
            <li> Depending on which base coat I use some of them do stain .</li>
            <li> Chips BAD!</li>
            <li> I hated this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and doesnt stay on even a week!</li>
            <li> The worst, it won&#x27;t even let me return them.</li>
            <li> I was real disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> SOMETHING HORRIBLE!!!!!</li>
            <li> but they chip horribly and almost immediately!!!!!  </li>
            <li> and then my nails stained horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> This polish will bubble and the finish looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> Worst nail polish ever!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I wore them all the time and started noticing that ibhad a horrible non stop metalic taste in my mouth!</li>
            <li> worst Amazon purchase ever.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;ve had a Sally stain my nails worst).</li>
            <li> can be a nasty process.  </li>
            <li> Terrible polish.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is awful leaves a film over your nails</li>
            <li> but when you take the polish off, your nails are horribly stained.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered these on a Sunday and they were at my house on Wednesday, love the fast delivery.  All polishes arrived in tact wrapped in bubble wrap.  Gorgeous colors - I am wearing a two tone ombre effect on my toes and black with chunky holo bluebell on my fingernails.  I will definitely be ordered more from this seller - all in all, one happy customer here.</li>
            <li> Chips right away, even with a base and top clear coat</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter at Christmas, she loved them.</li>
            <li> soooo pretty, and very solid, does not need to be going over and over. i dont ever write reviews so this says a lot lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely love EVERY single color!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve received, even from men!</li>
            <li> Stays much longer than normal nail polish, don&#x27;t have to worry about the glitter not staying suspended in the liquid. Recieved it sooner than expected. All around great buy!</li>
            <li> love the colors bt nail polish tend to chip off very easly</li>
            <li> absolutely fantastic colors I highly recommend anyone who loves metallic</li>
            <li> Ordered on 4/24, got them on 4/27!!! Super-quick delivery, as I was anticipating getting them between 4/30 - 5/5. I&#x27;ve used this brand polish before, so even though I have not used these colors yet, I know they&#x27;re great!! Love, love them!!!</li>
            <li> Although this nail polish is cheap and you get 12 different one I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it chips so easily you will have to reapply it daily</li>
            <li> Great colors but chips easily.  Mine started to come off in less tham 12 hours and I used two coats and a clear to coat</li>
            <li> Received these in the gift the other day. I love the colors the metallic rainbow is beautiful. Polish last very long and doesn&#x27;t chip. And leaves your nails with the shiny polished finish. Blush glides on polish evenly, and polish is not a watery.  Good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Love them.  Excellent coverage in 2 coats and covers are even more vibrant than as pictured.</li>
            <li> Love these colors! Most only need one coat! I will agree that the smell is pretty strong, but it&#x27;s nail polish...I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell good.</li>
            <li> Chips and peels after 1 day!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in this set.  Great add to my nail polish collection!</li>
            <li> Great colors for a great price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful color! One coat. Looks just like what is pictured. It does chip alot so I recommend two clear coats to seal in color. It does smell more than usu but that&#x27;s probably because of the metallic chemical compounds that make up the bright colors.</li>
            <li> Great colors - but t comes off within a day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, vibrant colors. One coat completely covers, even masking old layers. The colors merge well for ombre blending. These also work well for making wire nail polish flowers.</li>
            <li> This set  has vibrant colors and is very thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> In my opinion these are nice nail polishes that are basically the same size as the Sinful Colors nail polishes. Maybe even bigger! But I would recommend getting them of Shopmissa.com. They are. $1 and with any amount of products shipping is only $3.99 !</li>
            <li> Bought these for stamping. I saw some designs online with metallic mango &amp; it looked great so I bought the set. So far I have used the metallic purple and metallic white. The purple is great and covers a nail in 1 coat! The white did not show up well over the purple, it is white glitter on a clear base so its too transparent but it may look cool for subtle full nail designs - like white on cream. See the photo I have added. I&#x27;ll add more photos as I try the other colors.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really slow and the polish starts chipping in hours, even with a good top coat. Colors are awesome though</li>
            <li> I did not get all the colors that are shown. Ended up with 3 shades of blue. Didn&#x27;t get the green that I  ordered it for in the first place. Other than that it is a nice polish.</li>
            <li> Great price for the set, very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need a lot of coats to fully cover your nail. I love the colors and how they look on my nails, but some of these colors stain my nails and skin which is hard to remove. I have also noticed that these polishes tend to fade along the tips of your nails very quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazon does it again...quantity AND quality. These colors are just fantastic, fun, and rich. They really are metallic, and have a subtle sparkle to them. All of the colors look good, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about only using a few.  They&#x27;re also shipped quickly with good packaging. I know I&#x27;ll be buying these again once the old ones finish out, so I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> It is a kids gift and perfect for that.  Not high quality polish but many bright colors.  I bought this as a gift so I don&#x27;t know how well the polish holds up.  For a little girl I am not sure it matters as she will probably paint the dogs toenails and the coffee table.  The polish will likely last 3 days on fingernails and 19 years on the coffee table.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and it was a great deal.  I wish they came in a box or something, they were each wrapped in paper separately.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sister,  the Polish has good coverage and quite often she only use one coat, she Love the assortments of colors and how great the polish dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> The polish has very high opacity so it is great for nail art! I found that some of the colors looked very similar to others in the set whicheck upset me. The biggest problem though is that the polish goes on super thick so seamless, even lines are impossible.</li>
            <li> Awesome Stamping Polish may leave a stain if applied directly to the nail</li>
            <li> These colors are very pretty on. Use mostly on my toes for the bright ones.....</li>
            <li> my wife went crazy when she opened these up! they look exactly as shown they are very bright and shiny great great great nail polish! will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent Lacquer kit</li>
            <li> used them as filler for my golf clubs... bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to niece. She enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Nice colors but they don&#x27;t stay on.  Dissapointing</li>
            <li> these are very nice colors</li>
            <li> Love the colors, however one of the bottles broke all over the other bottles. it was such a bummer receiving them in the mail. :( the smell was so strong i knew they had broken before i even opened it.</li>
            <li> The colors of these polishes are beautiful but the quality itself is very poor. The polish chips even with a high-grade topcoat over it (I used an OPI top coat). It chipped after less than a day and once you get one chip it just flakes off very quickly from there.</li>
            <li> The green reminds me of Tinkerbell, The red I&#x27;m calling Ruby slipper red cause it reminds me of the ruby slippers from &amp;#34;The Wizard of Oz&amp;#34; Very good quality for the price. Will defanetly be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with kleancolor when I accidentally purchased it in red at a beauty supply store.  I wanted to get more and stumbled across this lot.  The colors are so amazing and vibrant.  The shine is stellar and you could even get away with one coat (the sign of a great lacquer).  This is definitely worth the price and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> A  perfect assortment!! Wonderful way to explore individuality.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves it</li>
            <li> Amazing, arrived on time and everything was in perfect conditions. The colors are super bright! But even though the smell is really strong (depending on the color) i recommend them!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> The polish itself is beautiful, but it doesn&#x27;t exceed my expectations. It doesn&#x27; t stay on nearly as long as I would like. And nail polish usually does smell bad, but this stuff is almost toxic! It smells horrible and doesnt stay on even a week! So... over all. Meh.</li>
            <li> Received 8/12 colors. Just emailed seller, will update with results.  Update. got the other 4 colors. these are pretty colors, but they chip really easily. &amp; my black didn&#x27;t come with the brush part</li>
            <li> As always I have no problems with any of the orders I place with Amazon</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors and incredibly fast shipping, what more could you want? I had no problem with these chipping, but I have a very good top coat so maybe that&#x27;s the answer. I also used a good base coat and had no problems with stains on my nails. The polishes were a bit smelly but no more so than some others I&#x27;ve used. I loved these and ordered more from the Kleancolor brand!</li>
            <li> Great brand for shimmering eye shadow and nail polish. Colors are very vibrant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White shimmer polish was much thicker than the rest, and polish may chip easily.</li>
            <li> love the colors and a great price</li>
            <li> Love the colors but I was disappointed because I did not revieve the white or an orange polish, they sent me 3 different pinks n purples along with all of the other colors in the picture.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice but delivery was slow</li>
            <li> BRILLIANT COLORS, ANOTHER CHRISTMAS STOCKING HIT!  MY NIECES GOT TO FIGHT IT OUT OVER WHO GOT WHAT COLORS.  :)  THRILLED!</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  I love all the colors! Very happy with my purchase. Thank you. :]</li>
            <li> Great color after just one coat. Dries fast compared to brands like OPI and China Glaze. I really love the selection of metallic hues and how well they actually cover the nail. It&#x27;s think enough that one coat is enough but thin enough that it doesn&#x27;t come out gooey/chunky.&lt;br /&gt;Looks awesome with chunky glitter on top or just plain. Those complaining about it staining the nail I would suggest putting two coats of clear base on. I use two coats of &amp;#34;Sinful Colors&amp;#34; clear coat #1064 or one coat of G.N.P. &amp;#34;Ultimate Nail Hardener&amp;#34; by Diamond Cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with chipping (I never have, it lasts the typical 2-3 days before it starts to chip badly) then you should try roughing up your base coat so it adheres better. Use an old nail buffing bar and just a couple swipes of the non-buffing side then apply color (typically this makes it last a few days longer, last time I applied the red this way it lasted 10 days!).&lt;br /&gt;Always apply clear top coat for the best metallic shine.</li>
            <li> These metallic are beautiful. Looks pretty on the toes. Lots of pigment so you don&#x27;t need lots of coats. Like the brush and bottle. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love the colors!  They last only a four days though.  Dries QUICK!</li>
            <li> Would not buy ever again packaging was aweful bottles were open, it has a terrible smell, chips easy,and do not dry well</li>
            <li> I bought these and i cant stop using them. The colours are beautiful. and they last long.  Everyone loves them. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that I only needed one coat of polish to get complete coverage and a bright, beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Just received it in the mail. The colors are even more beautiful in person. Yes the smell is a little strong but I&#x27;m used to it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!!!!!!  Beautiful colors.  I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive these quality polishes are.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love each one of them. Kinda hard to take off but its beautiful colors</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, great price. Unfortunately the nail polish chips very easily even with base and top coats applied. Good for one-night special occasionas though. Good delivery time.</li>
            <li> The colors are really  nice &amp; were perfect gifts for my grandkids just what I wanted ....Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Chipped in almost a day even after using the protector.</li>
            <li> Great gift for Mom&#x27;s. It had wild colors in it for Mom who likes those colors and more subdued colors for other Mom who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great value. I love all of the colors that came in this set. I mostly use them for nail art and stamping because they stain my nails very badly. That isn&#x27;t going to stop me from using these beautiful colors! The polish is still nice. I will use the lighter colors on my entire nail but not the darker colors. But they are all great for stamping!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole bunch of coats to get the true color! A great value and beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> This mostly is for kids or teens.</li>
            <li> VERY QUICK DELIVERY &amp; I LOVE LOVE LOVE EVERY ONE OF THE METALLIC COLORS I GET TONS OF COMPLIMENTS....I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND &amp; DEFINITELY BUY FROM U AGAIN....AMAZING AMAZING COLORS....THANK U :-)</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors and very bright!</li>
            <li> Got this set for my 17 year old she does nails they r great colors. Big bottles for a great price love amazon</li>
            <li> Love these! I am a professional Nail Stylist and I use these even with my stamping plates ! They look amazing on toes!  True to color !</li>
            <li> I just received it this week. I was so happy to look at the metallic shades. They were shining and absolutely flawless. I loved different colors and it stands the advantage that its cheap. I am so impressed with these shades, i recommend to all of you. It would be so much better to have these at cheaper price than having OPI or Butter london at absurdly over valued prices.</li>
            <li> this was a good buy. I&#x27;ve been needing some good colors. these colors are kinda metallic got a nice sparkly shine to it. these a good colors for the price. good colors to use nail foil on to be honest.  like I been doing. would recommend it for that.</li>
            <li> I love this set, because I brought another one right after. Great buy</li>
            <li> I like the colors they are very bright and I got lots of compliments. On the down side, the polish does not stay on for more than 2 days and despite applying a top coat, the colors stain your nails and its difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. There are pretty colors, but the polish starts coming off the next day.</li>
            <li> It came in 5 days early then expected in great condition and the colors are beautiful higher than my expectations</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t gotten mine, and it is just now in transit to carrier. I am disappointed. Other reviews I read said the delivery was quick, but this is not the case. Will update once it arrives.</li>
            <li> The green stained my nails yellow for a couple months :(</li>
            <li> Although the colors are pretty, the polish chips off the same or next day. You get what you pay for in another words. I painted my hands and toe nails. The color stayed on my toes for a few days without chipping, but always chipped off my finger nails the same day, even with using a bottom and top coat to help it stay on. I will not buy again. It is also hard to remove with nail polish remover and stains your nails. Cheap, poor quality and stains your nails.</li>
            <li> Flakes quickly and stains the nails. But pretty color</li>
            <li> Best finger nail Polish I have ever purchased and I mean ever purchased</li>
            <li> Polish colors are GREAT, they smell very strongly of acetone and polish peels off easily so must be top coated. This polish will stain nails, so use good base coat first.</li>
            <li> love the colors but the nail polish seems to chip easier than other polishes</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! A few of them leave your nails fairly tinted after use if you don&#x27;t use a base coat, but other than that these are great! Most of the colors you can get away with just one coat.</li>
            <li> Got here early, and I LOVE the colors....</li>
            <li> The metallic white is a great color but not great for stamping at all but the metallic yellow, metallic mango, is great for stamping. Is thick and it looks great for like Christmas designs. The metallic sapphire stains the stamper but it transfers great images into the nail. All the others also work good on stamping. No regrets in buying this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive way to start off your nail polish collection, this is a good option--with a few notable downsides. The variety of colors is excellent, spanning the entire rainbow plus black and white. They apply easily, with excellent coverage in two coats. Now, the picture doesn&#x27;t really show how shimmery they are--they are not the flat metallics you might expect. They&#x27;re gorgeous, nevertheless. They&#x27;re also fairly versatile--I was able to use the white and the red in combination with a few other polishes to produce an excellent water marble, which is certainly not true of most metallics. I&#x27;ve also used the black for stamping, and that turned out quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, every one of these polishes has a very strong, nasty smell. I&#x27;m more than used to the smell of typical nail polish, but this is a step beyond that. Any nail that you paint with these will carry that foul smell until you give your hands a thorough washing. That&#x27;s a problem I&#x27;ve only seen with a handful of polish brands, but it&#x27;s always disappointing. I&#x27;m not sure what is in the formula that causes that smell, but it makes me think these aren&#x27;t the most non-toxic polishes out there. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second downside is that some of them stain pretty severely. The green in particular stained my nails more that any polish I&#x27;ve ever owned, and this despite the fact that I always apply a really good base coat. In the future I will only be wearing that one layered over other polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in terms of durability, they are neither the best nor the worst out there. They seemed about on par with the cheaper drugstore brands (NYC, Wet&amp;Wild, etc.). Four good days without chipping IF you use a good base and top coat and IF you are moderately careful with your nails. Certainly not the best wear time possible, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, it&#x27;s a good set for the nail artist on a budget, particularly if you want them for stamping. Again, I&#x27;m put off by the smell, but if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a nice collection.dget, particularly if you want them for stamping. Again, I&#x27;m put off by the smell, but if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a nice collection.</li>
            <li> Bought these for myself n i can never find good nail polishes.  But they are awesome n Cole good.  Would by more different colors of they had any.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of coats....</li>
            <li> A good deal for 12 full size bottles. The colors are pretty and they go on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a hit-and-miss on the quality; I painted my toes and they chipped just from wearing my socks and boots the first day (and I used a base coat and top coat). But I painted my fingernails and they held up through heavy lawn work, dog baths, even bowling; lasted 4 days so far without chipping, and I&#x27;m hard on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> the colors are EXACTLY as bright (if not more vibrant) in real life as shown in the photo.  the colors are BEAUTIFUL!  they are perfect for nail art or to be worn alone.</li>
            <li> basic colors and good colore ,,quick service and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These polish are Beautiful, every color is just gorgeous.... Love them</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I was able to get these products at a very reasonable price and the colors are absolutely awesome.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> The colors are not really as shown and they chip whithin hours of getting nails  done. Not worth it. The worst, it won&#x27;t even let me return them.</li>
            <li> While this product looks good on my nails, it does NOT stay on!!! I painted my nails and most of the polish popped off (in one piece) THE SAME DAY.</li>
            <li> The mettalic look of these is outstanding ! BEAUTIFUL ! You have to put these on a color wheel to see the real color.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly bright. Bought them for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> pretty but some of it was hard to get open and then it stuck to jar. I was real disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> Colors are very vibrant and I like the metallic look.  I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t use on my nails.  I use it for a craft project I do.  This is a really great deal for the all 12 bottles of different colors.</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive nail polish and the colors are true to the pictures.  Pretty.  The only thing that I did not care for was that it was hard to get off.  No matter what I used.  A little sanding with an emery board took care of it.  All in all, not a bad buy for the amount of polish you get.</li>
            <li> Well packaged took week 1/2 2 weeks to get. The colors are AWSOME , very pretty my fav is the pink!  I just used for the first time today so I will do updates to let you know about wear and chips in couple days.  Oh and the pink only took one coat, these are thicker polishes. So far 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with these metallic polishes.  I have gotten so many compliments on these. With a strong top coat these colors do not budge , chip, fade etc. they are wonderful and for the cost you would be crazy not to buy.  I also bought the kleancolor 16 glitter set which is AWSOME and you can match with the metallics and really create a nice look or design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;I still love the colors HOWEVER,  these colors bleed a lot, I do my own acrylic nail and after using nail polish remover it still turned my acrylic so I had to drill off the color and this is with using a good base coat, I assume this would bleed on natural nail as well?&lt;br /&gt;Down to 3 stars</li>
            <li> I LOVE these nail polishes so are soooo gorgeous.I was a little nervous to order them when I had never heard of the brand and the fact that the cost was so cheap,but they themselves aren&#x27;t cheap.I only needed 1 coat.usually I do base coat 2 coats then top coat but this time 1 was enough that it wasn&#x27;t sheer at all and it went on amazingly.I took some pictures but couldn&#x27;t show the full beauty of them my fav is the pink and fuchsia.I would defiantly say if your thinking about getting them do it!They are pretty stinky like others have  said even tho I painted them 30 minutes ago I can still smell them if I put my nails to my nose.But if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, get them they are the prettiest polishes Ive ever seen.</li>
            <li> Love these colors! Very vibrant n doesnt require many coats. Dries fast too! Doesnt smell any different than any other polish out there. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these considering the colors in the photo are amazing. When I received the package and took out the nail polish I was happy until i realized they had given me 3 of the same color! I never received a green, dark blue, and the yellow one. Instead I got a very pretty pearl pink and 3 &amp;#34;metallic black&amp;#34; colors(the rest were the right ones in the photo), which would have been fine if it was actually a color I liked, but I never wear black nail polish... The other down side to them is they chip easily and are not are as shinny as in the photo. That is solved though easily with a clear top coat. If you are looking for a top quality nail polish you should really look into more expensive nail polish, but you get what you pay for and for the price I paid I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I love these polishes, am so happy I ordered them. They are supper covering and with one coat you are done. Am very happy I can use them with my plates, worked so well. But this nail polish is beautiful and fun but when my order came in the colors were off from what it said I&#x27;d be getting</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, and they&#x27;re great for stamping, but they do stain the nails even with a primer undercoat.  You can use a buffing block to buff out the yellow.</li>
            <li> Great colors.  Cant beat THE price  love them</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this thing in for my girlfriend, and the shipping fast very fast, although  one of the Nail Polish came open in the package, this could be a damage the happened in transit or poor packaging. besides that, she is very happy with it. the 4 stars is for the packaging. the product is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Chips BAD! but does great for stamping decals.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and so keep trying to use it, but it peels off like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen. One day after a pedi with them, half my toes were missing all the polish. It seems like a formula for kids that would be easy to remove, but certainly not worth the price. Too bad, since the colors are so pretty. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money!</li>
            <li> Chips easy. Lasts for only a few days-a plus if you change colors often. Great colors though! And the quantity to the price is Brilliant!</li>
            <li> The shipping is great but they are so cheap. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t last on my nails. However, the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> massive variety of colors and types i really like the set but unfortunately they dont marble well at all and that was kinda the reason i got them, aw well i still like the colors</li>
            <li> I wrote a review before and looks like they deleted it. When trying to take off stained nails and smearing onto hand as well. Very poor quality. Also chips very easily.</li>
            <li> So I love this colors, I especially love the purple color but that&#x27;s my personal preference. As for the shipping I had no problem with broken bottles or anything, I got all the colors in the picture and they all look amazing. Nail designs with these colors look awesome so I would totally recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is nice for the price. I love the colors and the way it goes on. I wear a coat of clear under all my nail polish so I did not notice the staining that others talked about. It does smell but not that bad. It&#x27;s worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: This nail polish completely ruined my nails. They started chipping, peeling in layers, dried out and became soft and almost painful in some areas. I threw away all of my cheap nail polish. I would stay clear of this product if you want to keep healthy nails.</li>
            <li> WOWZA! Does this polish stain! I painted my daughter&#x27;s nails the beautiful metallic green and after doing some cleaning around the house and playing basketball, her thumb nail had chipped after about 10 hours of wear. Imagine our surprise and horror in discovering her nail bed stained a deep yellow (about the same color as these stars in the rating!) after a few short hours of wear! I LOVE the colors - the green had a magnificent holo effect to it - but think I am going to reserve their use to stamping images on other polish since staining does seem to be a huge problem for this polish line. Don&#x27;t know if I would have purchased it if I had read the reviews and seen the warnings about the staining!&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller - they get a 5 gold star rating! I ordered the polishes on Saturday and received them on Monday - all bottles intact and wrapped tightly in bubble wrap. Would totally order from them again! GREAT customer service!</li>
            <li> dont buy this unless you want to fight it to get it all to come off.  it stains and smears when you use nail polish remover . I love the colors but the quality very bad. stinky too.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous! Goes on easy (2 coats and you are done!) The darker blue color is a bit of a pain to get off (it smears everywhere), so use extra cotton balls, and the green has bleed through and can stain your nails, so a clear base coat is a must. Otherwise they are great colors with a good top coat....stunning.</li>
            <li> This is chappy polish, starts chipping within 24 hours after painting your nails also mine started clumping after only using a few times.</li>
            <li> I love love love the colors. The colors are soo beautiful but this does not stay on. After it dries it chips very very easily. I used a base coat and a top coat and it is driving me nuts that i can&#x27;t even get a day out of these colors. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Cheap nail polish. To thick to use. I just threw it away! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These really are a nice set that spans a wide range of beautiful metallic colors. They go on easily and clean off fairly well. Overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with them. The brushes are a little stiff for my taste and there is a little bit of nail staining if you don&#x27;t use an undercoat but otherwise this is a real fun set.</li>
            <li> wonderful buy!  Colors are amazing and go on great.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better buy or a better picture for this purchase.</li>
            <li> The polish are nice colors and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I like how the colors look but like a lot of other people have said, they don&#x27;t last long. I put it on and the very next day it was already half chipped off. And they do stain your fingernails. The one I have used so far was the pink and it didn&#x27;t stain the whole nail but there were parts that were stained. Also not every color pictured is what you get. I didn&#x27;t receive the black but I did receive 3 purples (different shades) and 2 matte colors which are not listed. I like all the colors but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are incredibly pigmented! Extremely bright and amazing to look at. BUT BE WARNED, some, if not all, of these can and will stain your nails. I only use these on top of another base coat. Would have gotten 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t stain.  These make FABULOUS stamping polishes!!!</li>
            <li> I love this polish. All my friends always complement the color. The colors are just what I was looking for. Perfect</li>
            <li> For the price, this polish is a great deal just for the wow-factor colors. True, the polish doesn&#x27;t last long. It starts to chip or wear after a couple days without prep and top coat. BUT... the colors aren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; colors anyway, so they&#x27;re perfect for weekends and special occasions. Great for parties, holidays, so forth. The sample mani photo is quite accurate. These polishes are vivid and lustrous. The pigment is deep, but applies evenly. One or two coats was plenty.</li>
            <li> I love how there are a variety of colors and it&#x27;s brush makes it so easy!....the only downfall of this nail polish is that it chips VERY easily! i painted them and the next day they were chipped!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful set of colors, and a great value.  Each of these colors give great coverage and shine.  They go on smoothly and evenly.  My favorite manicure so far was the orange, mango and yellow sponged into a gradient with black tiger stripes stamped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is the metallic yellow stamps as a fabulous sparkly gold, even over black and dark colors.  I expect to get even more use out of this set than I originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor fixON was wonderful to deal with.  I had a defective bottle, and they replaced it pleasantly and quickly.</li>
            <li> The colors are very bright and bold just as shown in the photograph.  These polishes are also GREAT for nail stamping.  I will be order from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I love these polishes, am so happy I ordered them. They are supper covering and with one coat you are done. Am very happy I can use them with my plates, worked so well.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome. One coat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set with an Amazon gift card at Christmas. The colors are beautiful and long lasting. I love this nail polish and will purchase more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> excellent will be using this seller again</li>
            <li> Really nice colors, love the metallic/sparkly shine of the polish, and overall I&#x27;m impressed with the product considering the great price!</li>
            <li> Awesome colors!  One coat coverage, no fuss no mess. Great buy, 12 Full size bottles for the price of two.</li>
            <li> These colors are so vibrant and beautiful.  Using glitter colors on top gives you even more variety.&lt;br /&gt;While this brand does bleed, using a really good quality base coat will aid in overcoming this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see these colors in salons, so I was happy to find them here.</li>
            <li> Even my nail  lady loved my color!</li>
            <li> Was looking at gel nail polish. This was there so I ordered them. Really pretty colors but I needed gel polish</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this nail polish set. It makes my nails look professionally done. Will order more as soon as it runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two colors so far, the blue and white. The white chipped off half way through the day. Removing it was a bit harder than regular nail polish but it did not stain my nails. I have the blue on my toe nails and it&#x27;s holding up. Cannot comment yet if it is hard to remove or stains like the other reviews say. I do like the colors though!!</li>
            <li> Two of the nail polishes leaked a little but other than that I like the colors of the nail polishes</li>
            <li> I love this polish. The colors are absolutely gorgeous. I get compliments on the colors all the time.</li>
            <li> Not used it yet, but they sure look nice in the shelf...thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it to accent my nails with patterns or decorations since it chips and cracks very easily</li>
            <li> Fair. Doesn&#x27;t look as good on the nail as it does in the bottle.</li>
            <li> These colors are a great way to cheaply expand your nail polish collection. I love them. So far I&#x27;ve only tried three, and I&#x27;m sure these will last me a long time. My favorite thus far is the metallic white, which lasted me a whole week without the slightest chip. I recommend these nail polishes to anyone who wants beautiful and vibrant, durable colors for a low price.</li>
            <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> a gift  she love it the colors are great.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, so many great colors!</li>
            <li> The color&#x27;s  are great and fun to work with!!</li>
            <li> Was a little worried because when I opened the package I could smell polish.  But I looked an couldn&#x27;t see any that were damaged. So hopefully it was just a fluke</li>
            <li> Wow. These are beautiful, bright colors. One of the gifts my adult niece&#x27;s birthday was grab bag of cosmetics items I knew she&#x27;d like, but I wasn&#x27;t sure about her taste in nail polish, so this set was ideal: Reasonably priced and so many colors to choose from. I was hoping she&#x27;d like at least 3-4 colors, but she loves them all!</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter and for friend. Birthday gifts. Colors are bright.</li>
            <li> They are packaged well and they shipped very well; no breakage. But the polish itself is honestly just fair. It peels off in a day. Fun for kids&#x27; play manicures maybe, but not if you actually want your mani to last.</li>
            <li> Very nice color deposit</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how vibrant the colors are on your nails!  Great polish and glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed all of the colors.  The only one I don&#x27;t care for is the black but I figured I would just save that one until Halloween.  Otherwise, I have quite enjoyed testing out the others.</li>
            <li> love the colors!!!!! very satisfied with the nail polish. had been looking for metallic polish for a while and glad i purchased these. great price.</li>
            <li> For the price and for stamping your nail I love this nail polish only complaint is it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> One coat and your done. Dries really fast love it</li>
            <li> I have  used several of these colors they came out really nice and lasted a week.</li>
            <li> although the colors are pretty, the polish chips off the same  or next day.  I use CND and Opi nail polish and you can tell the difference. You get what you pay for another words.  I painted my hands and toe nails. The color stayed  on my toes for  a few days without  chipping, but always chipped off my finger nails the same day, even with using a bottom and top coat to help is stay on.  I would have to repaint my nails every day if I want to continue using this product on my nails.  I will  not buy again.  It is also hard to remove with nail polish remover and stains your nails.  I painted my finger nails with about 4 different colors so far and it lasts a day (maybe a day before it chips or flakes off!)  cheap, poor quality and stains your nails.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely gorgeous metallic colors!  Made great party favors for my baby shower.  I am thinking about buying another set to keep for myself!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because I needed an extra purchase in order to get free shipping.  These arrived so fast and I am in love with the metallic colors!! All of them are excellent!  My daughter loves when I paint her nails with these as well.  She is 5 :)</li>
            <li> When this order first arrived, I wanted to try them all!!  So I chose all but the black and white and went to town on my ten fingers!  I know ... sounds a little crazy ... but family &amp; friends already know I am!  I also used this &#x27;base&#x27; to try out some glitter polishes on top of a few of these colors.  I got a lot of ideas from playing around and a lot of compliments on my manicure ... which was bold and metallic.  I would buy this set again.  :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or if I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I do my nails but, I always put a base coat on my nails before applying any nail polish. Seems every time I use this nail polish it sticks to the nail regardless and I have to basically file the color off making my nails thin. I&#x27;ve stopped using this product and won&#x27;t be buying anymore. If I could afford a manicure I&#x27;d stick to that.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on buying so much nail polish so cheaply but I am glad I did.  This polish came in and didn&#x27;t have to be shaken up...it was ready to go.  The colors are so rich and full of pigment that one coat is more than enough. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Kleancolor started charging premium price soon per bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been very excited to receive my product of the metallic polish set of 12 but I have never received it. I have contacted the seller and they have not answered me back so I have to make a claim through Amazon in order to get my money back for products I did not receive. This company does not even deserve a 1 star but I had to put at least one to leave a comment........the polishes on the other hand I will order but from a different company..as for VIPolish  I have nothing good to say about them..</li>
            <li> I rated this as 3 stars only cuz it was ordered as a gift so I really can&#x27;t rate then quality of polish until I hear from my granddaughter after she uses the items. So far they look pretty and a nice size esp. for the price.</li>
            <li> I brought several sets for Christmas for the teenagers in our lives. They LOVED them....colors are amazing and bright in FULL bottles that are usual size. I thought they might be smaller, but was surprised with there size..</li>
            <li> So far these polishes are beyond my expectations! I love all the colors and they only need one coat to be opaque. They are so gorgeous and eye catching. This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this brand and I&#x27;m very pleased and I will be buying more. The only problem I have is that the odor is kind of odd and very strong, but they are so pretty that it&#x27;s not gonna stop me from using them. I would 100% recommend these! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she loved them and the colors were awesome even I use them</li>
            <li> My husband brought me this nail set for christmas, and my oh my.... these colors are GORGEOUS!!! I literally have on about 5 of the colors right now (rainbow nails) lol and they are all very rich and vibrant. The nail polish itself dries rather quickly and it doesnt chip off easily. All of the colors have a bit of shimmer to them but not like glitter which is perfect as the real glitter in other nail polishes tends to be hard to remove. I would recommed this set to anyone and everyone!! Great Kit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!WAIT A MIN!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;so i used the green color that comes with this kit, and it STAINED MY FINGERS SOMETHING HORRIBLE!!!!! its a week and a half later and my fingernails are still highlighter YELLOW from the green. i havent got to use all the colors yet, but out of the burgundy, purple, yellow, blue, and orange, the green stained it the worst. The blue stained it blue but that faded after about 2 days. its almost 2 weeks later and the yellow tint from the green wont go away. so i wont be using that one anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND!!! the polish chips easily, aftre about 3 days and barely any real maneuvering (didnt open soda cans or scratch and pick at things to make them chip) the polish chipped off leaving my fingers to look like a teen with just polish on the middle of my nails. lmao. My husband said \\&quot;please take that off\\&quot; im like i just put it on :-\ lmao.</li>
            <li> Stain your nails permanent, If you intend to use these as a base color beware, I only left the green polish for 3 days on my nail and they all turned yellow even after I soak my nails on pure acetone. Some of them can be used for stamping purposes, but as a base color it can be a disaster to your nails, note I did you naltiques base coat before applying it</li>
            <li> I ordered these as part of a present and when they came a couple of bottles were broken and had spilled all over the rest of them and the package...cleaned them up as best I could . Should have been packed better with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I was real nervious when I purchased these cause some of the reviews, But I figured it was only 12$ so why not. They just got here and I LOVE THEM. No repeat colors. They weren&#x27;t cracked or dried out. I tried the blue on and it is such a beautiful color. It drys really quick and so far no chipping..I love the way they shimmer. Very happy with this purchase :) :)</li>
            <li> Good nail polish except for yellow and green- these two colors stain your nails yellow and that doesn&#x27;t come off (it grows out with your nails).</li>
            <li> Be aware that the yellow color and I believe any of the colors with yellow in them will stain your nails. Make sure you use a basecoat first.  Otherwise, the colors are nice and great price.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this nailpolish its ridiculous. You only need to do one coat. its not like other nailpolishes that are super thin and where you have to apply coat after coat after coat. I love how metallic this particular polish is. (I have some on right now) Its also great because I do mine and my 5 year olds nails all the time and I only have to do one coat on her and it dries so quickly. if youve ever done a kids nails, you know how important that is. I will only buy this brand from here on out. Ive only tried the metallic so far but im about to order other colors soon. I could go on and on about this. Ive bought expensive nail polishes and theyve never worked this good. I am more that pleased</li>
            <li> Polish gives great coverage. Works awesome for an ombr√© method.Pictures don&#x27;t do justice for shimmer quality.  A heads up on the orange and mango...they look like the same color in the bottle but are noticeably different when applied to the nail (I thought I had gotten duplicates at first until reading the labels and swiping some polish on nail to see the difference).  Two bottles arrived broken/leaked but seller took care of immediately and were easy to contact.  I would purchase these polishes again and from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love all the different metallic&#x27;s colors</li>
            <li> Great colors! However, even with a base coat they stain your nails a different color. For example, I used the orange three weeks ago and my nails are still yellow.</li>
            <li> I can confirm a lot of the typical complaints about these polishes--they smell a little funny, the surface may feel dry but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re dry beneath the surface, so they can be a little tricky, and some of them stain.&lt;br /&gt;However, the colors are very pretty. They stain a little bit, but you can alleviate this by putting a couple coats of a nice base on first and letting them dry before applying. Most of the colors are nearly one coat for full coverage, and for you stampers out there, most of these colors can be used to stamp with, and amazingly well, particularly since these are basically chromes, which is a major plus. They&#x27;ll stain your stampers a tiny bit, but don&#x27;t do any damage.&lt;br /&gt;I give myself 3-4 new manis a week, so I never have anything on long enough to worry about a lot of chipping, but so far these hold up just as long as my higher end brands. Great pricing for anyone wanting to build up their polish collection, and shipping was quick and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> My niece will love this set.  I got it for her knowing that she loves to paint her nails, so the colors are perfect for her.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my ten year old granddaughter and my daughter asked if she could borrow them because the colors are so great.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, Kleancolor STINKS! Literally, but figuratively not at all - they make a nice polish at a very affordable price point. I have probably 25 Kleancolor shades and have never encountered a problem with any...until The Great St Patty&#x27;s Day Nail Incident of 2014. I used Metallic Green and as of today MOST of the yellow staining is finally grown out. :/ They looked horrible for the better part of 2 months and nothing - not lemon juice, not baking soda, not whitening toothpaste - got the stains to budge (and yes I had used a base coat). However, even if you only use 11 of the shades out of this set, it&#x27;s still a fantastic deal. But if you use the green, don&#x27;t say you haven&#x27;t been warned!</li>
            <li> Great set! I love all the colors. They don&#x27;t chip easily. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered these specifically for nail stamping.EXCEPT for the green and white  all the others are highly pigmented and work beautifully as stamping polish.I think for the price this product is worth it...</li>
            <li> Love Kleancolor polishes.  These are all gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This polish is okay.  The colors are amazing!  The drawback is that they wear off very quickly.  We have tried it with base coat, top coat and alone and the polish only lasts about 2 days before it starts to chip.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors in this package.  They really &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; when looking at them on my nails. Recommendation of putting on a clear base coat and then two coats of the polish. Also cover with a clear top coat to make it last a couple of days.  The colors are even brighter with the clear coat.</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Chips in hours, even with base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and it really only requires one good coat.</li>
            <li> This is not too bad a collection but I too found the green polish opened when I got the package.  It got over three of the other bottles. It also made the package stink really badly.  Delivery was fast, and some of the colors are really nice. My fave is the white.</li>
            <li> This nail polish color choice are very nice. It paints on smoothly &amp; evenly. I bought it cause of reading all the good reviews and had to try it for myself. I was very impress of the quality and how good and easy it was to paint the nails. I will definitely buy more of this. Polish came nicely individually wrap so it doesn&#x27;t shatters.</li>
            <li> Very stylish and beautiful colors. Just wish polish wasn&#x27;t so thick. Was hard to apply</li>
            <li> This is a awesome set and the colors are EXTREEMLY vibrant and cover so well that  they do not even require a second coat...very nice and quality polish.</li>
            <li> All the colors are exactly as they appear in the pic and you cant go wrong with the price and  if you were to buy these in a store they would cost at least $7 or more each I love these and get tons of compliments! You have a color for almost every outfit When people ask where I got them I tell them Amazon where I buy ALL of my unique nail polishes</li>
            <li> Polish is awesome... will definitely purchase in the future... Package came early, all items accounted for.. no cracked bottles and the quality is GREAT.. Definitely Rec!</li>
            <li> Very bright and vivid colors.</li>
            <li> I like the colors a lot; I just don‚Äôt like the smell. Anyway I am able to address that downside by using a lot of hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Love them love them ... The colors are beautiful !!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and I love that they are cruelty free.  However because the polish is  thick it peels off easily. It starts to peel the next day.  I haven&#x27;t found a top coat to keep it from peeling.</li>
            <li> Received package 9 days after ordering.  Not super fast shipping but ok. Got 12 different colors which are all beautiful.  Coverage if polish is very nice. 1 or 2 coats will give great coverage. Smell is not as bad as others have stated and dry time is appropriate for standard non fast drying polish.  Great polish for the price</li>
            <li> Got these as a mothers day present and my mom is in love with them,she loves nail polish so this is going to go great with her collection.There are all different colors and I did not get any of the same colors,I would most definitely buy from them again.I would recommend these to any girl,teen,or women who loves to do their nails or toes.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors......but they chip horribly and almost immediately!!!!!  I would not recommend. Sometimes you get what you pay for and that is the case here.  Sorry, but if you are looking for a one night wear where you do not have to touch much, then this is for you.  If you are looking for long wear this IS NOT for you.</li>
            <li> Awesome value, beautiful colors, relatively fast shipping</li>
            <li> Two polishes were broken in transit, made for a nasty mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> i just usually buy any polish i am attracted to,but this collection pops out because i have been wanting my polish to show and exspecially on pictures and these do stand out because silky and with false nails these are colorful and great but even without false these are very neat to exper....with great sett!</li>
            <li> This set came with what it promised, one of every color. I am over all very pleased with the quality of the nail polish, however, it is the strongest (and stinkiest) smelling nail polish I own. My only dislike about the set is that my neon/light green polish stained my nails a very unhealthy looking yellow color - instantly. I had made sure beforehand to put on my best base coat, but while painting on the green I messed up on my thumb nail. I then used nail polish remover and found my entire nail stained. I had done all of my nails on my right hand with the color. THE STAINS WOULD NOT GO AWAY!! I tried all sorts of things to un-stain my nails (lemon juice, YouTube videos, etc.), they ended up finally growing all the way out at somewhere between 5 and 6 months. What a PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;So..&lt;br /&gt;Beware the green!</li>
            <li> Like other comments, I failed to place a base coat on before I used it and then my nails stained horrible. But before I took it off the colors looked wonderful</li>
            <li> Just purchase this collection. It&#x27;s worth it. Colors are truly beautiful, and yes they smell like fingernail polish! One of my favorite shade&#x27;s is the metallic green. Too pretty. They&#x27;re all sexy attractive colors. Not kiddie colors.</li>
            <li> I am impressed, not only the colors of product but the fast delivery and the price was outstanding  compared to local merchants.&lt;br /&gt;and the bottles are full size,  at a nail shop you could easily pay from $9  to $15 a bottle...</li>
            <li> I hated this product.  What a waste of money.  Chipped off right after I put it on.  Did not even get to wear it for one day.  My daughter in law had the same experience.</li>
            <li> Good set. It shipped very quickly and none of them were broken so that was a plus. They were gorgeous colors but after I applied them they would start to chip right away. Using a topcoat limited the chipping. It is a shame because if they lasted longer than a couple of days I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So I have mixed reviews about this. Let me start with the PROS - I ordered these on a Friday and received them on Tuesday so shipping is very fast! And they are a very good price, under $2 per bottle when most good polishes are over $5 per bottle. And let me just say these colors are absolutely beautiful and they work great for stamping! The only colors that don&#x27;t stamp are white and yellow which is fine I expected that, but they are also very dark, opaque colors so if you don&#x27;t stamp with them they&#x27;d probably only need like one coat. Ok so now the CONS - so I was looking at my colors and noticed I had 2 blacks, meaning I didn&#x27;t get a color and when I looked I noticed it was the metallic purple they gypped me on which is very disappointing because I love purple :/ Also when I stamped with the metallic sapphire it stained my stamper so if you do stamp with these, I wouldn&#x27;t advise using a white stamper cuz mine is now stained which sucks but I&#x27;ll get over it. Oh and a lot of people said the smell is overwhelming but it&#x27;s really not that bad. So overall they are pretty, a great price, and great for stamping and I really would recommend them since they are so cheap but I guess your taking a gamble if you&#x27;ll get the right colors. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I love love love this nail polish.. The colors are beautiful.. It dries pretty quickly also..</li>
            <li> It tool a while for these to arrive, but when they did arrive, I was estastic! The colors are vibrant and I&#x27;ve tried the blue, purple, white and green! The smell isn&#x27;t bad, and my nails are not stained. I use a base and top coat and the color will last about 4 days, which for me is perfect (I&#x27;m always changing the color of my nails.)</li>
            <li> What an amazing set!! The polishes are so pigmented which is why this set is perfect for stamping... The polish has a stronger smell than other brands, but for the amount &amp; quality I get for the price, I don&#x27;t mind :)</li>
            <li> The nail polish is not lasting long but the colors are stylish. The plus is that the nail polish smells good. I have already recomended the nail polish to a friend.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, but I only got 10 different colors. I got one of the colors twice. Also, one of the bottles had leaked during shipping so that bottle isn&#x27;t full &amp; it was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> The stench from these polishes is unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;The metallic sapphire severely stained the nails. It&#x27;s horrible. Completely destroyed the nail with color all the way through. I guess that is why they call it \\&quot;Klean\\&quot; color and not clean color.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this line at all.</li>
            <li> Great vibrant colors and long lasting wear!</li>
            <li> great color but chips with in two days</li>
            <li> nail polish is horrible way to thick and smells very strong unlike reg nail polish and chips easy</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I got two metallic reds and no metallic yellow :( they&#x27;re all beautiful though, especially the aqua.</li>
            <li> These colors are really pretty and fun, and go on beautifully with one or two coats. However, when it comes time to get them off, they aren&#x27;t so fun. It takes forever to get the polish off of each nail, and you&#x27;ll use and entire cotton ball/cotton pad for each nail. Plus, the color then stains your finger pretty badly. I used the blue and my fingers were tinted blue for 2 days. Be very careful getting them off. However they look lovely when on.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product the colors are so bright.  This polish will bubble and the finish looks horrible.  It also chips like crazy.  I was expecting a product that acted more like a gel polish since that is what it says it is....  It is NOT this polish will chip even with a top coat.  I only put 1 coat on and was surprised at the coverage I got with 1 coat until it dried.  I have little bubbles on the polish, no I didn&#x27;t shake the polish before applying.  I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for 20+ years and rarely do I run into a product as horrible as this one was.....</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a great product. It left my fingernails stained.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but the dark blue color stained my nails really badly.  I&#x27;ve used nailpolish remover every day for over a week and my nails are still mis-colored.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I wanted to try the other colors, but after this experience I will be throwing them away.</li>
            <li> I am the biggest fan of these colors! They are bright, beautiful, and long lasting. All of the colors came in perfect condition and in perfect timing.  I have nothing bad to say other than...and this is my own stupidity....The green will stain your nails yellow if you neglect to prep your nails with a clear base.Go for it, this is totally worth your money!</li>
            <li> I Love the metallic colors! Go on easily. True to color, arrived on time. They do chip easily but what do you expect with the price. Ise a good top clear coat and your good.</li>
            <li> Excellent collectiin.i lofe it</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, all nail polishes arrived safe and unbroken. Product is great -- color just as shown and consistency perfect!</li>
            <li> The nailpolish are fine. Did not like it much</li>
            <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer for my daughter for Christmas and she loves all the colors.  Good product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I loved these polishes before I even used them. The colors are so bright and bold, it is hard to decide which one to use. I love the sleek look just as much as the awesome color selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My polishes arrived in excellent condition and the colors were exactly as shown. The polishes were all nicely liquid, with no signs of aging or hardening at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These applied so easily and smoothly, leaving a nice, clean finish. In fact, they are so easy to apply, even the little princesses can use them. The colors settle nicely and stay on well, even through things like home remodeling and washing dishes. I would purchase these again in a minute!</li>
            <li> The colors are fairly opaque after 1 coat which is nice. only issue I have is even using a really good base coat I have found that some of the colors really stained my nails badly. I started using a white nail polish under to help prevent the staining.</li>
            <li> I thought these colors were wonderful until I put the green on my nails and then a week later took off the polish to find my nail beds were YELLOW!! I tried nail polish remover, lemon juice and peroxide to get them clean but nothing worked! I would not suggest buying this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome polishes, vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> Wow this product that i bought was amazing it was a realy grate deal and theyre very pretty colors and they all came in grate conditions if you want to buy it go ahead you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> Stains nails so bad chips in the first hour</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these polishes. They&#x27;re absolutely gorgeous. I would recommend them to nail polish fanatics out there.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, the polish stays on does not chip off. Easy to apply, drys fast.  I have used three colors from this set.  Wow! I am impressed by the quality.  This is so good that it is hard to remove with polish remover.  Buy this set you will love it.</li>
            <li> Great sleepover fun for kids birthday party.  Greeat price, &amp; they lasted thru the weekend for more fun.  Very bright variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Happy, bright colors. Very minor chipping after several days of wear without a top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started a nail polish collection and these polishes were a great idea. the colors are amazing I&#x27;ve used the pink and black so far and I&#x27;m so excited to try the other colors. they were inexpensive and not a disappointment. it came just in time. I ordered them Tuesday got them Saturday no complaints here. I definitely will continue to shop for this brand in bulk of course.</li>
            <li> If you like nail stamping as much as I do, then get this set. The metallic white doesn&#x27;t stamp well, but all the other colors work better than expected. The only down side to these polishes is the smell as it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> they works amazing, the color is soooo shiny and metallic, i wish i could stress how beautiful they are, one thing i did notice is the sapphire one did stain my nails like crazy, and i even used a base coat. i didnt notice any others doing it but beware.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this brand of polish, I just love the colors, the finish, and the consistency. They dry fast, too. This batch have metallic finishes.  I put on the metallic red right away, right on top of yesterday&#x27;s manicure.  The red is a deep cranberry red, great for fall and winter.  The finish looks just like a brand new car, sparkling in the sun.  Close up, you can see that there is extremely fine glitter in the polish, but a few inches away, all you see is color and SHINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metallic white is more obviously glittery, and the black seems more flat than the other colors.  I&#x27;m unlikely to use the black, anyway, so it&#x27;s no big deal to me.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a good home for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the colors are heavily pigmented, rich, vivid, jewel-like colors. Some are deep tones, like the purple and the blue, others are more bright tones, such as the green.  I will have tons of fun with this kit, and may get the bigger metallic assortment just so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to this brand, for me anyway, is the smell.  Its pretty potent.  But this batch didn&#x27;t smell as strong, so maybe they fixed that, or the last batch burned out the smell-center in my brain.  lol. Other than that, I highly endorse this product; Great color, easy to use, you get large bottles, and it&#x27;s really cheap at a little more than a dollar per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  So far, all of the colors have looked great on the nail.  Easy to apply and remove.  But, the Metallic Green stained my nails very badly through TWO layers of a high end base coat.  The polish looks great on, it&#x27;s wicked-witch-of-the-west green, only metallic.  In sunlight it has a very cool yellow flash.  I love it, I&#x27;ll wear it again, stain or no stain.  But, I felt you would want to know before you buy/try.  I have used several of the other metallics now, and I really love them. Even the white metallic is fun, it&#x27;s like snow on your fingertips!  The white also makes a neat base for glitter polishes.  I gave the black away, however, it was really flat, even in the sun.  The girl I gave it to is in love with it, though, so to each her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (12/1/2013)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to play with color combos, layering, glitter over solids, that sort of thing.  I put on the metallic fuschia and layered Chunky Holo Fuschia over it and WOW!! What a great result!  You get an opalescent purple/pink/blue effect.  You really don&#x27;t see the glitter much, but the nail is constantly changing color as you move your hand.  Years ago L&#x27;Oreal had a polish called Seafleur, and this is very much like that.  You get the same effect with the Metallic Fuschia and Chunky Holo Bluebell.  This result is a showstopper....great for New Year&#x27;s Eve!  Seriously, you need to try this!r glitter polishes.

            <li> Love the colors!  Goes on nice!</li>
            <li> Chips every easily and it turned my nails yellow underneath. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Pretty colors and cheep price.  But they stain your nails and chip the same day :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE !! I was expecting smelling polish but no it was not. There were two bottles that leaked during shipping. I informed them and they did replace them for me.  The colors are so rich one coat is enough. In fact a base coat is a must to not get pigment absorbed into the nail. Dries super fast. Just love them. !</li>
            <li> Nice colors - if you put a coat over the polish doesn&#x27;t chip as fast.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> They came way before they were expected too ! I ordered them Monday got them the following Tuesday. They work great ! Stay on forever &amp; the colors are brilliantly gorgeous.</li>
            <li> These are ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed any nail staining yet like other reviewers have said but that&#x27;s not saying they don&#x27;t stain, I just don&#x27;t know yet. I do know that most of this polish has a very thick consistency and it makes it hard to do nail art with and draw fine lines. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I can use most of it with my nail art stamper and that&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Worst nail polish ever! Chips off the same day. You will have to redo everyday to keep this stuff on! On the other hand.. It stains your real nail. Not sure what this polish is made of, but it cannot be good for your nails. Should have sent it back when I had the chance! :(</li>
            <li> This is awesome polish. It comes with 12 colors and the smell is not that bad. They are bright and shiny metallics that are nice and not to thick but not to thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the white and light blue are kinda sparkly just so you know.&lt;br /&gt;Again this is a very good movie that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the colors of the polishes and they all look like the picture shown. But the bottles are really small. Almost the size of the ones you would get from Walmart that are the itty bitty ones. But the color is good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the shipping because when I got them they were all in bubble wrap in two packs and 3 of the bottles were broken open and they was nail polish everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great colors! Good consistency and texture! Reasonably priced. Bought all their sets and have plenty of choices.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and pigment</li>
            <li> The nail polish has a really strong odor I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> These are all fantastic!!!!!! Completely opaque in one coat! I was amazed when I first did the swatches! Buy them! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, love them</li>
            <li> Love it, I love the colors and I eish they had color changing polish as well</li>
            <li> Nice collection of colors.  Great price and quality!</li>
            <li> I love the colors and selection BUT, it&#x27;s very thick, Doesn&#x27;t  STAMP WELL, AND TAKES A LONG TIME TO DRY.&lt;br /&gt;IT ALWAYS TURNS MY WHITE STAMPING POLISH YELLOW. DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY.</li>
            <li> Great metallics, but a few of the colors stain quite badly despite base coat.</li>
            <li> poorly packed, products wasted through package.</li>
            <li> These came really fast. When they first arrived, one of m boxes was completely busted and there was nail polish everywhere. I contacted the sailer and within 30 minutes they contacted me back telling me they would send me the replacement colors. No late than 3 days later, I got my replacements. Very happy with this purchase, and I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> great polish  great customer service</li>
            <li> i really like the colors they are very bright but they are hard to get off and they stain your nails</li>
            <li> arrived before arrival date. all you have to do is apply one coat and it covers very well. very happy with order. Only one problem was one of the bottles was partially open and spilled a bit.</li>
            <li> I do like these very much... the set is perfect... they do smell diffrent then nail polish but thats OK does not bother me... and NO the smell will not stay on your nails after the bottle is closed the smell will go away.. Yes they DO stain your nails badly... Lucky me I have UV Gel Builder on my nails and can buff the stain out.. If you put on natural nails beware..... One coat will do , covers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;they do NOT come in a box they are loosly but nicely wraped in the mail, so as agift the apearance would not be good. I will defenatly get me some more... OH  also I had it on for 6 days now no chipping peeling for me, but I guess it&#x27;s because I use gel builder it adhires better to it then natural nails.. If you put on natural nail use the PH bond to dehidrate the nail so it will stay on longer/better as the nail has no oil on it.</li>
            <li> again this was a gift and i did not have to decide on one or two colors,  my daughter in law told me the color variety was great and some you could use in every season.</li>
            <li> I placed a review a few weeks ago and they didn&#x27;t like it so they deleted it. Whats the point of giving a review if its going to be deleted because I had a issue. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty...even better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> i have received my order and i love it.....</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant and not washed out. However, the polishes starts to chip off the next day and what doesn&#x27;t come off is hard to take off with remover. It stains the nail</li>
            <li> These made the perfect Sweet-16 birthday gift.  She loved them!</li>
            <li> These are terrific colors.  Great value and goes on very smooth</li>
            <li> ALL COLOURS I WANTED. GOES ON GREAT.</li>
            <li> Have not tried it yet but the smell is very strong.  Not sure I this is the way it is suppose to smell.</li>
            <li> Overall I was happy with them (great color, goes on easy and dries fast) but they do chip easily and the green turned my nail yellow</li>
            <li> Very beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> I ordered the nail polish for my daughter and she really enjoys it. I will be ordering more very soon. The nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip and our nail look professionally done.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors the picture doesn&#x27;t do these colors justice.</li>
            <li> These colors are vibrant- holy crap!! Now, for the good, the bad and the ugly. The good: the colors are the most intense metallics I&#x27;ve ever seen. Magnificent. Be prepared to be blown away. They&#x27;re awesome for stamping. The bad and ugly: The white is not metallic- it&#x27;s a glitter and it&#x27;s thick and yucky...or yick and thucky...completely useless. Overall, these are way worth the price. Very happy. As for how they hold up on natural nails, I don&#x27;t know. Now that I&#x27;m doing gel polish, I really don&#x27;t care, but too bad colors like this don&#x27;t exist in gels...I&#x27;d buy them in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Well, at first I was very happy, the colors are beautiful and only needed one coat, and the polish stayed on well.  A little too well, actually, because they stained both my nails and my daughters nails, and we scrubbed more than usual with nail polish remover... still didn&#x27;t get rid of it.  Not happy, won&#x27;t be using again. Too bad.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used at home!  Definitely salon quality and sure can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Awesome color but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 days before it chips and peels off.  It also stains your nails for a few days once removed. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> A nice set. Every color is very vibrant and beautiful, but goes on a little thick and chips pretty easily. For those reasons, I recommend these as stamping polishes. That would also decrease the risk of bad staining, which is common with these colors, too. Be very careful with the green, one coat without a base will turn your nails lemon yellow.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, all polishes arrived unbroken, and I received all of the colors that I was supposed to. My Metallic Red&#x27;s brush was messed up, as if it wasn&#x27;t cut correctly, but it&#x27;s still usable. Just makes things a little messier.&lt;br /&gt;I think this makes a great stamping set, there are so many colors and they&#x27;re all very pigmented. But otherwise, be careful about staining.</li>
            <li> Great deal for very pigmented, beautiful polishes. they take a long time to dry, but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  Arrived promptly.  Good colors.</li>
            <li> I just got into stamping and needed a good variety of colors to practice stamping with. I didn&#x27;t want to end up wasting the expensive special polish I had while still trying to master the learning curve. After reading all the reviews saying these polishes could be used for stamping I decided the price was low enough for my purposes. I figured if any of the colors didn&#x27;t work so well for stamping I could always use it as a base to stamp on top of. I was able to stamp with each of the colors onto white paper and got good results with all of them except \\&quot;Metallic White\\&quot; which isn&#x27;t metallic at all but more like clear lumpy, glittery glue. Its not opaque enough to use for stamping and too hard to work with as a regular polish. I tried to use it as a base color to stamp on top of because it has the potential to be pretty but that didn&#x27;t work out so well. Metallic White has a strange consistency, different from the other colors, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or dry properly. I added a coat of [[ASIN:B007U90J5U Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]] over the white to get it to dry better, but only the very top layer dried with the polish still wet underneath. After waiting an hour it hadn&#x27;t improved &amp; I was able to peel away the top layer in one piece leaving a sticky layer of polish on my nail. I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing it away, its not really good for any purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the colors work great for stamping and go on smoothly &amp; evenly as a regular polish. They also dry in a normal amount of time (use a fast dry top coat to speed things up.) The first color I tried for nail art was Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Red\\&quot;, which I used to make a small simple heart over the top of my smile line with a light gray base &amp; darker gray tip. Metallic Red was easy to work with &amp; made the heart look almost like a glittery sticker.  When my manicure started chipping, each of the hearts stayed intact until I removed them with acetone.  On the next manicure I tried stamping a mesh type pattern with Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Black\\&quot; over a clear base coat, painted the tips also with Metallic Black &amp; went over it with a top coat to give the impression of thigh high fishnet stockings. Kleancolor metallic polish works great for stamping, the polish scrapes without streaks &amp; the whole pattern transfers cleanly to the stamper. When I stamped my nails with Metallic Black, on first impression it looked \\&quot;grayer\\&quot; than the same design stamped with [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W Konad Black]]. I couldn&#x27;t see any of the metallic sparkles at all, it just looked matte. However, once I put a top coat of [[ASIN:B009CY02DA Seche Vite]] over it the black looked much darker &amp; shiny plus you could see the metallic sparkles again which added a certain something to the overall design.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problems I have encountered besides the Metallic White color being just awful in multiple ways, are the colors staining your fingernails &amp; the stamper. Its especially a problem with the [[ASIN:B00CJIOG0Q Winstonia stamper]] since its a really soft, slightly sticky kind of stamper. The staining issue can also make it difficult to completely clean off the stamping plates but it helps if you use 100% acetone.n with Kleancolor \\&quot;Metallic Black\\&quot; over a clear base coat, painted the tips also with Metallic Black &amp; went over it with a top coat to give the impression of thigh high fishnet stockings.

            <li> Great colors! Some of them have uneven bottoms...so they wobble...but it doesn&#x27;t bother me...I like the mettalic colors.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy received 6 of the same color!!!!</li>
            <li> was a gift for grandaughter</li>
            <li> Nail polish never really dries... Chips from the get go.</li>
            <li> Awesome color selections!!</li>
            <li> These colors are so vibrant and pretty!  My 5 year old daughter loves nail polish and we&#x27;ve been using various combinations of these for the past month.  I have no noticed any residual staining and the color lasts well with a clear top coat applied.  I will be buying more colors soon.</li>
            <li> Incredible quality for the price. I used #159 and #162, the orange and gold, to make fall colored nails! While it&#x27;s not really what I think of when I think &#x27;metallic&#x27; these colors have a great shine to them and apply easily. Be warned, they take some time to dry. If you want to expand your collection or are just getting started, this is a perfect kit to consider.</li>
            <li> I love love love these!!! The Aqua color is my favorite!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these nail polishes.  I usually pick them up for 1.50 a piece at my local daiso but this was an awesome deal even considering I wouldn&#x27;t usually buy some of the colors. Definitely made it fun to expand my horizons on incorporating new colors in my designs. All of them are very pretty and have gotten great complements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super shiny and statement making,  for cheap nail polish it is the best. Gives me a reason to do my nails all the time especially when I can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be aware you always need to use a good base coat or heck use a layer of top coat, especially on the pinks and greens. It&#x27;s good practice to anyways but you&#x27;re nail will be dyed if you don&#x27;t.  So pretty is worth it though.</li>
            <li> My Nieces loved them.</li>
            <li> I really like them .but I was really looking for purple chrome nail polish</li>
            <li> Polish won&#x27;t stay on..chips and peels off within hours of putting it on..colors are pretty sitting on decorative tray on my dresser..but on my nails...what a waste</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get these July 10th. I received them earlier than expected. It&#x27;s the 7th now. I&#x27;ve tried four colors and so far I am not disappointed. The drying time takes a long time, but I also purchased Seche Vite fast dry top coat, and with the two combined I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Great colors, but if you don&#x27;t have time to wait around for them to dry, then you definitely need the top coat I talked about.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.  Colors are amazing and really stand out. Will get a lot of use this summer.</li>
            <li> Customer service is awesome... And the colors are beautiful especially the black one!</li>
            <li> Most of my bottles of polish were broken...... it did not even come with the red polish.... i wanted that most of all</li>
            <li> smells worse then most and some of the colors arent as pictured and its really hard to get off but cheap and i like the selection.</li>
            <li> Although the colors are beautiful and the price is a steal there is always a catch.  More than half of the nail polishes stain my nails.  I keep them separated to use only as decoration on top of a different coat but even then it is used sparingly because it stains through.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! It dries super fast and I only need one coat to cover the whole nail. It des stain the nail like some reviews state however my nails are always painted with color anyway so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift.  The bottles came very carefully wrapped in bubble wrap, and no bottles were cracked or broken.  Since the bottles were not boxed or inside a closed display case, I decided to keep a few for myself.  The shiny green looks great on my toes and was easy to apply.  I also kept the blue and purple for polish changes.  The polish dries quickly, and the color stays vivid.</li>
            <li> liked the colors . the green polish was smashed in delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Love the colors!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Gets scrapped after few hours, never lasts more than a day. Also not easy to remove - with pink and red colors specially, it leaves red hues on half of the finger. Price may be good, but the quality suffers.</li>
            <li> This polish is very pigmented. One coat covered perfectly. They all look great.  I was able to stamp with each color except the white. I was excited with my first polish. My nails looked great. Unfortunately, without a REALLY good top coat the polish chips fast.  I used a gel top coat that can be taken off with acetone ( not real gel that you need to soak your nails) and my polish started to wear after 3 days.  I also had one chip.  If you have a great top coat then I would definitely buy these!</li>
            <li> This color arrangement is awesome. The polish goes on effortlessly and is super smooth. The colors are vibrant, well all but the white which is more like a thick glitter. The white is also the slowest to dry. Im so used to buying polish that requires more than one coat, but not Kleancolor! One coat for full coverage of every color. Without a clear coat they are not very shiny. Definately would reccommend as a must buy for those who like a choice of glittery colors!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish. Lasts a long time without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;The metallic colors are awesome and this set has so many to chose from</li>
            <li> Awesome colors, great coverage and nice application brush along with fantastic pricing.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> They were delivered to me super fast, none of the bottles were broken or damaged, and the colors are great. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors, only issue is one color was broke when I got it</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but the colors peels after wearing for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Still can;t believe the price! I bought these for a bachelorette party I was hosting. Really nice colors, and it stays on pretty great as well!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Long lasting&amp;#34; is no where near right. Not even twelve hours and all nails chipped some. I ordered this a month ago, I ordered a set of headphones a week ago. The headphones arrived first. I will say this, though the color is beautiful. It is also very quick drying.  And I want to try a clear coat on top to see if it helps the chipping.</li>
            <li> It was ok I may buy these</li>
            <li> Realy nice bright colors, but difficult to remove</li>
            <li> WE gave these as party favors. Everyone loved theirs</li>
            <li> Ordered this on Saturday. Got it by Monday. Great colors. The best nail polish I own now. Definitely best $12 ever spent. Plus, free shipping just puts the cherry on top.</li>
            <li> I really love them so much. They got here before the expected delivery date and the colors are beautiful. I don&#x27;t think they smell as bad as some people are saying, to me they just smell like any other nail polish. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
            <li> So affordable and I love the color. You only need one coat. However after a few uses it gets thick. It is also hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is a beautiful brand of colors. The polish itself usually needs at least one treatment of OPI Lacquer Thinner as the polish is a little too thick and doesn&#x27;t coat well at first. But that has no reflection on the seller. Seller is amazing and faster than anticipated in shipping! Kudos.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE THICKNESS OF THE POLISH, THOUGH I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE THICK BRUSHES</li>
            <li> The colours are amazing. Very pretty and they dry really fast. So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors...chips too quick..got top grade top coat...still chipped in 2 days..prepare for multiple touchups....</li>
            <li> Colors r beautiful luv it !!!!!</li>
            <li> quality is not good, very easy to chip!</li>
            <li> These colors are AMAZING!!!  I love how bold the colors are and the ease of application. I feel as though one coat is good. Usually I have to keep adding coats to get the colors I want with other cheap brands. But this is perfection for me.</li>
            <li> Chips so easily it will last about a day and then it&#x27;ll start to chip.</li>
            <li> These polishes are nice thought it had silver it doesnt was a white that looks more glittery than metallic but thats just one alll the others r spot on the colors r vibrant for the price certainly worth it I did display swatches n they r gorg!!!</li>
            <li> Nice and opaque, the colors dry well except for the silver.</li>
            <li> The polish is pretty, but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> my kid like it very much</li>
            <li> These are so cute! The colors are beautiful and they look like high quality. They are stunning! These will make amazing Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> These colors are a great look, I really enjoy changing up</li>
            <li> I love these colors! They are great for stamping and to just wear! I will buy these again!</li>
            <li> This polish is a GREAT bargain...exactly what I ordered, just as they appear in the pic!! The colors are beautiful and no knock off...its the real brand as described (Kleancolor) &amp; all the bottles were full, not damaged. I ordered this 4 days ago &amp; I already got it. I actually bought 4 color sets (42 polishes total) with different colors &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten 3 sets already. I can&#x27;t wait to use them all!!</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it!  Great to stamp with!!!</li>
            <li> awesome colors! great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I have bought so much of the kleancolor polish because I love the beautiful vibrant colors that I really have never found in any other brand!  I wore them all the time and started noticing that ibhad a horrible non stop metalic taste in my mouth! I cut out all thw meds that I was takin that I could and the taste waa still there!  I changed my lotions, toothpaste, soap even went to the dr! He could find nothin wrong so I thought maybe it was my polish! I stopped using the kleancolor and the taste went away and has never come back! It breaks my heart because like I said I just love the colors! So I sold all that I had except for about 10 bottles that I refuse to get rid of coz i just love to look at the colors!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with colors and selection of colors. They do have a tendency to bleed some so be sure to top coat before doing nail art especially lighter colored acrylic paint.</li>
            <li> Great set of polish! Colors are bright and polish goes on evenly. I used them for water marbling and the end results are gorgeous. Even the colors that I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like are shimmery and look great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Real lovely bright metallic colors. These polishes don&#x27;t watermarble well at all but they are thick and most of them with the exception of the white go on with one coat, I put a white base first before using the metallic white. 12 polishes for $14, can&#x27;t be the price.</li>
            <li> was girft for birthday of granddaughter - she loved them all</li>
            <li> These are totally and completely gorgeous.  Beautiful, bright, vivid colors and one coat does a great job but you probably won&#x27;t be able to stop at one coat. And these are full sized bottles.  You get a lot of product for a great price. I think I might order another set.  I am not even a big polish wearer but these will change all that.</li>
            <li> Greatest polish ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but chips within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my niece, she loves doing her nails. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the product! I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love the Colors and it does so fast. I can paint my nails right before bed with no worries.</li>
            <li> these polishes are beautiful I just love them, really only needs one coat</li>
            <li> Since there are so many other reviews I will make mine short and sweet. I love the colors! The Metallic shine is more my style and I like having a small variety. One coat was all it took, I used the Orange first. The dry time seemed pretty reasonable. As for the smell, it was a little different than normal but not horrible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a personal note, I don&#x27;t have luck with my nails or polish. I always break a nail as soon as I paint them. Nail polish always chips after two days and that&#x27;s even with a professional manicure. I&#x27;ve used super expensive nail polish brands and not had better luck. So for my opinion of this set is that even if it turns out to just be ok for wear and durability, it will work for me because I ruin everything and can&#x27;t have nice things.</li>
            <li> I have gotten other sets of Kleancolor polishes since I got these and have not been disappointed in any of them, I know people say they have a strong odor but Im okay with it, they are all very good and easy to apply and hold up well and this purchase started me buying Kleancolor like crazy! These metallics are awesome for stamping too!!  just make sure you use a good base coat so your nails don&#x27;t stain - a supreme value for the money!</li>
            <li> Nice consistency! The polishes are beautiful and are not too thin or thick, making it easy to apply. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Kleancolor Nail Polish - Awesome Metallic Full Size Lacquer Lot of 12-pc Set Body Care / Beauty Care / Bodycare... (Health and Beauty)\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lot of Kleancolor Nail polish is the best!  The colors are bright, metallic, and wear amazing. If you use a base coat (I prefer Q-Tica) them with a top coat such as Seche vite, it really brings out the colors and they are extremely vivid!!! I can&#x27;t wait to change my polish every week! These nail polish colors wear well too and don&#x27;t chip off in a day or two if applied correctly. They last a long time. Over a year later and these polishes are still thin and easy to put on! Most polish gets thick after a year and you have to replace - Not these! The Kleancolor Nail Polish don&#x27;t get thick at all - they still go on just as easily as they did the day I bought them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend to anyone who loves to paint their nails and have fun with great colors!!! The metallic polish can be a bit difficult to remove, so I use pure acetone and can get it off fairly easily with pure acetone!  It‚Äôs worth it though to not have a polish that chips and wears off the day after you spend an hour giving yourself a manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helped you, please click the button that says that it helped you, thank you so very much!! I really appreciate your feedback and time!</li>
            <li> I love these metallic polishes by Kleancolor. They are all very pigmented and work for my stamping and water marble nail art. I was so impressed with these colors that I purchased an even bigger lot of Kleancolor lacquer. I know some people experienced staining of the nail bed but I use these over a gel manicure on my hands and I use two coats of base on my toes so staining is not an issue.</li>
            <li> Love this deal. Kleancolor makes great polish and you can&#x27;t top the price anywhere! Don&#x27;t pass it up, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but definitely could smell the pungent odor everyone was complaining about even before I opened the polish jars.</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful colors and how they look on my nails but it chips really fast.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these Nail Polish. Love all the colours and the price is just right.&lt;br /&gt;12 bottles and they are awesome lol. I bought them last year and I still have them and I use them regularly. I would recommend this</li>
            <li> Was not impressed, may look good on acrylic nails but chipped away on natural nails</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law who collects nail polish like some collect baseball cards. She opened them up and was SO excited to see the range of colors. After trying them out, she raved about the metallic sheen, the thick coverage, and the beautiful, vivid colors. Her only complaint was that they seem to be a bit stinkier than other polishes.  This has not deterred her from using them though! She just paints her nails in a well ventilated area, or turns on a small fan.  She&#x27;s requested several other sets as gifts now that she&#x27;s tried one out.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more Kleancolor polish for her in the future!</li>
            <li> I am in love with every single color in this set. The colors are just as they look in the picture. I had been searching for metallic polishes but they are quite expensive in stores and the cheaper ones aren&#x27;t as pretty. So I hesitated on ordering these at first. But I&#x27;m now glad I did. I can honestly say this by far is my favorite purchase from Amazon just because the gorgeous colors &amp; the look make me so happy. I&#x27;m getting ready to order the neon colors next</li>
            <li> Awesome colors! Love them! Bought one for niece and she loved them so I ordered myself one!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend, and she loved it! Very pretty. I&#x27;m happy i picked this to send her.</li>
            <li> chips VERY easily even putting a clear coat on it doesn&#x27;t help much but the colors still turn out amazing!</li>
            <li> Just got them today an let me say (wow)&lt;br /&gt;I love them . First time ordering nail polish&lt;br /&gt;Online . The shipping was very fast an every polish was wrapped an secure . And the colors r what they look like in the pic.</li>
            <li> it comes off very easily. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vivid and it is thick enough that you don&#x27;t have to put more than one coat.</li>
            <li> These colors are just beautiful! Great quality product for a fraction of the cost of brands I buy in ny local drug store.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, great metallic colors. Goes on smooth and opaque in one coat. Haven&#x27;t tried it for stamping yet, but the water color designs work perfect.</li>
            <li> love these......... the best ppl always look at my nails.. say so cool...will get more from this person.. love themmmmmmmmm.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remove and stains the nails.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors however polish starts chipping the SAME day you polish. By third day it I completely chipped and almost 1/2 off your nails. I paint my nails frequently with many different brands and this is by far the worst. Maybe because it is so bright and metallic it causes the polish to chip easily. It could be useful for dotting but not for full color polish.</li>
            <li> i ordered this set even though there were some negative reviews. I figured at least some of the positive ones must be true. And they were. This polish goes on smooth and evenly, covering completely with one coat and no base coat needed! All of my other polishes tend to need a base. I am going to order other finishes from this brand, no doubt. No duplicates, no broken or open bottles either.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful! Seriously, the pictures don&#x27;t do them justice. They cover well, some people have mentioned using 2 coats but for me it only took 1 coat. Shipping was quick and they were packaged well, nothing was broken. The only real downside I have found so far is my polish started chipping after a day.</li>
            <li> love the colors and it stays on the toe nails forever. I wash too many dishes for it to last too long on the fingernails.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but they stain your nails bad. not easy to get off at all. I would recommend for someone who has a lot of time</li>
            <li> Bottles are bigger than I thought they were. Beautiful colors. Drys quick. Love it.</li>
            <li> really nice colours good product</li>
            <li> Colors look great and they are full size bottles. They are a Christmas gift for my daughter so I&#x27;m not sure how good they are but so far I&#x27;m really impressed</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.Good quality and beautiful shiny colors. This polish only takes one coat ..unlike some cheap brands that need several coats just to match how the color looks in the bottle. I would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> Thumbs Up: They came very quickly even the day before the expected delivery date, which made me very happy! Nice colors and received in good condition. Would definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down: None thus far</li>
            <li> Good polish, long lasting!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely wonderful for stamping. They are very fully pigmented and a bit thick, you could probably do your nails in one coat, but for stamping they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased them for stamping after seeing some swatches on the internet that used the KleanColor Metallic Orange, and I was not disappointed. The only color that doesn&#x27;t show up really well is the yellow, although if you use it over white or another really light color it would work ok. The Green works best over pale colors as well, but the rest work with almost any combination, and you get an entire rainbow of colors for the price of one or two Konad Special polishes. The white here is not an opaque white you would use for stamping if you wanted actual white, but you can still stamp with it and its more of a silvery glitter. But the rest of the colors are just as good as some of the konad special polishes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this polish. It stays on for a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> My Daughter and I are into, The whole nail art Thing .....These are full of metallic color colors are as they appear</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the colors are very good!  I really like the products.  I found same brand at dollar tree but the colors weren&#x27;t nearly as good as these!</li>
            <li> I love this polish! It is just what I wanted, it is shimmery it dries fast and stays pretty also very sturdy, I wash my hands and clean all day.I recommend! All the colors are so pretty:-)</li>
            <li> These came very quickly and not a one broken! I was amazed by the colors! The picture does not do them justice! Very pleased I decided to purchase these! Will deff buy again and recommend to everyone! Thank-You!!</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are great beautiful colors and dries quickly!!!  They are worth every penny you spend!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, broken brush on a couple bottles.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, the paint is good, but it doesn&#x27;t survive a shower without peeling or chipping.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich colors!</li>
            <li> Kleancolor Metallic Nail Polish is really awesome. The colors are so vibrant &amp; the polish is thick &amp; goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> the colors popped out you , ,LOVE  IT!</li>
            <li> they are fun colors. I read in other reviews on the strong smell. I don&#x27;t think that it is strong at all. I have bought much stronger polish from the store. The price was great and I thought that they would come in small bottles.  No they are normal size. I repaint my nails 2-3 times a week and I have a color for what ever I ware.</li>
            <li> Great price for the set &amp; the colors are GORGEOUS.. A few friends have even bought these because they loved the colors. They DO stain your nails, but only if you don&#x27;t add a basecoat. They have a STRONG smell too. My only true complaint is that the white was very goopy &amp; didn&#x27;t want to dry.</li>
            <li> Luv the wonderful extra shine &amp; shades of colors. The finish is very metallic. Luv it!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesnt come off!!! It takes forever!! But it looks beautiful  and it was very neatly packaged and shipped quickly. Just be prepared to be scrubbing it off of your nails, despite how beautiful it makes your nails look! And you must use a clear top coat.</li>
            <li> The polishes were fantastic! The colors showed well after only one coat. Amazon sells these for a great price for so many great colors, it dries quickly and stays on for long time. Though this isn&#x27;t a known brand of nail polish, it has the same awesome qualities as any big brand like Essie or Opi. I bought these beauties thinking that the metallic wouldn&#x27;t show up but it did, bright and boldly. My only complaint was the strange smell, though it was more appealing then the average nail polish. These polishes would be an excellent birthday or holiday present for girls any age!&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend these nail polishes, its a fantastic price with very good quality! Essie nail polish costs $8 dollars a bottle, this costs a little about that, for 12 bottles! Colors are exactly like the ones shown.</li>
            <li> Some bottles apparently were old, Polish not usable</li>
            <li> I only get 6 of the colors</li>
            <li> I love these colors !!! They made my nails shine :) :) :) :) :D XDXD;-):-)O:-):O:-O;-):-)B-)B-)B-)B-)B-)B-)B-)B-)B-)thanks you for made this possible</li>
            <li> Just love this polish. The colors are vivid. One coat provides great coverage. Good price. Fast shipping. I liked this polish so much I sent a set to my daughter too. The husband noticed my nails in the green shade and said it was the prettiest polish he&#x27;d ever seen me wear :) I highly recommend this polish!!</li>
            <li> Love them every color is just beautiful they came in just a few days after ordering them and every color is so beautiful especially on the toes I believe women should not ware sandles with messed up toes and these are perfect makes the toes pop color is so rich and shiny  :-) I will def be order again</li>
            <li> I love these colors and was happy to add them to my collection! I got the nail polish super fast, a day before the expected delivery date, and was very pleased with that! I will definitely be ordering from Kleancolor again in the near future to add more colors to my collection!</li>
            <li> While it covers nicely and the colors are so very nice, since I started using it (changing colors every other day and layering it on, like I do it every other polish I own) I noticed my nails becoming very brittle and the top layer peeling off. NEVER before has this happened to me. I tried using a bottom coat of protective polish but it didn&#x27;t help much. Whenever I bent my nail down (even just a small nudge) the top layer, starting from the ends, would separate and break off, or just chip off.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice this happening until the second week, I simply used a bottom coat of nail hardener/strengthener and thought nothing of it. Then I started to notice how thin my nails were getting to the point of one slowly, painfully cracking in half. Yep I stopped using this on my finger nails. However it doesn&#x27;t affect my toe nails at all. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;So now I mostly use this polish for my art projects and such. Just hope this polish doesn&#x27;t affect your nails the same way it did mine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors and long lasting finish! I like the array of colors provided in the set- very pretty. Awesome Saucem!</li>
            <li> These colors are AWESOME! They are so vibrant and they came really quick! One thing I would advise is to make sure you use a base coat with the green because if you don&#x27;t it will stain your fingernails a yellow-green FOREVER! ...gross lol</li>
            <li> All the colors are as showed in the pictures, great value. Only lasts on nails one day, however it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product with wonderful colors for use. Selection of colors are not overbearing but classy and trendy!!!</li>
            <li> good for the price, they are pretty, glittery &amp; shiny. but they wear very quickly. after a day I have to repaint. granite this is from everyday wear, dishes, showering, washing my hands. good for a girls first NP kit. but not for adults.</li>
            <li> When i finally got these polishes i was definitely excited! They are great colors, great sized bottles, and came at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful &amp; stay in artificial nail products well. Not great for natural nail retention. Peels in just a couple days.</li>
            <li> worst Amazon purchase ever. Polish is cheap, chips, stains your nails, and smells terrible even when dry.  I can smell my nails in the middle of the night when I&#x27;m sleeping. The shimmer in the black settles and makes the polish like sludge. You will need a high gloss top coat as the polish dries dull. Received two of the same colors &amp; contacted seller. Their response was identify the missing color and they&#x27;d ship it.  Now how on earth would I know which color was missing when the product is just a lot of metallics?</li>
            <li> Great It is good I got it on time so good . I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
            <li> I like the colors a lot !! however, sadly, it doesnt stay on nails more than one day because it is not as strong as other nail polishers. Just i will buy an extra &#x27; colorless protective&#x27; nail polisher from the Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors they are amazing!!!  I really recommend buy buying it if your looking for nail polishes!!!!</li>
            <li> I Can Use These Colors for Every Outfit I Have! Also cream light orange(not in this lot) and metallic gold make a lovely coral.</li>
            <li> These were used for teacher appreciation gifts.  Everyone seemed to like the colors.</li>
            <li> These twelve metallic colors are gorgeous and shimmery, and cover well in 1 - 2 coats.  They came packaged extremely well, which was good as the package had a particularly strong odor, alerting me to be careful opening.  Some of the lids were a bit loose; perhaps they needed to be as they were coming to the desert in August.  Two of them had leaked some nail polish, but because the bottles were individually wrapped in paper, as well as being in bubbly bags, it wasn&#x27;t a big mess.  I&#x27;ve put another set of this company&#x27;s colors on my wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up:  After using one of these colors on my nails I cannot recommend.  The green color stained my fingernails terribly, even with a clear base coat beneath it.  I couldn&#x27;t get the stain out no mater what I did (bleach, buffing)  the nails just had to grow out, which took over half a year.  If you want to use these as paint, the colors are lovely, I would never use on my fingernails again.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for my neice who LOVES to do nails. The colors are beautiful but we are finding that it chips pretty quickly. Still, it was a fun gift to get for her as she uses a lot of nail polish to paint nails. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Colors are great only thing is you have to paint fast beause it drys very quick.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter and she loved them. Great product, great colors and all in all just an amazing product. I will for sure buy again!!</li>
            <li> Got my package uber early so that was awesome. The polish is awesome. The colors are bold the smell is a Lil strong but its not all that bothersome. I really wasnt expecting such a wonderful product. Defiantly will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful. The polish goes on and dries great.</li>
            <li> Just a great reminder that you get what you pay for. This is very cheap in quality. The colors were interesting, but when they cannot last a full day, what good does it do? When the packaging arrived, 3 bottles of polish had broken, making a horrible mess. Could be luck of the draw, but that was not fun to deal with.</li>
            <li> Great colors and a nice assortment. I did not receive any repeats. The color is good and dense, so it does not take many coats, but like many metallics, I have found that it chips super easy (even with a top coat). Still, it is a fun set with a nice range. It made a nice stocking stuffer for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loves this polish!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these colors! The nail polish is good quality and they are normal size! I think I will be ordering another set of colors of this brand!</li>
            <li> Like the colors, but didn&#x27;t wear as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Nail polish is very pretty however it chips immediately. If your looking for a polish that lasts this probably isn&#x27;t want you wanna buy</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift, but I had added it to my wish list based on swatches of the Purple and Sapphire. I did not expect to like the Metallic Yellow, Metallic Mango, Metallic Orange, or Metallic Fuchsia -- those just aren&#x27;t my normal colors. However, I&#x27;m so lucky that I received this set because every color is amazing. They shine and shimmer! The Red, Mango, Orange and Yellow are perfect for fall. The Pink, Aqua, Fuchsia, Purple and Green are perfect for spring and summer. This is a must-have set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached swatches in natural light. It doesn&#x27;t show the shimmer as well as in person, the but the hues are true to color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polishes do chip like a mofo, so make sure you use at least a top coat (base would probably be a good idea, too). Otherwise, they&#x27;ll chip before the day is out.</li>
            <li> The price is great for the amount of polishes. It gives great coverage, you can get away with one coat. I&#x27;ve read that the smell is horrible, even when dry, and that&#x27;s not the case for me. I&#x27;ve also read that they stain, but I have yet to remove it. I applied 3 coats of base polish, like I always do, so hopefully they don&#x27;t stain too bad. Overall, great polishes for the price. It&#x27;s a good way to start a nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews so I would know what to expect. Shipping was fast it arrived in about two days,  they were packaged nicely with no broken bottles, and I received all the colors listed. So far I have used the pink (which I&#x27;m absolutely in love with), the aqua, and the green. I did use a base coat and the green did stain a little bit, but nothing too major( I&#x27;ve had a Sally stain my nails worst). Overall,  I love the colors and I&#x27;m happy with them, I&#x27;ll be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> Great nail polish. Packed well with bottles separated so no breakage. The colors are really nice and 1 coat does it.  The consistency is just right, The brush is good as well. I am very sensitive to odors and this polish does NOT smell. It also dries very quickly.  Very pleased. I will buy again from this brand.</li>
            <li> i love it , my orders was in time an all the colors are georgeous , i&#x27;m very happy with my orders thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very vivid and bright colors. Goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I&#x27;ll be buying more colors soon!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. ...awesome polish! Great for nail art too!</li>
            <li> Got these for my 13 yr old daughter who loves to do nails. She loves the colors and loves the metallic! The polish seems to stay on really well but she is so excited about it that she has repainted her nails every 2 or 3 days since christmas (when she got them). Very happy with purchase and shipping was pretty quick! Packaging was great no damage when received and colors were as shown.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the colors of metallic but polish started to turn dry,üò• can&#x27;t use them anymore,,</li>
            <li> Turns nails yellow when removed</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  They are super!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied at all with the nail polish.  It doesn&#x27;t come with all variety colors as shown on the picture.  In fact I will like to return one set and get my money back.</li>
            <li> Fun gift for preteen/teen girl</li>
            <li> Stained the livving daylights out of my nails.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  The colors are fun and metallic.  The polish does dry fast,  but the polish doesn&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t apply a good clear coat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic polish! For the most part only needed one coat! Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product! Shipping was right on time and was packaged well so none of those bottles were broken. Polish itself is good quality and looks a lot like the pictures. Very satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love all the colors that came with this order. theyre beautiful, shiny and at a great price. im excited to see what else Klean Color has for me to buy! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t put any of these on a clean nail yet, just over my old polish, but the colours are very pretty and very metallic and seem to cover up the nail polish i put them over, so they must be pretty thick in substance.  i&#x27;m not worried about staining, as other people have complained of.  i wear two base coats that protect my nails so well, i don&#x27;t even have problems removing glitter polish, which i know from experience can be a nasty process.  i did not get any duplicate colours and the price was good.  these are comparable in size to any bottle of polish you&#x27;d buy in a store, not mini bottles, as i feared they might be.  very happy and will be ordering more of these really pretty polishes.</li>
            <li> I love these colors!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but hard to remove because of the glitter</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing.  They are bright and there is such a large variety. Good brushes. Able to draw awesome designs and neat lines. The polish isn&#x27;t too watery or clumpy, it&#x27;s really perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my sister and they are really beautiful colors! They&#x27;re bright and vibrant. They look better in person than in the picture , but they leave her nails looking professional!</li>
            <li> I love these metallic colors they are all very good quality and bright colors.  I have used about 4 of the colors so far and have loved each one, can&#x27;t wait to use more.</li>
            <li> Omg I love these colors. They&#x27;re bright and just amazing. The color payoff with is more than expected. I was pleasantly surprised with how many of the colors I liked.&lt;br /&gt;The white one I could do without, its just a shimmer, nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;They did leave a little residue color on my nails even though I used a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;But with how well the colors pop, I didn&#x27;t care about a little color on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very worth buying the set.</li>
            <li> The upside to this order was it shipped and delivered way ahead of schedule.  The downside, the nail polish chips. even when using a base coat and top coat, it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  It didn&#x27;t last long through showers, cooking and washing dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish covers in one coat and looks amazing.  They are rich colors that look awesome when nails are painted with more than one color.  I have to agree that the green stained my nails a light yellow, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal as I was repainting them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on trying a different brand of base and top coats to see if that helps with the chipping.  Either way I would buy again because the colors are awesome.</li>
            <li> One coat!  That&#x27;s all!  One coat and I am done.  It dries very fast, which is huge since I often ruin a manicure because I just don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to dry.  Why 4 stars?  I can&#x27;t the color to come off my nail.  Not with all of them, just with a few of them, green for instance, or blue, or even hot pink.  Still, worth it!</li>
            <li> The colors are BRILLIANT!  However it arrived with one broken bottle - they were packaged nice and carefully.  I believe that bottle exploded because it got so cold - that is why I give a 5.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has beautiful colors, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on well. My daughter used it and it came of in one day. Mine stayed on for a couple of days and then chipped and scraped off.  I applied a top coat the last time and it increased the staying time a few days more.  Great item if you can change polish every day or two.  Very good price.</li>
            <li> I was expecting 12 different nail colors as listed in the ad and the pictures but 2 were duplicate colors so I only received 10 different colors. The colors are pretty but I have not used them.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars for this product because I absolutely loved the color and how nice it looks with only one coat. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family to use. However there is one flaw with this product. I usually redo my nails every week due to chipping and mainly wanting to try different colors. But this nail polish i find is extremely difficult to remove with nail polish remover. I had to use like 3 cotton balls on each hand or more just to get one coat of this nail polish off, when i usually only use 2 for both, which i find very inconvenient. It took me maybe 15-20 minutes to remove off both my hands. Overall, this is a very good product and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased these to gift to her sisters and they all loved it.</li>
            <li> Love these, but my twelve set did not include a yellow, instead was a black matte, which I don&#x27;t care for. My only complaint is base coat or not, some of them stain ur nails really bad...</li>
            <li> Color of nail polish are great there poppin love  all the colors will order again</li>
            <li> they are great colors and they hold well dont chip and flake to easy,well packaged fast delivery love the colors.good coverage.drys easy looks great.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the colors, but as other reviewers have stated, the paint smells very strong even after a few days on the nails! The paint also peals off the fingernails very easy.</li>
            <li> Just received kleancolor metallic nail polish, absolutely LOVE all the colors! The nail polish goes on dark, only need one coat! Best polish I have purchased in a very long time! Definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I love my polish! They&#x27;re pretty cool colors. They make a fashion statement. Also very universal. Because of brightness an etc. I</li>
            <li> I LOVE these, colors are awesome, the only thing is that they have a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail polishes, and to be honest I will continue to buy this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very inexpensive! Colors are very pigmented and were more than I expected. Dry as quick as the drugstore NYC nail polishes. Doesn&#x27;t leave your nail ugly when you take off polish. Again, very inexpensive a dollar a bottle! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Lasts about 2 days before they start to peel. (Lasts as long as the typical drugstore brands)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them! Shipping very fast</li>
            <li> I love a lot of these colors but BE CAREFUL and use a clear bottom coat. I put the orange on my fingers and when it came off I looked jaundiced for months! They just stayed this horrible yellow color until they grew out. I tried everything recommended to get rid of it but ended up just covering them up until I could cut it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the orange color was amazing. So just be sure to use a bottom clear coat.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Very vibrant color. My daughter and I are having a blast using these.</li>
            <li> Loving all the colors! The picture tells you lies... It&#x27;s even brighter and better in person! They&#x27;re long lasting, super sparkly, and comes in 12 different shades! My only complaint, is that they can stain really badly without a good base coat. Especially the green.</li>
            <li> Looking for metallic not glitter polish some looked metallic some look like glitter added the colors are nice though price is great</li>
            <li> Pros: Beautiful colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s very very thick I had to thin it out after a few trial runs it looks good</li>
            <li> Seriously - for the price - you really should. 12 bottles of shiny nail color for 13.00 ?? Even if you don&#x27;t like all the colors, or feel like you won&#x27;t use them now - save them to use in the winter, use them on your toes !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish is not just for fingers. In fact, I don&#x27;t use nail polish on my fingernails at all - only my toes :)</li>
            <li> Love the colors! If you are using them for stamping they go well over white and some go over black! They dry pretty quick so u have to move quickly but they are beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love them ! Great service!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. I have recommended it to 2 people who bought it</li>
            <li> did not receive full order</li>
            <li> Item packed well but colors are not same what we seen in the add..it reached within the date. Overall all we are not happy with product. .rest all okay</li>
            <li> I ordered my first set of these metallics. I showed them to my co-workers and this is the second order of metallics. Beautiful colors. Great price.</li>
            <li> OMG! I am in love with these nail polish colors! The colors look exactly like the photo! Price is amazing for all 12! Must buy if you love painting your nails!</li>
            <li> These are lots of fun they are a tad bit difficult to remove but the colors are crazy fun</li>
            <li> Got my package a few days earlier then said. All in great condition. Love them! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These come on time and are beautiful colors. They are bright and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. Some colors do stain your nails though. I use them for stamping and they work very well for stamping also. Have not had issues with chipping at all.</li>
            <li> I love all the different shades to choose from. The only problem is that even with a base coat, all the orange, yellow and green shades stain my nails</li>
            <li> These are the best nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever had! The colors are so vibrant and you really only need one coat which lasts. I am sold on this brand for life!</li>
            <li> It stays on for about a week without chipping or peeling. To take it off easy you would use acetone nail polish remover</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely gorgeous. The problem is that the polish began chipping off in less than 24 hours. When I took the polish off two days after I&#x27;d initially applied it, it left my nail beds stained. The polish is thin, and you can definitely tell the difference between this and higher quality polish. Also, I wanted to return the set because I&#x27;m unhappy with the quality, but I got a message that these items aren&#x27;t returnable so I guess I&#x27;m stuck. At least the colors are pretty. I&#x27;ll try it with a thick top coat next time and see if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, they dry quickly and apply easy. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to enhance your collection!!  I love love love them and when you take into account how inexpensive they are you can&#x27;t beat them!!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and stays o pretty good..</li>
            <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift for my niece who loves her nails painted.  She is a 5 yoa fasionista and having her own nail polish (with mom&#x27;s supervision) was exciting and made her feel important.  Would recommend because of the purchase and delivery was smooth!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; beautiful colors. Daughter loves her new polish!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  They are in beautiful colors but they stain your nail even with a base coat on it.  They also stain your cuticle.  The seller says you can use regular nail polish to remove this polish.  I have to use acetone.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to any one.  I really don&#x27;t use these but I&#x27;m stuck with them</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but even with a 2 layer base coat my nails were still stained.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors and great for the price!</li>
            <li> colors are very bright, picture is very accurate, goes easy on nails, love it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, great deal for $</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. I have 65+ bottles of nail polish and these are my favorite. I get a lot of complements at work on the colors. I work at Home Depot, using my hands a lot, so the nail polish usually chips within 2 days. Even if I get my nails professionally done, they don&#x27;t last long. All in all, I love this nail polish and recommend it to everyone, plus the price is perfect!</li>
            <li> Love love love. The color is strong enough to where you only need one coat. They DID NOT Stain my nails. Not even the black one. It stays on very very well. Doesn&#x27;t chip. I even work in a warehouse and work with my hands a lot and it still stayed on. Only negative is it took a little more effort to take off.</li>
            <li> I love them! The colors are bright and beautiful. I love the variety of colors and they shipped quickly. I received them in less than a week. The only downside I can see is that one of the colors leaked out a bit but not enough to ruin anything and they are very strong smelling. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good nail polish for a good price though.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and they came quickly, but sadly they tend to chip alot.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves them! Color stays on, no chips!</li>
            <li> So far I have only used one color one time. Like other reviews have said, it smells extra bad/strong compared to regular polish. It seems to hold about as well as other brands I have used, I got about a week with no chips adding a top coat to it. For the price I am certainly not complaining though as it stays better than I expected for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Pretty pretty colors. Good polish.covers in one coat.</li>
            <li> Great value. Gave as a gift.</li>
            <li> if I could LOVE this 100x, I would!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love all the bling of colors and the price is unbeatable!!!</li>
            <li> I seem to have gotten a different set of metallics that were shown in the product image. Mine seem to lean a bit heavily towards purple shades--fuschia, metallic purple and a darker sparkly metallic purple.  And no white, yellow or black.  Also 1 bottle broke during shipment. Accidents during shipping happen.  I bought them to use for stamping and have tried all of them.  I can tell that most of them will work very well for this purpose.  Only 2 weren&#x27;t suitable for stamping.  I&#x27;d liked to gotten more of a variety of colors, but for the price and for stamping, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on these colors. I like to mix and match them and the results are fantastic. I would like to order the regular nail polish with the 12-pc.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes went into my collection that I keep in a fishing tackle box.  When my girls and I are stuck in doors due to weather, we dig out the tackle box and paint out nails.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are a lot of fun to mix and match and they stay on for quite a while.  Usually use a base coat and then a top coat.  And usually when I am going to a salon to get my nails done, I bring a color with me in case I need a touch up and don&#x27;t have time to stop in.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to start off my collection for water marbling and i was absolutly blown away! The shipping was super fast and was at my door a week before the estimated date. It was very well packaged and even combined with my other order of cleancolor polishes so i got them all at the same time. The colors are beautiful and last a good amount of time. (Im a cashier at walmart so getting polish to stay on is no easy task) It works great with the designs i like to do and paints on nice and smooth. Along with the quality the price is amazing, spent less on this set then i would have buying the lower quality bottles at the store. This will always be my go to set for nail polishes!</li>
            <li> Great product and Seller to work with.</li>
            <li> This polish has beautiful color but likes to chip</li>
            <li> I love the polish!! Delivered on time but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that my metallic white bottle of polish was missing the brush completely. It has the lid but I cannot paint my nails that color at all due to no brush.</li>
            <li> Colors apply as shown. Love it!!:)</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Dries quickly.  I make glass animal eyes with this set using clear glass cabochons.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the fact that it has shimmer. I will definitely order more. It has a great scent bc it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell like other nail polishes has.</li>
            <li> They are really good. Depending on which base coat I use some of them do stain . I have tried the wraps base and only the green seems to leave a slight yellow tinge behind. With the hell base the blues really left their mark and with a rubber bonder base it was the reds that left a stain. But im still happy</li>
            <li> Terrible polish.  Would give it zero stars if I could.  Colors look beautiful so was very disappointed to find out that the polish is thick and therefore doesn&#x27;t apply well.  This is cheap in both the price and the quality.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is awful leaves a film over your nails</li>
            <li> These are great! Much thicker than I would have expected, you could get by with one coat. The complaints about the smell are very overblown. Great product for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is a really fun mix to play around with at a good price.  The colors are beautiful and application is smooth.  I&#x27;ve had faster drying polishes, but this is still worth it.</li>
            <li> Great colors! Love the polish and it came very well packaged.  It doesnt work that great with water nail art though. Some do but most dont.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! One coat coverage. Make sure you use a base coat or the colors will stain your nails.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors great price to would buy again but I did not get the free earrings</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful but I&#x27;m giving it a 2 star. I received two of the same color (Metallic Purple). Also,  the orange, black , and red are a matte finish. Still pretty tho.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors is very nice, but they chipped very easily even though I put a base coat, two layers of color and a top coat.  Good thing was it was easy to remove without polish remover.  I am thinking of mixing the color with the clear to hopefully bind it better to the base.  Cross your fingers!</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for teen daughter. She loved the colors and they work great for nail art. Would recommend putting top coat on them to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> his daughter loves them</li>
            <li> Bought these for my grand daughter for Christmas last year. Ordered them about a month or so before Christmas and never received them. Started getting really worried so contacted the company and they said they sent them. Told them I did not receive them, so they sent out another one. Assured me they would be her before Christmas, waited waited and waited. Finally Christmas Eve, about an hour before everyone was suppose to be here, they finally arrived. Although my grand daughter loved them, as I though she would, that was too close for comfort for me. Don&#x27;t know if I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> The polish is awesome and it arrived real quik the price is right I&#x27;am enjoying it alot.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous but the quality is lacking.  It begins to peel almost instantly.  This is definitely a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment and the price is right. Can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> Very cute colors! But chips quicker then I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about these nail polishes.  First of all, the colors are beautiful and the consistency is just right.  These are very metallic looking and you only need one coat, as the polish is a bit on the thicker side.  They look great and if your nails are in good shape, they will last a good 3-5 days with no chipping.  The cons are that they really stain your nails and cuticles, even if you use a base coat.  The first color that I tried was the magenta/metallic pink.  I left it on for about 4 days and then it started to chip.  I took it off with 100% acetone and it left a pink stain on my nails and cuticles as well as the skin around the nail.  Ugh!  I painted over it with the white metallic and it actually gave an ombre look to my nails which I actually got a lot of compliments on!  I took that off a few days later and it seemed to have lifted the pink stain?  So, I give it a 5 star review for color and one coat application.  2 stars for staining my nails and the smell, which isn&#x27;t strong but does smell worse than other polishes!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous! That said, it chips the next day, not matter how much prep you do to your nails.  Or what kind of top coat you use. Even multiple layers of Seche Vita won&#x27;t stop the chipping. Second it stains your nails horribly.</li>
            <li> Nail polish chips easily so disappointed</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing but when you take the polish off, your nails are horribly stained.  I used the green for St. Patricks day and now my nails are yellow.  YUCK!</li>
            <li> I love these. The day I got them I painted my nails the Green color and I was in love. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is when I took it off a few days later to try another color my nail&#x27;s were kinda a light green color I am not sure if it&#x27;s the nail polish or if it&#x27;s the nail polish remover that I have but I love this. They came packaged in 3&#x27;s only 1 was open but it didn&#x27;t make a big mess. Got in a timely matter. The Pink when I put on my sister&#x27;s nails was more of a dark red color.</li>
