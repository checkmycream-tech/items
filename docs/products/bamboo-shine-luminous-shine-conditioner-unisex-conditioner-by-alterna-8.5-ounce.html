            <li>This is a great product, especially when used with the complimenting Bamboo Shine conditioner.</li>
            <li>I may just start looking for another sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>And this is great for me because when I use any luminous spray it makes my hairs greasy and flat.</li>

            <li>I use Bamboo luminous shampoo with it and it has same good result.</li>

            <li>The fact that it is also gluten free is a big plus!</li>
            <li>I purchased for my daughter as she really likes this brand.  </li>
            <li>It adds shine very noticeably even at the ends.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair feeling extremely smooth and soft, more than any other product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be making my hair particularly lustrous.</li>

            <li> ( I&#x27;ve very thick hair )</li>
            <li> Before I started using this Shampoo my hair was really bad tangles, damaged, and really hard to brush.</li>

            <li> After several washes it makes my hair feel heavy.  Doesn&#x27;t sud but it&#x27;s not supposed to.  I have thick wavy hair and the conditioner makes it a tangled mess!  It does give my hair shine but unfortunately I can only use it once a week due to the heaviness.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite  conditioner. I have fine long hair and it makes my hair look amazing and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down of feel greasy, while still adding shine.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I love this product. My hair is healthier than with other shampoos.  I instantly noticed my hairs new strength and shine. It smells great. If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out a few extra bucks on hair products I recommend trying this one. I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair but I also tried a few samples of the Alterna Frizz control shampoo and conditioner and loved that one too.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this line.  It is everything she said it was.  I now have the full line and will continue to use these.  My hair is soft, manageable and every product in this line smells great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome every thing about it from the awesome fresh scent to the shine and keeps my frizzy hair under control. Another good thing is when I wake up in the morning my hair isn&#x27;t unruly that&#x27;s never happened to me before love this stuff and will continue to buy this on Amazon to me it is a small price to pay for manageable hair.</li>

            <li> I love this brand and it seems to work well but it is very smelly. It smells very earthy and does not provide a scent me or my husband enjoy smelling in my hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially when used with the complimenting Bamboo Shine conditioner. This product conditions my hair and leaves it super soft without weighing it down at all. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and how shiny it leaves my hair! The fact that it is also gluten free is a big plus!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be making my hair particularly lustrous. It is definitely a good quality product maybe just not a fit for my fine hair. Love the  smell though.</li>
            <li> Great shine, not heavy, smells good.  I like the bottle top because it twists to open and close and it makes it easy in the shower.  Recommend you use with the shampoo!  I&#x27;ve tried all the high end hair products and this was one of my favorites, added with the Bamboo Shine Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter as she really likes this brand.  She has thick hair and has to be careful of products she uses as a lot of them my her hair frizzy.  This product does not cause frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Alterna was a brand suggested to me by my stylist and I have not been disappointed. The conditioner leaves my hair feeling extremely smooth and soft, more than any other product I have tried so far. I actually tried a pricier brand (I know, hard to believe, right?) and it didn&#x27;t compare to this conditioner. My hair is less tangled, very easy to brush, and best of all has incredible shine and softness after using this product. I highly recommend it coupled with the Bamboo Shine Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It helps reduce the frizz. Even my hairdresser noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> Great product, timely delivery!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this conditioner from my stylist...but the Amazon price is much better. I love the product...makes my old hair feel soft and full.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Shine Shampoo and Conditioner for years, and I will never use anything else.  My hair is so healthy and shiny, and it is very important to me that the products I use on my skin and hair do not have Sulfates, Parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a different sage shampoo but this is the conditioner I use it with and I&#x27;m preettty sure I found the miracle combo. Very oddly enough but it made my hair air dry a LOT straighter than normal so I didn&#x27;t even have to straighten it. It also gave my hair volume and a great natural shine. The bottle dispenser is awesome and convenient. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shampoo, and Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this for five months now. Before I started using this Shampoo my hair was really bad tangles, damaged, and really hard to brush. ( I&#x27;ve very thick hair ) This has solved all of my problems, and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. This Shampoo is worth the money. If your feud up with your hair Alterna is the Brand for you. I use a lot of their other products as well, that work great together. This is my new favorite brand, I will never go back to any other brand, no matter how broke I am I will come up with the money to get this Shampoo, and Conditioner, and other products by Alterna.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Caviar is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using the conditioner and I really like it so far. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it does seem to make my hair feel softer and shinier. I use this in conjunction with the shampoo and I think together they both work well together. I would highly recommend this product for people who have straight, normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> What can I say but I ordered the wrong Alterna product for my fine, dry hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Alterna line of hair products and am a verified skin/hair product &amp;#34;flirt&amp;#34;. I simply should have stayed with their anti frizz which does a terrific job with this Brillo pad on my head.  Sometimes experiments simply don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This left my hair drier than the Arizona desert, absolutely no shine even when combined with its conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up giving it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> I am sure that any other conditioner could not work better than this one. However, I do not say that this is the best I have ever used. I think that it is one of the best. Alterna-caviar, phyto are also good (I have never tried these brands for shine, but just for volume, or anti-age, or damage treatment). Bamboo shine is OK for my fine and oily hairs. It adds shine very noticeably even at the ends. And this is great for me because when I use any luminous spray it makes my hairs greasy and flat. Smell is nice. Really makes my hairs feeling strong and smooth. There is only one thing is if you have dry hairs do not buy it. It is good for normal or oily hairs only. Highly recommend to use some oil for ends (Alterna caviar, couture colour, phyto, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I use Bamboo luminous shampoo with it and it has same good result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought both products twice.  Once in a store and once here.  Love the product - HATE the bottle!!!!  It&#x27;s a nightmare.  Whoever designed the bottle - OBVIOUSLY - doesn&#x27;t use the product or they would have changed the packaging by now.  Next time I&#x27;ll just move the product into a different dispenser.  I may just start looking for another sulfate free shampoo so I can avoid the hassle of having to switch bottles.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works incredibly!! Shine was so intense I didn&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair sometimes, I love the shampoo too!</li>
