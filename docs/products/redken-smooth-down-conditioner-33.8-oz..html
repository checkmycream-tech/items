            <li>This conditioner is perfect for your hair whether your hair is \\&quot;dry and unruly\\&quot; or not.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this online, because my hairdresser now carries the new version which isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>i love the product on my dry puffy hair, it makes my hair beautiful smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I have been using Redken Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li>and I never realized it was because of Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li>Smells great, my natural waves look amazing again and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I flat iron my hair about 3 times a weeks, so I need a great repairing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super bummed that Redken changed the formula.</li>
            <li>so luckily I found it on line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used product for 2 years and after two years of use I&#x27;ve finally been able to get my hair past the breaking point, and now I have healthy Long-long hair my husband Loves!!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stand the new version smooth lock</li>
            <li>The new variation of this is Smooth Lock.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to buy a new pump!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m trying to buy as much of this one as I can find!</li>
            <li>so glad someone still sells smooth down</li>
            <li>I love this Smooth Down line.</li>
            <li>So frustrating to see they changed the formula and am glad I can still find this kind.</li>
            <li>I was literally ready to cut four inches off yesterday but glad my stylist cancelled because Smooth Down came in the mail just in time!!</li>
            <li>and it is thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Still an overall good conditioner for normal to dry hair and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner ever, too bad</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Smooth Down&amp;#34; leaves a much nicer finish to my fine/dry, slightly naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I have to get the large bottle because they do not sell the smaller ones anymore!!</li>
            <li>I really like the fact the pump can be made any size, that way when they start selling smaller bottles</li>
            <li>Loved this product its unfortunate that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I got Smooth Down after reading the reviews here and my hair is instantly baby soft again!</li>
            <li>This also helps the dry hair very well.</li>
            <li>Redken discontinued this, they took away a good thing and replaced it with a bad one...way to go Redken.</li>

            <li> Redken discontinued this, they took away a good thing and replaced it with a bad one...way to go Redken.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be watered down and lumpy....also not as full as the ones I have purchased in the past elsewhere.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner in the 33.8oz bottle, I think it is slightly different than what I was used to in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as thick or smell quite the same.  </li>
            <li> I use this alternating with Redken Extreme conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, as I have long hair that I want to keep conditioned well to maintain its health.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again because it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry and dull for so long</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is past my waist</li>
            <li> This product conditions well without weighing your hair down and/or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years but couldn&#x27;t purchase it in the drugstore anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50 with semi dry thin hair,and this helps control those pesky stiff gray hairs while conditioning both my hair and my extensions.</li>
            <li> This is a product I used in the past but bought it in small bottles.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> disappointed that Redken discontinued this line</li>

            <li> I love ordering this size bottle from Amazon.  It saves you a bundle when you don&#x27;t have to buy it from the salon.  It keeps my hair looking really healthy and I have very thick hair so there is a lot to be said for that.</li>
            <li> disappointed that Redken discontinued this line</li>
            <li> Just OK conditioner.  Will not buy again because it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> The new variation of this is Smooth Lock.  It&#x27;s not the same, although my local salon insisted that it was.  Just looking at a drop in your hands you can see a big difference.  &amp;#34;Smooth Down&amp;#34; leaves a much nicer finish to my fine/dry, slightly naturally curly hair.  I&#x27;m super bummed that Redken changed the formula.</li>
            <li> So frustrating to see they changed the formula and am glad I can still find this kind.</li>
            <li> This product is for my wife. She loves it bacuse she has painted blond hair and this product really leaves her hair very beautiful. She recommends it.</li>

            <li> excellent conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 15 years &amp; I have to get the large bottle because they do not sell the smaller ones anymore!! I really like the fact the pump can be made any size, that way when they start selling smaller bottles I won&#x27;t have to buy a new pump!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Smooth Lock. My hair has been so dry and dull for so long and I never realized it was because of Smooth Lock. I was literally ready to cut four inches off yesterday but glad my stylist cancelled because Smooth Down came in the mail just in time!! I got Smooth Down after reading the reviews here and my hair is instantly baby soft again! I&#x27;m one shampoo and conditioning in, that&#x27;s how instant we&#x27;re talking! I love this Smooth Down line. Smells great, my natural waves look amazing again and my hair is soft. I&#x27;m very very happy with this line!!</li>
            <li> I love this product...it tames my frizzy hair But Redkin has changed the formula and ruined it, so I&#x27;m trying to buy as much of this one as I can find!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used it for a few years but couldn&#x27;t purchase it in the drugstore anymore so luckily I found it on line.</li>
