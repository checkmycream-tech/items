            <li>It was decent at a very nice pricing point.</li>
            <li>It can be strong if you do not know how to put it on, but I consider it my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought cologne online, and let me tell you, the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school, love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>There is a light citrus scent with this cologne</li>
            <li>For a long time, I love Azzaro, it &#x27;s really good for men and looking for ịit .</li>
            <li>(it was good and when I compare them they have different fragrance )</li>

            <li>If a cologne ever feels like you aren&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s 100% real or not, and it very well could have been, but something doesn&#x27;t feel right though, no supporting evidence though.</li>
            <li>Very pissed off.</li>
            <li>it doesnt smell like the original Loris Azzaro, its water down and the scent and smell is as strong and it doenst last long on you.</li>

            <li>It is a classic scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering yet still stays through the day, but cologne is a highly personal thing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Same smell, but not the same product. I&#x27;ve used Azzaro for 20+ yrs. This gets pretty close, but they probably use a cheaper mix on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old school, love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I love Azzaro, it &#x27;s really good for men and looking for ịit . Excellent hndling and shipping on time. I rate 5*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this Azzaro product (2 items 3.4 oz and I&#x27;m planing to reship the other-Because I&#x27;ve opened the one)  and  I am disappointed. Actually before I&#x27;ve bought the same product but from the different seller (it was good and when I compare them they have different fragrance )and I really wonder this Azzaro is REAL !</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for many years.  I have been buying it from a local store but they kept raising the price.  Someone told me to try buying it online and what I did I found a great way to shop and a good source to buy from.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s timeless favorite scent. It was the first cologne I bought him when we met 36 years ago and he still enjoys wearing it.</li>
            <li> this azzaro smells great on my husband, it is his favorite he wears it every day and I reorder it when he is down to the last bottle.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought cologne online, and let me tell you, the smell is amazing.  It can be strong if you do not know how to put it on, but I consider it my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Of course this product met my expectations as I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and it&#x27;s consistently excellent. It deserves a 4-1/2 star rating on Amazon and is a &amp;#34;buy now&amp;#34; at this price.</li>
            <li> If a cologne ever feels like you aren&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s 100% real or not, and it very well could have been, but something doesn&#x27;t feel right though, no supporting evidence though. It was decent at a very nice pricing point.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell like the original Loris Azzaro, its water down and the scent and smell is as strong and it doenst last long on you.</li>
            <li> I received a summer edition that stinks. I did not received the item as advertised. Very pissed off.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD SELLLER!!</li>
            <li> price has gone up allot since my last purchase of AZZARO. Just like everything has. What else do,you want to know?</li>
            <li> This cologne is so fresh and light, my husband loves it and so do I!  Fast shipping, came in original packaging, works perfect. There is a light citrus scent with this cologne so if you like a fresh citrus this is he cologne for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for almost 20 years, and through Amazon have found steady, less expensive sourcing. It is a classic scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering yet still stays through the day, but cologne is a highly personal thing. Once you find what fits for you, stick with it.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T FIGHT OFF THE WOMEN FAST ENOUGH</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> One of the classics no longer on the shelf. But this is one of my favorites and pleased to find it online for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I love it have used this in the past loved the price will order it again in the future..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian Legue</li>
