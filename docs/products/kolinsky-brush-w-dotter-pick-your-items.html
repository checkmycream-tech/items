            <li>Omg, I love If!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and it very nice for using when appling glitter to nails and just flip it around for design work.</li>
            <li>but I am enjoying to use this brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure this brush can withstand against acetone.  </li>
            <li>And would recommend this product for perfect French tips!</li>
            <li>The smaller brush is perfect and will now be my go-to clean up brush!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>it worked great to clean up my cuticles, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I used with isopropyl alcohol and got a perfect French on my first try !</li>
            <li>This brush is the perfect size for French \\&quot;smile line\\&quot; clean-up with the gel polish.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best purchase I have made as a soon-to-be nail technician.</li>
            <li>This brush does a great job on my gel French manicures!&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>I have seen some in beauty stores, but the size and quality of this one is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>This brush is what I use for clean up after nail art and painting my nails.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this. :)</li>
            <li>The brush itself is fairly small, so I recommend it for a person with great fine motor skills.</li>
            <li>Order arrived quickly and has allowed me to create amazing French manicures!</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy</li>
            <li>just the right size and makes the smile curve perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t withy first one</li>
            <li>and it came 3 days before the first estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Exactly the brush I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I normally use the blue kolinsky brush for cleanup but this one works so much better for me.</li>
            <li>It also stands up well to pure acetone.</li>
            <li>Its stiff enough that I am able to clean up easily but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt when I use it.</li>
            <li>I follow a few nail artists on a popular social media site and have been searching a clean-up brush that meets my needs.</li>
            <li>Worked well at first, but the bristles are starting to separate.</li>
            <li>I like the size too - a little smaller than most nail beds</li>
            <li>Clean-up brushes have become all the rage for at home manicures; they are used for straightening up the sides of the manicure near the cuticles.</li>
            <li>Its hard enough to shape the acrylic on your nails and soft enough to give them a really nice finishing look.</li>
            <li>For acrylic I would recommend leaving it in the liquid for five to ten minuted to remove excess powder and keep the brush like new.</li>
            <li>It was pretty hard to work with, and when I soaked it with brush cleaner the handle got really sticky and gross.</li>
            <li>This brush works really well at half the price you would pay in stores.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I ever did with myself before I owned a french brush. Hands down the best purchase I have made as a soon-to-be nail technician. I have seen some in beauty stores, but the size and quality of this one is just fantastic. If you do not have one already, but immediately.</li>
            <li> Was difficult using with acrylic powder. I&#x27;m used to softer bristled brushes. It was pretty hard to work with, and when I soaked it with brush cleaner the handle got really sticky and gross. I used it like twice..</li>
            <li> Omg, I love If! Very good cleaning brush. Will be ordering another soon</li>
