            <li>Also it comes with a handy pick (?)</li>
            <li>I take my eyelashes off every night; hence removal is very easy to do with this glue...</li>
            <li>I wear eyelashes often and this glue is by far the best I have ever used.</li>

            <li>It held all day and was very comfortable.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>I give this product an A+++ :-)</li>
            <li>get tacky in 3 seconds love love love this glue and it will not move once you put eyelashes on</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, line both your lash line and the lashes for better hold.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy again once I run out :)</li>
            <li>I love this glue.</li>
            <li>Though this one seems to have worked for many, it just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic eyelash glue!  </li>
            <li>Although I like Ardell as well, this brand is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>i have both, and i love them :)</li>
            <li>Be sure to always clean the top so it doesnt gunk up</li>
            <li>Wow what a great concept.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply even for beginners .</li>
            <li>It rubs off the lashes easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash glues and was hoping this one would be a good alternative to my normal one</li>
            <li>duo and revlon work just fine</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have the issues with light adhesive.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and keeps the lashes in place until I take them off.</li>
            <li>I have the most success with allowing the glue to sit on the lash for 30-60 seconds before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that many many times, and it&#x27;s always been an adventure getting them off without ripping out chunks of my real lashes.  </li>
            <li>It has also has lasted a long time without drying out and the precision applicator is great.  </li>
            <li>i love some of Darkness products, and they have never failed me.</li>
            <li>The clear stuff has always been amazing</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it shipped in a reasonable time, but that is the only good  thing I can say about this product.</li>
            <li>so I quickly took it off and haven&#x27;t used it again.</li>
            <li>Dries black and bleand great wit eye liner .</li>
            <li>It is a pigmented black that blends in very nicely with eyeliner and doesn&#x27;t leave any gaps.  </li>
            <li>smaller amount used means quicker drying time before applying to the lashline, and more importantly .. ..</li>
            <li>Maybe good for other uses?</li>
            <li>and they fall right off.</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s really good at staying on its a little bit hard to take off when you want it to come off at night, other wise it&#x27;s an amazing lash glue!</li>
            <li>I would definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Real glue!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to false lashes but this glue works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure if my eyes were sensitive to this glue or if it was the new eyelashes that I purchased.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and apply, not irritating and works for hours while not being not heavy on lids.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!</li>
            <li>Takes less glue and adheres much better!</li>
            <li>: If you want a double eyelid look, it&#x27;s better to use the clear/white glue because it makes the double eyelid look more natural.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li>works great but very hard to take off.</li>
            <li>this glue has not irritated my eyes or pulled out or harmed my real lashes...</li>
            <li>Hope y&#x27;all like as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like the glue a lot</li>
            <li>Holds eye lashes very well .</li>
            <li>and it sticks really well.  </li>
            <li>I really needed something to hold my eyelashes the whole day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s work really grate much better than other $$$ brand name one.</li>
            <li>Right in the middle of doing the first model the package started to leak when I opened it.</li>
            <li>love the black glue as well.</li>
            <li>But I found this product to be messy and not as good as my regular lash glue.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love how the glue combs with a little brush attached to the cap  ...</li>
            <li>I liked it however goes on a bit thick.</li>
            <li>other than that, its fine.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the black eyeliner look!</li>
            <li>I am looking for new glue.</li>
            <li>Looks natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use clear glue again.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but I recommend the darkness clear eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>Probably old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna keep on trying it, but so far its \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am from the middle east and it doesn&#x27;t worth to send it back and exchange it :</li>
            <li>: use a stripe of black liquid liner first, flex that lash a few times to make it more flexible, and use a non-fluffy \\&quot;precision\\&quot; q-tip to press the lash close to your lash line.)</li>
            <li>The only issue is be sure not to use too much because it can look clumpy which is not a good look.</li>
            <li>The eyelash glue is NOT black.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and wanted to use this product for a major runway show.</li>
            <li>MAJOR THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my real eyelashes and since it&#x27;s black, the glue doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>ok stuff but not superior</li>
            <li>black  adhesive is worth the price</li>
            <li>lash glues due to easy of use via the brush applicator and that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting other stronger, higher quality glues.</li>
            <li>I was excited that it was colored black, and wouldn&#x27;t show a white line like regular lash glue shows.  </li>
            <li>things that help in a general sense</li>
            <li>The glue doesn&#x27;t take that long to get tacky and is great at keeping your false eyelashes in place on once you press it down.</li>
            <li>IT ALSO MEANS LESS CHANCE OF GLUING THE STRIP LASHES ONTO YOUR REAL LASHES!  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying the black color</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had tried a black glue</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li>After I applied it, it seemed like it would never dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gooey white to clear kind that comes with lashes will last a couple hours, and then i usually have to take a small tube in my purse out for the night.</li>
            <li>Holds very well with ZERO mess.</li>

            <li> I was excited that it was colored black, and wouldn&#x27;t show a white line like regular lash glue shows.  </li>
            <li> things that help in a general sense</li>
            <li> The glue doesn&#x27;t take that long to get tacky and is great at keeping your false eyelashes in place on once you press it down.</li>
            <li> IT ALSO MEANS LESS CHANCE OF GLUING THE STRIP LASHES ONTO YOUR REAL LASHES!  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying the black color</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had tried a black glue</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> After I applied it, it seemed like it would never dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gooey white to clear kind that comes with lashes will last a couple hours, and then i usually have to take a small tube in my purse out for the night.</li>
            <li> Holds very well with ZERO mess.</li>
            <li> It holds well, and my little problem with white glue taking way too long to dry clear (and occasionally never doing so) has been completely eliminated.  </li>
            <li> i totally understand the concept of it, if you dont wear black eyeliner but want to wear lashes, then get the clear white one!</li>
            <li> See, the problem is that the white glue dries clear but this black glue dries...</li>
            <li> I also find this glue to be less sticky than it&#x27;s clear counterpart; the black glue doesn&#x27;t work for some sections of my eyelash sometimes, but the clear glue always does.</li>
            <li> BUT I did receive in the mail today another black eye lash glue with a few samples of foundation, mild touch peeling gel, concentrating eye gel &amp; some detox blemish bass.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to blow on it or wait long for it to get tacky.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands, including Revlon, Ardell, and E.L.F.  </li>
            <li> therefore not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The only reason I use it is because of the dark color.</li>
            <li> I received this product and it was completely dry!</li>
            <li> and even though the color is like blue, when it dries it goes to color black.</li>
            <li> And it was easy to remove with olive oil and didn&#x27;t destroy the false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> the only con is this glue can be messy if not applied correctly...</li>
            <li> It irritates my skin and it dries really rough.</li>
            <li> I have to apply more then a thin layer to the false lashes I&#x27;m using in order for it to stay on.</li>
            <li> I have used false eyelashes for years but until i used this product it took alot of time and was difficult this product makes putting on false eyelashes super easy</li>
            <li> My lashes don&#x27;t stay on as long and it also leaves a black goopy/sticky residue when you take the lashes off.</li>
            <li> It only makes sense to have black eyelash glue for black lashes, after all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to wash off than other eyelash glues I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over other eyes</li>
            <li> Though like any other adhesive, it tickles your eyes.</li>
            <li> so you can just brush the amount needed onto the strip of eyelashes instead of globbing it on from a tube like other eyelash glues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed when I tried it out and the glue and my false lashes looked even more unnatural than they did with the regular white glue.  </li>
            <li> The bottle hardly opened, and when it finally did, it was all rubber inside.</li>
            <li> It dries dark and I never worry about it loosening .</li>
            <li> It is really black like liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> My fav eyelash glue in the world ny 1st time using black.</li>
            <li> Goes on like black liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I had black glue all over my hands .</li>
            <li> It applies black, so you cant see it</li>
            <li> The color black matches with the eyelash color as well as my black eyeliner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the black version....</li>
            <li> The black glue is a hit-or-miss for me.</li>
            <li> BLACK.  </li>
            <li> i dont understand why people are complaining that is dries black...</li>
            <li> if i mess up, i just go over it with black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It seems to thicken up and the brush is a mess.</li>
            <li> It becomes a mess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that black eyelash glue existed until a few months ago, and I&#x27;ve gotta say--</li>
            <li> like that little stick tho.</li>
            <li> If you are the type to mess up on your eyelash glue often during application, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because the black glue might mess up your make up and leave a tacky dark mark that is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money .... not sticky at all</li>
            <li> The fact that you have to apply it directly on your skin and then put the fake lashes on it can be a bit tricky.</li>
            <li> I received my eyelash glue in the mail dried up.</li>
            <li> This one arrived all dried out and hardened.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way and because of its small brush you can precision place glue without it gooping out of a tube.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a long thin brush attached to the cap like those liquid eyeliner bottles.</li>
            <li> My false eyelashes don&#x27;t stay on long with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Lashes stayed put all night long, but I prefer the clear still :(</li>
            <li> It gives a firm hold that lasts for hours without being too hard to remove and tearing out my eyelashes like the Revlon did.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s usually all day.</li>
            <li> and so I end up have the glue on my real lashes :(</li>
            <li> Plus its a very dark color so its hardly noticeable!</li>
            <li> It always smudges everywhere and it takes forever to dry and doesn&#x27;t stick for so long. :(</li>
            <li> THis is so hard to use.</li>
            <li> Not very tacky but difficult to remove like ardell stuff.</li>
            <li> Other glues build up on the lash strip and make them difficult to use.....</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Crap would stick to my eyelashes aka lint, my old eyelashes, eyeshadow etc.</li>
            <li> not great for strip lashes for me.</li>
            <li> Bad delivery, money wasted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s total crap!</li>
            <li> Weird glue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept with my fake lashes and it holds as if I just put them on.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of the glue that comes with the false lashes in the drugstore!</li>
            <li> You can use it to fix your fake eyelash while applying it!</li>
            <li> i was completely disappointed ...</li>
            <li> recommended to everyone, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this glue.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;goup&#x27; was crap.</li>
            <li> so that can be annoying.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> The product is terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Glue is AMAZING !!! It held up all day...rain or shine...I take my eyelashes off every night; hence removal is very easy to do with this glue...this glue has not irritated my eyes or pulled out or harmed my real lashes...the only con is this glue can be messy if not applied correctly...I have purchased this glue 3 times at a reasonable price !!!!!....I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product !!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it works so well and lasts all day this is my second time buying it and will continue to buy again I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never go this product ! Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This stuff is lash cement! A little goes along way and because of its small brush you can precision place glue without it gooping out of a tube. Plus it dries faster than duo so you don&#x27;t have to blow on it or wait long for it to get tacky. It is really black like liquid eyeliner so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for a beginner to eyelashes. The wand is helpful as well. Hope y&#x27;all like as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The glue doesn&#x27;t take that long to get tacky and is great at keeping your false eyelashes in place on once you press it down. I&#x27;ll never use clear glue again.</li>
            <li> This is the Best eyelash glue I&#x27;ve ever used! Be sure to always clean the top so it doesnt gunk up</li>
            <li> This is the best glue I have used.  I will be ordering again. The service was good and i received the product in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Holds very well with ZERO mess. Easy to use and apply, not irritating and works for hours while not being not heavy on lids. I would recommend this over other eyes lash glues due to easy of use via the brush applicator and that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash glues and was hoping this one would be a good alternative to my normal one but it&#x27;s not.  My lashes don&#x27;t stay on as long and it also leaves a black goopy/sticky residue when you take the lashes off.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes often and this glue is by far the best I have ever used. Just be warned you need makeup remover to remove the eyelash glue after wear.</li>
            <li> My fav eyelash glue in the world ny 1st time using black. Lashes stayed put all night long, but I prefer the clear still :(</li>
            <li> My favorite lash glue ever. It dries dark and I never worry about it loosening . I think it was an add on item</li>
            <li> black  adhesive is worth the price and you don&#x27;t have the issues with light adhesive.  this one has a nice fine brush so no globby bits of glue.</li>
            <li> This is the best lash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used. My eyelashes stay on all day.  It dries really fast.  I would definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I really like the glue a lot it&#x27;s my favorite and it&#x27;s a good price I think and got here on time</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> The eyelash glue is NOT black. It&#x27;s white. And it does not hold the lashes. And it stings. It&#x27;s total crap!</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite lash glue ever! Goes on like black liquid eyeliner. Love it!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money .... not sticky at all</li>
            <li> I have used false eyelashes for years but until i used this product it took alot of time and was difficult this product makes putting on false eyelashes super easy and it comes off great with baby oil. I give this product an A+++ :-)</li>
            <li> works great but very hard to take off. had to rub with lots of water and make up remover. other than that, its fine.</li>
            <li> Real glue! and even though the color is like blue, when it dries it goes to color black. Really nice product and a strong adhesive. Though like any other adhesive, it tickles your eyes. Well, we all have different methods to cope with that. Also it comes with a handy pick (?) You can use it to fix your fake eyelash while applying it!</li>
            <li> The product is terrible! Eyelashes don&#x27;t stick at all!</li>
            <li> I received this product and it was completely dry! I am from the middle east and it doesn&#x27;t worth to send it back and exchange it :(&lt;br /&gt;But i was completely disappointed ...</li>
            <li> The fact that you have to apply it directly on your skin and then put the fake lashes on it can be a bit tricky. I just cannot avoid my eyelashes when I apply the glue and so I end up have the glue on my real lashes :( and it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I received my eyelash glue in the mail dried up. To the point I couldn&#x27;t open it my self and had my bf do it for me. Which he as well had troubles opening it. I was so livid I ended up throwing it in the garbage... literally. And got a hold of the seller to tell him what happened and how I threw it away because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with sending it back to get my refund.&lt;br /&gt;I never got a reply back...&lt;br /&gt;  BUT I did receive in the mail today another black eye lash glue with a few samples of foundation, mild touch peeling gel, concentrating eye gel &amp; some detox blemish bass.Thank you!</li>
            <li> worked great, my eyes looked flawless! recommended to everyone, you will not be disappointed. easy to apply even for beginners .</li>
            <li> This glue is amazing it&#x27;s like &amp;#34;industrial glue&amp;#34; for your eye! Holds on all day and is so simple to use. Would give this 5 stars but since it&#x27;s really good at staying on its a little bit hard to take off when you want it to come off at night, other wise it&#x27;s an amazing lash glue!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this glue. It goes on smoothly and keeps the lashes in place until I take them off. Other glues build up on the lash strip and make them difficult to use.....but this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love how the glue combs with a little brush attached to the cap  ... .like liquid eyeliner ... so you can just brush the amount needed onto the strip of eyelashes instead of globbing it on from a tube like other eyelash glues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller amount used means quicker drying time before applying to the lashline, and more importantly .. ..IT ALSO MEANS LESS CHANCE OF GLUING THE STRIP LASHES ONTO YOUR REAL LASHES!  YAYS!!  .. .umm.. ..been there. .done that many many times, and it&#x27;s always been an adventure getting them off without ripping out chunks of my real lashes.  But now with this, it&#x27;s oh so easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oooh!  and I love the plastic stick that comes with it too!  it helps &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; the strip lashes in place if need be.  MAJOR THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this along with the transparent version. This one arrived all dried out and hardened. The bottle hardly opened, and when it finally did, it was all rubber inside. Probably old. Bad delivery, money wasted.</li>
            <li> Dries black and bleand great wit eye liner . Holds eye lashes very well .</li>
            <li> i like the blue/whitish glue the best. The last all and night!! Only one problem. You can see the glue,  After, about 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;I love the black glue as well. I wish it was a bit stronger. It rubs off the lashes easily It makes the lashes, last. for reuse. i thought the amount of glue in tube would had lasted longer then it did. It seems to thicken up and the brush is a mess. I am looking for new glue.</li>
            <li> Weird glue. Not very tacky but difficult to remove like ardell stuff. not great for strip lashes for me. Maybe good for other uses?</li>
            <li> I loved this glue. It held all day and was very comfortable. Plus I love the black eyeliner look! Just love this stuff! And it was easy to remove with olive oil and didn&#x27;t destroy the false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and wanted to use this product for a major runway show. I was pleased that it shipped in a reasonable time, but that is the only good  thing I can say about this product. Right in the middle of doing the first model the package started to leak when I opened it. I had black glue all over my hands . I continue to try to use the glue however and that was a big big mistake. The glue came out in clumps and in the end I had to throw the product out. What a waste. I had to revert to my standard 2.00 eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> bye duo you suck hello darkness! get tacky in 3 seconds love love love this glue and it will not move once you put eyelashes on</li>
            <li> The glue works good n I would recommend it to someone else ...&lt;br /&gt;N is easy to use ...love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that black eyelash glue existed until a few months ago, and I&#x27;ve gotta say--I&#x27;m not going back.  I love this stuff.  It holds well, and my little problem with white glue taking way too long to dry clear (and occasionally never doing so) has been completely eliminated.  I have the most success with allowing the glue to sit on the lash for 30-60 seconds before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Other things that help in a general sense: use a stripe of black liquid liner first, flex that lash a few times to make it more flexible, and use a non-fluffy \\&quot;precision\\&quot; q-tip to press the lash close to your lash line.)</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated. I love this product. Holds lashes in place. Looks natural!</li>
            <li> ok stuff but not superior therefore not worth the extra money. duo and revlon work just fine, line both your lash line and the lashes for better hold. like that little stick tho.</li>
            <li> It irritates my skin and it dries really rough. My false eyelashes don&#x27;t stay on long with this product at all.</li>
            <li> THis is so hard to use. It always smudges everywhere and it takes forever to dry and doesn&#x27;t stick for so long. :(</li>
            <li> This glue is the best glue ever! I&#x27;m new to false lashes but this glue works great! Once applied, the lashes stay on until I remove it and that&#x27;s usually all day. I love it and will buy again once I run out :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It applies black, so you cant see it and it sticks really well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure if my eyes were sensitive to this glue or if it was the new eyelashes that I purchased. When I put my lashes on with this glue my eyes started to burn and tingle so I quickly took it off and haven&#x27;t used it again.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this eyelash glue. It&#x27;s gentle on my real eyelashes and since it&#x27;s black, the glue doesn&#x27;t show. The only issue is be sure not to use too much because it can look clumpy which is not a good look.</li>
            <li> I love this glue. It&#x27;s the only brand I use. This is my first time trying the black color but it works just as well as the white ones. This glue lasts all day and night. I&#x27;ve slept with my fake lashes and it holds as if I just put them on. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this glue.</li>
            <li> This glue works wonderfully for a temporary adherence, but anything longer than a couple of hours and its gives in. I recommend getting other stronger, higher quality glues. Though this one seems to have worked for many, it just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited that it was colored black, and wouldn&#x27;t show a white line like regular lash glue shows.  But I found this product to be messy and not as good as my regular lash glue.  I&#x27;m gonna keep on trying it, but so far its \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;goup&#x27; was crap. After I applied it, it seemed like it would never dry. Crap would stick to my eyelashes aka lint, my old eyelashes, eyeshadow etc. Not a good product. WOULD NOT recommend getting.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am inept at getting the lashes on with the regular glue and I have hooded eye lids so I can never get the eyeliner on properly and it runs. This stuff sticks my eyelashes on and it looks like eyeliner! A perfect product for me!</li>
            <li> I really needed something to hold my eyelashes the whole day. This eyelash glue didn&#x27;t even work for an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work and lash stay all day. Since I bought it, I have a change to use it once and it&#x27;s work really grate much better than other $$$ brand name one.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s black.&lt;br /&gt;Works amazingly well. Adheres easily and firm.&lt;br /&gt;Holds perfectly all night long.&lt;br /&gt;The gooey white to clear kind that comes with lashes will last a couple hours, and then i usually have to take a small tube in my purse out for the night. This lasts ALL NIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash off - just use a good make up remover and they fall right off.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of the glue that comes with the false lashes in the drugstore! Takes less glue and adheres much better! Plus its a very dark color so its hardly noticeable!</li>
            <li> Great to have. There&#x27;s a long thin brush attached to the cap like those liquid eyeliner bottles. I have to apply more then a thin layer to the false lashes I&#x27;m using in order for it to stay on. The color black matches with the eyelash color as well as my black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the clear/white eyelash &amp; double eyelid glue: If you want a double eyelid look, it&#x27;s better to use the clear/white glue because it makes the double eyelid look more natural.</li>
            <li> this is my second time ordering this product. Its the best glue i have used so far and i am not planning of using another one:D&lt;br /&gt;i give this 5 starts :p</li>
            <li> Darkness eyelash glue has always been my go-to eyelash glue ever since I discovered it. The clear stuff has always been amazing so I decided to try the black version....it&#x27;s a bit different. If you are the type to mess up on your eyelash glue often during application, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because the black glue might mess up your make up and leave a tacky dark mark that is hard to remove. I also find this glue to be less sticky than it&#x27;s clear counterpart; the black glue doesn&#x27;t work for some sections of my eyelash sometimes, but the clear glue always does. The black glue is a hit-or-miss for me. I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but I recommend the darkness clear eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic eyelash glue!  I have tried several other brands, including Revlon, Ardell, and E.L.F.  Although I like Ardell as well, this brand is definitely my favorite.  It gives a firm hold that lasts for hours without being too hard to remove and tearing out my eyelashes like the Revlon did.  This was the first time I had tried a black glue and I was very happy with the results.  It is a pigmented black that blends in very nicely with eyeliner and doesn&#x27;t leave any gaps.  It has also has lasted a long time without drying out and the precision applicator is great.  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> It definitely works. But it remains sticky even after it dries.. so that can be annoying.  It&#x27;s harder to wash off than other eyelash glues I&#x27;ve used. The only reason I use it is because of the dark color. It only makes sense to have black eyelash glue for black lashes, after all.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought, Wow what a great concept.  However, I was disappointed when I tried it out and the glue and my false lashes looked even more unnatural than they did with the regular white glue.  See, the problem is that the white glue dries clear but this black glue dries...BLACK.  Let&#x27;s say you mistakingly got some outside your lash line.  It becomes a mess.</li>
            <li> i love some of Darkness products, and they have never failed me. i dont understand why people are complaining that is dries black... i totally understand the concept of it, if you dont wear black eyeliner but want to wear lashes, then get the clear white one! i have both, and i love them :)</li>
            <li> I liked it however goes on a bit thick.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all. Didn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> it does a really good job sticking and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s black. if i mess up, i just go over it with black eyeliner.</li>
