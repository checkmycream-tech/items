            <li>I love not having my polish wear off at the ends and</li>
            <li>So I placed an order for 4 more color changing polishes from this line :</li>
            <li>Love them all(did swatch nails to ck them all</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased with the results</li>
            <li>I have many brands of gel polish and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I love the light color when my nails are warm, which is most of the time.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple ones and have loved everyone!!</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and my clients are in love with it</li>
            <li>the price will have to do :-)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>There were so many colors</li>
            <li>Light pinkish shade with sparkles when warm.</li>
            <li>Love this Polish.</li>
            <li>I look forward to buying more colors.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish is thicker than most gel nail polishes I have seen.  </li>
            <li>Very durable and nice looking!</li>
            <li>I love how easy the polish goes on.</li>
            <li>Definitely My New Favorite Polish !! 💅🏻</li>
            <li>Very cool~</li>
            <li>Wish I had seen that if I had bought one more I could have received a 6th for free.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li>Application is easy, it required two coats to be opaque.</li>
            <li>There is no peeling or chipping and my manicure is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The fine glitter</li>
            <li>Polish went on smoothly and only needed one coat for beautiful coverage and color.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li>Overall great brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun :)</li>
            <li>My manicure lasted 15 days without chipping or pulling away from the free edge.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions provided in the free downloadable Ebook and had no issues applying this color.</li>
            <li>The best part is I won&#x27;t get tired of wearing it after one day like I do regular polish because it doesn&#x27;t stay one color, it changes with the temperature and has beautiful glitter in it!  </li>
            <li>These feel smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with lifting or chipping.</li>
            <li>I use a LED light.</li>
            <li>I have used really cheap base/top coat and OPI brand with this polish.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>If you want to see a good vid on these go to You Tube..very helpful on seeing the colors first hand;-)..</li>
            <li>It only took 2 coats for me and very nice quality.</li>
            <li>I got the classic galaxy and both the blue and purple are beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and vibrant.</li>
            <li>We took hers off last night and it was real easy using the advice from the free e-book and painted them again!  </li>
            <li>but with more coverage, I can just barely see my nail line through it when it&#x27;s warm.  </li>
            <li>The formula on both are great; only two coats needed for full opacity.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and your done so quickly.</li>
            <li>This polish is a high quality gel polish and I recommend everyone to buy this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much :)</li>
            <li>Ordered the UVA light and&lt;br /&gt;the special remover.</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Thought she would like it because it is so fun, except that I use it too!</li>
            <li>All the swatches are beautiful, but I am partial to pinks.  </li>
            <li>You should definitely try this out, their customer service is amazing and responded quickly everytime I emailed them!!</li>
            <li>I tried pink frost, and the color change is so beautiful, with just the right amount of glitter!</li>
            <li>Wow, was I impressed when it finally worked!!!</li>
            <li>The polish is gorgeous, can&#x27;t wait to order more colors (I ordered Pink Frost).</li>
            <li>so far, I am totally in love!</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to test and review DIY Hard Nails and am quite impressed with the formula.  </li>
            <li>They wear beautifully for a full two weeks (the length of my test) and removal is average for soak off gel polish.  </li>
            <li>depending on the temperture of my hands, it went from bright fushia to white and everything in between...</li>
            <li>this is sooo cool</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I ordered the color changing gel polish in every color.</li>
            <li>When warm its a frosted clear/white with a range of fine to medium glitter and larger hexagonal glitter to match.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this new gel polish!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to adding more colors to my collection and seeing what new ones are released!</li>
            <li>I just took a hot bath and the polish changed in to a beautiful pink.</li>
            <li>I love both and got great compliments but the pink frost is by far my fav.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>I have used gel polishes for over a year exclusively and love trying out new brands and colors.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely LoVe My New Color Changing gel Nail Polish</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty!</li>
            <li>this nail polish is the absolute BOMB!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to be ordering more of this polish!</li>
            <li>It took me 1 week over my estimated shipping date but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>It is fun to see the colors changing.</li>
            <li>I ordered heartbreaker and pink frost and they had such a great application and coverage!</li>
            <li>This polish is so much fun.</li>
            <li>Fun, color-switching polish</li>
            <li>I loved it so much i bought a 2nd color!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s  definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>really works, almost clear with Sparkle when warm-</li>
            <li>It changes color instantly and even changes with your warm breath.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer on healthy nails.</li>
            <li>so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have short nails but really liked the color changing effects of the root beer float.</li>
            <li>I love how it changes color from white to beautiful hot pink.</li>
            <li>Color change is fun for a change of pace.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to see the color change right before your eyes....</li>
            <li>I had problems with a defective color that wouldn&#x27;t change colors but after contacting customer service they shipped me out another one right away.</li>
            <li>It arrived right when it said it would</li>
            <li>The polish arrived right after I did a manicure</li>
            <li>super excited to receive all my new shellac polish.  </li>
            <li>Plus I ordered the base and top coat and a beautiful blue glitter top coat called Galaxy Twlight, which I just love!..</li>
            <li>A week and half later still looks great!</li>
            <li>I bought several colors and have used 2 of them and my adult daughter has used several that she purchased &amp; they all perform as described and are incredible!  </li>
            <li>My customers young and old love it!  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I used 2 coats for a complete color saturated look, but I could of easily done one coat if I wanted a lighter look.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful polishes, I bought base, top and two colors and love it all.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This polish does exactly what it claims...</li>
            <li>it turns exactly the color that is shown.  </li>
            <li>I have discovered that the longer your nail is, the more likely it will stay the darker color at the tips.  </li>
            <li>This is my second experience with a gel color changing polish, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I actually used mine over fake nails and wasnt how sure it would work on that, but it turned out to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>so I was nerves at first</li>
            <li>At first I thought another polish that doesn&#x27;t chip and does.  </li>
            <li>The color is exactly what read described.</li>
            <li>I thought this was pretty funky.  </li>
            <li>This is the first brand of color changing polish I have tried</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more</li>
            <li>2 coats does the job very well!</li>
            <li>I really do not understand why this nail polish is getting such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Overall first impression, the polish is great and will be picking up other colors to try.  </li>
            <li>, it had become a new go to for several of them! :-)</li>
            <li>I first ordered Classic Galaxy..</li>
            <li>I found this on Chickettes site, she has some great swatch pictures of the Pink Frost and the Pink Galaxy colors.</li>
            <li>the DIY color change Pink Galaxy on my toes with the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46yr old and had fun with this color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cna and the stay on even after washing my hand as much as I do.</li>
            <li>No worries now thanks to gel polishes.  </li>
            <li>both my orders came to me LIGHTING FAST</li>
            <li>The how to guide has some really helpful tips for beginners.</li>
            <li>It really changes color.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I just got my polish today (early) and I put it on right away.  </li>
            <li>i use my hands a lot, but this has been on a week and only had one tiny chip that was very easy to repair.</li>
            <li>at first the polish looked so old like it was not going to work- very lumpy.</li>
            <li>The original appeal was clear to soft sheer pink and after washing my hands and stepping out into a cooler temperature the color changed to a beautiful shade of pink.</li>
            <li>Purple french tips when the tips of my nails are cool.</li>
            <li>Very thick and goopy, does not look as great or go on as smooth as my other gel polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking at definitely getting Coca Cola Float next! :)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more colors in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li>My kids love when I dip my hands in cold water and warm water to watch them change.</li>
            <li>So hard to find nice colour changing shellac</li>
            <li>Just recieved this in the mail but haven&#x27;t received my free book &amp; the color is a lighter pinkish purple rather than the pink it shows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), but so far there isn&#x27;t much out there like it, so</li>
            <li>So far these nail polish has been pretty sensitive to temperature change, I am looking forward to buy the rest of the colors from this brand.</li>
            <li>the polish and can&#x27;t wait to get a few more colors.</li>
            <li>so I didnt feel right marking the product with 4 stars because of my personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Bright purplish blue when hand cold or submersed in cool water!</li>
            <li>I ordered the pink Galaxy and I&#x27;ve gotten non stop comments on my magical nails that actually change color.</li>
            <li>The polish is extremely reactive in hot and cold temperatures and the colors are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Color change is cool but it is super thick.</li>
            <li>That has NEVER happened to me with any other brand of gel polish that I have applied myself and, believe me, I have tried many different brands!  </li>
            <li>Pink Frost remains mostly the sheer white on me and since my nails are short, there is not a lot of length that would remain cool to show the ombre effect.  </li>
            <li>This is such a pretty gel polish.</li>
            <li>I really like this one my hands get cold easily and nails still look good both warm and cold</li>
            <li>At times your nails will have a gradient effect from dark on the tips to light at the nail beds getting lighter as it gets near your cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It went on smooth with no clumps or mess.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and thick which allows you to use it to shape your nails!</li>
            <li>To be honest tho, I thought the pink color would be a little brighter based off the picture</li>
            <li>and I love the glitter that gives it just that little extra.</li>
            <li>I just got this, and I love it, makes my nails really hard,</li>
            <li>so the only time I really saw</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had this color on for a week and have had no chipping or peeling</li>
            <li>but after I saw the final product, I don&#x27;t care haha.</li>
            <li>and it still looks fresh minus my nail growth.</li>
            <li>When I had the initial problem thy contacted my back right away to try and fix it.</li>
            <li>I am wearing the Cola one now, and when I am at a comfortable temperature, the bed of my nail stays the pale color with the tips of my nails the darker color.  </li>
            <li>I agree, the only con is waiting 2 weeks before trying new colors!</li>
            <li>It applied easily and was very compatible with my Gelish base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>I thought the light shade &amp;#34;needed something&amp;#34;, so added a hand-drawn tree on each finger, as the tips usually had color on them that looked like it could be a pile of fallen leaves.  </li>
            <li>When I  received the new polish from DIY, they sent a guide with tips and instructions on the proper way to  use your gel.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 3 bottles to get the free shipping (Ice Queen, Pink Galaxy &amp; Pink Frost).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty long lasting wear....</li>
            <li>When cold, the polish turns a bright fuchsia.  </li>
            <li>we have ordered 5 different colors so far.</li>
            <li>I was really wanting the pink galaxy and will be watching for it to come back in stock.</li>
            <li>This brand applied easily and was compatible with my Red Carpet Manicure base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>I used with my cnd base and top coat with my cnd light.</li>
            <li>have had this particular polish on for 2 weeks, and have noticed that with my other gel polishes, they will start to lift at the edges of my nail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted to the gel, my nails break so easily</li>
            <li>It was fun watching the tips turn back to the dark purple bleeding into the pink.</li>
            <li>since I wanted to see what the other colors looked like, I put the other colors on 2 of my fingers on my right</li>
            <li>I got the nail polish earlier than expected, which is always a major plus!!!</li>

            <li> I love how easy the polish goes on.</li>
            <li> Definitely My New Favorite Polish !! 💅🏻</li>
            <li> Very cool~</li>
            <li> Wish I had seen that if I had bought one more I could have received a 6th for free.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li> Application is easy, it required two coats to be opaque.</li>
            <li> There is no peeling or chipping and my manicure is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The fine glitter</li>
            <li> Polish went on smoothly and only needed one coat for beautiful coverage and color.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li> Overall great brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much fun :)</li>

            <li> I followed the instructions provided in the free downloadable Ebook and had no issues applying this color.</li>
            <li> The best part is I won&#x27;t get tired of wearing it after one day like I do regular polish because it doesn&#x27;t stay one color, it changes with the temperature and has beautiful glitter in it!  </li>
            <li> These feel smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with lifting or chipping.</li>
            <li> I use a LED light.</li>
            <li> I have used really cheap base/top coat and OPI brand with this polish.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> If you want to see a good vid on these go to You Tube..very helpful on seeing the colors first hand;-)..</li>
            <li> It only took 2 coats for me and very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I got the classic galaxy and both the blue and purple are beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and vibrant.</li>
            <li> We took hers off last night and it was real easy using the advice from the free e-book and painted them again!  </li>
            <li> but with more coverage, I can just barely see my nail line through it when it&#x27;s warm.  </li>
            <li> The formula on both are great; only two coats needed for full opacity.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and your done so quickly.</li>
            <li> This polish is a high quality gel polish and I recommend everyone to buy this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much :)</li>
            <li> Ordered the UVA light and&lt;br /&gt;the special remover.</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Thought she would like it because it is so fun, except that I use it too!</li>
            <li> All the swatches are beautiful, but I am partial to pinks.  </li>
            <li> You should definitely try this out, their customer service is amazing and responded quickly everytime I emailed them!!</li>
            <li> I tried pink frost, and the color change is so beautiful, with just the right amount of glitter!</li>
            <li> Wow, was I impressed when it finally worked!!!</li>
            <li> The polish is gorgeous, can&#x27;t wait to order more colors (I ordered Pink Frost).</li>
            <li> so far, I am totally in love!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test and review DIY Hard Nails and am quite impressed with the formula.  </li>
            <li> They wear beautifully for a full two weeks (the length of my test) and removal is average for soak off gel polish.  </li>
            <li> depending on the temperture of my hands, it went from bright fushia to white and everything in between...</li>
            <li> this is sooo cool</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I ordered the color changing gel polish in every color.</li>
            <li> When warm its a frosted clear/white with a range of fine to medium glitter and larger hexagonal glitter to match.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this new gel polish!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to adding more colors to my collection and seeing what new ones are released!</li>
            <li> I just took a hot bath and the polish changed in to a beautiful pink.</li>
            <li> I love both and got great compliments but the pink frost is by far my fav.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li> I have used gel polishes for over a year exclusively and love trying out new brands and colors.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely LoVe My New Color Changing gel Nail Polish</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still pretty!</li>
            <li> this nail polish is the absolute BOMB!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to be ordering more of this polish!</li>
            <li> It took me 1 week over my estimated shipping date but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> It is fun to see the colors changing.</li>
            <li> I ordered heartbreaker and pink frost and they had such a great application and coverage!</li>
            <li> This polish is so much fun.</li>
            <li> Fun, color-switching polish</li>
            <li> I loved it so much i bought a 2nd color!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s  definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> really works, almost clear with Sparkle when warm-</li>
            <li> It changes color instantly and even changes with your warm breath.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer on healthy nails.</li>
            <li> so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have short nails but really liked the color changing effects of the root beer float.</li>
            <li> I love how it changes color from white to beautiful hot pink.</li>
            <li> Color change is fun for a change of pace.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to see the color change right before your eyes....</li>
            <li> I had problems with a defective color that wouldn&#x27;t change colors but after contacting customer service they shipped me out another one right away.</li>
            <li> It arrived right when it said it would</li>
            <li> The polish arrived right after I did a manicure</li>
            <li> super excited to receive all my new shellac polish.  </li>
            <li> Plus I ordered the base and top coat and a beautiful blue glitter top coat called Galaxy Twlight, which I just love!..</li>
            <li> A week and half later still looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought several colors and have used 2 of them and my adult daughter has used several that she purchased &amp; they all perform as described and are incredible!  </li>
            <li> My customers young and old love it!  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I used 2 coats for a complete color saturated look, but I could of easily done one coat if I wanted a lighter look.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful polishes, I bought base, top and two colors and love it all.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This polish does exactly what it claims...</li>
            <li> it turns exactly the color that is shown.  </li>
            <li> I have discovered that the longer your nail is, the more likely it will stay the darker color at the tips.  </li>
            <li> This is my second experience with a gel color changing polish, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I actually used mine over fake nails and wasnt how sure it would work on that, but it turned out to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> so I was nerves at first</li>
            <li> At first I thought another polish that doesn&#x27;t chip and does.  </li>
            <li> The color is exactly what read described.</li>
            <li> I thought this was pretty funky.  </li>
            <li> This is the first brand of color changing polish I have tried</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> 2 coats does the job very well!</li>
            <li> I really do not understand why this nail polish is getting such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Overall first impression, the polish is great and will be picking up other colors to try.  </li>
            <li> , it had become a new go to for several of them! :-)</li>
            <li> I first ordered Classic Galaxy..</li>
            <li> I found this on Chickettes site, she has some great swatch pictures of the Pink Frost and the Pink Galaxy colors.</li>
            <li> the DIY color change Pink Galaxy on my toes with the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46yr old and had fun with this color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cna and the stay on even after washing my hand as much as I do.</li>
            <li> No worries now thanks to gel polishes.  </li>
            <li> both my orders came to me LIGHTING FAST</li>
            <li> The how to guide has some really helpful tips for beginners.</li>
            <li> It really changes color.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I just got my polish today (early) and I put it on right away.  </li>
            <li> i use my hands a lot, but this has been on a week and only had one tiny chip that was very easy to repair.</li>
            <li> at first the polish looked so old like it was not going to work- very lumpy.</li>
            <li> The original appeal was clear to soft sheer pink and after washing my hands and stepping out into a cooler temperature the color changed to a beautiful shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Purple french tips when the tips of my nails are cool.</li>
            <li> Very thick and goopy, does not look as great or go on as smooth as my other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking at definitely getting Coca Cola Float next! :)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more colors in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li> My kids love when I dip my hands in cold water and warm water to watch them change.</li>
            <li> So hard to find nice colour changing shellac</li>
            <li> Just recieved this in the mail but haven&#x27;t received my free book &amp; the color is a lighter pinkish purple rather than the pink it shows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), but so far there isn&#x27;t much out there like it, so</li>
            <li> So far these nail polish has been pretty sensitive to temperature change, I am looking forward to buy the rest of the colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> the polish and can&#x27;t wait to get a few more colors.</li>
            <li> so I didnt feel right marking the product with 4 stars because of my personal preference.  </li>
            <li> Bright purplish blue when hand cold or submersed in cool water!</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink Galaxy and I&#x27;ve gotten non stop comments on my magical nails that actually change color.</li>
            <li> The polish is extremely reactive in hot and cold temperatures and the colors are awesome.  </li>
            <li> Color change is cool but it is super thick.</li>
            <li> That has NEVER happened to me with any other brand of gel polish that I have applied myself and, believe me, I have tried many different brands!  </li>
            <li> Pink Frost remains mostly the sheer white on me and since my nails are short, there is not a lot of length that would remain cool to show the ombre effect.  </li>
            <li> This is such a pretty gel polish.</li>
            <li> I really like this one my hands get cold easily and nails still look good both warm and cold</li>
            <li> At times your nails will have a gradient effect from dark on the tips to light at the nail beds getting lighter as it gets near your cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It went on smooth with no clumps or mess.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and thick which allows you to use it to shape your nails!</li>
            <li> To be honest tho, I thought the pink color would be a little brighter based off the picture</li>
            <li> and I love the glitter that gives it just that little extra.</li>
            <li> I just got this, and I love it, makes my nails really hard,</li>
            <li> so the only time I really saw</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this color on for a week and have had no chipping or peeling</li>
            <li> but after I saw the final product, I don&#x27;t care haha.</li>
            <li> and it still looks fresh minus my nail growth.</li>
            <li> When I had the initial problem thy contacted my back right away to try and fix it.</li>
            <li> I am wearing the Cola one now, and when I am at a comfortable temperature, the bed of my nail stays the pale color with the tips of my nails the darker color.  </li>
            <li> I agree, the only con is waiting 2 weeks before trying new colors!</li>
            <li> It applied easily and was very compatible with my Gelish base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I thought the light shade &amp;#34;needed something&amp;#34;, so added a hand-drawn tree on each finger, as the tips usually had color on them that looked like it could be a pile of fallen leaves.  </li>
            <li> When I  received the new polish from DIY, they sent a guide with tips and instructions on the proper way to  use your gel.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 3 bottles to get the free shipping (Ice Queen, Pink Galaxy &amp; Pink Frost).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty long lasting wear....</li>
            <li> When cold, the polish turns a bright fuchsia.  </li>
            <li> we have ordered 5 different colors so far.</li>
            <li> I was really wanting the pink galaxy and will be watching for it to come back in stock.</li>
            <li> This brand applied easily and was compatible with my Red Carpet Manicure base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I used with my cnd base and top coat with my cnd light.</li>
            <li> have had this particular polish on for 2 weeks, and have noticed that with my other gel polishes, they will start to lift at the edges of my nail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the gel, my nails break so easily</li>
            <li> It was fun watching the tips turn back to the dark purple bleeding into the pink.</li>
            <li> since I wanted to see what the other colors looked like, I put the other colors on 2 of my fingers on my right</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish earlier than expected, which is always a major plus!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase from DIY Hard Nails.</li>
            <li> The actual nail polish is a little thick and doesn&#x27;t spread as smoothly as I would like</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> I will update on how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Works just like advertised and is extremely long lasting!</li>
            <li> You will only see an ombre effect if you have long nails.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely easy to apply....toook only a very thin coat...</li>
            <li> And cures very well with my OPI base and top coats.</li>
            <li> It goes on pink, and turns white.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased pink Crystal</li>
            <li> I received it two days earlier then expected eta</li>
            <li> Changes like indicated and long wear.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish stayed on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The color change happens all day long!</li>
            <li> but it literally kept me amused all day long!!  </li>
            <li> The nail polish lasts for a while as long as you use your base and top coat properly.  </li>
            <li> but it is a deep purple black with specks of pink glitter.</li>
            <li> I got Pink Frost as a gift along with Ice Queen...</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink Frost</li>
            <li> I bought this color and the pink Galaxy.</li>
            <li> So i bought the pink galaxy as part of a Christmas gift to myself.</li>
            <li> I bought a Few different colors !!</li>
            <li> I purchased Pink Galaxy.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink Crystal, Pink Frost and Pink Galaxy...just received them and applied Pink Crystal...</li>
            <li> Coca Cola Float, Pink frost, Pink Galaxy and Purple Tonic...</li>
            <li> The only con is restraining yourself from changing the colors everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the pink frost for a week now and it&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the color I decided to get is Pink Frost.</li>
            <li> Used base coat and $100 uv machine and top coat next day chiped (3 nails)</li>
            <li> I broke one of my nails, and noticed that the tip , which after the break barely extended past my finger, did not stay as dark at the ends as my other longer nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased the top coat, base coat and the pink frost and pink crystals.  </li>
            <li> On me it lasts longer than any other gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I will be purchasing other colors to try out</li>
            <li> Finally I could wait no more and changed my polish.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it took quite a while for me to snag this color because it was never in stock.</li>
            <li> used my Gelish top and base.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of the DIY&#x27;s two was a base coat and the top.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get one of the other colors!</li>
            <li> it works with hot and cold Temps</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep in my opinion ($14.99 + $3.99 shipping + tax)</li>
            <li> I tend to not get a lot of gradient in the nails because they often are one color or the other depending on my hand warmth, but the colors do switch a lot during the day even with small temperature changes.</li>
            <li> My nails are the same length as picture, but unless I stick my hand in some cold water, the entire nail stays clear/white with sparkles.  </li>
            <li> it was blotchy uneven</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was too thick to use when I received it</li>
            <li> Then when my nails touch cold water, the entire nail turns dark pink with sparkles.  </li>
            <li> The color change mainly happens when my hands are exposed to cold water.  </li>
            <li> The color changing is very sensitive so with my cold hands</li>
            <li> Just a little thick going on</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t French tip like picture- dark pink when cold!</li>
            <li> it was hard to decide.  </li>
            <li> the color change was when I was doing dishes or it was really cold outside...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been sticking my nails next to cold things just to watch it change.</li>
            <li> Almost to thick to even use</li>
            <li> The nail polish I received is kinda thick but manageable.</li>
            <li> The polish is thick</li>
            <li> i scrubbed down a kitchen for my grandmother and it did not even chip!!!</li>
            <li> I like how it changes to pink when I&#x27;m cold</li>
            <li> When my hands, or the air temp is cold, the polish turns dark.  </li>
            <li> I have issues though with chipping and peeling due to my brittle nails, which is something I stuggle with with all Gel polishes :(</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong?  </li>
            <li> read a review of someone who was very disappointed that they did not have dark nail tips.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s cold out.</li>
            <li> Cold water also changes the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it even changes with my body temperature when I&#x27;m feeling very cold at night.</li>
            <li> so I used the base coat and</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Loving this polish!  I&#x27;m addicted to the gel, my nails break so easily but with the gel polish,  they are actually growing.  When I  received the new polish from DIY, they sent a guide with tips and instructions on the proper way to  use your gel.  I&#x27;m a happy camper :)</li>
            <li> I read about these on Chickettes.com and ordered the same day. I ordered heartbreaker and pink frost and they had such a great application and coverage! I have used gel polishes for over a year exclusively and love trying out new brands and colors. I was really wanting the pink galaxy and will be watching for it to come back in stock. Thank you Andrea for posting about these!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have worn mine for 2 weeks now.  My daughter picks at them and they stayed on great even for her, she did pick a couple off in this last week, but that is to be expected from a 12 year old.  We took hers off last night and it was real easy using the advice from the free e-book and painted them again!  I do recommend purchasing and reading the e-book before deciding what lamp to buy.  I began reading it after purchasing a UV Lamp, well the advise led me to promptly cancel that order and get an LED one.  These are beautiful polishes, I bought base, top and two colors and love it all.  Wish I had seen that if I had bought one more I could have received a 6th for free.</li>
            <li> OK, not as pictured, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this polish!  I am so impressed with how well it has been holding up since I initially applied it two weeks ago.  There is no peeling or chipping and my manicure is still going strong.  That has NEVER happened to me with any other brand of gel polish that I have applied myself and, believe me, I have tried many different brands!  I think I can attribute it to the awesome e-book with tips on how to apply gel polish that came with my purchase.  So helpful!  This brand applied easily and was compatible with my Red Carpet Manicure base and top coat.  Everyone I meet is impressed with the color changing effects.  I am a teacher and my students are constantly following me around to see what color my nails are at any given moment.  I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors and try those out, too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  My customers young and old love it!  Long lasting</li>
            <li> I have been a Gelish user for some time now and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I had problems with a defective color that wouldn&#x27;t change colors but after contacting customer service they shipped me out another one right away. Wow, was I impressed when it finally worked!!! This polish is so much fun. I bought the Pink Frost and I&#x27;ve been sticking my nails next to cold things just to watch it change. I&#x27;ve noticed that it even changes with my body temperature when I&#x27;m feeling very cold at night. Not only am I impressed with the polish. When I had the initial problem thy contacted my back right away to try and fix it. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors. So far I&#x27;ve had this color on for a week and have had no chipping or peeling and it still looks fresh minus my nail growth. Overall great brand.</li>
            <li> Color change is cool but it is super thick. Almost to thick to even use</li>
            <li> Just recieved this in the mail but haven&#x27;t received my free book &amp; the color is a lighter pinkish purple rather than the pink it shows. I haven&#x27;t tried to see if it actually works tho.</li>
            <li> It arrived right when it said it would maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to apply it but looks nicer in the picture then when I applied it on my nails it was blotchy uneven but again maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough coats on I do like it though</li>
            <li> I love this gel and have received many compliments on it. I&#x27;m now on my second week with it &amp; it still looks wonderful...</li>
            <li> I  love the colors. The color changing is very sensitive so with my cold hands it&#x27;s always changing.  I am not a big fan of the bigger size glitter.  The fine glitter I like so I didnt feel right marking the product with 4 stars because of my personal preference.  It is a fenomenal product and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> i love the color and the glittery effect. I will update on how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I just got my polish today (early) and I put it on right away.  It went on evenly, only needed 2 coats and didn&#x27;t shrink back on me. When warm its a frosted clear/white with a range of fine to medium glitter and larger hexagonal glitter to match. When cold, the polish turns a bright fuchsia.  It&#x27;s almost a jelly but with more coverage, I can just barely see my nail line through it when it&#x27;s warm.  I found this on Chickettes site, she has some great swatch pictures of the Pink Frost and the Pink Galaxy colors.</li>
            <li> Fun, color-switching polish</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  I got the polish in the mail earlier than advertised.  The colors are excellent.  The polish is extremely reactive in hot and cold temperatures and the colors are awesome.  I will definitely be buying more colors in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t wait to try more colors!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this new gel polish! It applies very smoothly, and does not &amp;#34;pool&amp;#34; at the sides.  I tried pink frost, and the color change is so beautiful, with just the right amount of glitter! I cant wait to get my hands on more colors!!! :)</li>
            <li> I really do not understand why this nail polish is getting such great reviews.  The actual effect looks nothing like the picture.  I don&#x27;t get the ombre affect at all.  My nails are the same length as picture, but unless I stick my hand in some cold water, the entire nail stays clear/white with sparkles.  Then when my nails touch cold water, the entire nail turns dark pink with sparkles.  Am I doing something wrong?  The picture is beautiful, and that is the effect I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me.  Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this color and the pink Galaxy. I love both and got great compliments but the pink frost is by far my fav. The nail polish I received is kinda thick but manageable. I&#x27;m def planning on buying more.</li>
            <li> Best Gel Polish Ever!!!!  This polish does exactly what it claims...it turns exactly the color that is shown.  When my hands, or the air temp is cold, the polish turns dark.  If I am warm, or the air temp is warm, the polish turns the lighter color.  I am wearing the Cola one now, and when I am at a comfortable temperature, the bed of my nail stays the pale color with the tips of my nails the darker color.  At times your nails will have a gradient effect from dark on the tips to light at the nail beds getting lighter as it gets near your cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;I read a review of someone who was very disappointed that they did not have dark nail tips.  I have discovered that the longer your nail is, the more likely it will stay the darker color at the tips.  I broke one of my nails, and noticed that the tip , which after the break barely extended past my finger, did not stay as dark at the ends as my other longer nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this particular polish on for 2 weeks, and have noticed that with my other gel polishes, they will start to lift at the edges of my nail.  After two weeks with this polish, still no lift!!! They are going strong!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome polish. Something you should know about this polish though. It is thicker then most polish, and to get the best change in color, I recommend 1 coat not 2.  I find myself looking at my nails often to see the color change.  The amount and different sizes of glitter are a perfect addition.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish!  I bought several colors and have used 2 of them and my adult daughter has used several that she purchased &amp; they all perform as described and are incredible!  They wear well, too!  What conversation starters, too!  You definately need to try them.  I am adding photos of the Coca Cola color.  I thought the light shade &amp;#34;needed something&amp;#34;, so added a hand-drawn tree on each finger, as the tips usually had color on them that looked like it could be a pile of fallen leaves.  I loved the effect!  I will post how they look at different temperatures....the lightest being when the temperature of my hands is the warmest.</li>
            <li> I just got this, and I love it, makes my nails really hard,</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing. This is my second experience with a gel color changing polish, but this one is my favorite. The polish is gorgeous, can&#x27;t wait to order more colors (I ordered Pink Frost). It&#x27;s so much fun :)&lt;br /&gt;I used my Gelish top and base. Thank you very much :)</li>
            <li> So i bought the pink galaxy as part of a Christmas gift to myself. I only ordered one color bc it is a bit pricey, and i didn&#x27;t know if it would actually work. So here&#x27;s the news. It totally does!  It amuses me and everyone around by constantly changing. I actually used mine over fake nails and wasnt how sure it would work on that, but it turned out to work perfectly. Also even with gel polishes i sometimes can only make it last a week bc i use my hands a lot, but this has been on a week and only had one tiny chip that was very easy to repair. I loved it so much i bought a 2nd color! I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of the DIY&#x27;s two was a base coat and the top. I already had done my finger nails so I used the base coat and the DIY color change Pink Galaxy on my toes with the top coat.  The polish is thick so I was nerves at first but, the thickness help keep the polish off of my skin. I have not seen it change color yet but it is a deep purple black with specks of pink glitter. I think if it where to be on my fingers with tips I would be able to see the color change. That&#x27;s why I only gave 4 stars cause I have yet to see the change on my toes.    I love how easy the polish goes on. It&#x27;s a good buy.    PS,   I just took a hot bath and the polish changed in to a beautiful pink. It was fun watching the tips turn back to the dark purple bleeding into the pink. So yes it works great!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love how reactant the polish is to temperature  changes. It looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my daughter. Thought she would like it because it is so fun, except that I use it too! It is exactly as advertised and great entertainment whenever it changes color! I have 3 of these colors and none of them disappoint!</li>
            <li> I Absolutely LoVe My New Color Changing gel Nail Polish I bought a Few different colors !! I LoVe how it Goes on ! Definitely My New Favorite Polish !! 💅🏻</li>
            <li> i love it! it lasts way longer than regular nail polish  and I&#x27;m always  getting compliments on my nails. it also protects them and makes them stronger so it&#x27;s  definitely worth every penny. the color changing on is probably my favorite :)</li>
            <li> Just love this changing polish - goes on in two coats, stays on for a couple weeks no problem.  Makes you feel like you have a different manicure throughout the day.  Have several of these colors and I&#x27;m hooked.  Recommend them to everyone - if you love a change and are adventurous give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this gel polish! I&#x27;ve used many brands and this one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. My manicure lasted 15 days without chipping or pulling away from the free edge. The colors are amazing and vibrant. The color changing polishes are stunning. Very happy with the whole system!</li>
            <li> I love how it changes color based on temperature!  Just like it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> When i saw it at chickettes.com, i was like this is sooo cool and i want to try it!!!</li>
            <li> Im loving this polish! I followed the instructions provided in the free downloadable Ebook and had no issues applying this color. It went on smooth with no clumps or mess. The original appeal was clear to soft sheer pink and after washing my hands and stepping out into a cooler temperature the color changed to a beautiful shade of pink. After a while it then faded to a more ombre look which I absolutely love! Will be purchasing more colors !</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase from DIY Hard Nails. I purchased three colors: Paradise, Coca Cola Float and Sun Glow. I love all three colors. The color change is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test and review DIY Hard Nails and am quite impressed with the formula.  They wear beautifully for a full two weeks (the length of my test) and removal is average for soak off gel polish.  The top coat is quite nice and holds its shine for the duration of the manicure.  The thermals are quite nice.  I found they were constantly shifting on my nails and never looked the same twice.  Coca Cola Float even took on a tri-color effect!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and so much fun!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this polish via Chickettes.com blog and had to have it!  All the swatches are beautiful, but I am partial to pinks.  I applied 3 coats for durability and opacity.  Pink Frost remains mostly the sheer white on me and since my nails are short, there is not a lot of length that would remain cool to show the ombre effect.  The color change mainly happens when my hands are exposed to cold water.  Overall first impression, the polish is great and will be picking up other colors to try.  I will do a wear test for a week, then do a blog post with a final review.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely LOVE it. At first I thought another polish that doesn&#x27;t chip and does.  But it doesnt chip at all, The thermos are perfect especially in this weather :)</li>
            <li> No it chiped the next day. Used base coat and $100 uv machine and top coat next day chiped (3 nails)</li>
            <li> Awesome color amazing product def should buy! goes on well and stays on well the colors are very pretty I bought three different colors 😊</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish earlier than expected, which is always a major plus!!! I love the color &amp; the ease of using it. My only complaint is that it was too thick to use when I received it so I had to buy thinner to use it. I didn&#x27;t want to send it back &amp; have to wait for it to arrive again. The color is exactly what read described. I&#x27;d definitely buy another color too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gel polish!! I have the color changing ones and they are so beautiful and very pigmented, you can do one coat and be good. The best part is I won&#x27;t get tired of wearing it after one day like I do regular polish because it doesn&#x27;t stay one color, it changes with the temperature and has beautiful glitter in it!  I&#x27;m currently wearing it and will definitely update to let you all know the wear time. You should definitely try this out, their customer service is amazing and responded quickly everytime I emailed them!! Love it:-)</li>
            <li> super excited to receive all my new shellac polish.  I ordered 6 because I could not decide which color I wanted.  Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> really works, almost clear with Sparkle when warm- isn&#x27;t French tip like picture- dark pink when cold! Very cool~</li>
            <li> OMG.....this nail polish is the absolute BOMB!!  Not only does it look wonderful..but it literally kept me amused all day long!!  The color changes all day...depending on the temperture of my hands, it went from bright fushia to white and everything in between...ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;Somtimes the nailbeds would be white, and the tips would be fushia....looking just like a french manicure. The sparkles thoughout are wonderful! My co-workers all loved it...but they all go to salons to get their nails done...and none of their salons carried it.  It was extremely easy to apply....toook only a very thin coat...I used 2 coats. .. A good top coat  and my manicure lasted for 3 weeks....no chips or anything. As a matter of fact...I just did a fill and a lite topcoat after the 3 weeks, and got another 2 weeks of wear !! Ladies....BUY THIS...you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have to say I really LOVE this polish. On me it lasts longer than any other gel I&#x27;ve used. Can&#x27;t wait for more colors to come out.</li>
            <li> Besides being an awesome polish, they have the Best Customer Service I&#x27;ve ever encountered! I agree, the only con is waiting 2 weeks before trying new colors!</li>
            <li> Love my color changing nail polish from DIY It&#x27;s so pretty long lasting wear.... I will never go back to regular nail polish again!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing polish. It changes color instantly and even changes with your warm breath. The shipping was very fast!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was pretty funky.  I&#x27;m 46yr old and had fun with this color.  It stayed put close to 2 weeks without chipping and my hands are constantly in water and/or purell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eyes on these ever since I saw them on Chickettes.com. I got the Coca Cola Float and Purple Tonic. The formula on both are great; only two coats needed for full opacity. They cured great in my Gelish LED lamp. The color change is quite striking and I love the glitter that gives it just that little extra. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Love them :) I&#x27;m a cna and the stay on even after washing my hand as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish after seeing it on Chickettes.com. I purchased Pink Galaxy. The color change is amazing!! This is the first brand of color changing polish I have tried but I do love it. Application is easy, it required two coats to be opaque. I cured it in my LED lamp. It lasted about a week to 10 days on my nails without chipping/peeling. I have issues though with chipping and peeling due to my brittle nails, which is something I stuggle with with all Gel polishes :( so I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer on healthy nails. The only complaint I have is that it took quite a while for me to snag this color because it was never in stock. That issue seems to have improved recently though. Yay!! Looking forward to adding more colors to my collection and seeing what new ones are released!</li>
            <li> It goes on pink, and turns white. I like how it changes to pink when I&#x27;m cold or it&#x27;s cold out. Cold water also changes the color.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in heartbreaker and I absolutely love it! Good bye salon gel overlay, hello gel polish!!!! 3 coats and it&#x27;s as sturdy as professional pink and white. So far so good. It has been a week...no chipping. Hope it&#x27;s lasts a month</li>
            <li> I received both the polishes I requested and so far, I am totally in love! The color changing is especially fun!! I will definitely order more in the future. Thank you!! I found the polish applied very smoothly in just 2 coats. And cures very well with my OPI base and top coats. Can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink Crystal, Pink Frost and Pink Galaxy...just received them and applied Pink Crystal...so far I love it.  It applied easily and was very compatible with my Gelish base and top coat.  Working in an office regular nail polish leaves streaks on the papers and envelopes which is a pain.  No worries now thanks to gel polishes.  I guess I will have to wait 2 weeks to try another color...I love not having my polish wear off at the ends and no chipping for the entire time it is on.</li>
            <li> I seen this on You Tube and rushed over to buy it..I first ordered Classic Galaxy..I received it in like 3 days(which is a big plus)..it&#x27;s a beautiful purple glitter that turns to a beautiful blue glitter..worked wonderfully ..So I placed an order for 4 more color changing polishes from this line :Coca Cola Float, Pink frost, Pink Galaxy and Purple Tonic...Love them all(did swatch nails to ck them all out)..Plus I ordered the base and top coat and a beautiful blue glitter top coat called Galaxy Twlight, which I just love!..If you want to see a good vid on these go to You Tube..very helpful on seeing the colors first hand;-)..P.S and both my orders came to me LIGHTING FAST</li>
            <li> I received my polish yesterday. The seller was really nice and was checking in to ensure that I received my product because they lost the tracking information. I was so thrilled to use it and I LOVE it :) It does a really great job of changing colors and it&#x27;s a great purchase. The actual nail polish is a little thick and doesn&#x27;t spread as smoothly as I would like but after I saw the final product, I don&#x27;t care haha. I just knew that once I put on the gel topcoat it would stop it from changing colors...nope! It changes colors when it&#x27;s hot/cold; it&#x27;s amazing!!!!    The price is a little steep in my opinion ($14.99 + $3.99 shipping + tax) but I&#x27;m pleased with the results so I will be purchasing other colors to try out :) I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works just like advertised and is extremely long lasting! Will definitely buy again and have recommended to all my polish wearing friends.</li>
            <li> this nail polish is amazing! It goes on nice and thick which allows you to use it to shape your nails! People always think that I&#x27;m wearing acrylic nails when I have it on.</li>
            <li> I have many brands of gel polish and this is one of my favorites. My gel polish often peels up but I did not have that problem during the two weeks that I kept this on my nails. I have short nails but really liked the color changing effects of the root beer float. I love the light color when my nails are warm, which is most of the time. Will definitely buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> I love these gels! Super strong, and awesome colors!</li>
            <li> Great polish. Lasts a long time. Can&#x27;t wait to get more colors!</li>
            <li> I love this company! Their polishes are amazing!!! I have tried multiple ones and have loved everyone!! I have never found anything that would actually stay on my nails until now!! These feel smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with lifting or chipping. I use a LED light. The how to guide has some really helpful tips for beginners. The pictures are very accurate at showing the colors. I would definitely recommend these and I will be ordering more. They also have amazing customer service!!  The only con is restraining yourself from changing the colors everyday. My kids love when I dip my hands in cold water and warm water to watch them change. I love these!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased pink Crystal it is gorgeous!! :-) love the glitter and shimmer in it! I received it two days earlier then expected eta and my clients are in love with it, it had become a new go to for several of them! :-)</li>
            <li> Amazing! Just love the colors and great quality. I bought 4 colors and cannot wait to try them all. Works great.</li>
            <li> Love this gel polish!!!! I got the classic galaxy and both the blue and purple are beautiful!!!! I tend to not get a lot of gradient in the nails because they often are one color or the other depending on my hand warmth, but the colors do switch a lot during the day even with small temperature changes. Even without getting to see both colors at once very often, it&#x27;s still beautiful and feels like I keep changing my nail polish...without the hassle of actually having too!! I used 2 coats for a complete color saturated look, but I could of easily done one coat if I wanted a lighter look. I am definitely going to be ordering more of this polish! It&#x27;s a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), but so far there isn&#x27;t much out there like it, so the price will have to do :-)</li>
            <li> Absolutely Amazing!! It really changes color. I&#x27;ve been wearing the pink frost for a week now and it&lt;br /&gt;looks like I just applied it. No chipping. I work with the public and they are amazed the way it changes color. They say I just have to&lt;br /&gt;have it.  I love it so much that I ordered the color changing gel polish in every color. Just can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty gel polish. It goes on very nicely and evenly. I can&#x27;t wait to get one of the other colors!</li>
            <li> Love this product colors are fun &amp; wears great. Will definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> There were so many colors it was hard to decide.  I purchased 3 bottles to get the free shipping (Ice Queen, Pink Galaxy &amp; Pink Frost).  The polish arrived right after I did a manicure so I had to wait.  Finally I could wait no more and changed my polish.  It&#x27;s fun to see the color change right before your eyes....Just like the mood rings that were so popular in my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t decide which of the colors to do I went with Ice Queen on my left hand than then since I wanted to see what the other colors looked like, I put the other colors on 2 of my fingers on my right hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the polish and can&#x27;t wait to get a few more colors.</li>
            <li> I saw this gel polish on Chickettes.com. This is the color I decided to get is Pink Frost. I love how it changes color from white to beautiful hot pink. It also has beautiful glitter in it.  Very durable and nice looking!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have the purple tonic and the shade changes are just beautiful. Light pinkish shade with sparkles when warm. Purple french tips when the tips of my nails are cool. Bright purplish blue when hand cold or submersed in cool water! Polish went on smoothly and only needed one coat for beautiful coverage and color.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! 2 coats does the job very well! The colors are beautiful!!! And there is plenty of glitter and shimmer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this amazing polish i purchased the coca cola float and it it so so gorgeous. This polish is a high quality gel polish and I recommend everyone to buy this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Love this polish!  Changes like indicated and long wear.  Also like how it&#x27;s glittery!</li>
            <li> Love this Polish. Easy to apply and your done so quickly. Color change is fun for a change of pace. Will def buy more!</li>
            <li> Soo excited to try this loved post my chickettes.com which made me look! So hard to find nice colour changing shellac</li>
            <li> Love this polish!  The color is great and it is fun watching it change.  I look forward to buying more colors.  It applies very easily.  The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Love love love this gel polish!! I used with my cnd base and top coat with my cnd light. Went on great! A week and half later still looks great! The color change happens all day long! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have the color changing nail polish in almost every color.  It works great.  You will only see an ombre effect if you have long nails.  The nail polish lasts for a while as long as you use your base and top coat properly.  I have used really cheap base/top coat and OPI brand with this polish. The nail polish stayed on for a long time.  The only reason why I had to take it off was because my nails started growing out.  The nail polish is thicker than most gel nail polishes I have seen.  I use 1-3 coats depending on the color I am using.</li>
