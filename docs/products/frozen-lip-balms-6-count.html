            <li> I split these up to put in loot bags for my daughters frozen bday party. The girls were very excited and happy to have the chap stick. Not bright, with little bit of glitter in the balm. Just enough glitz for 6 year olds.</li>

            <li> They were kind of yucky smells. My daughter did not like them. I didn&#x27;t either</li>
