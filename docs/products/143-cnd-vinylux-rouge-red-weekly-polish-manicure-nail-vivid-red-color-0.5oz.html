            <li>Good transaction.</li>
            <li>I take it with me when I have a pedicure as the salons never have this gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Great color, used many times before.</li>
            <li>But remember with any &amp;#34;Nail Lacquer&amp;#34; you need a great top coat that seals your polish on.  </li>
            <li>I love CND products, and this weekly polish is great for in between salon visits.</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>but it is kind of worn out on the edges after 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>Love it, will buy more colors for collection!</li>
            <li>Love this for my toes and the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>The color is very bright, quality is awesome, I loved it and purchased more, it last longer than regular polishes</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Love the color even if I still don&#x27;t get it,  </li>
            <li>This brand of nail polish amazes with how well it stays on, I need it in every color :)</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchased.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, too, using the cND Vinyl top coat.</li>
            <li>Also, it stays fresh-looking for more than a week.</li>
            <li>love the color of this polish.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a top coat.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think anything could be better than OPI Nail Lacquer, but CND did it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend Seche Vite top coat/dryer and gloss.  </li>
            <li>Easily lasts me 7 days (someone who doesn&#x27;t have a dishwasher and types all day) with just some wear at the tips.</li>
            <li>The top coat gives the polish a nice professional shine, however the polish just isn&#x27;t up to snuff in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Fantastic formula, practically applies itself.</li>
            <li>i went two weeks with just some light touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>Great shade of red for summer and beyond!  </li>
            <li>if love red than this is you&#x27;re red awesome</li>
            <li>between manicures I brush on the top coat to keep the high gloss from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great wearability (it last a week for me), but it is a little bright for me.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Red, love this color, one of my favorites, lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure this was not the real polish and a filler instead.</li>
            <li>Love, love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion, got a few compliments from only wearing it once....</li>
            <li>Still worth it.</li>
            <li>Came right off.</li>
            <li>Last more then a week.</li>
            <li>really lasts!&lt;br /&gt;You can do dishes and still look freshly manicured.  </li>
            <li>so i will try to recreate a french manicure using available Vinylux colors.&lt;br /&gt;Bring this polish to your manicurist for a longer lasting manicure....or do your own nails.  </li>
            <li>First introduced to this product while getting a manicure.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for and in a very flattering color.  </li>
            <li>I love this classic red!</li>
            <li>And this color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>Nothing special, Revlon does the same job</li>
            <li>I tried the recommended topcoat at first, but after two days the finish dulled so I went over it with my Essie quick dry topcoat.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last 7 days, only able to wear 4 days without chipping.</li>
            <li>There is also a clear top coat which works with any other polish and should prolong your manicure.  </li>
            <li>The color is a very classic crisp red, will never go out of style.</li>
            <li>Really should be applied by a professional manicurist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PS, make sure you use heavy duty gloves when washing dishes or cleaning.</li>
            <li>Then it just looks old and worn.  </li>
            <li>Found it stayed on much longer than regular polish</li>
            <li>The product is exact as expected.</li>

            <li> This really will last me all week which I was skeptical about when I first purchased.</li>
            <li> No polish has ever lasted that long for me.  </li>
            <li> did not last any longer than any other polish, i used it with their basecoat and topcoat.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!</li>

            <li> French manicures are also bad when it comes to staying power</li>
            <li> This polish stays on for at least 7 days!</li>
            <li> (I am VERY hard on my nails).</li>
            <li> not impressed.</li>
            <li> Lasts about a week but not flawlessly.  </li>

            <li> Great product.  Love the color.  Lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> Chips in less than a day. Pretty sure this was not the real polish and a filler instead.</li>
            <li> Love the color even if I still don&#x27;t get it,  but I know the product and I love every vanylux products!!</li>
            <li> Red polish would not come off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Love, love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion, got a few compliments from only wearing it once....</li>
            <li> Just tried one time and so far, not good.  Chipped off the second day I work it.  Did like color.</li>
            <li> Fantastic formula, practically applies itself. Easily lasts me 7 days (someone who doesn&#x27;t have a dishwasher and types all day) with just some wear at the tips. I tried the recommended topcoat at first, but after two days the finish dulled so I went over it with my Essie quick dry topcoat.</li>
            <li> Love the color and how long it lasts.  Want to see what other colors you offer.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  it does not stay on all week like it states. It chips on the tips. It does coat your nails and gives some protection so your nails can grow.  I would not spend the money on this product again.</li>
            <li> did not last any longer than any other polish, i used it with their basecoat and topcoat. not impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this classic red! It&#x27;s perfect for any season.  This brand of nail polish amazes with how well it stays on, I need it in every color :)</li>
            <li> Last more then a week. recommend  highly&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for and in a very flattering color.  Glad I made this purchased. i would recommend.</li>
            <li> This polish stays on for at least 7 days! Love it. Went from Chanel to CND. Will purchase different colors!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish. It lasts longer than gel polish done at the salon. And this color is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> Application is the same as any other nail polish, the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me (I am VERY hard on my nails). Other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil, which I am not doing so maybe the polish would last longer if I did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays. The color selection is fairly vast with this product. I have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so as well as continue to purchase and use the product myself.</li>
            <li> A red manicure can look so festive.......for a day or two.  Then it just looks old and worn.  This polish is the exception.  It really lasts!&lt;br /&gt;You can do dishes and still look freshly manicured.  i went two weeks with just some light touch-ups.  No polish has ever lasted that long for me.  I have avoided red polish for years because it is the fastest to wear off at the edges or fade and lose its shine. French manicures are also bad when it comes to staying power so i will try to recreate a french manicure using available Vinylux colors.&lt;br /&gt;Bring this polish to your manicurist for a longer lasting manicure....or do your own nails.  There is also a clear top coat which works with any other polish and should prolong your manicure.  Drying time seems to be a bit longer for these polishes.</li>
            <li> The color is very bright, quality is awesome, I loved it and purchased more, it last longer than regular polishes</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Vinylux Polish and I wish it were what it claims. For me, the polish lasts only about 4 days max without chipping and that is with wearing gloves when washing dishes. The top coat gives the polish a nice professional shine, however the polish just isn&#x27;t up to snuff in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Lasts a long time! Good transaction.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, Revlon does the same job</li>
            <li> Came right off. Really should be applied by a professional manicurist.  I followed the directions, too, using the cND Vinyl top coat. Did not work.</li>
            <li> Great shade of red for summer and beyond!  Also, it stays fresh-looking for more than a week.</li>
            <li> love the color of this polish.</li>
            <li> Great wearability (it last a week for me), but it is a little bright for me. It&#x27;s a fire engine red.</li>
            <li> love the color but the top coat is awful</li>
            <li> Beautiful Red, love this color, one of my favorites, lasts a very long time.  Make sure you use a top coat.</li>
            <li> if love red than this is you&#x27;re red awesome</li>
            <li> Great color, used many times before. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great product ...beautiful color and stays on your toenails forever .  I take it with me when I have a pedicure as the salons never have this gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> First introduced to this product while getting a manicure.  Found it stayed on much longer than regular polish so I went online to purchase it through Amazon.  Very happy.  Lasts almost 2 weeks if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last 7 days, only able to wear 4 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything could be better than OPI Nail Lacquer, but CND did it.  I used it the day I got it in the mail and seven days later, it is still on.  But remember with any &amp;#34;Nail Lacquer&amp;#34; you need a great top coat that seals your polish on.  I recommend Seche Vite top coat/dryer and gloss.  After you put on Seche Vite within 10 minutes your nails are dry and smudge proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even between manicures I brush on the top coat to keep the high gloss from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, make sure you use heavy duty gloves when washing dishes or cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this for my toes and the color is amazing. I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The product is exact as expected. it is stay for 7 days and can be even longer but it is kind of worn out on the edges after 3-4 days. Love it, will buy more colors for collection!</li>
            <li> Just as it says.  Lasts about a week but not flawlessly.  It starts to chip after about four days and by seven days it&#x27;s a mess.  Still worth it.</li>
            <li> I love CND products, and this weekly polish is great for in between salon visits. I wash my hands vigorously and quite often at work, and regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t even last a day. This really will last me all week which I was skeptical about when I first purchased. The color is a very classic crisp red, will never go out of style.</li>
            <li> it started peeling the day I applied it.  When I went on vac it lasted 2 days as I did not dishes or housework, filing, typing.</li>
            <li> its the only nail enamel that last in my hands without the roughness to the nails of shelac</li>
