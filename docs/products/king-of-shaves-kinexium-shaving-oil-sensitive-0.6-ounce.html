            <li>This is a wonderful product, I just love it, it gives you the best shaving experience, just as described, 200% recommended!</li>
            <li>This King of Shaves (KOS) is a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling verse travel shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Kinexium Oil allowed me to have the closest shave I have ever experienced from a DE razor.</li>
            <li>I asked my wife to see if she liked the smell - AND she DID!</li>
            <li>pleasant smell:</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s sort of like good running shoes - you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It is also quite good for your hair and skin as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Good with blade or electric.</li>
            <li>But Kinexium (as awesome as it is) is not my goto shaving oil now that I&#x27;ve discovered Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil which is an amazing blend of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Very potent and effective.</li>
            <li>Most pleasant smell:</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised!!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve used a shaving oil; I&#x27;ve been using king of shave&#x27;s oils for quite a while and they make an amazing</li>
            <li>but it would have been nice if this statement was listed with the product before purchase.</li>
            <li>I no longer use shaving cream, this is the best shaving product i&#x27;ve ever bought, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving oil by far!</li>
            <li>For the sake of it, I also bought a bottle of CB Rowan&#x27;s Natural Pre Shave Oil, just to see which option I would like best.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>My skin also feels refreshed and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, I like the Kinexium better and after more than 25 years shaving with a Braun shaver without oil</li>
            <li>I do feel like the hair clumps more inside the razor heads when using this</li>
            <li>That would be lovely.  </li>
            <li>I was going through shaving cream a lot more often.  </li>
            <li>I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after shaving with</li>
            <li>The Braun is a better, alcohol-based cleaner so perhaps it won&#x27;t have the problem.</li>
            <li>It leaves me much better moisturized than the Kinexium.  </li>
            <li>For many years, whenever I travel I take Kinexium shave oil with me.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d be better off just using Vaseline or soap</li>
            <li>I tried everything and finally found the best there is.  </li>
            <li>and I have yet to find anything better.  </li>
            <li>what more could you ask for..?</li>
            <li>Smells much better.  </li>
            <li>Feels better.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to add shaving cream or gel on top of it.</li>
            <li>With just 2 squirts (one for each side of my face) I was able to evenly spread the product around my face and neck area.</li>
            <li>I did a three-pass shave and the oil maintained a nice coat and kept the blade gliding smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li>If I am able to obtain consistant results from this product, the shave brush, shave soap, mixing mug and aftershave products are goners.</li>
            <li>I would spend more time mixing and lathering my shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works best when following directions:*</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best beard conditioner (most astringent):</li>
            <li>Works best when following directions:</li>
            <li>First, my experience with Amazon is almost always great and very quick as a Prime member.  </li>
            <li>find it interesting though, that many of the comments regarding the Kinexium Shaving Oil leaving a film on the sink and how time-consuming it is to clean are made by individuals that spend about 3-5 minutes preparing their shave soap lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the most smooth shaving experience ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good thing, because they don&#x27;t give you much.</li>
            <li>-- if you travel a lot, you can easily shave with just the shaving oil and your razor, and not bother packing you can of foam.</li>
            <li>strongly suggest you give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-28-12:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is pretty amazing as a lubricant for electric shavers, minimizes razor heat and skin friction without a lot of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>The Kinexium oil really makes a nice difference allowing the razor to glide smoothly.  </li>
            <li>face is smooth after a 5 minute shave</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cut myself and my skin feels smooth with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>Using a double-edge razor I was amazed how smoothly the razor glided on my skin.</li>
            <li>Provides good lubrication for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it clogged up my Panasonic LA-93 Cleaning System.</li>
            <li>So much more logical than shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and small for your carry on too.</li>
            <li>leaves an ultra slick perfect shaving surface.........</li>
            <li>Somersets, King of Shaves, Shave Secret    Best beard conditioner (most astringent):</li>
            <li>Its advertising is a bit over the top for either legal or PC reasons, though:  </li>
            <li>so I have to do a more in-depth cleaning more often than previously, but if that means a more comfortable shave without the dryness</li>
            <li>Africa&#x27;s Herbal gets me as close as does the Kinexium and the shave is as quick as with the Kinexium.  </li>
            <li>All these advantages makes things go really quick</li>
            <li>And for those of you who thorough and do your &amp;#34;manscaping,&amp;#34; you will quickly appreciate this oil, just like I did.</li>
            <li>I used King of Shaves shave gel for a long time and loved it, bought this as a pre-shave oil</li>
            <li>I am starting with a neutral rating plus one star because my wife liked it and pray she wasn&#x27;t being ornery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best Buy (as of 2/26/15): King of Shaves (35¢/ml), Shave Secret (37¢/ml), Somersets (66¢/ml)    Dispenser Control (per drop):</li>
            <li>So as soon as I&#x27;m completely out of Kinexium, I&#x27;ll go back to the Africa&#x27;s Best and only use like 2 drops (one drop per side)</li>
            <li>Small package, great for travel or home.  </li>
            <li>Super slick and smells good.</li>
            <li>and the shave goes VERY FAST and</li>
            <li>This shave oil works pretty well with my electric razor.</li>
            <li>That couldn&#x27;t be more opposite from my experience.  </li>
            <li>Two pumps of the plunger provides enough product to cover most mugs;  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, shaving is entirely improved by using it</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this because the small size is great for travel, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>A warm, soaking wet washrag works well for this, and allows me to wipe my face afterward.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About three months ago I became interested in shaving oil, in part listening to Stu Burguiere of \\&quot;The</li>
            <li>Well, in my experience, although the product does leave a oily film it is not difficult to clean with a sponge and some soap or any product you use to clean your sink on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>, I cannot think about going back without it, it is such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>-- one other handy thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different oils over recent weeks and this is my 2nd favorite choice.  </li>
            <li>Kinexium gets you VERY CLOSE</li>
            <li>And for 3 days I&#x27;m blown away at how much closer and how much smoother I am.  </li>
            <li>and I really like that.</li>
            <li>Shaving also goes much quicker.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a variety of types; all I&#x27;ll say is I&#x27;d avoid the menthol unless you really like that menthol feel, which person I can pass</li>
            <li>do tend to wash with a gentle face cleanser afterwards to get the oil off my face.  </li>
            <li>received the King of Shaves shaving oil - thanks to the add-on feature change regarding shipping.</li>
            <li>Shaves shaving oil - thanks to the add-on feature change regarding shipping.</li>
            <li>If there is anything negative, it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice other oils, but overall for shaving, and especially head shaving, this is the best</li>
            <li>I usually love this product, but this one had a curious odor that seemed to say that it had been on the shelf for years!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really getting the idea that when shaving with oil, LESS IS BETTER.  </li>
            <li>Forget about it if you have a decent amount of growth; use some clippers to remove most of the beard first, then shave as usual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting such great shaves in such short time that I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to my go to oil</li>
            <li>I have used other brands with completely safe and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I reapply some water during the shave with wet fingers to keep the shave a smooth experience.</li>
            <li>ordered 2 of these, one works fine the other does not dispense.</li>
            <li>The smell is similar to Somersets Original English, but not as intense.</li>
            <li>The smell is similar to Somersets Original English, but not as intense.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve never had to do this since it has always been just right for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tad pricey, but literally one drop a day is the right amount, so it should last quite a while.  .</li>
            <li>This is a very light oil, and softens up your whiskers; the razor blade takes off both the shave cream and the oil underneath, and you will not believe how close it gets (I sound like a corny add -- sorry -- but it works).</li>
            <li>I bought this item after reading people recommending it in reviews of my new Braun 790-4 shaver, I never thought about using a shaving oil.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it doesn&#x27;t ruin my new Braun 797cc Cleaner.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying new oil.  </li>
            <li>my opinion, this product still deserves serious consideration from anyone looking for a quick smooth shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this stuff I thought it was kind of silly, really, &#x27;cause if shaving oil was something that made a difference why did we only see ads for shave gels and foams?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe so little oil can give a great shave.</li>
            <li>Have used the sensitive lotion before (and like it) and tried this as a change.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I like to shave against the natural direction of the hair (which I know is a no-no in shaving) for a smoother result.  </li>
            <li>I was also a bit nervous about using an oil-based product as I didn&#x27;t want to break out with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>So far not seeing buildup.</li>
            <li>I tried a whole bunch of shave oils when this became unavailable last year, and none of them worked as well.</li>
            <li>an absolute essential.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly 15 years</li>
            <li>At nearly $25</li>
            <li>I was completely sold.  </li>
            <li>Shaves\\&quot; \\&quot;K-Series Formula Alpha Super-cooled Menthol\\&quot; shaving oil that came with an old Braun electric shaver purchased over twelve years ago.</li>
            <li>The pump action is _not_ an atomizer; rather it dispenses a gloplet (equivalent to 3-4 drops) of shaving oil per push of the button.</li>

            <li>The positive with this is that it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>Have to wet the face first.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me about 4-5 seconds to clean and rinse the oily residue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often, though, because I absolutely have to use sunblock on my face for health reasons with cancer, and I&#x27;m not sure if this silicon-based oil will prevent the sunblock from working well for UVA and UVB.</li>
            <li>Only need a few drops for a comfortable shave, and because it&#x27;s oily your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like with soaps and foams.</li>
            <li>Really cuts down on razor burn.</li>
            <li>; and yet it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dermatologically tested.&amp;#34;  At least it doesn&#x27;t use the Super Platitude and say that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;all natural.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This should be easily resolved using standard drain products however, I have not experienced any clogging as of yet</li>
            <li>All you need is one little pump and your face will come away with a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I think all the other shaving stuff is going to have to find a new home.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Best beard conditioner (most astringent):</li>
            <li> Works best when following directions:</li>
            <li> First, my experience with Amazon is almost always great and very quick as a Prime member.  </li>
            <li> find it interesting though, that many of the comments regarding the Kinexium Shaving Oil leaving a film on the sink and how time-consuming it is to clean are made by individuals that spend about 3-5 minutes preparing their shave soap lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the most smooth shaving experience ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good thing, because they don&#x27;t give you much.</li>
            <li> -- if you travel a lot, you can easily shave with just the shaving oil and your razor, and not bother packing you can of foam.</li>
            <li> strongly suggest you give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-28-12:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing as a lubricant for electric shavers, minimizes razor heat and skin friction without a lot of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> The Kinexium oil really makes a nice difference allowing the razor to glide smoothly.  </li>
            <li> face is smooth after a 5 minute shave</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut myself and my skin feels smooth with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> Using a double-edge razor I was amazed how smoothly the razor glided on my skin.</li>
            <li> Provides good lubrication for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it clogged up my Panasonic LA-93 Cleaning System.</li>
            <li> So much more logical than shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and small for your carry on too.</li>
            <li> leaves an ultra slick perfect shaving surface.........</li>
            <li> Somersets, King of Shaves, Shave Secret    Best beard conditioner (most astringent):</li>
            <li> Its advertising is a bit over the top for either legal or PC reasons, though:  </li>
            <li> so I have to do a more in-depth cleaning more often than previously, but if that means a more comfortable shave without the dryness</li>
            <li> Africa&#x27;s Herbal gets me as close as does the Kinexium and the shave is as quick as with the Kinexium.  </li>
            <li> All these advantages makes things go really quick</li>
            <li> And for those of you who thorough and do your &amp;#34;manscaping,&amp;#34; you will quickly appreciate this oil, just like I did.</li>
            <li> I used King of Shaves shave gel for a long time and loved it, bought this as a pre-shave oil</li>
            <li> I am starting with a neutral rating plus one star because my wife liked it and pray she wasn&#x27;t being ornery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best Buy (as of 2/26/15): King of Shaves (35¢/ml), Shave Secret (37¢/ml), Somersets (66¢/ml)    Dispenser Control (per drop):</li>
            <li> So as soon as I&#x27;m completely out of Kinexium, I&#x27;ll go back to the Africa&#x27;s Best and only use like 2 drops (one drop per side)</li>
            <li> Small package, great for travel or home.  </li>
            <li> Super slick and smells good.</li>
            <li> and the shave goes VERY FAST and</li>
            <li> This shave oil works pretty well with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> That couldn&#x27;t be more opposite from my experience.  </li>
            <li> Two pumps of the plunger provides enough product to cover most mugs;  </li>
            <li> Item exactly as described</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, shaving is entirely improved by using it</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this because the small size is great for travel, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> A warm, soaking wet washrag works well for this, and allows me to wipe my face afterward.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About three months ago I became interested in shaving oil, in part listening to Stu Burguiere of \\&quot;The</li>
            <li> Well, in my experience, although the product does leave a oily film it is not difficult to clean with a sponge and some soap or any product you use to clean your sink on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> , I cannot think about going back without it, it is such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> -- one other handy thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different oils over recent weeks and this is my 2nd favorite choice.  </li>
            <li> Kinexium gets you VERY CLOSE</li>
            <li> And for 3 days I&#x27;m blown away at how much closer and how much smoother I am.  </li>
            <li> and I really like that.</li>
            <li> Shaving also goes much quicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a variety of types; all I&#x27;ll say is I&#x27;d avoid the menthol unless you really like that menthol feel, which person I can pass</li>
            <li> do tend to wash with a gentle face cleanser afterwards to get the oil off my face.  </li>
            <li> received the King of Shaves shaving oil - thanks to the add-on feature change regarding shipping.</li>
            <li> Shaves shaving oil - thanks to the add-on feature change regarding shipping.</li>
            <li> If there is anything negative, it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice other oils, but overall for shaving, and especially head shaving, this is the best</li>
            <li> I usually love this product, but this one had a curious odor that seemed to say that it had been on the shelf for years!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really getting the idea that when shaving with oil, LESS IS BETTER.  </li>
            <li> Forget about it if you have a decent amount of growth; use some clippers to remove most of the beard first, then shave as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting such great shaves in such short time that I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to my go to oil</li>
            <li> I have used other brands with completely safe and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I reapply some water during the shave with wet fingers to keep the shave a smooth experience.</li>
            <li> ordered 2 of these, one works fine the other does not dispense.</li>
            <li> The smell is similar to Somersets Original English, but not as intense.</li>
            <li> The smell is similar to Somersets Original English, but not as intense.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve never had to do this since it has always been just right for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tad pricey, but literally one drop a day is the right amount, so it should last quite a while.  .</li>
            <li> This is a very light oil, and softens up your whiskers; the razor blade takes off both the shave cream and the oil underneath, and you will not believe how close it gets (I sound like a corny add -- sorry -- but it works).</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading people recommending it in reviews of my new Braun 790-4 shaver, I never thought about using a shaving oil.  </li>
            <li> Hoping it doesn&#x27;t ruin my new Braun 797cc Cleaner.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying new oil.  </li>
            <li> my opinion, this product still deserves serious consideration from anyone looking for a quick smooth shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this stuff I thought it was kind of silly, really, &#x27;cause if shaving oil was something that made a difference why did we only see ads for shave gels and foams?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe so little oil can give a great shave.</li>
            <li> Have used the sensitive lotion before (and like it) and tried this as a change.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I like to shave against the natural direction of the hair (which I know is a no-no in shaving) for a smoother result.  </li>
            <li> I was also a bit nervous about using an oil-based product as I didn&#x27;t want to break out with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> So far not seeing buildup.</li>
            <li> I tried a whole bunch of shave oils when this became unavailable last year, and none of them worked as well.</li>
            <li> an absolute essential.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 15 years</li>
            <li> At nearly $25</li>
            <li> I was completely sold.  </li>
            <li> Shaves\\&quot; \\&quot;K-Series Formula Alpha Super-cooled Menthol\\&quot; shaving oil that came with an old Braun electric shaver purchased over twelve years ago.</li>
            <li> The pump action is _not_ an atomizer; rather it dispenses a gloplet (equivalent to 3-4 drops) of shaving oil per push of the button.</li>
            <li> The pump action is _not_ an atomizer; rather it dispenses a gloplet (equivalent to 3-4 drops) of shaving oil per push of the button.</li>
            <li> The positive with this is that it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Have to wet the face first.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 4-5 seconds to clean and rinse the oily residue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often, though, because I absolutely have to use sunblock on my face for health reasons with cancer, and I&#x27;m not sure if this silicon-based oil will prevent the sunblock from working well for UVA and UVB.</li>
            <li> Only need a few drops for a comfortable shave, and because it&#x27;s oily your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like with soaps and foams.</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> ; and yet it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dermatologically tested.&amp;#34;  At least it doesn&#x27;t use the Super Platitude and say that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;all natural.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This should be easily resolved using standard drain products however, I have not experienced any clogging as of yet</li>
            <li> All you need is one little pump and your face will come away with a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I think all the other shaving stuff is going to have to find a new home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good shaving oil - It was prudent not to base a judgment on 12+ year old product.</li>

            <li> I think the only solution is to buy a new bottle, secretly throw the old bottle away, and request a retest.</li>
            <li> the order never showed up, so the evaluation is now a neutral three stars: It&#x27;s hard to tell who is responsible for the loss, Amazon, USPS?</li>
            <li> I do feel that I get a closer shave but would also compare this to other pre-shave items, such as Lectra Shave.</li>
            <li> All foams or other products that I have used have left me with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this shaving oil is equal to the hand liquid soap I use, but the smell is different, I use to work in my dads auto shop at a younger age, the smell reminds me of a detergent , or some chemical  that was used there for cleaning parts, cant put my finger on it but</li>
            <li> Why dry out your skin with soap and alcohol (after shave).</li>
            <li> I use roughly 3-4 pumps or actuations for my beard.  </li>
            <li> So its not really like &amp;#34;passes&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and since I started using this</li>
            <li> It has a silicone extract added to it, and it beats any other oil out there.</li>
            <li> I rinse it after every other swipe and it cleans the blades out</li>
            <li> The only problem I might see is the longterm buildup of the product and small hair inside the drain pipe.</li>
            <li> used it as I did my other shaving oils, but the smell reminded me of linseed oil.</li>
            <li> I have used Shave Secret with reasonable results, but still got a few ingrown hairs from it.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard, and with standard shaving creams I would often be reduced to shaving every other day to avoid issues.  </li>
            <li> Although a little leery, I ordered this product to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being somewhat expensive per ounce, it works very, very well.</li>
            <li> Only negative depending on the blade may make it clog faster.</li>
            <li> Some people use this as a shaving base and add a lotion or cream on top.  </li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t care for Shave Secret because it reminds her of Old Spice.</li>
            <li> my__ humble opinion (except for any evaluation marked with an &#x27;*&#x27; - which means use common sense!).</li>
            <li> my__ humble opinion (except for any evaluation marked with an &#x27;*&#x27; - which means use common sense!).</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like the oily mess or the&lt;br /&gt;thought of putting this oil down the drain.</li>
            <li> (feeling like the razor glides less with that oil than without, defeating the purpose).  </li>
            <li> I never the less rubbed it on my face and it worked well, but I will probably switch to a less carcinogenic pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> The Somersets does have a pronounced tea tree smell, which is less objectionable to my wife -</li>
            <li> But she still isn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, As I rummaged around my medicine cabinet yesterday (man speak for \\&quot;reach for something in back while knocking everything else out of the cabinet\\&quot;), out fell the 12+ year old bottle of \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> IF NOT using a shaving oil, I recommend trying all three; cost: less than $24 - You won&#x27;t regret switching to shaving oil.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit expensive but, given that you only use 2 squirts to shave, I&#x27;m not certain</li>
            <li> The LA-93 was very dirty inside because of the oil, and I had to clean it manually (even when the cleaner was working).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used the sensitive lotion before (and like it) and tried this as a change.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump so only get 1 application, as opposed to squeezing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My face is smooth after a 5 minute shave</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading people recommending it in reviews of my new Braun 790-4 shaver, I never thought about using a shaving oil.  For the sake of it, I also bought a bottle of CB Rowan&#x27;s Natural Pre Shave Oil, just to see which option I would like best.  The Kinexium oil really makes a nice difference allowing the razor to glide smoothly.  I also like the smell and the feeling it leaves after, even after cleaning my face.  By contrast the CB Rowan&#x27;s is really thick and I actually felt it was not working for my electric razor (feeling like the razor glides less with that oil than without, defeating the purpose).  In conclusion, I like the Kinexium better and after more than 25 years shaving with a Braun shaver without oil, I cannot think about going back without it, it is such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> This shave oil works pretty well with my electric razor. I do feel that I get a closer shave but would also compare this to other pre-shave items, such as Lectra Shave. The positive with this is that it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry afterwards. I do feel like the hair clumps more inside the razor heads when using this so I have to do a more in-depth cleaning more often than previously, but if that means a more comfortable shave without the dryness that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> Delivered with a sticker on it stating that it contains ingredients known to cause cancer. This was not disclosed in the listing at all and I am very disappointed. I guess I could have looked up each ingredient but it would have been nice if this statement was listed with the product before purchase. Obviously will not be using. I have used other brands with completely safe and natural ingredients. Just a warning for anyone else that would change their mind knowing this info.</li>
            <li> First, my experience with Amazon is almost always great and very quick as a Prime member.  This King of Shaves (KOS) is a GREAT product.  I have very sensitive skin for shaving.  I like to shave against the natural direction of the hair (which I know is a no-no in shaving) for a smoother result.  All foams or other products that I have used have left me with razor burn.  I have a fairly thick beard, and with standard shaving creams I would often be reduced to shaving every other day to avoid issues.  I did a lot of research before choosing this option, and this KOS product had very good feedback.  I was also a bit nervous about using an oil-based product as I didn&#x27;t want to break out with adult acne.  That would be lovely.  That couldn&#x27;t be more opposite from my experience.  I use roughly 3-4 pumps or actuations for my beard.  I think a bottle of this typically last between 2-3mos in my experience even though they said 100 actuations per bottle.  I was going through shaving cream a lot more often.  My skin also feels refreshed and very smooth.  I also feel like the oil treats my disposable blade too (similar to oiling shears, scissors, or clippers).  I truly love this product.  I buy it in bulk because it was somewhat difficult to find for a while.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after shaving with&lt;br /&gt;this oil. But I don&#x27;t like the oily mess or the&lt;br /&gt;thought of putting this oil down the drain.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product, but this one had a curious odor that seemed to say that it had been on the shelf for years!</li>
            <li> I no longer have any shaving cream in my house.  I don&#x27;t cut myself and my skin feels smooth with no razor burn.  Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit expensive but, given that you only use 2 squirts to shave, I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s that much more expensive than shaving cream.  Still, it&#x27;s sort of like good running shoes - you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;m just not sure if it ruins electric razor cleaners eventually. I&#x27;m pretty sure it clogged up my Panasonic LA-93 Cleaning System. Hoping it doesn&#x27;t ruin my new Braun 797cc Cleaner. The LA-93 was very dirty inside because of the oil, and I had to clean it manually (even when the cleaner was working). The Braun is a better, alcohol-based cleaner so perhaps it won&#x27;t have the problem. So far not seeing buildup. I tried a whole bunch of shave oils when this became unavailable last year, and none of them worked as well.</li>
            <li> So much more logical than shaving soap. Why dry out your skin with soap and alcohol (after shave).</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing as a lubricant for electric shavers, minimizes razor heat and skin friction without a lot of alcohol.  Two pumps of the plunger provides enough product to cover most mugs;  good thing, because they don&#x27;t give you much. Pleasing scent...an absolute essential.</li>
            <li> Shaving with oil is definitely the way to go.  I&#x27;ve tried many different oils over recent weeks and this is my 2nd favorite choice.  Kinexium gets you VERY CLOSE and the shave goes VERY FAST and this stuff is just perfect.  Its expensive here on Amazon but you can get this same bottle at Target for around $5.  Dunno why its so expensive on Amazon.  But Kinexium (as awesome as it is) is not my goto shaving oil now that I&#x27;ve discovered Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil which is an amazing blend of natural oils.  It is also quite good for your hair and skin as a moisturizer.  It leaves me much better moisturized than the Kinexium.  PLUS Africa&#x27;s Herbal gets me as close as does the Kinexium and the shave is as quick as with the Kinexium.  PLUS Africa&#x27;s is easily available at Walmart for less than $2 for 8oz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Its really expensive here on Amazon and again I don&#x27;t know why.  But my recommendation is to use Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil from Walmart and use it in your hair and skin too. I hope this helps someone.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  UPDATE &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; I&#x27;ve gone back to Knexium for the pas 3 days to test a theory.  I believe the KOS intends you to shave with ONE PUMP of the bottle.  So I tried it.  And for 3 days I&#x27;m blown away at how much closer and how much smoother I am.  I&#x27;m getting such great shaves in such short time that I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to my go to oil (Africa&#x27;s  Best) for a test there.  So as soon as I&#x27;m completely out of Kinexium, I&#x27;ll go back to the Africa&#x27;s Best and only use like 2 drops (one drop per side) and see where that gets me.  But I&#x27;m really getting the idea that when shaving with oil, LESS IS BETTER.  I shave in the shower and just let the water hit my face between passes.  I say passes, but I only have t apply this oil ONCE per shave.  I then can just go for it and keep on shaving until I&#x27;m done.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about clearing the stubble from the blades and I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying new oil.  So its not really like &amp;#34;passes&amp;#34;.  All these advantages makes things go really quick and I really like that.</li>
            <li> Hello shavers! I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve used a shaving oil; I&#x27;ve been using king of shave&#x27;s oils for quite a while and they make an amazing difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you wash your face, put a bit of shaving oil where the razor will be going (a couple of drops) and then if you want to add foam or gel it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought this stuff I thought it was kind of silly, really, &#x27;cause if shaving oil was something that made a difference why did we only see ads for shave gels and foams? And who ever heard of shaving oil? Sounded like something to lubricate my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But definitely not. This is a very light oil, and softens up your whiskers; the razor blade takes off both the shave cream and the oil underneath, and you will not believe how close it gets (I sound like a corny add -- sorry -- but it works). Shaving also goes much quicker. And for those of you who thorough and do your &amp;#34;manscaping,&amp;#34; you will quickly appreciate this oil, just like I did. No cuts or nicks or razor burn or pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a variety of types; all I&#x27;ll say is I&#x27;d avoid the menthol unless you really like that menthol feel, which person I can pass on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh -- one other handy thing -- if you travel a lot, you can easily shave with just the shaving oil and your razor, and not bother packing you can of foam. It works just fine.</li>
            <li> Read the insert that comes with the oil.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this until I opened the box and saw the label on the front of the packaging stating, &amp;#34;This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer&amp;#34;. This somehow was left out of the product&#x27;s description on the website. Would have never ordered it if I had known this.</li>
            <li> For many years, whenever I travel I take Kinexium shave oil with me. The bottle is tiny. Only need a few drops for a comfortable shave, and because it&#x27;s oily your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like with soaps and foams. Can leave a residue in the sink which takes a little effort to rinse away.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d be better off just using Vaseline or soap</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with shaving and getting ingrown hairs along with having irritation from shaving.  I tried everything and finally found the best there is.  I have been using this product for nearly 15 years and I have yet to find anything better.  Some people use this as a shaving base and add a lotion or cream on top.  Personally, I&#x27;ve never had to do this since it has always been just right for me.</li>
            <li> I no longer use shaving cream, this is the best shaving product i&#x27;ve ever bought, highly recommended. It&#x27;s awesome and small for your carry on too.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving painless. I will never use cream or gel ever again. Super slick and smells good.</li>
            <li> I have used all of the standard pharmacy shaving lubricants. This is by far the best. All you need is one little pump and your face will come away with a very close shave. This will be the only shaving oil that I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving oil by far!</li>
            <li> gave me pimples...  not impressed</li>
            <li> I have problems with razor burn, rashes, etc. This has helped reduce flare up of my skin</li>
            <li> leaves an ultra slick perfect shaving surface.........what more could you ask for..?</li>
            <li> King of Shaves makes the best shaving products. A++++</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and since I started using this I haven&#x27;t had any problems with nicks, cuts, bumps, or razor burn. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. I love this stuff, shaving is entirely improved by using it</li>
            <li> Stuff is excellent. Really cuts down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling verse travel shave lotion. It lasts longer. Only negative depending on the blade may make it clog faster.</li>
            <li> It works well, but when it came in the mail it had a sticker on it that said it contained chemicals known by the state of California to cause cancer!  What do they know in CA that the rest of the country doesn&#x27;t?  I never the less rubbed it on my face and it worked well, but I will probably switch to a less carcinogenic pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> I used this a pre-shave oil for wetshaving, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the horrible smell of this oil.</li>
            <li> Clogs up my razor, making it very hard to shave. Stay away. Weird sticky oily feeling when applying. Really wanted to like this because the small size is great for travel, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, I just love it, it gives you the best shaving experience, just as described, 200% recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of oils and this one is the best. Electric razor uses need this. I have been using for 10 months.</li>
            <li> Very potent and effective. I don&#x27;t use it very often, though, because I absolutely have to use sunblock on my face for health reasons with cancer, and I&#x27;m not sure if this silicon-based oil will prevent the sunblock from working well for UVA and UVB. Its advertising is a bit over the top for either legal or PC reasons, though:  it says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;never tested on humans or animals,&amp;#34; and yet it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dermatologically tested.&amp;#34;  At least it doesn&#x27;t use the Super Platitude and say that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;all natural.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Small package, great for travel or home.  Good with blade or electric. Best I have ever found. Been using for a few years.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Panasonic razor and prefer it over the usual &amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34; type products.  Smells much better.  Feels better.  Have to wet the face first.  A warm, soaking wet washrag works well for this, and allows me to wipe my face afterward.  I reapply some water during the shave with wet fingers to keep the shave a smooth experience.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!! Works exactly as advertised!!!! I am very happy with this product NOTHING works as well!! BRAVO-THE BEST-BEST BEST BEST</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a talc stick powder user before electric shaving; Kinexium is cleaner (no spilling excess powder) and provides the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  At nearly $25 it&#x27;s tad pricey, but literally one drop a day is the right amount, so it should last quite a while.  .</li>
            <li> ordered 2 of these, one works fine the other does not dispense.</li>
            <li> I have used Shave Secret with reasonable results, but still got a few ingrown hairs from it.  Once I tried this Kinexium, (I found it locally at Bed, Bath and Beyond) I was completely sold.  It has a silicone extract added to it, and it beats any other oil out there. No nicks, no burn, no ingrown hairs. Just the most smooth shaving experience ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They guys who say it clogs your razor.....well, hello..!...rinse the dang blade out moron...I rinse it after every other swipe and it cleans the blades out fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to wash with a gentle face cleanser afterwards to get the oil off my face.  If there is anything negative, it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice other oils, but overall for shaving, and especially head shaving, this is the best</li>
            <li> Not sure if this shaving oil is equal to the hand liquid soap I use, but the smell is different, I use to work in my dads auto shop at a younger age, the smell reminds me of a detergent , or some chemical  that was used there for cleaning parts, cant put my finger on it but its somewhere in an auto shop?</li>
            <li> Provides good lubrication for sensitive skin. I used King of Shaves shave gel for a long time and loved it, bought this as a pre-shave oil but when I got it I realized that it&#x27;s actually shaving oil, not pre-shave oil. You don&#x27;t need to add shaving cream or gel on top of it. I like it and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Although a little leery, I ordered this product to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being somewhat expensive per ounce, it works very, very well. With just 2 squirts (one for each side of my face) I was able to evenly spread the product around my face and neck area. Using a double-edge razor I was amazed how smoothly the razor glided on my skin. I did a three-pass shave and the oil maintained a nice coat and kept the blade gliding smoothly over my face. After the shave, I rinsed slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kinexium Oil allowed me to have the closest shave I have ever experienced from a DE razor. I think all the other shaving stuff is going to have to find a new home. If I am able to obtain consistant results from this product, the shave brush, shave soap, mixing mug and aftershave products are goners. This cut down my shave time to just a few minutes. I would spend more time mixing and lathering my shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest you give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-28-12:&lt;br /&gt;I have read a few online comments regarding this products &#x27;oilyness&#x27; and how it leaves a film on sink which may be difficult to rinse. Well, in my experience, although the product does leave a oily film it is not difficult to clean with a sponge and some soap or any product you use to clean your sink on a regular basis. It usually takes me about 4-5 seconds to clean and rinse the oily residue. The only problem I might see is the longterm buildup of the product and small hair inside the drain pipe. This should be easily resolved using standard drain products however, I have not experienced any clogging as of yet so I can not comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it interesting though, that many of the comments regarding the Kinexium Shaving Oil leaving a film on the sink and how time-consuming it is to clean are made by individuals that spend about 3-5 minutes preparing their shave soap lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the instructions of the product suggest 2 squirts on your handsto then be spread on the face. I find that 2 squirts are usually not enough for thorough coverage. Forget about it if you have a decent amount of growth; use some clippers to remove most of the beard first, then shave as usual. I use 3 squirts, one for each side of my face and one for the neck area. This may be overkill for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this product still deserves serious consideration from anyone looking for a quick smooth shave without irritation. Kinexium Shaving Oil makes shaving tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have a small plastic bottle of \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; \\&quot;K-Series Formula Alpha Super-cooled Menthol\\&quot; shaving oil that came with an old Braun electric shaver purchased over twelve years ago. At that time I was a brush cup and safety razor man, and was unfamiliar with \\&quot;Shaving Oil\\&quot;. I thought it was for lubricating the electric razor (which is what it does between the blades and foil as you shave). I stuck it in the medicine closet shelf and forgot about it until 17 January 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About three months ago I became interested in shaving oil, in part listening to Stu Burguiere of \\&quot;The Blaze\\&quot; advertise [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q Shave Secret]]. I ended up purchasing two shaving oils: [[ASIN:B004ZBS4U8 Somersets Original English Shaving Oil]] at Walgreens and Shave Secret at Walmart. My wife doesn&#x27;t care for Shave Secret because it reminds her of Old Spice. The Somersets does have a pronounced tea tree smell, which is less objectionable to my wife - But she still isn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, As I rummaged around my medicine cabinet yesterday (man speak for \\&quot;reach for something in back while knocking everything else out of the cabinet\\&quot;), out fell the 12+ year old bottle of \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; - I though I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as I did my other shaving oils, but the smell reminded me of linseed oil. I asked my wife to see if she liked the smell - AND she DID! Ugh! What to do? I think the only solution is to buy a new bottle, secretly throw the old bottle away, and request a retest. I am starting with a neutral rating plus one star because my wife liked it and pray she wasn&#x27;t being ornery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation to come soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 February 2015&lt;br /&gt;Well the order never showed up, so the evaluation is now a neutral three stars: It&#x27;s hard to tell who is responsible for the loss, Amazon, USPS? But Amazon Prime has now made this purchase an add-on. I reckon others also lost theirs in shipment. Reordering and will advise. If it is lost again, I will one-star the item just based on delivery reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26 February 2015&lt;br /&gt;I received the King of Shaves shaving oil - thanks to the add-on feature change regarding shipping. Now to conclude my evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good shaving oil - It was prudent not to base a judgment on 12+ year old product. The smell is similar to Somersets Original English, but not as intense. The pump action is _not_ an atomizer; rather it dispenses a gloplet (equivalent to 3-4 drops) of shaving oil per push of the button. My wife&#x27;s opinion is ho-hum at best - SO, I will choose what I like and what feels best. NOTE that my evaluation is __my__ humble opinion (except for any evaluation marked with an &#x27;*&#x27; - which means use common sense!). I also use the excellent [[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5]] for shaving - Your choice of shaver might influence your choice of shaving oil - In my case, I noticed no difference in the effectiveness of the shaver. I will rank these oils as first, second, and third - sorry, there are no participation trophies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my evaluation/comparison of [[ASIN:B000FX88XS King of Shaves]], [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q Shave Secret]], and [[ASIN:B004ZBS4U8 Somersets Original English]] shaving oils:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works best when following directions:*** All three&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most pleasant smell: Somersets, King of Shaves, Shave Secret&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best beard conditioner (most astringent): Shave Secret, Somersets, King of Shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Buy (as of 2/26/15): King of Shaves (35¢/ml), Shave Secret (37¢/ml), Somersets (66¢/ml)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser Control (per drop): Somersets, Shave Secret, King of Shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I prefer the Somersets, I have all three and will continue to use all three until gone.
