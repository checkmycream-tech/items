    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best product ever.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m very happy that I</li>
            <li>Practice would make perfect.  </li>
            <li>I applied them 3 days ago, and they still look great!</li>
            <li>So I thought this would be awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li>They are still perfect.  </li>
            <li>and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>My nails look perfect and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>This is actually a very good product to get a perfect or almost perfect result to your nails.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, here&#x27;s what I think is the BEST THING about these strips: Even after I remove them, my nails are amazingly stronger!</li>
            <li>I was so astonished at how beautiful my nail looked that I ran to email a friend.    </li>
            <li>This helps greatly with adhesion.  </li>
            <li>There is a variety of sizes to choose from and the colors are great.</li>
            <li>but if you follow the instructions they are great.</li>
            <li>and they still look great.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to apply these and when I was done they looked great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been polishing my nails for years and years and this looked like a great idea....</li>
            <li>I found this product to be great.  </li>
            <li>I bought 4 since Avon has great products..</li>
            <li>You WILL NOT have nice nails in the end!</li>
            <li>However, having figured out how best to make this work, I now feel a lot better about it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth a try !!!!</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly.    </li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>They might be good for a rush job or to pack if you&#x27;re travelling somewhere, though.</li>
            <li>If you want it to look good, it&#x27;s just as time-consuming.</li>
            <li>and I am good at putting things on face and nails.</li>
            <li>not so good.  </li>
            <li>When I was done, I had the most beautifully polished nails EVER.  </li>
            <li>Because this makes the product more affordable...5 stars!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love them, I thought they would be the newest craze!</li>
            <li>How ingenious!</li>
            <li>Not to sound like a dork, but I stared at my nails all day!!    </li>
            <li>I just ordered a bunch more and intend to do my toes, too!</li>
            <li>ordered some more for me and her!  </li>
            <li>This really is the best product ever, and if Avon has discontinued this product I hope someone else comes out with it.</li>
            <li>(and the strips do file away nicely.)</li>
            <li>&quot; She couldn&#x27;t believe how nice they looked.  </li>
            <li>They looked good for about a week, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I found it stays perfect looking much longer than liquid nail polish and not chip so easily, as the product claims.  </li>
            <li>I love this love this love this!</li>
            <li>In summary, I love, love, love these!  </li>
            <li>These were even better than a professional manicure, because the area around the cuticle came out more even and perfect than a person could paint, no matter their skill level.</li>
            <li>It sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that as your nail grows, the edge of the strip will become more noticeable and a ragged edge won&#x27;t be attractive.</li>
            <li>And my nails stayed looking good for a week and a half, which I think is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You start by tearing off a piece of an appropriate nail size to use.</li>
            <li>For example, the Pearl color was more of a milky translucent shade</li>
            <li>will be sure to be more cautious with furture purchases I make with Avon.</li>
            <li>I wonder if 2 strips can be layered for a more opaque result.</li>
            <li>Any amount of overlap on the cuticles is OK, but all the nail must be covered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hooked and plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I guess if you compare this to a salon manicure, then it might seem more cost-effective.</li>
            <li>your money on a better product, ladies.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t pull correctly you&#x27;re bound to peel off more that intended.</li>
            <li>I was playing around with them and was able to peel them off before hardening, but not after.</li>
            <li>To be on the safe side, I would wait 20 minutes before playing footsie with anyone.</li>
            <li>This adheres the polish better and gets rid of any bubbles.</li>
            <li>These are totally fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I just went to the Avon site and bought 8 more sets while they are still on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love make up</li>
            <li>Trimming the 3 sides takes most of the time.  </li>
            <li>have three more sets and I will use them, but I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase more sets.  </li>
            <li>My nails look as good as they did the first day that I applied them.</li>
            <li>I like an opaque rosy coral for my toes as it goes with warm and cool colors.</li>
            <li>When I first saw all the strips, I laughed at the size of the biggest one.  </li>
            <li>These are actually kind of cool.</li>
            <li>Have fun!!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;But, once on, it was on, and looked perfect and dry!  </li>
            <li>To say this was my first try, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try this, but I&#x27;m sure you could trim the strip to fit your nail at the bed and sides at this point.</li>
            <li>I took mine out of a sealed package and they were soft and stuck to the nail great.</li>
            <li>I prepared my nails as directed, making sure to buff them smooth with a buffing tool.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m going to buy them cheaply on eBay, rather than paying a lot more to get them from Avon.  </li>
            <li>First you need to have well groomed cuticles, but this is a given for most people who want a nicely manicured look anyway.</li>
            <li>I lightly buffed my nails so the surface was better to stick to.</li>
            <li>They also seem to be more forgiving (just smooth out any mistakes, bumps, lumps, or bubbles with that cuticle pusher . . .</li>
            <li>have found that the sizes are more then adequate for most women&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>I tried using other implements, but this worked best for me.</li>
            <li>And it is so cool!</li>
            <li>The best thing about them is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry!!!</li>
            <li>Trimming the length is easy.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t cut easily.</li>
            <li>The nail strips are easy to apply and the sizes are fine.</li>
            <li>The nail polish strip will break off easily when you smooth the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they were fine.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have problems using my non-dominant hand to position the strips, but I did fine.      </li>
            <li>These are NOT that sticky, so it&#x27;s easy to smooth them out in a couple of strokes.  </li>
            <li>One thing I did find is that it looks much better if you make sure your cuticles are cleaned up and smooth first..</li>
            <li>and I found they fit just fine.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a huge product</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry if you get air bubbles because you can smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>With whatever finger is available, press at the nailbed to seat it.</li>
            <li>&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit some of my nails, so I used the excess pieces for a couple of my nails because I needed the width.  </li>
            <li>so you can fit them to your nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to push out any creases when applying so they harden correctly.  </li>
            <li>Bubbles won&#x27;t smooth out?  </li>
            <li>Since this isn&#x27;t a liquid polish, these strips will not \\&quot;fill in\\&quot; ridges or smooth out the nail itself.</li>
            <li>had no problem with fit.</li>
            <li>I had to use scissors to trim the enamel to fit my finger nails.</li>
            <li>but you can buff it off lightly with a pumice stone or use nail polish remover if that happens.</li>
            <li>They dont fit and dont stick at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can stretch them a bit wider to fit the width of your nails.  </li>
            <li>I dampened my finger with water and then just rubbed the strip back and forth a bit to make sure I had good contact with the nail, sort of like smoothing out wallpaper.</li>
            <li>Your nails have to be clean and free of any lotion or oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure your nails are smooth and clean, align one edge, and smooth over the whole nail.  </li>
            <li>They had not chipped, but the new growth did not look nice.  </li>
            <li>I ran my finger over the tip and the excess polish broke cleanly away.  </li>
            <li>Do a quick buff to smooth your nails out</li>
            <li>do take some time to apply (if you want them to look good) and I recommend using a metal cuticle pusher or something similar so that you can lightly smooth over the strip once applied to the nail.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so flimsy they are hard to get aligned perfectly to your cuticle.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive a free set of the strips when they first sent them out to reps.  </li>
            <li>nice thing is that you can pretty much do whatever you need to do immediately after without worrying about smudging the polish, but for the price (2 sets for $9.00 is what I paid online)</li>
            <li>And it should be able to be done at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>but ya know, there are spares and surprisingly after that I was able to do all 10 nails without another problem, and actually did them fast.</li>
            <li>First let me say that the idea behind these is wonderful, and the color I bought (Berry Fast) is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using these since I love to have my nails polished but dont&#x27; have the time to polish them  often.</li>
            <li>The good news is that I only used 6 of the 16 for all 10 toes!  </li>
            <li>I tried them yestarday and the concept is cool, but as with anything I think there is a learning curve.  </li>
            <li>The advertising claims it&#x27;s easy to apply - and it might be IF your fingernails are the exact width and size of the product.</li>
            <li>The strips were easy enough to apply but takes a bit of time to figure out which size to use on which nail and more time to align it so it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>One or two nails look fine, but the rest are not so hot.</li>
            <li>You can apply them quickly and away you go.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, but after the first 2 nails were done I was hooked.</li>
            <li>liked the result very much, although it didn&#x27;t really save time on the first try.  </li>
            <li>For me it is worth the cost to have a few weeks of freedom from applying and removing and redoing nail polish, and best of all, my nails have not broken split or peeled.</li>
            <li>And very very shiny!  </li>
            <li>I received these today and first of all one size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to lift and reposition if you don&#x27;t get it exactly right the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to have cuticles pushed back and nails very clean and free from oil before applying the strips.</li>
            <li>and I love to try new things and prodcuts.  </li>
            <li>My result is really good looking nails that I didn&#x27;t have to wait to dry.</li>
            <li>They are fast and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>As for me, I can&#x27;t say enough about how I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>They came off easily, more easily than regular polish, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Hold at the nailbed with an adjacent finger and gently stretch the strip and smooth from nailbed to tip with a DAMP finger.</li>
            <li>Then smooth over the whole nail, pressing into the cuticle all around.</li>
            <li>But since my first manicure with these nail strips still look good after a week, I don&#x27;t know how long I will have to wait.    </li>
            <li>I found that if after application you apply a clear top coat the manicure lasts even longer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I like most of the available colors and the couple of samples I tried did not apply as the same color as it appeared before separating the color layer.</li>
            <li>I did find an off white that I liked and that is what I bought.</li>
            <li>gives a more professional look.  </li>
            <li>Make sure cuticles are smooth and pushed back.</li>
            <li>Although I am not a huge fan of the color she sent (Magic Mauve - I thought I would love it because it looked darker in the package), I am now a HUGE fan of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>One user reported that the product needs time to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, and she&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>It stayed sticky with each try until I got it right...</li>
            <li>If applied just right</li>
            <li>The size is mostly right.  </li>
            <li>I found that the product stretched nicely, and broke right where I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the color, Twinkling Pink, sort of a very light, shell pink color that was very pretty.</li>
            <li>After you smooth it down you fold it over the nail at the tip and smooth the edges by lightly running your nail or cuticle</li>
            <li>It gives a shiny, professional looking finish quickly!</li>
            <li>It gave a very professional look and it was fun to use!  </li>
            <li>Nailpolish -- even a salon manicure -- doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or two on me before it starts chipping and flaking.</li>
            <li>I misalligned the first one and thought uh,</li>
            <li>My nails are longer than I&#x27;ve ever been able to keep them; in fact I&#x27;ve filed them back twice already</li>
            <li>though I am all thumbs when it comes to nail polish, and I never fail to get nail polish on my fingers....</li>
            <li>The nail strips covered more of my nail than I could with the brush from regular polish.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say this was an interesting experiment.</li>
            <li>(I did my Mom&#x27;s nails first) and you can expect your dominant hand to take longer to do.</li>
            <li>My first set started to wear away at the tips after 10 days, which is more than I ever get from a regular manicure.  </li>
            <li>I found that it is IMPERATIVE that you wipe your nails with an acetone nailpolish first, to remove all trace of dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li>The first nail I did was my pinky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really puzzled!    </li>
            <li>I think if you try these strips, you will like them every bit as much as I do!</li>
            <li>The amount time it took me to put the strips on (for the first time) is about the same as putting on liquid nail polish, but much better result.  </li>
            <li>The first nail I did was my thumb nail</li>
            <li>You will end up with some product overhang on the sides of your nails, but if you gently run your nail along the edge of your nail to create a perforation, the excess product breaks right off.  </li>
            <li>and it came out beautifully, the other ten fingers .....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy busy gal and while I&#x27;d love to keep a weekly nail appointment, it just doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>When she first told me about them, I thought, for certain, that something like that could never</li>
            <li>The first time I used these I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much</li>
            <li>The best thing is that the colors are very opaque and even, whereas with regular bottle polish you&#x27;d have to apply at least 3 coats to get that effect.</li>
            <li>You get better control because the strip is very long.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats waiting for polish to dry...</li>
            <li>So, the real question is, are you willing to pay $8.00 (the regular price when not on sale) for a ONE-TIME (this is important to know) application?</li>
            <li>I bought the instant manicure strips because I love any new and technological beauty products.  </li>
            <li>And the Pink is just a very light tinge of Pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this manicure would last for a week or two, $8 would be fine.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out the new \\&quot;instant Manicure.\\</li>
            <li>Just like it took you some practice to get nail polish to look nice, you may need a little practice for these.  </li>
            <li>most satisfying thing about the new product was that i could peel it off (sorry to those people that tried to remove with the nail polish remover), much like the cheap versions of polish my mother used to buy me as a child.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a fun thing to try but considering the price (even on sale) for a single use, it&#x27;s more of a fun novelty gift item than anything else.</li>
            <li>(My nails grow really fast.)</li>
            <li>kept them on for 4 days, but they were chipping so much and peeling away from the cuticle bed, so I decided to remove them.  </li>
            <li>- I found one that fit each of my fingernails; the application and the final result are problematic.</li>
            <li>My sister has smaller hands and they fit her, too.  </li>
            <li>I trimmed any excess just by using my nails and used a wooden orange stick to smooth out and tuck the edges.</li>
            <li>and I saw it wasn&#x27;t going on straight</li>
            <li>it really looks like you just got your nails done.</li>
            <li>LIGHTLY) than regular polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - No nail polish smell which my husband appreciated A LOT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bet these will be pulled by Avon very soon.</li>
            <li>so it covers your nail smoothly at the tip where you tear the extra off.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay and actually easier to remove the clear plastic film</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work better on acrylic or short natural nails.</li>
            <li>You can also use a nail clipper to trim the 3 sides, but the tip of the nail would be better if you just tear the excess off by pulling down and covering the edge, so it will not chip off so fast.</li>
            <li>I truly liked Avon&#x27;s Instant Manicure Dry Nail Enamel.  </li>
            <li>They lasted slightly longer than regular polish and looked really good.  </li>
            <li>Once cut down, it applies fairly easily, though it&#x27;s tricky to get it on absolutely straight.</li>
            <li>Smooth the edges carefully and press down around the edges and cuticle part to make sure the product is completely stuck, then gently pull the excess over the end of your nail and press against the tip of your nail to create a perforation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Twinkling pink is a very pale, SHEER frost, but you get perfectly even color.</li>
            <li>did notice reading through these reviews that many of the 5 star glowing reviews are all EXACT duplicates of reviews on several other web sites.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with sizes at all which I was very relieved.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You definately need to have clean dry nails to make this work.  </li>
            <li>It might have helped that I used a light color (pink).  </li>
            <li>If they last me two-weeks as some of the others wrote, then they are definitely worth the purchase....</li>
            <li>in all, for most people, I would say that the convenience of these nail strips is nearly just the same as regular polish.</li>
            <li>Application takes a little practice and patience - the first hand was a shaky but the second hand was perfect.</li>
            <li>Use your thumb or any other fingernail that is still bare (or has had a strip in place 30 minutes or more) to press into cuticle and trim as per the package instructions.</li>
            <li>The strip smooths down easily with no bubbles at all.  </li>
            <li>However, I did see several small wrinkles, despite my best efforts, and the areas around my cuticles would not smooth out.  </li>
            <li>I am currently wearing my first Avon Instant Manicure right now.  </li>
            <li>Over a period of a few hours I noticed the polish got more opaque and completely adhered to my nail just like regular polish;  it also developed a shine and hardness that wasn&#x27;t there right after application.  </li>
            <li>was very skeptical about these nails after reading user reviews, but my experience was very good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me several minutes to do my first two nails.  </li>
            <li>However, apparently I now have \\&quot;fat\\&quot; fingers (thanks Avon for giving me that image).</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I can understand the frustration some users have had with this product, as I felt the same way after my first set ended up in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>I put my second set of these on Saturday morning (as the first set I tried was a disaster-</li>
            <li>However, these may look smoother on the nails, for most people, as opposed to if they had painted their nails with ordinary polish.</li>
            <li>This is my first try with the the instant manicure</li>
            <li>You press the strip down and smooth towards the tip of the nail.  </li>
            <li>Last week I brushed some regular nail polish (similar color) on top of the strips because my nails had grown out so much and the uncolored nail bed was getting wider.</li>
            <li>then let the strip naturally fall onto the rest of the nail and then smooth the sides down.</li>
            <li>The great thing is how little time it took, no smudging wet nails while waiting for them to dry, and it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>I used one large cotton ball for all ten fingers.  </li>
            <li>Truly, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I swear my bare, natural nails become long and strong after I&#x27;ve had the Instant Manicure on.</li>
            <li>There is also a clear plastic film that covers each nail strips (that wasn&#x27;t mentioned on the package.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried applying the nail strips by leaving the clear plastic film on</li>
            <li>Remove the clear coating and then the backing of the strip.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t peel off the clear strip until I fitted them for my nails.  </li>
            <li>but somewhere near the end.</li>
            <li>Did not fit (not even a close fit)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t read all the negative reviews before I bought 2 sets of the press on nails.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why some people had such problems with these.  </li>
            <li>and they came off with no problems using regular nail polish remover pads (for real nails, not acrylic nails) &lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, though, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not a problem.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply the strips one at a time, slowly, because although some users have said you can peel them off and try again, in my experience when you do this the strip most often either tears or breaks up.  </li>
            <li>Then, you MUST roughen the entire surface of your nail with an emery - just a little, not a lot, but make sure you get down into the edges and right up to the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it goes on dry, because with nail polish I almost always mess it up before it dries.    </li>
            <li>They were not difficult to apply, although the first time I did wind up with some small \\&quot;bubbles.\\&quot;   </li>
            <li>I later got out the extras polish strips to show someone how they worked and those did not stick at all, they didn&#x27;t work right once they were in the air too long.</li>
            <li>So go slow and get it right the first time.  </li>
            <li>I understand if you have insanely small fingers they would fit.</li>
            <li>Fun to put on and peel off, but just not worth it.</li>
            <li>It took about a half and hour for me to do my Mom&#x27;s hands (and I&#x27;m pretty good at polishing her nails with traditional bottle polish) but at least they were instantly dry.</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;Instant</li>
            <li>The concept of not having to wait for your nail polish to dry is very enticing.</li>
            <li>In the time it took me to apply these, I could have given myself a much longer lasting traditional manicure.</li>
            <li>You can line up one side then smooth it to the other side and run your nail over the edge to make perforation, and then you can break off the excess carefully.  </li>
            <li>also found that I have very small finger and that most of the enamel strips were too big for my fingers.</li>
            <li>They do feel just a bit tacky when you first put them on, like real nail polish but (not near at wet) they will dry completely.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t line it up just right, you can have a mess.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pull too hard when trying to fit the strip to size or you may pull some of the polish off your nail.</li>
            <li>only wish is that the strips came in clear.</li>
            <li>I think they will last, but it&#x27;s just been 24 hours for me so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 24 hours later now and so far, no wear marks or chips.  </li>
            <li>barely so...</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;WHAT woman has a thumb nail THAT big??\\&quot;   Uh, apparently I do.  </li>
            <li>The strip came over my skin a little bit, but all I had to do was run my thumb nail along the strip that came over my skin to create a crease and the excess polish peeled right</li>
            <li>Just be careful and smooth out the bubbles as you lay down the strip on your nail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the new Instant Manicure several times already.  </li>
            <li>The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; is that my nails have grown in that time, so there is a tiny line of new growth.  </li>
            <li>However, this does NOT mean that you can jam your foot into a pair of pumps and dance the night away 10 minutes after application (not that you would hide your toes after just painting them, anyway) nor does it mean that you can get under the sheets and snooze right after application.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smudge like nail polish, so you can pick things up right away and go about your business without worry, but you still have to let them harden for a few hours</li>
            <li>Just one suggestion, before you apply, have your cuticles pushed back as far as possible, so you can slip on your strip close to the nail bed.</li>
            <li>of the problem is that my nails are natural and long.</li>
            <li>The cuticle pusher helps minimize this risk, after smoothing it over the polish while slightly pushing down (careful not to dent the polish because it will dent before it is set) to stick it to the nail better.</li>
            <li>It definitely has an advantage of not having to wait for the nail polish to try and not having problem of messing up the nails accidentally while waiting for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to using my cheap brand colors and Sally Hansen base and instant dry top coats.</li>
            <li>This moment of nostalgia was not worth the ridiculously high price of the manicure.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I do think it is a little too pricey compared to traditional polish.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the best product ever.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m very happy that I</li>
            <li> Practice would make perfect.  </li>
            <li> I applied them 3 days ago, and they still look great!</li>
            <li> So I thought this would be awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> They are still perfect.  </li>
            <li> and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li> My nails look perfect and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good product to get a perfect or almost perfect result to your nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, here&#x27;s what I think is the BEST THING about these strips: Even after I remove them, my nails are amazingly stronger!</li>
            <li> I was so astonished at how beautiful my nail looked that I ran to email a friend.    </li>
            <li> This helps greatly with adhesion.  </li>
            <li> There is a variety of sizes to choose from and the colors are great.</li>
            <li> but if you follow the instructions they are great.</li>
            <li> and they still look great.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to apply these and when I was done they looked great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been polishing my nails for years and years and this looked like a great idea....</li>
            <li> I found this product to be great.  </li>
            <li> I bought 4 since Avon has great products..</li>
            <li> You WILL NOT have nice nails in the end!</li>
            <li> However, having figured out how best to make this work, I now feel a lot better about it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth a try !!!!</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly.    </li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> They might be good for a rush job or to pack if you&#x27;re travelling somewhere, though.</li>
            <li> If you want it to look good, it&#x27;s just as time-consuming.</li>
            <li> and I am good at putting things on face and nails.</li>
            <li> not so good.  </li>
            <li> When I was done, I had the most beautifully polished nails EVER.  </li>
            <li> Because this makes the product more affordable...5 stars!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I love them, I thought they would be the newest craze!</li>
            <li> How ingenious!</li>
            <li> Not to sound like a dork, but I stared at my nails all day!!    </li>
            <li> I just ordered a bunch more and intend to do my toes, too!</li>
            <li> ordered some more for me and her!  </li>
            <li> This really is the best product ever, and if Avon has discontinued this product I hope someone else comes out with it.</li>
            <li> (and the strips do file away nicely.)</li>
            <li> &quot; She couldn&#x27;t believe how nice they looked.  </li>
            <li> They looked good for about a week, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I found it stays perfect looking much longer than liquid nail polish and not chip so easily, as the product claims.  </li>
            <li> I love this love this love this!</li>
            <li> In summary, I love, love, love these!  </li>
            <li> These were even better than a professional manicure, because the area around the cuticle came out more even and perfect than a person could paint, no matter their skill level.</li>
            <li> It sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that as your nail grows, the edge of the strip will become more noticeable and a ragged edge won&#x27;t be attractive.</li>
            <li> And my nails stayed looking good for a week and a half, which I think is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You start by tearing off a piece of an appropriate nail size to use.</li>
            <li> For example, the Pearl color was more of a milky translucent shade</li>
            <li> will be sure to be more cautious with furture purchases I make with Avon.</li>
            <li> I wonder if 2 strips can be layered for a more opaque result.</li>
            <li> Any amount of overlap on the cuticles is OK, but all the nail must be covered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked and plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I guess if you compare this to a salon manicure, then it might seem more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> your money on a better product, ladies.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t pull correctly you&#x27;re bound to peel off more that intended.</li>
            <li> I was playing around with them and was able to peel them off before hardening, but not after.</li>
            <li> To be on the safe side, I would wait 20 minutes before playing footsie with anyone.</li>
            <li> This adheres the polish better and gets rid of any bubbles.</li>
            <li> These are totally fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I just went to the Avon site and bought 8 more sets while they are still on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love make up</li>
            <li> Trimming the 3 sides takes most of the time.  </li>
            <li> have three more sets and I will use them, but I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase more sets.  </li>
            <li> My nails look as good as they did the first day that I applied them.</li>
            <li> I like an opaque rosy coral for my toes as it goes with warm and cool colors.</li>
            <li> When I first saw all the strips, I laughed at the size of the biggest one.  </li>
            <li> These are actually kind of cool.</li>
            <li> Have fun!!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;But, once on, it was on, and looked perfect and dry!  </li>
            <li> To say this was my first try, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try this, but I&#x27;m sure you could trim the strip to fit your nail at the bed and sides at this point.</li>
            <li> I took mine out of a sealed package and they were soft and stuck to the nail great.</li>
            <li> I prepared my nails as directed, making sure to buff them smooth with a buffing tool.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going to buy them cheaply on eBay, rather than paying a lot more to get them from Avon.  </li>
            <li> First you need to have well groomed cuticles, but this is a given for most people who want a nicely manicured look anyway.</li>
            <li> I lightly buffed my nails so the surface was better to stick to.</li>
            <li> They also seem to be more forgiving (just smooth out any mistakes, bumps, lumps, or bubbles with that cuticle pusher . . .</li>
            <li> have found that the sizes are more then adequate for most women&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I tried using other implements, but this worked best for me.</li>
            <li> And it is so cool!</li>
            <li> The best thing about them is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry!!!</li>
            <li> Trimming the length is easy.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t cut easily.</li>
            <li> The nail strips are easy to apply and the sizes are fine.</li>
            <li> The nail polish strip will break off easily when you smooth the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were fine.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have problems using my non-dominant hand to position the strips, but I did fine.      </li>
            <li> These are NOT that sticky, so it&#x27;s easy to smooth them out in a couple of strokes.  </li>
            <li> One thing I did find is that it looks much better if you make sure your cuticles are cleaned up and smooth first..</li>
            <li> and I found they fit just fine.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a huge product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry if you get air bubbles because you can smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> With whatever finger is available, press at the nailbed to seat it.</li>
            <li> &quot; doesn&#x27;t fit some of my nails, so I used the excess pieces for a couple of my nails because I needed the width.  </li>
            <li> so you can fit them to your nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to push out any creases when applying so they harden correctly.  </li>
            <li> Bubbles won&#x27;t smooth out?  </li>
            <li> Since this isn&#x27;t a liquid polish, these strips will not \\&quot;fill in\\&quot; ridges or smooth out the nail itself.</li>
            <li> had no problem with fit.</li>
            <li> I had to use scissors to trim the enamel to fit my finger nails.</li>
            <li> but you can buff it off lightly with a pumice stone or use nail polish remover if that happens.</li>
            <li> They dont fit and dont stick at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can stretch them a bit wider to fit the width of your nails.  </li>
            <li> I dampened my finger with water and then just rubbed the strip back and forth a bit to make sure I had good contact with the nail, sort of like smoothing out wallpaper.</li>
            <li> Your nails have to be clean and free of any lotion or oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure your nails are smooth and clean, align one edge, and smooth over the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> They had not chipped, but the new growth did not look nice.  </li>
            <li> I ran my finger over the tip and the excess polish broke cleanly away.  </li>
            <li> Do a quick buff to smooth your nails out</li>
            <li> do take some time to apply (if you want them to look good) and I recommend using a metal cuticle pusher or something similar so that you can lightly smooth over the strip once applied to the nail.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so flimsy they are hard to get aligned perfectly to your cuticle.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a free set of the strips when they first sent them out to reps.  </li>
            <li> nice thing is that you can pretty much do whatever you need to do immediately after without worrying about smudging the polish, but for the price (2 sets for $9.00 is what I paid online)</li>
            <li> And it should be able to be done at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> but ya know, there are spares and surprisingly after that I was able to do all 10 nails without another problem, and actually did them fast.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the idea behind these is wonderful, and the color I bought (Berry Fast) is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using these since I love to have my nails polished but dont&#x27; have the time to polish them  often.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I only used 6 of the 16 for all 10 toes!  </li>
            <li> I tried them yestarday and the concept is cool, but as with anything I think there is a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> The advertising claims it&#x27;s easy to apply - and it might be IF your fingernails are the exact width and size of the product.</li>
            <li> The strips were easy enough to apply but takes a bit of time to figure out which size to use on which nail and more time to align it so it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> One or two nails look fine, but the rest are not so hot.</li>
            <li> You can apply them quickly and away you go.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, but after the first 2 nails were done I was hooked.</li>
            <li> liked the result very much, although it didn&#x27;t really save time on the first try.  </li>
            <li> For me it is worth the cost to have a few weeks of freedom from applying and removing and redoing nail polish, and best of all, my nails have not broken split or peeled.</li>
            <li> And very very shiny!  </li>
            <li> I received these today and first of all one size doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to lift and reposition if you don&#x27;t get it exactly right the first time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to have cuticles pushed back and nails very clean and free from oil before applying the strips.</li>
            <li> and I love to try new things and prodcuts.  </li>
            <li> My result is really good looking nails that I didn&#x27;t have to wait to dry.</li>
            <li> They are fast and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> As for me, I can&#x27;t say enough about how I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> They came off easily, more easily than regular polish, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Hold at the nailbed with an adjacent finger and gently stretch the strip and smooth from nailbed to tip with a DAMP finger.</li>
            <li> Then smooth over the whole nail, pressing into the cuticle all around.</li>
            <li> But since my first manicure with these nail strips still look good after a week, I don&#x27;t know how long I will have to wait.    </li>
            <li> I found that if after application you apply a clear top coat the manicure lasts even longer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I like most of the available colors and the couple of samples I tried did not apply as the same color as it appeared before separating the color layer.</li>
            <li> I did find an off white that I liked and that is what I bought.</li>
            <li> gives a more professional look.  </li>
            <li> Make sure cuticles are smooth and pushed back.</li>
            <li> Although I am not a huge fan of the color she sent (Magic Mauve - I thought I would love it because it looked darker in the package), I am now a HUGE fan of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> One user reported that the product needs time to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, and she&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> It stayed sticky with each try until I got it right...</li>
            <li> If applied just right</li>
            <li> The size is mostly right.  </li>
            <li> I found that the product stretched nicely, and broke right where I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> and I loved the color, Twinkling Pink, sort of a very light, shell pink color that was very pretty.</li>
            <li> After you smooth it down you fold it over the nail at the tip and smooth the edges by lightly running your nail or cuticle</li>
            <li> It gives a shiny, professional looking finish quickly!</li>
            <li> It gave a very professional look and it was fun to use!  </li>
            <li> Nailpolish -- even a salon manicure -- doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or two on me before it starts chipping and flaking.</li>
            <li> I misalligned the first one and thought uh,</li>
            <li> My nails are longer than I&#x27;ve ever been able to keep them; in fact I&#x27;ve filed them back twice already</li>
            <li> though I am all thumbs when it comes to nail polish, and I never fail to get nail polish on my fingers....</li>
            <li> The nail strips covered more of my nail than I could with the brush from regular polish.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say this was an interesting experiment.</li>
            <li> (I did my Mom&#x27;s nails first) and you can expect your dominant hand to take longer to do.</li>
            <li> My first set started to wear away at the tips after 10 days, which is more than I ever get from a regular manicure.  </li>
            <li> I found that it is IMPERATIVE that you wipe your nails with an acetone nailpolish first, to remove all trace of dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li> The first nail I did was my pinky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really puzzled!    </li>
            <li> I think if you try these strips, you will like them every bit as much as I do!</li>
            <li> The amount time it took me to put the strips on (for the first time) is about the same as putting on liquid nail polish, but much better result.  </li>
            <li> The first nail I did was my thumb nail</li>
            <li> You will end up with some product overhang on the sides of your nails, but if you gently run your nail along the edge of your nail to create a perforation, the excess product breaks right off.  </li>
            <li> and it came out beautifully, the other ten fingers .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy busy gal and while I&#x27;d love to keep a weekly nail appointment, it just doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> When she first told me about them, I thought, for certain, that something like that could never</li>
            <li> The first time I used these I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much</li>
            <li> The best thing is that the colors are very opaque and even, whereas with regular bottle polish you&#x27;d have to apply at least 3 coats to get that effect.</li>
            <li> You get better control because the strip is very long.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats waiting for polish to dry...</li>
            <li> So, the real question is, are you willing to pay $8.00 (the regular price when not on sale) for a ONE-TIME (this is important to know) application?</li>
            <li> I bought the instant manicure strips because I love any new and technological beauty products.  </li>
            <li> And the Pink is just a very light tinge of Pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this manicure would last for a week or two, $8 would be fine.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out the new \\&quot;instant Manicure.\\</li>
            <li> Just like it took you some practice to get nail polish to look nice, you may need a little practice for these.  </li>
            <li> most satisfying thing about the new product was that i could peel it off (sorry to those people that tried to remove with the nail polish remover), much like the cheap versions of polish my mother used to buy me as a child.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a fun thing to try but considering the price (even on sale) for a single use, it&#x27;s more of a fun novelty gift item than anything else.</li>
            <li> (My nails grow really fast.)</li>
            <li> kept them on for 4 days, but they were chipping so much and peeling away from the cuticle bed, so I decided to remove them.  </li>
            <li> - I found one that fit each of my fingernails; the application and the final result are problematic.</li>
            <li> My sister has smaller hands and they fit her, too.  </li>
            <li> I trimmed any excess just by using my nails and used a wooden orange stick to smooth out and tuck the edges.</li>
            <li> and I saw it wasn&#x27;t going on straight</li>
            <li> it really looks like you just got your nails done.</li>
            <li> LIGHTLY) than regular polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - No nail polish smell which my husband appreciated A LOT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bet these will be pulled by Avon very soon.</li>
            <li> so it covers your nail smoothly at the tip where you tear the extra off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay and actually easier to remove the clear plastic film</li>
            <li> Perhaps it would work better on acrylic or short natural nails.</li>
            <li> You can also use a nail clipper to trim the 3 sides, but the tip of the nail would be better if you just tear the excess off by pulling down and covering the edge, so it will not chip off so fast.</li>
            <li> I truly liked Avon&#x27;s Instant Manicure Dry Nail Enamel.  </li>
            <li> They lasted slightly longer than regular polish and looked really good.  </li>
            <li> Once cut down, it applies fairly easily, though it&#x27;s tricky to get it on absolutely straight.</li>
            <li> Smooth the edges carefully and press down around the edges and cuticle part to make sure the product is completely stuck, then gently pull the excess over the end of your nail and press against the tip of your nail to create a perforation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Twinkling pink is a very pale, SHEER frost, but you get perfectly even color.</li>
            <li> did notice reading through these reviews that many of the 5 star glowing reviews are all EXACT duplicates of reviews on several other web sites.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with sizes at all which I was very relieved.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You definately need to have clean dry nails to make this work.  </li>
            <li> It might have helped that I used a light color (pink).  </li>
            <li> If they last me two-weeks as some of the others wrote, then they are definitely worth the purchase....</li>
            <li> in all, for most people, I would say that the convenience of these nail strips is nearly just the same as regular polish.</li>
            <li> Application takes a little practice and patience - the first hand was a shaky but the second hand was perfect.</li>
            <li> Use your thumb or any other fingernail that is still bare (or has had a strip in place 30 minutes or more) to press into cuticle and trim as per the package instructions.</li>
            <li> The strip smooths down easily with no bubbles at all.  </li>
            <li> However, I did see several small wrinkles, despite my best efforts, and the areas around my cuticles would not smooth out.  </li>
            <li> I am currently wearing my first Avon Instant Manicure right now.  </li>
            <li> Over a period of a few hours I noticed the polish got more opaque and completely adhered to my nail just like regular polish;  it also developed a shine and hardness that wasn&#x27;t there right after application.  </li>
            <li> was very skeptical about these nails after reading user reviews, but my experience was very good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me several minutes to do my first two nails.  </li>
            <li> However, apparently I now have \\&quot;fat\\&quot; fingers (thanks Avon for giving me that image).</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I can understand the frustration some users have had with this product, as I felt the same way after my first set ended up in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> I put my second set of these on Saturday morning (as the first set I tried was a disaster-</li>
            <li> However, these may look smoother on the nails, for most people, as opposed to if they had painted their nails with ordinary polish.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with the the instant manicure</li>
            <li> You press the strip down and smooth towards the tip of the nail.  </li>
            <li> Last week I brushed some regular nail polish (similar color) on top of the strips because my nails had grown out so much and the uncolored nail bed was getting wider.</li>
            <li> then let the strip naturally fall onto the rest of the nail and then smooth the sides down.</li>
            <li> The great thing is how little time it took, no smudging wet nails while waiting for them to dry, and it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I used one large cotton ball for all ten fingers.  </li>
            <li> Truly, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I swear my bare, natural nails become long and strong after I&#x27;ve had the Instant Manicure on.</li>
            <li> There is also a clear plastic film that covers each nail strips (that wasn&#x27;t mentioned on the package.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying the nail strips by leaving the clear plastic film on</li>
            <li> Remove the clear coating and then the backing of the strip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t peel off the clear strip until I fitted them for my nails.  </li>
            <li> but somewhere near the end.</li>
            <li> Did not fit (not even a close fit)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t read all the negative reviews before I bought 2 sets of the press on nails.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why some people had such problems with these.  </li>
            <li> and they came off with no problems using regular nail polish remover pads (for real nails, not acrylic nails) &lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, though, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not a problem.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply the strips one at a time, slowly, because although some users have said you can peel them off and try again, in my experience when you do this the strip most often either tears or breaks up.  </li>
            <li> Then, you MUST roughen the entire surface of your nail with an emery - just a little, not a lot, but make sure you get down into the edges and right up to the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> And I love that it goes on dry, because with nail polish I almost always mess it up before it dries.    </li>
            <li> They were not difficult to apply, although the first time I did wind up with some small \\&quot;bubbles.\\&quot;   </li>
            <li> I later got out the extras polish strips to show someone how they worked and those did not stick at all, they didn&#x27;t work right once they were in the air too long.</li>
            <li> So go slow and get it right the first time.  </li>
            <li> I understand if you have insanely small fingers they would fit.</li>
            <li> Fun to put on and peel off, but just not worth it.</li>
            <li> It took about a half and hour for me to do my Mom&#x27;s hands (and I&#x27;m pretty good at polishing her nails with traditional bottle polish) but at least they were instantly dry.</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Instant</li>
            <li> The concept of not having to wait for your nail polish to dry is very enticing.</li>
            <li> In the time it took me to apply these, I could have given myself a much longer lasting traditional manicure.</li>
            <li> You can line up one side then smooth it to the other side and run your nail over the edge to make perforation, and then you can break off the excess carefully.  </li>
            <li> also found that I have very small finger and that most of the enamel strips were too big for my fingers.</li>
            <li> They do feel just a bit tacky when you first put them on, like real nail polish but (not near at wet) they will dry completely.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t line it up just right, you can have a mess.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pull too hard when trying to fit the strip to size or you may pull some of the polish off your nail.</li>
            <li> only wish is that the strips came in clear.</li>
            <li> I think they will last, but it&#x27;s just been 24 hours for me so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 24 hours later now and so far, no wear marks or chips.  </li>
            <li> barely so...</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;WHAT woman has a thumb nail THAT big??\\&quot;   Uh, apparently I do.  </li>
            <li> The strip came over my skin a little bit, but all I had to do was run my thumb nail along the strip that came over my skin to create a crease and the excess polish peeled right</li>
            <li> Just be careful and smooth out the bubbles as you lay down the strip on your nail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the new Instant Manicure several times already.  </li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; is that my nails have grown in that time, so there is a tiny line of new growth.  </li>
            <li> However, this does NOT mean that you can jam your foot into a pair of pumps and dance the night away 10 minutes after application (not that you would hide your toes after just painting them, anyway) nor does it mean that you can get under the sheets and snooze right after application.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smudge like nail polish, so you can pick things up right away and go about your business without worry, but you still have to let them harden for a few hours</li>
            <li> Just one suggestion, before you apply, have your cuticles pushed back as far as possible, so you can slip on your strip close to the nail bed.</li>
            <li> of the problem is that my nails are natural and long.</li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher helps minimize this risk, after smoothing it over the polish while slightly pushing down (careful not to dent the polish because it will dent before it is set) to stick it to the nail better.</li>
            <li> It definitely has an advantage of not having to wait for the nail polish to try and not having problem of messing up the nails accidentally while waiting for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to using my cheap brand colors and Sally Hansen base and instant dry top coats.</li>
            <li> This moment of nostalgia was not worth the ridiculously high price of the manicure.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I do think it is a little too pricey compared to traditional polish.  </li>
            <li> The strip would naturally tear over the sharp edge of my nail.</li>
            <li> I figured the next test would be how long they would last.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get it on staight with the first try, don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> purchased these because my toddler enjoys poking at my freshly polished nails (no good).</li>
            <li> They last extremely long.</li>
            <li> My nails are relatively short, but the strips are quite long.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t last long on my nails either.  </li>
            <li> Technically it might, but your nails wouldn&#x27;t look good with big strips of unpolished nail at the base.    </li>
            <li> That way it will take a little longer before the new growth begins to show.</li>
            <li> My friend sent me a set of these Avon Instant Manicure Dry Enamel Nail Strips.  </li>
            <li> The Instant Manicure Dry Enamel Strips were no differnt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And if the strip is bigger than your nail, don&#x27;t worry because if you run a cuticle wand (or just run along the edge with your other nails), the extra polish comes off the skin leaving the nail polish intact on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have found that Avon&#x27;s speed dry nail polish works like a charm, is easier to apply and takes a very short time to dry.</li>
            <li> hard to get the enamel on straight and without causing ripples in the enamel itself when applying it to one&#x27;s finger nails.  </li>
            <li> The product is a bit tough to use, and I destroyed my first set trying to figure out how to do it properly.  </li>
            <li> I just placed them on the center of the back part of my nail</li>
            <li> I will keep buying these as long as I can.</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t center it correctly there&#x27;s no way of peeling it off and starting over.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what someone would be doing all that time, or why they would persist that long if they were having problems.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a little bummed now that she can&#x27;t mess them up much.</li>
            <li> For people like me, whose nails are not perfectly round or smooth, it is impossible to get an even coating of liquid nail polish.  </li>
            <li> You can stick it on the next nail and then go back to trim the previous nail.  </li>
            <li> And total application time, including wiping and roughening, was about half an hour for all ten nails.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tricky to get on, and even trickier to complete the application - once they&#x27;re on your nails, getting the perforation on the end of your nail and removing the excess is not easy.</li>
            <li> I have never had any manicure last even close to this long!!!!  </li>
            <li> with Avon Instant Manicure, I can go one or even two weeks before they start looking shabby -- and that&#x27;s mainly due to the line at the bottom where my nails have grown out.</li>
            <li> All the strips that remained after doing my other four fingers were too big for my nail.  </li>
            <li> Also, the instructions say that once the strip package is opened, the strips will dry out (it&#x27;s still nail polish, after all)</li>
            <li> The polish may seem dry but it needs time to set and to adhere to your nail.</li>
            <li> that you don&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry.   </li>
            <li> the nails had time to dry and set (if it would make any difference).</li>
            <li> I just wish they had a larger variety of sizes because I had to work with a few fingers as they were larger than my fingernails.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a single chip.  </li>
            <li> Overall, my impression is it was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Which means in the long run it is really no shorter period of time to polish your nail and spray them with enamel spray.  </li>
            <li> Doing thumbs last, hold the strip over a nail and set down at the nail bed.</li>
            <li> I only wish the price were a bit less.</li>
            <li> And,I had a different experience that a previous reviewer:  if you let them dry/harden, they don&#x27;t peel off.</li>
            <li> only wish the price was better:(</li>
            <li> The strips are about twice as thick as saran wrap, slightly stretchy and very manageable during the application process.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you have to individually cut down the width of each \\&quot;fingernail polish\\&quot; to apply to your fingernail (that takes a lot of time!).</li>
            <li> I purchased one in Pearl and one in Pink to try.</li>
            <li> but I simply indented the sides of the polish and once dried</li>
            <li> The next day I trimmed a few on my cuticle with my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about changing my polish in a few days simply because this manicure is growing out.  </li>
            <li> Some people loved them, some people hated them.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not the polish&#x27;s fault,</li>
            <li> The worst part is that the strips do not last as long as regular polish with a top coat applied over it.</li>
            <li> This product took at least ten times as long to apply as liquid nail polish and lastest no longer - it started chipping off within two hours of application!</li>
            <li> The colors are not exactly like the colors on the chart.</li>
            <li> The other fingers took about 30 seconds each to do.  </li>
            <li> However, 24 hours later there were small cracks all over the surface that attracted dirt.</li>
            <li> but that is pretty expensive for a one day use product.  </li>
            <li> In response to what other people&#x27;s comments: &lt;</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to pull the strip too taut when you are placing the strip down or you may tear or break</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found it hard to get even color with sheer polishes.</li>
            <li> So when this came out, I was skeptical whether it really works.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries to get the strip against the base of my nail--but if you hold it near the bottom, rather than the end of the strip, it is much easier to contol.  </li>
            <li> I lined the curved edge of the strip at the base of my nail, making sure it is beneath my cuticle a bit, then pulling the strip out and down over the edge of my nail was all it took.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little tricky to apply, especially the first time, but it&#x27;s no more difficult than using those  little brushes and painting in the lines!  </li>
            <li> half price</li>
            <li> It lasted less than a week before chips and cracks occurred and the some of the edges peeled up.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best product ever. I heard that Avon has discontinued it and am greatly disappointed. I hope another manufacturer will take up where Avon left off.    The nail strips are easy to apply and the sizes are fine. They last extremely long. I applied them over a week ago and I have no chips. My nails look as good as they did the first day that I applied them. With nail polish I usually have chips in two days. And I love that it goes on dry, because with nail polish I almost always mess it up before it dries.    I can hardly wait to try another color. But since my first manicure with these nail strips still look good after a week, I don&#x27;t know how long I will have to wait.    ...It is three weeks later and I finally got to apply the instant nails again. I found that if after application you apply a clear top coat the manicure lasts even longer. This really is the best product ever, and if Avon has discontinued this product I hope someone else comes out with it. After all it is just a thin film of plastic with an adhesive backing. How hard can it be? And it should be able to be done at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; nails. They peel and split so badly, I&#x27;d given up trying to grow my nails to any length at all. Nailpolish -- even a salon manicure -- doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or two on me before it starts chipping and flaking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with Avon Instant Manicure, I can go one or even two weeks before they start looking shabby -- and that&#x27;s mainly due to the line at the bottom where my nails have grown out. (My nails grow really fast.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, here&#x27;s what I think is the BEST THING about these strips: Even after I remove them, my nails are amazingly stronger! Truly, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I swear my bare, natural nails become long and strong after I&#x27;ve had the Instant Manicure on. This side effect lasts for weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the strips came in clear.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of packages months ago, and finally decided to try them THREE weeks ago. I misalligned the first one and thought uh, oh..but ya know, there are spares and surprisingly after that I was able to do all 10 nails without another problem, and actually did them fast. I can&#x27;t say I like most of the available colors and the couple of samples I tried did not apply as the same color as it appeared before separating the color layer. I did find an off white that I liked and that is what I bought. I type and do housework and mine did NOT chip, or rather HAS NOT chipped after wearing the strips 22 days and still counting. Last week I brushed some regular nail polish (similar color) on top of the strips because my nails had grown out so much and the uncolored nail bed was getting wider. I am taking the time to offer this review only because I saw some low-star reviews. As for me, I can&#x27;t say enough about how I love this stuff! My nails are longer than I&#x27;ve ever been able to keep them; in fact I&#x27;ve filed them back twice already (and the strips do file away nicely.) Just one suggestion, before you apply, have your cuticles pushed back as far as possible, so you can slip on your strip close to the nail bed. That way it will take a little longer before the new growth begins to show. I love this love this love this! In this case, don&#x27;t decide against trying this product based on someone&#x27;s bad experience. For me it is worth the cost to have a few weeks of freedom from applying and removing and redoing nail polish, and best of all, my nails have not broken split or peeled. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am a messy, hopeless person when it comes to nail polish. So when this came out, I was skeptical whether it really works.  It sounded too good to be true.  I was also concerned about the size issue.  What if the nail strips were bigger than my nails?  I purchased one in Pearl and one in Pink to try. And I&#x27;m very happy that I did!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail strips comes in an air-sealed package with two sheets of 8 nail strips of different sizes.  I had no trouble with sizes at all which I was very relieved.  When you open the package, you immediately smell a nail polish scent.  I followed the tip on the package to apply the strips to my thumb last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You start by tearing off a piece of an appropriate nail size to use. You then remove the sticker strip by lifting it off at the silver tab.  There is also a clear plastic film that covers each nail strips (that wasn&#x27;t mentioned on the package.)  I&#x27;ve tried applying the nail strips by leaving the clear plastic film on but it&#x27;s okay and actually easier to remove the clear plastic film first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You place the strips where your cuticle begins but without going beyond the skin.  You press the strip down and smooth towards the tip of the nail.  Don&#x27;t worry if you get air bubbles because you can smooth it out.  Just be careful not to pull the strip too taut when you are placing the strip down or you may tear or break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if the strip is bigger than your nail, don&#x27;t worry because if you run a cuticle wand (or just run along the edge with your other nails), the extra polish comes off the skin leaving the nail polish intact on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it easier to actually hold the strip not at the end but somewhere near the end. You get better control because the strip is very long.  After you smooth it down you fold it over the nail at the tip and smooth the edges by lightly running your nail or cuticle wand under it. The nail polish strip will break off easily when you smooth the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me several minutes to do my first two nails.  But from my third nail on, it took me only about 5 seconds each to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the color chart.  The colors are not exactly like the colors on the chart. For example, the Pearl color was more of a milky translucent shade then the beige color it is showing.  And the Pink is just a very light tinge of Pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am all thumbs when it comes to nail polish, and I never fail to get nail polish on my fingers....I used this without problems at all! It gave a very professional look and it was fun to use!  I will definitely purchase this product again and I will be getting it for my girlfriends to try!</li>
            <li> Today I recieved my Instant Manicure (got them on sale, half price so I purchased two sets). To say this was my first try, I am very pleased with the outcome. The nail strips covered more of my nail than I could with the brush from regular polish. I did get some of the strip on my skin around the nail but I simply indented the sides of the polish and once dried, it simply peeled away. My result is really good looking nails that I didn&#x27;t have to wait to dry. I only rated these a four because they were a bit tricky and a little frustrating trying to get them just right. If they last me two-weeks as some of the others wrote, then they are definitely worth the purchase....</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out the new \\&quot;instant Manicure.\\&quot; I was so committed to my faith in the Avon brand, that I actually ordered two, naively believing that a company like Avon would not put their name behind a product unless it was tested and passed with flying colors. I was sadly mistaken. The new \\&quot;Instant Manicure\\&quot; is a joke. There were several problems with the manicure, listed below: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Did not fit (not even a close fit) I understand if you have insanely small fingers they would fit. However, apparently I now have \\&quot;fat\\&quot; fingers (thanks Avon for giving me that image). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Chipped within 2 hours of applying, despite the promise that an \\&quot;anti-chip\\&quot; polish was used. Literally they started to chip when I applied them. This was ridiculous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Within 24 hours began to peel (literally peel off of my nail). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The most satisfying thing about the new product was that i could peel it off (sorry to those people that tried to remove with the nail polish remover), much like the cheap versions of polish my mother used to buy me as a child. This moment of nostalgia was not worth the ridiculously high price of the manicure.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THESE! They are a waste of money! Fun to put on and peel off, but just not worth it. You WILL NOT have nice nails in the end! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to be more cautious with furture purchases I make with Avon.</li>
            <li> Please note that my wife is doing this review! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;OK...I did hands and feet with a few strips to spare. My nails are relatively short, but the strips are quite long. Because this makes the product more affordable...5 stars!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Twinkling pink is a very pale, SHEER frost, but you get perfectly even color. I&#x27;ve always found it hard to get even color with sheer polishes. I wonder if 2 strips can be layered for a more opaque result. The strips are about twice as thick as saran wrap, slightly stretchy and very manageable during the application process. It&#x27;s important to have cuticles pushed back and nails very clean and free from oil before applying the strips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some tips: &lt;br /&gt;1. Tear off a strip and choose a nail that it will cover entirely. I used the largest strip sideways for my big toes. I didn&#x27;t try this, but I&#x27;m sure you could trim the strip to fit your nail at the bed and sides at this point. &lt;br /&gt;2. Remove the clear coating and then the backing of the strip. &lt;br /&gt;3. Doing thumbs last, hold the strip over a nail and set down at the nail bed. Any amount of overlap on the cuticles is OK, but all the nail must be covered. &lt;br /&gt;4. With whatever finger is available, press at the nailbed to seat it. You can remove and try again if things are crooked. &lt;br /&gt;5. Hold at the nailbed with an adjacent finger and gently stretch the strip and smooth from nailbed to tip with a DAMP finger. &lt;br /&gt;6. Then smooth over the whole nail, pressing into the cuticle all around. &lt;br /&gt;7. If you plan to use the excess at the tip on another nail, cut with small scissors and don&#x27;t let it stick to itself. You can stick it on the next nail and then go back to trim the previous nail.  &lt;br /&gt;8. Use your thumb or any other fingernail that is still bare (or has had a strip in place 30 minutes or more) to press into cuticle and trim as per the package instructions. I tried using other implements, but this worked best for me. The next day I trimmed a few on my cuticle with my nails. Be aware that as your nail grows, the edge of the strip will become more noticeable and a ragged edge won&#x27;t be attractive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked and plan to order more. I hope that Avon will increase the color choices. I like an opaque rosy coral for my toes as it goes with warm and cool colors. I think they will last, but it&#x27;s just been 24 hours for me so far. Have fun!!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product took at least ten times as long to apply as liquid nail polish and lastest no longer - it started chipping off within two hours of application! The advertising claims it&#x27;s easy to apply - and it might be IF your fingernails are the exact width and size of the product. Otherwise, you have to individually cut down the width of each \\&quot;fingernail polish\\&quot; to apply to your fingernail (that takes a lot of time!). Once cut down, it applies fairly easily, though it&#x27;s tricky to get it on absolutely straight. Trimming the length is easy. I returned this product for a refund. If I could give this zero stars I would. Bad product and total waste of time.</li>
            <li> I am currently wearing my first Avon Instant Manicure right now.  I applied it 10 days ago and I only have 1 tiny chip (which I got yesterday).  I have never had any manicure last even close to this long!!!!  I&#x27;m thinking about changing my polish in a few days simply because this manicure is growing out.  I really like this product, but I do think it is a little too pricey compared to traditional polish.  I guess if you compare this to a salon manicure, then it might seem more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive a free set of the strips when they first sent them out to reps.  My rep doesn&#x27;t do her nails, so she gave me her set to try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Applying them wasn&#x27;t too horrible.  Practice would make perfect.  However, I did see several small wrinkles, despite my best efforts, and the areas around my cuticles would not smooth out.  And by the next morning, the tips were already chipping off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I kept them on for 4 days, but they were chipping so much and peeling away from the cuticle bed, so I decided to remove them.  WOW!  What a pain!  It took 4 cotton pads soaked in remover to get them off.  I, too, had a gummy residue left over, so I ended up using a buffing block to remove the remaining product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I told my rep about it, and she called the company.  They said they&#x27;d had numerous complaints, so they were probably going to pull the product.  This was several weeks ago, yet they are still selling this product in their newest catalog.  Boooo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on a better product, ladies.</li>
            <li> I bought the instant manicure strips because I love any new and technological beauty products.  I applied them 3 days ago, and they still look great! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You definately need to have clean dry nails to make this work.  Just be careful and smooth out the bubbles as you lay down the strip on your nail.  go slow!  Just like it took you some practice to get nail polish to look nice, you may need a little practice for these.  You can&#x27;t just slap them on.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, once on, it was on, and looked perfect and dry!  And very very shiny!  I have no chipping whatsoever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far, I am very satisfied.  I only wish the price were a bit less.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say this was an interesting experiment. It definitely takes practice (I did my Mom&#x27;s nails first) and you can expect your dominant hand to take longer to do. The strips were easy enough to apply but takes a bit of time to figure out which size to use on which nail and more time to align it so it goes on smoothly. It took about a half and hour for me to do my Mom&#x27;s hands (and I&#x27;m pretty good at polishing her nails with traditional bottle polish) but at least they were instantly dry. The best thing is that the colors are very opaque and even, whereas with regular bottle polish you&#x27;d have to apply at least 3 coats to get that effect. The worst part is that the strips do not last as long as regular polish with a top coat applied over it. It lasted less than a week before chips and cracks occurred and the some of the edges peeled up. Also, the instructions say that once the strip package is opened, the strips will dry out (it&#x27;s still nail polish, after all) so don&#x27;t expect to only use ten and save any leftovers. Additionally, removing these was a nightmare, it took about 7 cotton squares soaked in nail polish remover and some serious scrubbing to remove peculiar glue-like bits. Overall it was a fun thing to try but considering the price (even on sale) for a single use, it&#x27;s more of a fun novelty gift item than anything else.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the idea behind these is wonderful, and the color I bought (Berry Fast) is gorgeous. That said, I don&#x27;t see myself ever buying these again for several reasons. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One problem I have with these strips is the price. If this manicure would last for a week or two, $8 would be fine. But for a chipped, wrinkled result that&#x27;s already coming off? Hardly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the sizes - I found one that fit each of my fingernails; the application and the final result are problematic. They&#x27;re tricky to get on, and even trickier to complete the application - once they&#x27;re on your nails, getting the perforation on the end of your nail and removing the excess is not easy. Also, you might want to have someone put these on you unless you&#x27;re ambidextrous.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did my nails last night and this morning it looks like I was doing dishes and then digging in the garden without gloves for several hours. One or two nails look fine, but the rest are not so hot. I think I&#x27;ll stick to liquid polish from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t read all the negative reviews before I bought 2 sets of the press on nails.  It&#x27;s not very easy to apply, but I got the hang of it.  Your nails have to be clean and free of any lotion or oils.  My first set started to wear away at the tips after 10 days, which is more than I ever get from a regular manicure.  I did my nails before going to bed, so that they had plenty time to set before I was using my hands.  The polish is hard, doesn&#x27;t peel or crack.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I hate polishing my nails, because at least one, if not most, of my nails end up smudged or worse.  Always.  So I thought this would be awesome.  The product is a bit tough to use, and I destroyed my first set trying to figure out how to do it properly.  I found that it is IMPERATIVE that you wipe your nails with an acetone nailpolish first, to remove all trace of dirt and oil.  Then, you MUST roughen the entire surface of your nail with an emery - just a little, not a lot, but make sure you get down into the edges and right up to the cuticle.  This helps greatly with adhesion.  Then, apply the strips one at a time, slowly, because although some users have said you can peel them off and try again, in my experience when you do this the strip most often either tears or breaks up.  So go slow and get it right the first time.  Smooth the edges carefully and press down around the edges and cuticle part to make sure the product is completely stuck, then gently pull the excess over the end of your nail and press against the tip of your nail to create a perforation.  Then break the excess off.  I found that the \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit some of my nails, so I used the excess pieces for a couple of my nails because I needed the width.  You will end up with some product overhang on the sides of your nails, but if you gently run your nail along the edge of your nail to create a perforation, the excess product breaks right off.  One user reported that the product needs time to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, and she&#x27;s right.  Over a period of a few hours I noticed the polish got more opaque and completely adhered to my nail just like regular polish;  it also developed a shine and hardness that wasn&#x27;t there right after application.  It&#x27;s 24 hours later now and so far, no wear marks or chips.  I&#x27;m happy to have found a polish I can use without too much grief.  And total application time, including wiping and roughening, was about half an hour for all ten nails.  I can understand the frustration some users have had with this product, as I felt the same way after my first set ended up in the garbage.  However, having figured out how best to make this work, I now feel a lot better about it.  Give it a try before writing it off - it might work for you too.</li>
            <li> There is a variety of sizes to choose from and the colors are great. I put them on in no time sitting in bed watching a movie! I just placed them on the center of the back part of my nail then let the strip naturally fall onto the rest of the nail and then smooth the sides down. Only a couple had wrinkles and I just rubbed them and any bubbles out. Breaking the extra polish off the tip of the nail was not a problem either. It has already been over a week and no chipping at all. I, also, am very surprised at the bad reviews. &lt;br /&gt;I wonder if some people aren&#x27;t get packages with a broken seal. I took mine out of a sealed package and they were soft and stuck to the nail great. I later got out the extras polish strips to show someone how they worked and those did not stick at all, they didn&#x27;t work right once they were in the air too long. &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love them, I thought they would be the newest craze! I have been doing nails for years and I hope they \\&quot;stick\\&quot; around.</li>
            <li> The first time I used these I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but if you follow the instructions they are great. I have had them on for two weeks and no chips at all and haven&#x27;t had one nail break. Sure beats waiting for polish to dry...I will keep buying these as long as I can. One person said you only get 8 I believe there were 14 in case you make a mistake in my package. &lt;br /&gt;Joan</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using these since I love to have my nails polished but dont&#x27; have the time to polish them  often. I received these today and first of all one size doesn&#x27;t fit all.The biggest one wouldn&#x27;t wrap around my thumb and the smallest one wouldn&#x27;t wrap around my pinky.They&#x27;re not easy to put on, if you don&#x27;t center it correctly there&#x27;s no way of peeling it off and starting over. They also don&#x27;t cut easily. if you don&#x27;t pull correctly you&#x27;re bound to peel off more that intended. I&#x27;ll stick to regular polish!! I didn&#x27;t like these..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the new Instant Manicure several times already.  It gives a shiny, professional looking finish quickly! You can apply them quickly and away you go.  There are different sizes in the same pack so you can fit them to your nails.  I don&#x27;t have small hands and I found they fit just fine. My sister has smaller hands and they fit her, too.  It&#x27;s important to push out any creases when applying so they harden correctly.  And,I had a different experience that a previous reviewer:  if you let them dry/harden, they don&#x27;t peel off. They don&#x27;t smudge like nail polish, so you can pick things up right away and go about your business without worry, but you still have to let them harden for a few hours so they set. I did all sorts of tasks while they were hardening, like driving the car and grocery shopping, and I didn&#x27;t scratch or chip them at all! I was playing around with them and was able to peel them off before hardening, but not after. I kept Instant Manicure on several days, did dishes, did housework and they were fine. One thing I did find is that it looks much better if you make sure your cuticles are cleaned up and smooth first..gives a more professional look.  I&#x27;m very impressed! How ingenious! Well worth a try !!!!</li>
            <li> I saw these strips advertised in a magazine and decided to look at the reviews on Amazon before purchasing.  Oh dear.  Some people loved them, some people hated them.  I buy so many useless beauty products that I hated to waste my money on yet another, so I bought a set on eBay for 99 cents!      I prepared my nails as directed, making sure to buff them smooth with a buffing tool.  The first nail I did was my pinky.  The strip is sticky, but barely so... so it&#x27;s easy to lift and reposition if you don&#x27;t get it exactly right the first time.  It took a couple of tries to get the strip against the base of my nail--but if you hold it near the bottom, rather than the end of the strip, it is much easier to contol.  The strip smooths down easily with no bubbles at all.  I ran my finger over the tip and the excess polish broke cleanly away.  I was so astonished at how beautiful my nail looked that I ran to email a friend.    The other fingers took about 30 seconds each to do.  I thought I would have problems using my non-dominant hand to position the strips, but I did fine.      When I was done, I had the most beautifully polished nails EVER.  These were even better than a professional manicure, because the area around the cuticle came out more even and perfect than a person could paint, no matter their skill level. Not to sound like a dork, but I stared at my nails all day!!    I figured the next test would be how long they would last.  It has now been one week and I don&#x27;t have a single chip.  They are still perfect.  The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; is that my nails have grown in that time, so there is a tiny line of new growth.  Certainly not the polish&#x27;s fault, but I don&#x27;t see how they can advertise that the polish lasts up to 14 days.  Technically it might, but your nails wouldn&#x27;t look good with big strips of unpolished nail at the base.    Now that I&#x27;ve tried these strips, I&#x27;m puzzled at some of the bad reviews.  One and a half hours to get these on?  I can&#x27;t imagine what someone would be doing all that time, or why they would persist that long if they were having problems.  Bubbles won&#x27;t smooth out?  These are NOT that sticky, so it&#x27;s easy to smooth them out in a couple of strokes.  I&#x27;m really puzzled!    One thing I will mention is that you need to use a bigger strip than you think.  When I first saw all the strips, I laughed at the size of the biggest one.  I thought, \\&quot;WHAT woman has a thumb nail THAT big??\\&quot;   Uh, apparently I do.  It fit perfectly.    In summary, I love, love, love these!  But I&#x27;m going to buy them cheaply on eBay, rather than paying a lot more to get them from Avon.  (For the record, I don&#x27;t work for Avon... I don&#x27;t even like their cosmetics.)    **Edited to add comment**  I took the strips off on day 8.  They had not chipped, but the new growth did not look nice.  They came off easily, more easily than regular polish, in my opinion.  I used one large cotton ball for all ten fingers.  I didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;scrub,\\&quot; nor were there any stubborn bits of polish left on my nails.  I really don&#x27;t understand why some people had such problems with these.  I have the same nails as everyone else.  I just ordered a bunch more and intend to do my toes, too!</li>
            <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews. I had very little trouble applying these and they came off with no problems using regular nail polish remover pads (for real nails, not acrylic nails) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A couple of hints for people using these. First you need to have well groomed cuticles, but this is a given for most people who want a nicely manicured look anyway. Make sure cuticles are smooth and pushed back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second hint- buff your nails before applying these. If you have any ridges or imperfections in your nails, they show through these strips. Since this isn&#x27;t a liquid polish, these strips will not \\&quot;fill in\\&quot; ridges or smooth out the nail itself. They are like thin strips of saran wrap and every ridge &amp; imperfection shows through. Do a quick buff to smooth your nails out and you are good to go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with fit. I lined the curved edge of the strip at the base of my nail, making sure it is beneath my cuticle a bit, then pulling the strip out and down over the edge of my nail was all it took. The strip would naturally tear over the sharp edge of my nail. I trimmed any excess just by using my nails and used a wooden orange stick to smooth out and tuck the edges. I dampened my finger with water and then just rubbed the strip back and forth a bit to make sure I had good contact with the nail, sort of like smoothing out wallpaper. Voila! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took very little time to do both hands and I loved the color, Twinkling Pink, sort of a very light, shell pink color that was very pretty. They looked good for about a week, which is pretty good. The great thing is how little time it took, no smudging wet nails while waiting for them to dry, and it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, but after the first 2 nails were done I was hooked. This is what I did that may help you.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) I lightly buffed my nails so the surface was better to stick to. I also, pushed back cuticles. &lt;br /&gt;2) I didn&#x27;t peel off the clear strip until I fitted them for my nails.  &lt;br /&gt;3) It is hard to get it on staight with the first try, don&#x27;t worry. When I would start putting it on and I saw it wasn&#x27;t going on straight, I just peeled it back up and stuck it back on. It stayed sticky with each try until I got it right...2-3 times is what it took me.  &lt;br /&gt;4) They do feel just a bit tacky when you first put them on, like real nail polish but (not near at wet) they will dry completely.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have had them on for 4 days now and they still look great. My sister even said \\&quot;Oh, you painted your nails today?\\&quot; I said, \\&quot;No, 4 days ago I did and I even went bowling!\\&quot; She couldn&#x27;t believe how nice they looked.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I ordered some more for me and her!  &lt;br /&gt;I only wish the price was better:(</li>
            <li> I truly liked Avon&#x27;s Instant Manicure Dry Nail Enamel.  They lasted slightly longer than regular polish and looked really good.  They were not difficult to apply, although the first time I did wind up with some small \\&quot;bubbles.\\&quot;   The best thing about them is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product and I am not impressed with the results.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First off it is very difficult to apply the nail enamel strips to ones finger nails.... hard to get the enamel on straight and without causing ripples in the enamel itself when applying it to one&#x27;s finger nails.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also found that I have very small finger and that most of the enamel strips were too big for my fingers. I had to use scissors to trim the enamel to fit my finger nails. The color didn&#x27;t last long on my nails either.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found that Avon&#x27;s speed dry nail polish works like a charm, is easier to apply and takes a very short time to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy busy gal and while I&#x27;d love to keep a weekly nail appointment, it just doesn&#x27;t happen. I was a bit incredulous about Instant Manicure but thought I&#x27;d give at a shot. And it is so cool! If applied just right it really looks like you just got your nails done. In fact my mother just asked me if I got a manicure! Application takes a little practice and patience - the first hand was a shaky but the second hand was perfect. So I definitely recommend getting two packs to start - one for practice.</li>
            <li> I put my second set of these on Saturday morning (as the first set I tried was a disaster- I ended up picking it all off) and the next day they they already looked like day 4 or 5 of a regular manicure.  My nails are chipped and the \\&quot;polish\\&quot; is lifting by the cuticle. It took me about 10 minutes to get these on, as they kept on bubbling and they&#x27;re so flimsy they are hard to get aligned perfectly to your cuticle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The nice thing is that you can pretty much do whatever you need to do immediately after without worrying about smudging the polish, but for the price (2 sets for $9.00 is what I paid online) I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on a regular basis.  They might be good for a rush job or to pack if you&#x27;re travelling somewhere, though.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to apply these and when I was done they looked great.  However, 24 hours later there were small cracks all over the surface that attracted dirt. They looked horrible that way.  So these would work for an evening but that is pretty expensive for a one day use product.  Overall, my impression is it was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are actually kind of cool. The concept of not having to wait for your nail polish to dry is very enticing. However, this does NOT mean that you can jam your foot into a pair of pumps and dance the night away 10 minutes after application (not that you would hide your toes after just painting them, anyway) nor does it mean that you can get under the sheets and snooze right after application. Why not? The polish may seem dry but it needs time to set and to adhere to your nail. To be on the safe side, I would wait 20 minutes before playing footsie with anyone. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with a wrinkly mess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They do take some time to apply (if you want them to look good) and I recommend using a metal cuticle pusher or something similar so that you can lightly smooth over the strip once applied to the nail. This adheres the polish better and gets rid of any bubbles. It is somewhat difficult to get off the skin but you can buff it off lightly with a pumice stone or use nail polish remover if that happens. Don&#x27;t pull too hard when trying to fit the strip to size or you may pull some of the polish off your nail. The cuticle pusher helps minimize this risk, after smoothing it over the polish while slightly pushing down (careful not to dent the polish because it will dent before it is set) to stick it to the nail better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased these because my toddler enjoys poking at my freshly polished nails (no good). She&#x27;s a little bummed now that she can&#x27;t mess them up much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found that the sizes are more then adequate for most women&#x27;s nails. I even used them on my toes once! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, for most people, I would say that the convenience of these nail strips is nearly just the same as regular polish. If you want it to look good, it&#x27;s just as time-consuming. However, these may look smoother on the nails, for most people, as opposed to if they had painted their nails with ordinary polish. They also seem to be more forgiving (just smooth out any mistakes, bumps, lumps, or bubbles with that cuticle pusher . . . LIGHTLY) than regular polish. So, the real question is, are you willing to pay $8.00 (the regular price when not on sale) for a ONE-TIME (this is important to know) application?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been polishing my nails for years and years and this looked like a great idea....until I tried to apply them. Bubbles and wrinkles galore. I had no luck trying to realign the strip if it went on crooked either, it tore when I was trying to peel it off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Part of the problem is that my nails are natural and long. Perhaps it would work better on acrylic or short natural nails. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did notice reading through these reviews that many of the 5 star glowing reviews are all EXACT duplicates of reviews on several other web sites. Hopefully not Avon sellers trying to convince people to buy a bad product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to using my cheap brand colors and Sally Hansen base and instant dry top coats.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be great.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little tricky to apply, especially the first time, but it&#x27;s no more difficult than using those  little brushes and painting in the lines!  Just make sure your nails are smooth and clean, align one edge, and smooth over the whole nail.  I found that the product stretched nicely, and broke right where I wanted it to.  I think it&#x27;s a huge product PLUS that you don&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical about these nails after reading user reviews, but my experience was very good.  And my nails stayed looking good for a week and a half, which I think is excellent.  It might have helped that I used a light color (pink).  No problem with the sizes.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.  (no, I don&#x27;t work for Avon.  And I hate doing my nails.)</li>
            <li> These are totally fantastic!  I would use them again and again!  They are fast and easy to apply.  I just wish they had a larger variety of sizes because I had to work with a few fingers as they were larger than my fingernails.</li>
            <li> My friend sent me a set of these Avon Instant Manicure Dry Enamel Nail Strips.  When she first told me about them, I thought, for certain, that something like that could never work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong, wrong, wrong!  Although I am not a huge fan of the color she sent (Magic Mauve - I thought I would love it because it looked darker in the package), I am now a HUGE fan of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have really small nail beds.  I was worried that all the strips would be too big for my nails.  But they weren&#x27;t!  I peeled the strip off, applied it, smoothed out the edges and it was perfect.  I am right-handed...so applying the strips to that hand (with my left hand) was a bit tricky but not at all impossible.  A few times I mis-aligned the strips but it did not matter - all I had to do was pull them off and try it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ran into a problem with my left thumb nail.  All the strips that remained after doing my other four fingers were too big for my nail.  Again, though, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not a problem.  The strip came over my skin a little bit, but all I had to do was run my thumb nail along the strip that came over my skin to create a crease and the excess polish peeled right off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had applied all the strips and took a look at the final result, I could not believe that this was not a well-done polish job.  My nails look perfect and shiny.  I just went to the Avon site and bought 8 more sets while they are still on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some added benefits to this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - No nail polish smell which my husband appreciated A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - No mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - No getting nail polish on your cuticles or your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - No bumps or ridges on your nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - No smudgy mistakes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I am a big fan...maybe because I was very skeptical at first.  I think if you try these strips, you will like them every bit as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on these. I love make up and I am good at putting things on face and nails. This was a joke..They dont fit and dont stick at all. I bet these will be pulled by Avon very soon. I will try what I bought on my toes. I bought 4 since Avon has great products..This sad to say is NOT one of them. Shame on Avon for this one.</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good product to get a perfect or almost perfect result to your nails.  For people like me, whose nails are not perfectly round or smooth, it is impossible to get an even coating of liquid nail polish.  The amount time it took me to put the strips on (for the first time) is about the same as putting on liquid nail polish, but much better result.  In response to what other people&#x27;s comments: &lt;br /&gt;1. The size is mostly right.  You don&#x27;t need insanely small nails.  The strips are stretchable.  Yes, you can stretch them a bit wider to fit the width of your nails.  In fact, you need to stretch them a little at the end so it covers your nail smoothly at the tip where you tear the extra off. &lt;br /&gt;2. Trimming the 3 sides takes most of the time.  This is where you need to get a hang of it.  You can line up one side then smooth it to the other side and run your nail over the edge to make perforation, and then you can break off the excess carefully.  You can also use a nail clipper to trim the 3 sides, but the tip of the nail would be better if you just tear the excess off by pulling down and covering the edge, so it will not chip off so fast. &lt;br /&gt;3. I found it stays perfect looking much longer than liquid nail polish and not chip so easily, as the product claims.  I did them at night before going to bed, so the nails had time to dry and set (if it would make any difference). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I liked the result very much, although it didn&#x27;t really save time on the first try.  It definitely has an advantage of not having to wait for the nail polish to try and not having problem of messing up the nails accidentally while waiting for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with the the instant manicure and I was a bit nervous.  I did my toes so that any mistakes would be less visible.  It also avoided the dominant hand problem.  The good news is that I only used 6 of the 16 for all 10 toes!  You can tear off what you need and use the rest for another 1 or 2 piggies.  I think it will last longer on my toes too.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I am a consumer nut, they get me with the advertising and I love to try new things and prodcuts.  The Instant Manicure Dry Enamel Strips were no differnt.  I tried them yestarday and the concept is cool, but as with anything I think there is a learning curve.  My nail beds are smaller than usual, thus most of the strips are either too big or too small.  The first nail I did was my thumb nail and it came out beautifully, the other ten fingers ..... not so good.  If you don&#x27;t line it up just right, you can have a mess.  Which means in the long run it is really no shorter period of time to polish your nail and spray them with enamel spray.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have three more sets and I will use them, but I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase more sets.  I am on the second day and I already have some chipping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But hey, at least I can say I tried them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
            <li> In the time it took me to apply these, I could have given myself a much longer lasting traditional manicure. After I finally got them all on, it looked like I had put sheer stickers on my fingernails, and some even had bubbles underneath. They started peeling off after several hours. I feel rather foolish for having been sucked in by the hype. Too bad there isn&#x27;t a negative star rating.</li>
