    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the best.</li>
            <li>SOOOOOO happy that I did!</li>
            <li>If it happens to help with crows feet or wrinkles over time, awesome.</li>
            <li>Still happy with this product and hope they never stop selling it!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>Best way to go is concealer&amp; a good moisturizer, like Neutrogena</li>
            <li>Great product, and good packaging!</li>
            <li>I wanted a great anti-age moisturizer</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels great going on but dries to a matte finish that makes me look like I have on foundation.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t change your life by any stretch, but it&#x27;ll change your skin if you use it wisely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>My 52 year-old skin looks smooth and flawless and feels AMAZING after applying.  </li>
            <li>If not, I&#x27;m just happy to have found a light foundation-ish type product that will even out what I have going on with the freckles and all that without making me look like I have 5 lbs of makeup</li>
            <li>The scent can be a bit strong, but for me it&#x27;s a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Hydraboost is as good or better than most</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light</li>
            <li>and it just draws more attention to the fact that I have makeup on or B)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think Ultra-Lift is a good product, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is a sophisticated and clean scent.</li>
            <li>This may say that it is an anti-age skin corrector, but I just got a tube of it, and it&#x27;s primary use is for helping your skin in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I knew that the look would be one of a light foundation</li>
            <li>This is important.  </li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in a sample size, so I got to try it for free.</li>
            <li>However, if you have sensitive skin, the perfume may not be good for</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off you use it properly, it matches your skin tone very nicely.</li>
            <li>I think it has a nice light scent, but sensitive people may find it overpowering.</li>
            <li>Put it on with a clean face, before the rest of your makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More medium skin tones could wear this but much richer tones or lighter</li>
            <li>My complexion is medium fair with red and gold undertones.</li>
            <li>This lotion was a lucky discovery.</li>
            <li>My skin needs good cover for different spots on my face, and it does very well.</li>
            <li>Bought this because a Tina Fey recommendation says it changed to your unique skin color, but this is not true for fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many good BB creams that I quit buying regular foundation several years ago.</li>
            <li>However, my skin is very light and this product makes me look yellow</li>
            <li>but it smooths and evens out my skin tone and just looks really pretty.</li>
            <li>This one works very well: protects, blends easily, looks natural.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, if you are a senior citizens, trying to keep your skin smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>For someone that just wants a firming lotion I don&#x27;t really think this is the right product.</li>
            <li>It did reduce the appearance of pores and reduced shine, so that was a positive.</li>
            <li>is nice for the transitional times of year when you may be getting slightly darker or lighter with sun exposure.</li>
            <li>Product goes on easy enough</li>
            <li>It is a little darker than I wish, but it makes my skin look amazing.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much change this can really make.</li>
            <li>I almost wonder if the product in the tube was not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the promising ads.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>Since I have the Garnier BB Cream and really like it, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need anything</li>
            <li>too much of it will make your face feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for anti-age products, this is cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to apply one coat of BB rather than sunscreen plus foundation.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>I use it to even out my skin tone so that I don&#x27;t have to apply as much foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>even at the current price I really like this product and feel that it worked well on my skin tone and made my complexion look more even and prepared for makeup or ready for a low maintenance look.</li>
            <li>I am usually a classic ivory color and believe that I&#x27;m probably the lightest of colors that could pull it off.</li>
            <li>I apply a little loose powder, and it looks better and far more natural than any foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion with a dusting of freckles that get way worse in the summer even if I use 100 spf sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am only 25, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it actually lifts or corrects my skin, but I do notice that I look better if I use this in place of my standard face lotion.</li>
            <li>On my face, this product looks tannish white when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>I really like the sheer, natural coverage it provides.</li>
            <li>As far as the lifting claims go I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>When I would wash my face at the end of the day with a makeup remover cloth, it would turn completely orange.  </li>
            <li>Actually adds an orange hue and is very noticeably not my skin color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50s, and it looked like cakey foundation around my nose.</li>
            <li>like a natural, no-makeup look, but</li>
            <li>I used a pea-size portion it as a lotion, and that tiny amount was enough to cover my whole face without discoloring my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered great but the product broke my skin out so bad I had to stop using it after a weekðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the strong, unpleasant smell.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The first thing I noticed was the strong, unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few weeks I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes and frown lines have decreased.</li>
            <li> so is looks dewy instead of dry.</li>
            <li> I just used a dab of Ultra-Lift, along with some loose powder to set it, and lip gloss, and I&#x27;m set for the day.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube white and when you apply it to your skin (a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like all the other makeup if you have any imperfections it dries &amp; cakes right into them,making them look worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to BB cremes and tinted moisturizers, but a little unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I expected it to be even lighter than it is.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on different foundations (that are usually way too thick or heavy for my use) that I was hesitant to give another one a shot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t slather it on, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I bought the product I was not aware it contained an ingredient to color the skin.  </li>
            <li> This works extremely well for me.  </li>
            <li> I had to dilute with other lotion.</li>
            <li> but I certainly did not want a product to make my skin a weird color.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is medium to dark, perhaps you will not have an issue with the color content.  </li>
            <li> This is a thumbs down</li>
            <li> would have given this five stars, but I downgraded it slightly for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use less than you would of a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I hate a really \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look and prefer to look as natural as possible.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> tried rubbing a small amount on my face, and to my dismay, it changed the color of my skin to look like I had applied a bad powder to my face, and didn&#x27;t stay smooth.  </li>
            <li> As a number of reviewers have said, a little dab will do you.</li>
            <li> I use a little dab, meaning about the size of a garbanzo bean.</li>
            <li> Got tired of going to my local drugstore and not finding it in stock.</li>
            <li> Just want plain lotion with sunscreen to use under foundation.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> and that is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed and would definitely not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time finding products that match my skin tone (usually, things turn orange on me).</li>
            <li> the foundation has to be so thick to cover freckles that it makes me look like a crazy makeup obsessed freak...</li>
            <li> So when I try to use foundation it looks terrible because either A) you can see the freckles through the makeup</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this in combination with the night cream. My skin is smoother and my lines diminished. Currently I&#x27;m subscribing to both products. Got tired of going to my local drugstore and not finding it in stock. Now it automatically shows up just before I run out. Another perk: I save money buying it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered great but the product broke my skin out so bad I had to stop using it after a weekðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like all the other makeup if you have any imperfections it dries &amp; cakes right into them,making them look worse. Best way to go is concealer&amp; a good moisturizer, like Neutrogena, hydra boost.I&#x27;ve tried some of the best. For $15. Hydraboost is as good or better than most</li>
            <li> I have to admit I got it at a steal of 5.99 but even at the current price I really like this product and feel that it worked well on my skin tone and made my complexion look more even and prepared for makeup or ready for a low maintenance look. That said I can definitely see how this color would not work for everyone. I am usually a classic ivory color and believe that I&#x27;m probably the lightest of colors that could pull it off. More medium skin tones could wear this but much richer tones or lighter then me just would not work because it will leave color on you skin. As far as the lifting claims go I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t know how much change this can really make. The scent can be a bit strong, but for me it&#x27;s a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, and good packaging!</li>
            <li> This product turns my skin ORANGE.  I adore Garnier products for everything from skin care to shampoo/conditioner and styling products.  I almost wonder if the product in the tube was not the real thing.  No where on the packaging or in any advertising did i see anything about a tint or tanning element included.  When I would wash my face at the end of the day with a makeup remover cloth, it would turn completely orange.  The scent is nice and light but I was disappointed and would definitely not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the promising ads.  I wanted a great anti-age moisturizer but I certainly did not want a product to make my skin a weird color.  When I bought the product I was not aware it contained an ingredient to color the skin.  If your skin is medium to dark, perhaps you will not have an issue with the color content.  However, my skin is very light and this product makes me look yellow and that is not a good thing.  Why would they even put that color in there??  The color is not like a tanning product, it washes off which means it also rubs off onto your clothes, ick!  Obviously I will only be using this product if I plan on avoiding people and staying in the house all day.</li>
            <li> For someone that just wants a firming lotion I don&#x27;t really think this is the right product. I saw an ad that said it changes to match any skin tone and I was intrigued. I have spent so much money on different foundations (that are usually way too thick or heavy for my use) that I was hesitant to give another one a shot. SOOOOOO happy that I did! I have a fair complexion with a dusting of freckles that get way worse in the summer even if I use 100 spf sunscreen. So when I try to use foundation it looks terrible because either A) you can see the freckles through the makeup and it just draws more attention to the fact that I have makeup on or B) the foundation has to be so thick to cover freckles that it makes me look like a crazy makeup obsessed freak...I hate a really \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look and prefer to look as natural as possible.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff did the trick. It comes out of the tube white and when you apply it to your skin (a little goes a long way) it changes to the color of your skin and absorbs into it. I don&#x27;t know how this works but it smooths and evens out my skin tone and just looks really pretty. If it happens to help with crows feet or wrinkles over time, awesome. If not, I&#x27;m just happy to have found a light foundation-ish type product that will even out what I have going on with the freckles and all that without making me look like I have 5 lbs of makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;Also is nice for the transitional times of year when you may be getting slightly darker or lighter with sun exposure. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Update**** July 30, 2014&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few weeks I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes and frown lines have decreased. Still happy with this product and hope they never stop selling it!</li>
            <li> My 52 year-old skin looks smooth and flawless and feels AMAZING after applying.  I apply a little loose powder, and it looks better and far more natural than any foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for me.  My skin needs good cover for different spots on my face, and it does very well.</li>

Don&#x27;t really need anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this five stars, but I downgraded it slightly for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstoff, if you don&#x27;t like fragrance in your skin care, don&#x27;t use this product. I think it has a nice light scent, but sensitive people may find it overpowering. Second, like I said earlier, don&#x27;t slather this all over your face. This stuff is quite moisturizing, and too much of it will make your face feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Ultra-Lift is a good product, and worth the money. It won&#x27;t change your life by any stretch, but it&#x27;ll change your skin if you use it wisely.</li>
            <li> This may say that it is an anti-age skin corrector, but I just got a tube of it, and it&#x27;s primary use is for helping your skin in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried rubbing a small amount on my face, and to my dismay, it changed the color of my skin to look like I had applied a bad powder to my face, and didn&#x27;t stay smooth.  I washed it off immediately, and threw the rest away. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, if you are a senior citizens, trying to keep your skin smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Bought this because a Tina Fey recommendation says it changed to your unique skin color, but this is not true for fair skin.  Actually adds an orange hue and is very noticeably not my skin color.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I knew that the look would be one of a light foundation but I expected it to be even lighter than it is. It feels great going on but dries to a matte finish that makes me look like I have on foundation. Can&#x27;t wear alone, have to finish making up face and add shimmer so is looks dewy instead of dry. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Just bought this yesterday so I cant speak to whether it reduces the look of wrinkles.  The first thing I noticed was the strong, unpleasant smell.  I could smell it several hours after I&#x27;d applied it.  Product goes on easy enough but I wasnt expecting it to look like a foundation.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and it&#x27;s a little dark for me. It left my face with a sallow, yellowish tinge.  It did reduce the appearance of pores and reduced shine, so that was a positive. I dont think I will buy it again once tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I did not realize that the cream--which looks white in the tube--would turn color when applied to the skin.  It is a little darker than I wish, but it makes my skin look amazing.  Please give this a chance.  It does NOT make me breakout (and I use it as a night cream as well).</li>
            <li> Not what it seems. Couldn&#x27;t find my regular Garner facial lotion so I got this. I&#x27;m in my early 50s, and it looked like cakey foundation around my nose. Too thick. I had to dilute with other lotion. Won&#x27;t even finish the tube! Also I did not realize it was tinted. Just want plain lotion with sunscreen to use under foundation. This is a thumbs down</li>
            <li> As a number of reviewers have said, a little dab will do you. This is important.  Use less than you would of a BB cream. Use too much and it looks heavy and pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a natural, no-makeup look, but I do not like to go without makeup. This lotion was a lucky discovery. I really like the sheer, natural coverage it provides. It&#x27;s similar to BB cremes and tinted moisturizers, but a little unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use a little dab, meaning about the size of a garbanzo bean. My complexion is medium fair with red and gold undertones. On my face, this product looks tannish white when I first apply it. Within 2-3 minutes, it changes and is virtually invisible on my skin. It minimizes pores and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> A lot of people are claiming that they use this as a foundation or BB cream replacement, but when I apply it to my skin, I don&#x27;t get any coverage at all. I used a pea-size portion it as a lotion, and that tiny amount was enough to cover my whole face without discoloring my skin tone. It comes out white, so obviously, don&#x27;t use this as your foundation! Put it on with a clean face, before the rest of your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is a scent, but I like it. It is a sophisticated and clean scent. I cannot smell it once it is applied to my face, but it lingered on my hands until I washed it off, and it will not linger all day. However, if you have sensitive skin, the perfume may not be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in a sample size, so I got to try it for free. I am only 25, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it actually lifts or corrects my skin, but I do notice that I look better if I use this in place of my standard face lotion. i do not use this on a daily basis, either, so I cannot say if it made any big difference or not.&lt;br /&gt;Will I be buying this full-size product? No....but like I said, I&#x27;m 25, and I don&#x27;t need anti-age products yet. If you are in the market for anti-age products, this is cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have used so many good BB creams that I quit buying regular foundation several years ago. It is so much easier to apply one coat of BB rather than sunscreen plus foundation. This one works very well: protects, blends easily, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I use it to even out my skin tone so that I don&#x27;t have to apply as much foundation or concealer. On &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin days, I use only this along with finishing power (no foundation). Good stuff!</li>
