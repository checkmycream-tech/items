            <li> I&#x27;m a complete mascara snob, so I am probably more critical than others. It was an okay mascara, but dried pretty quickly so you have a hard time layering it and it didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular. If you&#x27;re looking for a light weight mascara that isn&#x27;t too thick or clumpy you will probably like this one.</li>
            <li> Babe lash worked very well the first time around. However since I purchased my second tube, I am slightly under whelmed</li>
            <li> It seems to be drying out too fast for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before at twice the price.  It works!  My lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. After 3 weeks I actually saw longer lashes and for a 63 yr old that&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, Stays on all day</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the perfect compliment to the Babe Lash serum, so I ordered it.  I find it to be very clumpy and was very disappointed.  My less expensive Cover Girl works much better.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again</li>
            <li> Good mascara. Nothing special though.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It really works</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum and mascara and really like it.  My eyelashes have really grown out since I started it.  Now I just use the mascara.  I was buying it from the beauty parlor but she charged twice as much as was so happy to see Amazon has it. Lee Strang</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! My lashes were broken off and a mess! My lashes are long now and not falling out . The Babe lash mascara keeps them healthy aswell!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use the product long enough to see results. The first morning after application, I woke up to bloodshot eyes. I put visine in them thinking my eyes needed to adjust. But after a week and a half, they were not only bloodshot, they were dry and itchy. I threw it away. I wished it would have worked.</li>
            <li> Good product, one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  No clumpy eyelashes, no smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li> I love the mascara but it dried up in one week.</li>
            <li> Smudges and smears.  Not worth what it cost.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, never comes out of the tube gloppy so no clumps and the brush is great, separates every little lash.  Also does not flake, and is very easy to remove.  This is a great mascara, definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was in wonderful shape.  Best mascara ever and when used with the serum....longest lashes rver.</li>
