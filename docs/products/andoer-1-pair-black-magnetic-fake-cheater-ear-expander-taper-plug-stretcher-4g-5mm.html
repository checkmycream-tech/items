            <li> but I have noticed my ears get a little irritated and red from wearing them to long</li>
            <li> the magnet is not strong enough and it keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> The magnets were not strong enough for my ears.</li>
            <li> Anyways when I try to put them on the magnet is not very strong so it is very difficult to let them stay, also they fall off easily.</li>
            <li> Never got them not worth</li>

            <li> The magnets aren&#x27;t strong enough! They don&#x27;t even stay on~ they fall right off. Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> So far so good magnetics work good, looks real, and nice and small just howI wanted it . Really recommend you buying it</li>
            <li> The magnets suck. They barely work through the earlobe.</li>
            <li> the magnet actually kinda hurts</li>
            <li> They got here fast worked great and i recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s parents don&#x27;t let them pierce their ears</li>
            <li> Product would not stay attached , the back kept falling off.</li>
            <li> Never got them not worth it glad I got my money back for something way better. Just don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail and tried to put them on but the magnets are to weak to stay attached. Not only do they not work on your ears but no matter where you attach them they wont stay unless its paper thin. If the magnets were stronger these would be good.</li>
            <li> The magnets are too weak</li>
            <li> Weak magnet. Didn&#x27;t work at all. My brothers were extremely disappointed, as was I.</li>
            <li> If it was possible I would&#x27;ve have not even given it a star. magnets barely stick</li>
            <li> the tapers did not hold</li>
            <li> They were good but the magnets were to weak they feel off every time I moved to my left or right.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well for me the magnets super comfortable so far but I have noticed my ears get a little irritated and red from wearing them to long I do not recommend wearing these to school or doing an activity that requires you to do physical labor while wearing these they will fall out but I do wear these when I go out to eat or hang out with friends and they cant really tell the difference But they do there job well!</li>
            <li> Ive been begging my parents to let me pierce my ears, and I thought if I showed them that I really liked them by getting these then they might let me. Anyways when I try to put them on the magnet is not very strong so it is very difficult to let them stay, also they fall off easily. So I would have liked the magnets to be stronger. BUT they do look real when they are on. You also have to be careful not to let the little black rubber band things fall off. But if your looking for a little joke to scare your parents then these are great, but if your looking for something to use a lot I recommend you look for something with a stronger magnet. The ones I bought at spencers are great, but they don&#x27;t have the rubber bands that make them look more real.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay on. At all. They wouldn&#x27;t magnetized.</li>
            <li> i only used this once and it was for a prank on my mom it held up fine</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made bought as a gift and magnets are to weak to stay in place</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if I should get my ears gauged. So  I got these just to  see if I liked them. the magnet is not strong enough and it keeps falling off. but they do look real.</li>
            <li> They look real. They broke after 2 months of wearing them. Ears start to hurt after some hours of wearing. I was satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li> Love then there great magnets are strong I wear them all day (:</li>
            <li> The magnets don&#x27;t seem to hold very much, though they DO look very realistic. I have pierced ears, and I bought these for my brother. They aren&#x27;t as strong, but for example, they&#x27;d tend to fall off if you were to take a jog, jump, or change body positions quickly. For the rest of the matter, I do recommend them! If you are going out with friends to a movie, Or to dinner, they will not be a bother. The magnets also aren&#x27;t very comfy at first, also the rubber bands tend to fall off a lot (this is fixable) but it can be rather annoying if you&#x27;re in a hurry!</li>
            <li> The magnets were not strong enough for my ears. They just fell out</li>
            <li> Horrible got them today and the magnets are weak</li>
            <li> Bad magnets dont stay on ears, i should of returned them but too late.</li>
