            <li>/&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason i wanted this drill was because of the better handling for speed with the foot pedal.</li>
            <li>This is the best nail file I&#x27;ve come across so far, ,, works miracles compared to the other 2 I purchased</li>
            <li>Extra Sanding bands&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and was very pleased with the customer service I received.  </li>
            <li>Before I purchased, I had read lots of review to ensure I got the product would be useful for me.</li>
            <li>Everything she needs is here to give her fun</li>
            <li>it came super fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s my own experience, the other people might find this product will be useful for them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, I would recommend it to any professional acrylic artists for fills and full sets.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever buying a drill.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>It burned from the first day.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>the drill bits don&#x27;t like much</li>
            <li>the drill is powerful professional quality I have had no problems</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much yet</li>
            <li>so much faster than &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34</li>
            <li>buy  fast  delivery</li>
            <li>picture present bring the same thing! :)</li>
            <li>and the unit was shipped extra fast!!</li>
            <li>And I was surprised at how fast I received the item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update once I receive the new unit.</li>
            <li>I am I professional nail tech and bought this drill</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is very powerful close enough to the ones at the salon</li>
            <li>Its really good just one small problem the round filing paper</li>
            <li>The RPM&#x27;s definitely have enough power to remove your gel or acrylic nails, but the machine does get a little bit warm after long periods of use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast considering how mail usually takes over a month to get here.</li>
            <li>the only problem I have with it so far is that the extras advertised as coming with it, didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but the quality is very similar to professional tattoo drills.</li>
            <li>its exactly what i expected!!</li>
            <li>Also, the foot pedal seems kind of  flimsy, i haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, but I would just be careful and not leave it around where it could get broken.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it a little better is if the sanding bits were a little finer.</li>

            <li> well it&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li> The nail bits are not gold and therefore probably will need replacing before too long.. maybe 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> I could not get it to work; the second, it appealed as a very rough product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Came with everything listed but was not very powerful....</li>
            <li> I likea little bit, but will see how it works</li>
            <li> Little vibration in headpiece.</li>
            <li> then I might change my rating but kinda small for the price.</li>
            <li> Handpiece not lockable so hard to get bits out.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of vibration hard to use</li>
            <li> The stand that is included for the dremmel is a little useless for me, seems to just get in the way.</li>
            <li> The drill has a weird noise.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my foot pedal would NOT work upon assembling the drill.</li>
            <li> Sadly the unit wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this.</li>

            <li> Love it came super fast has everything like it says it comes in the box with instructions and everything love love love highly recommend</li>
            <li> i loved it thank you for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product! I love it! Well worth the price, I would recommend it to any professional acrylic artists for fills and full sets.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 star every ting was in there like in the pic the drill bits don&#x27;t like much so I have to order some that will work for nails like the ones u actually use in a salon the gold ones and every thing else I likea little bit, but will see how it works wen I use it. then I might change my rating but kinda small for the price. I think $15 should me more of a price for this. well I did use it and change the rating to a 5 star it does what it suppose to so really happy with what I got :)</li>
            <li> I love it, works great!... My nail tech used this, so I bought one for me after she moved away...</li>
            <li> Great product. I am a groomer and it&#x27;s just what I needed to get the job done. Great price too. Nice doing business with you.</li>
            <li> This met all my expectations.  I love the speed control and being able to reverse the direction.  I ended up buy another for a friend also.</li>
            <li> I love this drill, it works great for the price.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is because the drill bits weren&#x27;t as good, they are not of great quality so I will probably have to buy those separately.  Other than that it is very powerful close enough to the ones at the salon and I like the fact that is has the foot pedal.  Also, the foot pedal seems kind of  flimsy, i haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, but I would just be careful and not leave it around where it could get broken.</li>
            <li> Works great for home use.</li>
            <li> Works good for the price.  Handpiece not lockable so hard to get bits out. Little vibration in headpiece.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and love it.  I works great.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star was because it was missing&lt;br /&gt;1x Nail Art Brush&lt;br /&gt;1x Finger Separator&lt;br /&gt;1x Nail Art Rhinestones Wheel&lt;br /&gt;20x Extra Sanding bands&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and was very pleased with the customer service I received.  I am only writing this to let others know that it might not come with everything shown.</li>
            <li> The drill has a weird noise.</li>
            <li> This machine is pretty great. The RPM&#x27;s definitely have enough power to remove your gel or acrylic nails, but the machine does get a little bit warm after long periods of use. The stand that is included for the dremmel is a little useless for me, seems to just get in the way. The nail bits are not gold and therefore probably will need replacing before too long.. maybe 6 months or so. But this is a great starter kit and really worth the money.</li>
            <li> its good but sometimes it doesnt work then i wiggle the cord and it does ?????</li>
            <li> This item is great the drill is powerful professional quality I have had no problems I think this is a great buy for the Price</li>

            <li> I am I professional nail tech and bought this drill and I am very satisfied with the quality and such a great price!!</li>

            <li> Love this works very well</li>
            <li> the only problem I have with it so far is that the extras advertised as coming with it, didn&#x27;t. The seller addressed this problem promptly and fairly. The nail drill is very easy to use. I have only used it a few times, but it has met my expectations and made doing my gel overlays at home much quicker and easier. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased, I had read lots of review to ensure I got the product would be useful for me. However, after receiving it, it was a completely different case which I had hope for .First,  I could not get it to work; the second, it appealed as a very rough product.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my own experience, the other people might find this product will be useful for them.</li>
            <li> super funccional, I am a nail tech and this machine drill works great! 5 stars for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The  picture present bring the same thing! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT SOOOOOOO MUCH</li>
            <li> The main reason i wanted this drill was because of the better handling for speed with the foot pedal. Unfortunately my foot pedal would NOT work upon assembling the drill. I was very disappointed with this. It was however packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it!..great price!...work awesome and got it quick!</li>
            <li> I love it! And I was surprised at how fast I received the item.</li>
            <li> I Love it it was better then I thought it would be</li>
            <li> There is a lot of vibration hard to use</li>
            <li> its exactly what i expected!!</li>
            <li> Item was not what was stated.  Items shown and promised were not included..</li>
            <li> defonatly met my expectations</li>
            <li> Came with everything listed but was not very powerful.... Every time I touch my nail the drill stops.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Cheap bits but I just got some on ebay. The drill is excellent! I haven&#x27;t used it much yet but the quality is very similar to professional tattoo drills. Very good!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm...so much faster than &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; filing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described. This is a good quality product. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for right now. I recently orders this drill while deployed. Shipping was pretty fast considering how mail usually takes over a month to get here. As soon as I got this drill in the mail I went to try it out. Sadly the unit wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I checked everything, even tried different outlets and couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I contacted loel and explained the situation. They had me place another order and once it ships they will give me a FULL refund. That&#x27;s the best customer service ever and the unit was shipped extra fast!! I&#x27;ll update once I receive the new unit.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my drill! This is my first time ever buying a drill. I did read some of the reviews of the drill and even though there weren&#x27;t many I did not want to pay for an expensive drill yet. I just got into doing nails and needed a practice drill and this drill does the job. I am able to lay acrylic and drill the acrylic as well. It does allow you to change the speeds and it comes with the foot pedal but I don&#x27;t use the pedal at all. I would definitely recommend this drill</li>
            <li> It works great except for the the foot pedal. That doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I would have returned it except that I needed it as soon as it came in.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Returned&lt;br /&gt;Was incomplete</li>
