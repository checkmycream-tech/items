    <ol>
            <li>I received the afro hair doll and the texture is perfect for braiding.</li>
            <li>i would say that this also might not be the best head to use if you are a beginner to braiding, which is what i bought it for...</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>but the manikin was perfect if I could use the holder</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the gray hairs interdispersed throughout, great product!</li>
            <li>she is wonderful for my granddaughter</li>
            <li>Very good for practicing braiding hair with extension.  </li>
            <li>The mannequin is beautiful, however there is nothing ethnic about her.</li>
            <li>Great stand great hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>should lol..</li>
            <li>she comes with the the clamp happy birthday</li>
            <li>The manikin is great for practice and I am learning how to braid on it now.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>it was too good of a grade.</li>
            <li>She is lighter in skin color and more attractive.  </li>
            <li>She said it is wonderful and as long as she&#x27;s happy?!</li>
            <li>Therefore I love it!</li>
            <li>this is a really nice lil set, tho i had hoped for a hair texture closer to my granddaughters...</li>
            <li>My niece is creating hairstyles with the mannequin and then doing them on her own hair.  </li>
            <li>I am learning to take care of my own hair at home.</li>
            <li>I wanted this Manikin to practice improving my hair skills, and really liked because it was Ethnic.</li>
            <li>I also would have liked it to be a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed its light weight, the hair texture is good when this one isn&#x27;t any more good</li>
            <li>I thought, what a wonderful gift to introduce to  a young girl her age.  </li>
            <li>The wig head and the holder make sewing and making wigs sooo easy!</li>
            <li>Mannequin was fine!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m stretching for 3 more words.</li>
            <li>in all I LOVE it for my purposes</li>
            <li>when considering buying one of these products just be sure that this is what you want</li>
            <li>It was the best gift ever, especially for those girls who love to do hair.  </li>
            <li>What is even better</li>
            <li>She is learning how to do many hairstyles.</li>
            <li>This served it&#x27;s purpose for me and has been passed to my girls since they love to braid and style hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something more textured.</li>
            <li>The length is more like 10-12&amp;#34; rather than 17-19&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This doll doesn&#x27;t fit the description at all, this is not what I ordered!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Because if so, they make a styling doll with more afro textured kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it was better quality.....</li>
            <li>she love her hair  </li>
            <li>I was hoping the hair texture would have been more course like African-American women&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>i love the head...</li>
            <li>normally is with great shape</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t braid it, gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>Even a 3a,b or c would have been fine.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it has real hair and she can model being a real beautician is great for her.</li>
            <li>It is worth WAYYYYYY more than what it costs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to practice on a manikin with ethnic hair.  </li>
            <li>The young lady I bought this item for loved it.  </li>
            <li>Many professionals lack the skills necessary to work with ethnic hair and get good results so if you can then it can give you a leg up when looking for jobs.</li>
            <li>She loved it, my only concern was, even though the models skin was brown</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and it curls nicely.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad product</li>
            <li>So like I said its not a bad head</li>
            <li>/&gt;that said, if you are looking for a head that has a finer hair texture for a mixed race person or for a caucasian with hair a lil on the coarse side that has layers, this would be an excellent head to practice on...</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m comparing this to my hair, but even with a super relaxer in my hair  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great either for someone who wants to learn for personal interest or if they&#x27;re practicing for a career.  </li>
            <li>Very good for the small price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this manikin so I could teach myself how to corn-row and twist and other styles that I would like to eventually be able to do to my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Mannequin was as expected and the manikin holder was a nice plus!</li>
            <li>Great product doesn&#x27;t shed much as previous manikins that I have had also everything was included as listed with the manikin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this may be fine if you are used to working with different hair textures, but for someone like myself who just wanted the manikin for the purposes of learning how to style my hair, it&#x27;s a no go.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for anyone who wants to learn how to do hair.  </li>
            <li>Got for my granddaughter, but she rarely uses it.</li>
            <li>I just got this product about a hour ago and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>only thing \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; about this wig is the color, the hair isnt good quality at all and its almost too soft (i could barely braid it) and kind of thin&lt;</li>
            <li>She is at the age where a doll was not quite right.  </li>
            <li>I wish her hair was little thicker but it is nice quality hair!</li>
            <li>She has learned to curl hair with rollers, hot curl the hair, flat iron the hair, she has trimmed it, and it is still nice.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I sent it back for Yolonda which I LOVE</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>my 10 year old uses this wayyy more than any 10 year old</li>
            <li>The manekin&#x27;s hair is very easy to braid or do other styles.</li>
            <li>The hair is super stringy and nowhere near ethic.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this manikin head to everyone who is looking to improve their hairstyling skills and learn how to do new hairstyles!!!</li>
            <li>I just ordered the Afro hair for her this christmas, she now wants to learn to braid hair.  </li>
            <li>The hair that has been inserted into the scalp is real.</li>
            <li>also, i found the pivoting clamp stand worked very well...</li>
            <li>Im actually ready to order one for myself.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much since I&#x27;ve received it.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is too silky &amp; it sheds too much for my liking.  </li>
            <li>The holder allows me to tilt and swivel her head to make the angle of braiding work for me, like a real head.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t think it would have so much gray hair.</li>
            <li>one critique is that this styling head doesn&#x27;t really have ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It doesnt comb forward naturally - there&#x27;s a middle part in the crown of the head that prevents that so you wouldnt be able to cut bangs</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because it is able to do my cutting practices in the&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice and shedding and the length of the hair was decent.</li>
            <li>This hair feels real so practice is more realistic than with less professional models.  </li>
            <li>- I wish the stand/clamp it comes with was a little more flexible.  </li>
            <li>We use these in our middle school afterschool program and they have held up through the past 6 sessions and are still in good shape.</li>
            <li>Although she looks African American or Ethnic her hair is too fine.</li>
            <li>This manikin&#x27;s hair is more like a 1a, very silky and hard to work with if you&#x27;re not used to the texture.  </li>
            <li>The Whitney styling doll pretty much has straight, slick hair, which is fine as long as that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>Ok to START the only thing negative about this is that the picture doesnt look like the real mannequin, but then again the one you get is prettier.</li>
            <li>I actually did not have too much shedding...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my twevlve year old daughter</li>
            <li>The hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>it is not as soft as this.  </li>
            <li>My daughter wants to go into cosmetology, shes only 14.</li>
            <li>very aggravated because this is a Christmas present</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 12 year old, she loves it.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t wait to curl and style it like a professional.</li>
            <li>wig holder allowed to set it firmly in place on my nightstand while still providing movement to get to the nape area etc (exactly like asking the client to move their head a certain way)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected this hair to be little more textured.  </li>
            <li>Daughter used it to complete her final for cosmo class.  </li>
            <li>It was a christmas present for an 11 year old.  </li>
            <li>Not kinky or natural Afro American</li>
            <li>My ten year old is learning how to cornrow with this head.</li>
            <li>the hair is a little straight but looks all natural and can be dyed, pressed and whatever else......</li>
            <li>I purchased this human hair manikin head for my thirteen year old niece as a Xmas present.  </li>
            <li>the cut on it is not even and the length does not allow for cutting it even and still have enough for good braiding practice...</li>
            <li>Her hair is soft, brown and hang almost mid way to back if she had a back.  </li>

            <li> very aggravated because this is a Christmas present</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old, she loves it.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t wait to curl and style it like a professional.</li>
            <li> wig holder allowed to set it firmly in place on my nightstand while still providing movement to get to the nape area etc (exactly like asking the client to move their head a certain way)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected this hair to be little more textured.  </li>
            <li> Daughter used it to complete her final for cosmo class.  </li>
            <li> It was a christmas present for an 11 year old.  </li>
            <li> Not kinky or natural Afro American</li>
            <li> My ten year old is learning how to cornrow with this head.</li>
            <li> the hair is a little straight but looks all natural and can be dyed, pressed and whatever else......</li>
            <li> I purchased this human hair manikin head for my thirteen year old niece as a Xmas present.  </li>
            <li> the cut on it is not even and the length does not allow for cutting it even and still have enough for good braiding practice...</li>
            <li> Her hair is soft, brown and hang almost mid way to back if she had a back.  </li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed styling this head with single braids, but it is not textured like afro hair and impossible to cornrow.</li>
            <li> Hair is too thin and you can&#x27;t do much to it.</li>
            <li> , the only complaint I have is that the long selling is not real is much shorter for improving that.&lt;br /&gt;Grace, and if I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> There is a little grey, but not much.  </li>
            <li> ......had other mounting options to avoid damage to the item it is being mounted to.</li>
            <li> But other then that and the gray strands of hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any odd smell like I&#x27;ve read about for some the other mannequin</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Finished my wig in less than half the time it took me using the Styrofoam head</li>
            <li> but if I was a cosmetology student trying to practice I might have been a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I thought the hair would be a little course.</li>
            <li> but I after this I will never go back to those for making wigs.&lt;br /&gt;-I simply braided the hair on the head down put a basic wig cap to keep the hair in place and put the wig base (in my case a spandex dome cap)</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The stand holder did not fit into the manikin&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Missing a piece to connect it to a table.</li>
            <li> so I can improve my hairstyling skills with less fuss and my goal has been reached!</li>
            <li> Very little shedding of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually get what i ordered, but on this order,I payed for a holder</li>
            <li> In fact, I am not sure what &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair means on these types of dolls.</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> If you are practicing your cornrowing skills, I am not sure how well this would work.</li>
            <li> This hair is hard to work with when trying to braid or cornrow.  </li>
            <li> Does that mean kinky with some curl?</li>
            <li> Does it mean the texture of relaxed hair?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it difficult to use quite a few times because of where/how I&#x27;m trying to pose it</li>
            <li> The hair sheds with the littlest use which is irritating.</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> This is false advertisement and i fell like i&#x27;ve been ripped off!</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed!</li>
            <li> and as i did it gave off this terrible smell which made my stomach hurt.</li>

            <li> Got for my granddaughter, but she rarely uses it. Trying to teach her how to do braids and care for her hair by using this doll head.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter for Christmas 2011. She is nine.  She has not seen it so I will comment again after she plays with it.  My initial impression is \\&quot;she is prettier in person\\&quot;  She is lighter in skin color and more attractive.  Her hair is soft, brown and hang almost mid way to back if she had a back.  There is a little grey, but not much.  I will comment again after christmas on my daughter&#x27;s impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I gave doll to my daughter this pass christmas 12/2011 and she loves it.  She has learned to curl hair with rollers, hot curl the hair, flat iron the hair, she has trimmed it, and it is still nice.  It has been washed over and over again and still looks the same.  I just ordered the Afro hair for her this christmas, she now wants to learn to braid hair.  I received the afro hair doll and the texture is perfect for braiding.</li>
            <li> Daughter used it to complete her final for cosmo class.  All went well.</li>
            <li> This was what the gift recipient wanted. She loved it. It was everything she was looking for... i&#x27;m stretching for 3 more words.</li>
            <li> This manikin head is what it&#x27;s cracked up to be! It is worth WAYYYYYY more than what it costs. The hair that has been inserted into the scalp is real. I bought it so I can improve my hairstyling skills with less fuss and my goal has been reached! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this manikin head to everyone who is looking to improve their hairstyling skills and learn how to do new hairstyles!!!</li>
            <li> I usually get what i ordered, but on this order,I payed for a holder and i did not recieve it! Im very disappointed! I dont understand why would they advertise the holder and not send it. I&#x27;ll be sending this product back. This is false advertisement and i fell like i&#x27;ve been ripped off!</li>
            <li> Great stand great hair u can do any thing to this hair and can treat it as if its ur own...apply heat wash whatever</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this to make u-part/sew-in/quick weave wigs:&lt;br /&gt;-You NEED this!!! The wig head and the holder make sewing and making wigs sooo easy! Before I bought this I was just using the Styrofoam one from the beauty supply store but I after this I will never go back to those for making wigs.&lt;br /&gt;-I simply braided the hair on the head down put a basic wig cap to keep the hair in place and put the wig base (in my case a spandex dome cap) started sewing!&lt;br /&gt;-The wig holder allowed to set it firmly in place on my nightstand while still providing movement to get to the nape area etc (exactly like asking the client to move their head a certain way)&lt;br /&gt;-Finished my wig in less than half the time it took me using the Styrofoam head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youre using this as a cosmetology tool:&lt;br /&gt;-The only thing \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; about this wig is the color, the hair isnt good quality at all and its almost too soft (i could barely braid it) and kind of thin&lt;br /&gt;-It doesnt comb forward naturally - there&#x27;s a middle part in the crown of the head that prevents that so you wouldnt be able to cut bangs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I LOVE it for my purposes but if I was a cosmetology student trying to practice I might have been a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#x27;s another product that&#x27;s cheaper but if you notice it doesn&#x27;t come with the holder - YOU NEED THE HOLDER (unless you already have one)! it makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> Ok to START the only thing negative about this is that the picture doesnt look like the real mannequin, but then again the one you get is prettier. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! I have curles straightened weaved and everything else. I actually bleached the hair and it is still holding up. it works just like human hair. I would recommend this product. I actually did not have too much shedding...</li>
            <li> The young lady I bought this item for loved it.  The manekin&#x27;s hair is very easy to braid or do other styles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this human hair manikin head for my thirteen year old niece as a Xmas present.  She is at the age where a doll was not quite right.  Then I thought about the heads they use in cosmetology schools to teach students how to braid and style hair.  I thought, what a wonderful gift to introduce to  a young girl her age.  She can develop a skill while combing and brushing hair of the manikin head!  Needless to say, She loves the gift!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my twevlve year old daughter and she loves it. The fact that it has real hair and she can model being a real beautician is great for her. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Ethnic Human Hair my backside. I&#x27;m ethnic and this Whitney chicks hair felt nothing like mines. Couldn&#x27;t braid it, gets tangled easily. Heck, she doesn&#x27;t even look ethnic. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice lil set, tho i had hoped for a hair texture closer to my granddaughters...i would say that this also might not be the best head to use if you are a beginner to braiding, which is what i bought it for...the cut on it is not even and the length does not allow for cutting it even and still have enough for good braiding practice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, if you are looking for a head that has a finer hair texture for a mixed race person or for a caucasian with hair a lil on the coarse side that has layers, this would be an excellent head to practice on...also, i found the pivoting clamp stand worked very well...nothing fancy, but sufficient for this purpose</li>
            <li> when considering buying one of these products just be sure that this is what you want and you have checked everywhere else before purchasing online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this manikin so I could teach myself how to corn-row and twist and other styles that I would like to eventually be able to do to my own hair.  I don&#x27;t know what is the point of calling the manikin \\&quot;Ethnic\\&quot; when it doesn&#x27;t have ethnic hair.  I was hoping for a hair texture closer to my 4a texture.  Even a 3a,b or c would have been fine.  This manikin&#x27;s hair is more like a 1a, very silky and hard to work with if you&#x27;re not used to the texture.  I&#x27;m sure this may be fine if you are used to working with different hair textures, but for someone like myself who just wanted the manikin for the purposes of learning how to style my hair, it&#x27;s a no go.</li>
            <li> when i was purchases the manikin  it says it comes with holder  but I only receive the manikin head no holder .so question is where is the holder? If the manikin does notes included the holder Say it.</li>
            <li> It was a christmas present for an 11 year old.  She loved it, my only concern was, even though the models skin was brown the modles facial features were caucasian.</li>
            <li> The hair was soft and manageable. My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I use this head to practice lighting patterns for photography.  I can&#x27;t provide any feedback on using it for styling hair, but it does the job for lighting exercises.  It didn&#x27;t have any odd smell like I&#x27;ve read about for some the other mannequin heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only two negatives:&lt;br /&gt; - A bigger nose would help with casting shadows for lighting (I know that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed for, but it&#x27;s how I use it)&lt;br /&gt; - I wish the stand/clamp it comes with was a little more flexible.  I&#x27;ve found it difficult to use quite a few times because of where/how I&#x27;m trying to pose it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t shed much as previous manikins that I have had also everything was included as listed with the manikin.</li>
            <li> I purchase this as a Christmas gift for my teen niece.  It was the best gift ever, especially for those girls who love to do hair.  My niece is creating hairstyles with the mannequin and then doing them on her own hair.  What is even better this one comes with a holder that swivels.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this head.  Hair is too thin and you can&#x27;t do much to it. And I thought the hair would be a little course. Nothing like African American hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed styling this head with single braids, but it is not textured like afro hair and impossible to cornrow.</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter, and she loves it. She is learning how to do many hairstyles. Im actually ready to order one for myself.</li>
            <li> I am learning to take care of my own hair at home. I needed a mannequin to practice with. This served it&#x27;s purpose for me and has been passed to my girls since they love to braid and style hair.</li>
            <li> Very good for practicing braiding hair with extension.  Very straight hair.  Not kinky or natural Afro American like I thought.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed its light weight, the hair texture is good when this one isn&#x27;t any more good I will get another. Very good for the small price.</li>
            <li> I expected this hair to be little more textured.  Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m comparing this to my hair, but even with a super relaxer in my hair  it is not as soft as this.  This hair is hard to work with when trying to braid or cornrow.  I haven&#x27;t used it much since I&#x27;ve received it.  I will continue to work with it.</li>
            <li> I wish her hair was little thicker but it is nice quality hair! My ten year old is learning how to cornrow with this head. Although she looks African American or Ethnic her hair is too fine. If your looking for a coarser hair this may not be the one. We do like the hair though.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for anyone who wants to learn how to do hair.  It&#x27;s great either for someone who wants to learn for personal interest or if they&#x27;re practicing for a career.  This hair feels real so practice is more realistic than with less professional models.  Plus it clamps onto tables or counters so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it tipping over while you&#x27;re using it.  For anyone who&#x27;s practicing for a career it&#x27;s important to practice on a manikin with ethnic hair.  Many professionals lack the skills necessary to work with ethnic hair and get good results so if you can then it can give you a leg up when looking for jobs.</li>
            <li> The mannequin is beautiful, however there is nothing ethnic about her. I ordered this one specifically for the &amp;#34;ethnicity&amp;#34;. Her hair is too silky &amp; it sheds too much for my liking.  I was hoping for something more textured. The length is more like 10-12&amp;#34; rather than 17-19&amp;#34;. And not too mention she&#x27;s 10 shades lighter than the picture shows. This doll doesn&#x27;t fit the description at all, this is not what I ordered!</li>
            <li> We use these in our middle school afterschool program and they have held up through the past 6 sessions and are still in good shape. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Very little shedding of hair. Wish I would have purchased two so she can have one to cut</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because it is able to do my cutting practices in the&lt;br /&gt;and you can comb and drying normally is with great shape, the only complaint I have is that the long selling is not real is much shorter for improving that.&lt;br /&gt;Grace, and if I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> my 10 year old uses this wayyy more than any 10 year old should lol..it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> It served the purpose.  Wish the mounting bracket when deeper and ......had other mounting options to avoid damage to the item it is being mounted to.</li>
            <li> The stand holder did not fit into the manikin&#x27;s. but the manikin was perfect if I could use the holder</li>
            <li> I am using this mannequin to learn to braid (along with a youtube how to video). Mannequin was as expected and the manikin holder was a nice plus! The holder allows me to tilt and swivel her head to make the angle of braiding work for me, like a real head. I don&#x27;t care about the gray hairs interdispersed throughout, great product!</li>
            <li> My daughter wants to go into cosmetology, shes only 14. So i got her this as a starter manikin. She loves it! Hair was longer than we expected....perfect for her!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my pre-teen daughter. She likes it to practice braiding techniques. I just didn&#x27;t think it would have so much gray hair.</li>
            <li> I just got this product about a hour ago and so far I love it. I recently went to curl it and as i did it gave off this terrible smell which made my stomach hurt. But other then that and the gray strands of hair I&#x27;m really enjoying it. The hair is soft and it curls nicely. I would recommend for a beginner or just to have.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad product but I assumed since it said ethnic hair that it would be course enough for me to braid. Which was the initial purpose of me purchasing this head. I couldn&#x27;t grip the hair it was too good of a grade. I sent it back for Yolonda which I LOVE and I&#x27;m braiding her hair ALL THE TIME! So like I said its not a bad head just not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was supposed to have ethnic hair. It has a caucasian texture, and the hair sheds ALOT! bought this because I wanted to learn how to braid/cornrow cannot do it with this. Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> Missing a piece to connect it to a table. Mannequin was fine! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product. I bought it as a birthday gift for my niece and she likes it too. I didn&#x27;t notice and shedding and the length of the hair was decent. My niece loves the thing and is always washing, curling and styling the hair in different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one critique is that this styling head doesn&#x27;t really have ethnic hair. In fact, I am not sure what &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair means on these types of dolls. Does that mean kinky with some curl? Because if so, they make a styling doll with more afro textured kinky hair. Does it mean the texture of relaxed hair? I am not sure. The Whitney styling doll pretty much has straight, slick hair, which is fine as long as that&#x27;s what you want. If you are practicing your cornrowing skills, I am not sure how well this would work.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the holder..</li>
            <li> I wanted this Manikin to practice improving my hair skills, and really liked because it was Ethnic. However, the hair isn&#x27;t at all ethnic! The hair sheds with the littlest use which is irritating. Also, I tried to curl it and it didn&#x27;t hold any curl so its not 100% Human Hair. Wish it was better quality.....</li>
            <li> It looks NOTHING like that in person. The hair is super stringy and nowhere near ethic. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture or description.</li>
            <li> she is wonderful for my granddaughter she love her hair  she comes with the the clamp happy birthday INDIA GRESHAM  in Greensboro Ga</li>
            <li> Beware! Does NOT come with holder...I will have to pay extra and order this separately...very aggravated because this is a Christmas present and I was counting on getting the holder with it!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the hair texture would have been more course like African-American women&#x27;s hair. I also would have liked it to be a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I didnt receive the holder it was supposed to come with</li>
            <li> The manikin is great for practice and I am learning how to braid on it now. the hair is a little straight but looks all natural and can be dyed, pressed and whatever else......</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old, she loves it. She can&#x27;t wait to curl and style it like a professional. Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> i love the head... the hair is like silk</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it! Therefore I love it! She said it is wonderful and as long as she&#x27;s happy?! Granny is happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
