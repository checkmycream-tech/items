            <li>My daughter&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>Love the cap that keeps the toothpaste from drying out.</li>
            <li>One thing many kids that come to my home don&#x27;t have is tooth brushes and tooth paste.</li>
            <li>They love the taste and will eagerly brush their teeth each night.</li>

            <li>Then I&#x27;d get some more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like mint, and that is what most toothpaste tastes like to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My 8-year-old does much better with the cleanliness thing.</li>
            <li>teeth seem very clean with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>teeth seem very clean with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A very mild and kind of sweet winterfresh mint.</li>
            <li>The mild taste is very easy on upset stomachs.</li>
            <li>The mild taste is very easy on upset stomachs.</li>
            <li>; but it works best if you store it up side down.</li>
            <li>Received as promised and the kids are fine with the taste.</li>
            <li>If you just want a pleasant-tasting toothpaste, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d also be great for pregnant women or people undergoing chemo who have sensitive taste buds and noses.</li>
            <li>Great value compared to the local market.  </li>
            <li>The taste is great even for younger kids.</li>
            <li>The taste is great even for younger kids.</li>
            <li>but they tell me brushing your teeth is important.  </li>
            <li>I am golden status customer, or would I say I should be treated likewise after a long time of being acquainted with a good item.</li>
            <li>This is great toothpaste: tasty (similar to bubble gum flavor), aesthetically pleasing (sparkly blue), and apparently effective since I&#x27;ve had no cavities for years.</li>
            <li>My son (9 y/o) does not like super minty flavors.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my dentist trusts Kids Crest, which is the major selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>We are happy with this toothpaste -- no special characters, but my 5-year-old doesn&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d also be great for pregnant women or people undergoing chemo who have sensitive taste buds and noses.t&#x27;s blue toothpaste with sparkles in it.</li>
            <li>But with Kid&#x27;s Crest Sparkle Fun I rarely get complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps their breath fresh.</li>
            <li>It keeps their breath fresh.</li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste so much because it is gives such a refreshing feeling on teeth and gum.  </li>
            <li>If that concerns you, there are also traditional tubes available that have more content without all the plastic.</li>
            <li>Anything that causes him to brush his teeth longer or more frequently is a winner in my book.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>probably good for kids because its a mild, sweet taste, but as an adult i didn&#x27;t think the taste was &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough</li>
            <li>Now if only the lid would magically put itself back onto the top of the bottle!</li>
            <li>So far so good, only one tooth has fallen out.</li>
            <li>Kids love the sparkles- especially girls.</li>
            <li>Kids love the sparkles- especially girls.</li>
            <li>And the squeeze tubes have almost always worked well; I only remember one tube out of dozens that had a problem (it stopped advancing to squeeze out more, before it was empty).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;neat squeeze\\&quot; is neater than a regular toothpaste tube, but they still manage to get toothpaste most anywhere (floor, wall, counter, etc.).</li>
            <li>I use this for my toddler, who is good at spitting up the paste, than swallowing it, but I use less quantity than my older kid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy on their gums, yet foams up enough to clean their entire mouth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy on their gums, yet foams up enough to clean their entire mouth</li>
            <li>Well, I certainly do.</li>
            <li>Something that is really convenient you might not think about is that this stands vertically.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this one as I think they&#x27;re learning how to be more careful.</li>
            <li>Decent price too.</li>
            <li>Although there is little glittery pits in the toothpaste, it has a very smooth texture.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is easy for any kid above the age of 5 to open.</li>
            <li>My only real problem is that the bottle is made kind of ridiculously.</li>
            <li>But I like that the cap is easy enough for smaller hands to open.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing less of a drudge to him and it keeps the toothpaste clean</li>
            <li>This is all my 10 yr old will use.</li>
            <li>Glitter is everything in a young princesses eyes.</li>
            <li>Glitter is everything in a young princesses eyes.</li>
            <li>Well, as an aging adult I just can&#x27;t stand bubble gum.</li>
            <li>So far, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary</li>
            <li>I tried it and will stay with my adult flavors</li>
            <li>No mess and our child likes it.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a way other than hiding normal squeeze tubes to make them look organized after cleaning the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that the hard plastic and flat bottom allow it to stand on</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a few things I really like about this particular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Makes children independent even at a young</li>
            <li>only downside is that the tubes feel a bit wasteful; there&#x27;s quite a bit of plastic for a modest amount of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>We have to place ours upside down in jars for the toothpaste to rest on the upper half near the opening so we can easily squeeze it</li>
            <li>I get a lot of &#x27;This is too spicy&#x27; with other very minty-tasting toothpastes.</li>

            <li> We have to place ours upside down in jars for the toothpaste to rest on the upper half near the opening so we can easily squeeze it</li>
            <li> I get a lot of &#x27;This is too spicy&#x27; with other very minty-tasting toothpastes.</li>
            <li> In many cases, the entire bottom of the unit pops open and will not form a seal, preventing the formation of a vacuum inside the unit and rendering the check valve and &amp;#34;Neat Squeeze&amp;#34; concept useless.</li>
            <li> kids generally do not like the minty flavored toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> There is a class action lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble claiming that the design is flawed and 20% or more of the toothpaste remains trapped in the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming for their sensitive taste buds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming for their sensitive taste buds.</li>
            <li> Some other brands they won&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave a aftertaste in the mouth that some other brands do.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of toothpaste the other day and tried brushing with it.</li>
            <li> The unit then will function but requires a lot of force and needs to be held against your body or some other object when squeezing to create a seal.</li>
            <li> That means the counterspace used is about the same as a small bar of soap and it stands upright so it doesn&#x27;t look messy.</li>
            <li> At the request of their dentist we follow up Kids Crest with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Children&#x27;s Anticavity Fluoride Rinse to get some fluoride on their little pearly whites.</li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s a few things I find</li>
            <li> so why waste your money</li>
            <li> it has sparkles in it, how can you not love it?</li>
            <li> One negative is the tube design that makes it difficult to squeeze out the last quarter of volume.</li>
            <li> I could hardly wait to rinse out my mouth with Listerine.</li>
            <li> My kid likes this, but this toothpaste is so thick that it clogs up the sink.  </li>
            <li> but my wife forced me into buying this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it a few times when I&#x27;m feeling sick.</li>

            <li> This is the only toothpaste that my daughter likes to use. It was great fining it at such a good price. Buy being able to buy through subscribe and save is a plus</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste that I use. It doesn&#x27;t burn, it tastes good, and importantly the bottle is shaped well so that you can get everything out of the tube. Something that is really convenient you might not think about is that this stands vertically. That means the counterspace used is about the same as a small bar of soap and it stands upright so it doesn&#x27;t look messy. There really isn&#x27;t a way other than hiding normal squeeze tubes to make them look organized after cleaning the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it has sparkles in it, how can you not love it?</li>
            <li> My kids love the taste of this toothpaste and my dentist trusts Kids Crest to do a good job cleaning teeth &#x3D; win / win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids generally do not like the minty flavored toothpastes.  They also seem to hate the fruity flavored toothpastes made by Tom&#x27;s so I needed something in between.  This product is it.  Most importantly, my dentist trusts Kids Crest, which is the major selling point for me.  At the request of their dentist we follow up Kids Crest with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Children&#x27;s Anticavity Fluoride Rinse to get some fluoride on their little pearly whites.</li>
            <li> All 6 expire in 3 months....</li>
            <li> Great value compared to the local market.  Now I have my stock up on these and won&#x27;t need to purchase for a while.  Thanks for the great value!</li>
            <li> My kid likes this, but this toothpaste is so thick that it clogs up the sink.  We switched to Aquafresh, it&#x27;s cheaper &amp; softer, and the sink no longer clogs up.</li>
            <li> This is all my 10 yr old will use. And she&#x27;s never had a cavity!</li>
            <li> Simply the best in the market for kids to protect against cavities. I use this for my toddler, who is good at spitting up the paste, than swallowing it, but I use less quantity than my older kid.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> regular toothpaste is too spicy for my kids. they love this toothpaste and it gets the job done, sounds like a winner to me!</li>
            <li> I did not think it was the bigger size when I ordered it. It was a surprise when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> Great product that we trust and love the price for bulk. Love the cap that keeps the toothpaste from drying out.</li>
            <li> Ordered Mar, found products expire Jun. How is a kid supposed to finish one 6oz tube within 2 months, not mention 6 tubes!! Should not offer such soon-to-expire products, especially in 6 tubes!! Making return now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest practically my entire life. My teeth have always been healthy (knock on wood!) so I trust the brand. I used this toothpaste as a kid and now my kids use it too. This bulk collection is great. I&#x27;m a foster parent. One thing many kids that come to my home don&#x27;t have is tooth brushes and tooth paste. I keep a collection of both things on stock so they&#x27;ll always have some when they come. I never get complaints about this toothpaste. Some other brands they won&#x27;t like the taste. Some they don&#x27;t like the texture. I get a lot of &#x27;This is too spicy&#x27; with other very minty-tasting toothpastes. But with Kid&#x27;s Crest Sparkle Fun I rarely get complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a few things I really like about this particular toothpaste. And then there&#x27;s a few things I find are &#x27;design flaws&#x27;. I&#x27;ll start out with the not-so-good things and end on a good note. My only real problem is that the bottle is made kind of ridiculously. I love that the hard plastic and flat bottom allow it to stand on it&#x27;s own. But when you get about half-way finished with the bottle you begin to have a very difficult time squeezing out the rest. And because it stands upright all of the toothpaste rests on the bottom of the bottle. It also won&#x27;t balance on it&#x27;s cap. We have to place ours upside down in jars for the toothpaste to rest on the upper half near the opening so we can easily squeeze it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I got that tidbit out of the way- here&#x27;s why I rated this toothpaste 5 stars. The toothpaste stands by itself. I find this sanitary because it&#x27;s never going to tip over into the sink or a dirty towel. The cap twists on and off. This is easy for any kid above the age of 5 to open. Toddlers probably still need a bit of help. But I like that the cap is easy enough for smaller hands to open. Makes children independent even at a young age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of this toothpaste is awesome! It&#x27;s what I would call a &#x27;bubblemint&#x27; flavor. A very mild and kind of sweet winterfresh mint. It&#x27;s blue toothpaste with sparkles in it. Kids love the sparkles- especially girls. Glitter is everything in a young princesses eyes. Even boys find it fascinating (although they&#x27;re rarely as thrilled as the girls by the sparkles). The taste is great even for younger kids. It&#x27;s not overwhelming for their sensitive taste buds. I&#x27;ve even used it a few times when I&#x27;m feeling sick. The mild taste is very easy on upset stomachs. For children&#x27;s taste-preferences it&#x27;s ideal. Although there is little glittery pits in the toothpaste, it has a very smooth texture. There is no &#x27;baking-soda&#x27; like bits in it. It&#x27;s very easy on their gums, yet foams up enough to clean their entire mouth easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my kiddos teeth seem very clean with this toothpaste. Overtime it does help whiten mouths that haven&#x27;t brushed regularly before. It keeps their breath fresh. They love the taste and will eagerly brush their teeth each night. I&#x27;d highly recommend for children ages 3 to 12. It&#x27;d also be great for pregnant women or people undergoing chemo who have sensitive taste buds and noses.t&#x27;s blue toothpaste with sparkles in it. Kids love the sparkles- especially girls.

            <li> probably good for kids because its a mild, sweet taste, but as an adult i didn&#x27;t think the taste was &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste so much because it is gives such a refreshing feeling on teeth and gum.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave a aftertaste in the mouth that some other brands do.  One negative is the tube design that makes it difficult to squeeze out the last quarter of volume.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good and encourages kids to brush effectively.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No mess and our child likes it. Decent price too.</li>
            <li> Remember how you used to like bubble gum when you were a kid? Well, I certainly do. I&#x27;d get a big chunk of it and chew and chew until the flavor was all gone. Then I&#x27;d get some more. Well, as an aging adult I just can&#x27;t stand bubble gum. What&#x27;s the deal? Why do all kids seem to like bubble gum?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, we now have a boy approaching three and it&#x27;s essential that we get him into a teeth-brushing habit. It&#x27;s difficult. My wife has tried several tricks and here&#x27;s one that seems to work. She brought home this Kid&#x27;s Crest bubble-gum flavored toothpaste. He loves it. I ran out of toothpaste the other day and tried brushing with it. Ugh! It was awful! I could hardly wait to rinse out my mouth with Listerine. But hey, it&#x27;s not for me it&#x27;s to get the boy to brush his teeth and it seems to be working. The toothpaste contains flourides. There&#x27;s a lot of warnings on the container about swallowing it. So far, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> Great price and kids love the flavor and gets them to brush!</li>
            <li> Maybe nice products but I just got FIVE of them. What happened?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mint, and that is what most toothpaste tastes like to me.&lt;br /&gt;I like the &amp;#34;neat squeeze,&amp;#34; but it works best if you store it up side down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no dentist... but they tell me brushing your teeth is important.  I figure kids teeth fall out anyway so why waste your money but my wife forced me into buying this.  So far so good, only one tooth has fallen out.</li>
            <li> Received as promised and the kids are fine with the taste.</li>
            <li> Everything perfect-  thank you...  Ray Briggs</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste: tasty (similar to bubble gum flavor), aesthetically pleasing (sparkly blue), and apparently effective since I&#x27;ve had no cavities for years. My wife, daughter, and I all use it. And the squeeze tubes have almost always worked well; I only remember one tube out of dozens that had a problem (it stopped advancing to squeeze out more, before it was empty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the tubes feel a bit wasteful; there&#x27;s quite a bit of plastic for a modest amount of toothpaste. If that concerns you, there are also traditional tubes available that have more content without all the plastic.</li>
            <li> Very good product as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I keep searching for a way to keep the kids&#x27; toothpaste neater and cleaner. This \\&quot;neat squeeze\\&quot; is neater than a regular toothpaste tube, but they still manage to get toothpaste most anywhere (floor, wall, counter, etc.). I&#x27;m talking about 4-year-old twins, so I had kind of thought I could find a tube that would make things noticeably neater. I will keep using this one as I think they&#x27;re learning how to be more careful. My 8-year-old does much better with the cleanliness thing. Now if only the lid would magically put itself back onto the top of the bottle! The kids all love the Kids&#x27; Crest toothpaste flavor, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Potential buyers should note the following regarding the &amp;#34;Neat Squeeze&amp;#34; container:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There is a class action lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble claiming that the design is flawed and 20% or more of the toothpaste remains trapped in the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In many cases, the entire bottom of the unit pops open and will not form a seal, preventing the formation of a vacuum inside the unit and rendering the check valve and &amp;#34;Neat Squeeze&amp;#34; concept useless. The unit then will function but requires a lot of force and needs to be held against your body or some other object when squeezing to create a seal.</li>
            <li> My son loves the flavor and the squeeze tube.  Anything that causes him to brush his teeth longer or more frequently is a winner in my book.  Price seemed really good too, a lot for the money IMHO.  I tried it and will stay with my adult flavors but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  If I could get the cat to use this stuff, I&#x27;d be one happy camper.</li>
            <li> My son (9 y/o) does not like super minty flavors.  He finds this tooth paste flavor acceptable.</li>
            <li> We are happy with this toothpaste -- no special characters, but my 5-year-old doesn&#x27;t mind.  It&#x27;s also recommended by his pediatric dentist.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing less of a drudge to him and it keeps the toothpaste clean so my sanity stays in tact</li>
            <li> Great transaction with this vendor, and of course, I have known the product for more than a decade. I am golden status customer, or would I say I should be treated likewise after a long time of being acquainted with a good item. Thank you. ATV</li>
            <li> will expire in March, too short to use up such a big package</li>
            <li> Very good tasting with effective cavity protection. If you just want a pleasant-tasting toothpaste, it&#x27;s fine. However, if you prefer additional qualities such a cleaning and whitening, try something else.</li>
