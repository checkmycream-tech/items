            <li>Compared to the first and famous L-Brand this one impressed me at arrival with the tiny eyeliner brush instead of 60 one way brushes nobody needs and which are big and clumsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thankful Amazon quickly issued me a credit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just bought this recently but so far I have to say I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>If you are consistent, this will give you gorgeous long lashes, I didn&#x27;t believe it till I tried it!</li>

            <li>Switched to Careprost and have been generally satisfied with the exception of my last purchase.  </li>
            <li>Continued use will keep them long and lovely.</li>
            <li>lovely long lashes...</li>
            <li>I work closely with the Latisse Rep in our area who says it is nothing but pure bimatoprost.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses this and says she doesn&#x27;t have to curl her lashes anymore, but I don&#x27;t really notice her lashes being that much longer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I would say around Christmas of last year I had the most long and thick beautiful eyelashes I ever seen.</li>
            <li>I started out using Latisse and had good results but the cost was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>It may be just me--I tend to me a little more sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>New supplier sent me a bottle that expired  months ago</li>
            <li>just full, lush, long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first used Latisse in June 2011, which a medical spa sold me at a cost of $99.00.</li>
            <li>Everyone online says you should expect to begin seeing some results at about 6-8 weeks and you should see full results at 16 weeks, but I&#x27;m getting results way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>it takes a while to see results(as stated) but my lashes are longer,thicker &amp; darker.i have also used it on my very sparse eyebrows with the same result.</li>
            <li>and he said that it had not neen written in any drug juournals thus far.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush that comes with it oppose to those thick wasteful things</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m excited to find a cheaper solution I will update you in a few weeks with my results.</li>
            <li>I allow my face to dry and use it like liner, allowing ten minutes for absorbtion before applying my Urban Decay Shadow and Maybelline Full and Soft Mascara...</li>
            <li>but it is more irritating to the eye and the skin around the eye.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After 2 weeks of dutifully using this product I see no change. I will continue to hope it will work in time.</li>
            <li> If you are consistent, this will give you gorgeous long lashes, I didn&#x27;t believe it till I tried it! Will never be without it!</li>
            <li> The person who gave this 1 star couldn&#x27;t be more wrong and needs to do some research. Latisse, Lumigan, and Careprost all work the same in growing lashes. Seriously... She needs to read up more online...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest you consult your physician prior to use merely to cover myself.&lt;br /&gt;For me this is a miracle product in hair growth and regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no side effects, and my hair is as thick as it was in my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;I thank this company for producing such a great product.</li>
            <li> Just bought this recently but so far I have to say I&#x27;m happy with it. I love the brush that comes with it oppose to those thick wasteful things Latisse uses because you only need a drop to cover both eyes and this brush does that effortlessly. I&#x27;ve used Latisse for over a year loved my results but not the price, I&#x27;m excited to find a cheaper solution I will update you in a few weeks with my results.</li>
            <li> I first used Latisse in June 2011, which a medical spa sold me at a cost of $99.00. Cheapest price around, they boasted.&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that it works great! Thick and long lashes in six weeks. Worth the $99.00 for the excellent results. Happy with Latisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then ordered Careprost here on Amazon and it works identically.&lt;br /&gt;No fall out, no brown spots, nothing negative to report, just full, lush, long lashes.&lt;br /&gt; It works well with no product waste.  You didn&#x27;t ask, but I feel like talking so I&#x27;ll also add, that I only use it in the mornings after splashing my face with water.  I allow my face to dry and use it like liner, allowing ten minutes for absorbtion before applying my Urban Decay Shadow and Maybelline Full and Soft Mascara...best mascara eva, if you don&#x27;t mind me saying. I&#x27;m 51, if that makes any difference in the review.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my eyelashes now with Careprost at a much cheaper price and it works the same.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and says she doesn&#x27;t have to curl her lashes anymore, but I don&#x27;t really notice her lashes being that much longer.  Would love honest comparison of those who have used Latisse and now use Careprost.</li>
            <li> This product works well and you will notice a difference in about 6 weeks. Continued use will keep them long and lovely.</li>
            <li> I started out using Latisse and had good results but the cost was ridiculous.  Switched to Careprost and have been generally satisfied with the exception of my last purchase.  New supplier sent me a bottle that expired  months ago and the results have been disappointing.</li>
            <li> it takes a while to see results(as stated) but my lashes are longer,thicker &amp; darker.i have also used it on my very sparse eyebrows with the same result. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I keep a back stock, use it almost daily...lovely long lashes...I wont use an eyelash curler and now I dont need to :) I have been asked if I have eyelash extensions lol</li>
            <li> I work at a Medical Spa where we sell Latisse.  I work closely with the Latisse Rep in our area who says it is nothing but pure bimatoprost.  Our surgeon says the same.  I was very excited to see this for sale online at Amazon.  It was cheaper than if I bought Latisse with my discount at my work.  However, I ordered this item almost 4 weeks ago for a birthday gift for TODAY and never received the item.  After almost 3 weeks, I contacted the seller and they replied that they would ship another asap.  Never got anything.  I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer and this is the VERY FIRST bad experience I have had with a seller on here EVER.  I would say I average about 4/5 orders from Amazon a week (purchasing for work &amp; personal use).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful Amazon quickly issued me a credit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never left a negative review anywhere at any time, but I have to say I would be wary of ordering from this seller. But will still be a faithful Amazon customer and appreciate their speedy resolution.</li>
            <li> I asked my doctor if Carepost was a generic for Latisse and he said that it had not neen written in any drug juournals thus far.  They said that they have refunded my amount for Careprost. but I haven&#x27;t verified my account.  I have no reason to doubt them though. Just thought I would pass the doc&#x27;s words along.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work like Latisse but it is more irritating to the eye and the skin around the eye.  It may be just me--I tend to me a little more sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!  Not sure why anyone would pay for the name brand when the results are the same!!  My lashes are long, thick and darker!</li>
            <li> as with all generic products, the quality of the medication is not to the level of the brand names.  I&#x27;ve used latisse and I switched to generic for money savings and I&#x27;ve maintained my thicker, longer, darker lashes with this product but my lashes havent gotten any thicker, longer, or darker since I&#x27;ve switched.  It&#x27;s cheaper but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as dramatically as the brand name product.  Good for maintenance, and I&#x27;ll probably still use it.</li>
            <li> I am already loving this product! The price is great, and there was a nice eyeliner brush included which makes applying the solution precisely a breeze. I have been applying this product for 26 days (about. 3.5 wks) and my eyelashes are already thicker and longer, even my husband can tell! I&#x27;m  eager to see what they will look like at 16 weeks. Everyone online says you should expect to begin seeing some results at about 6-8 weeks and you should see full results at 16 weeks, but I&#x27;m getting results way sooner than expected. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting thicker, longer, more beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> Its  wonderful product  for regrow lashes , for thining hairline in everybody  its a miracle product for  small money...!i love it !</li>
            <li> Compared to the first and famous L-Brand this one impressed me at arrival with the tiny eyeliner brush instead of 60 one way brushes nobody needs and which are big and clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had used the L-Brand before and wanted to keep the lashes I can only say that that worked for half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend the change to this solution.</li>
            <li> Great results! One bottle last over a month...longer, thicker lashes...love it! I will order again and tell my friends! Thanks</li>
            <li> I had very short eyelashes that when I put on mascara you still could not see them. I purchased the Bimatoprost Solution on 9-11-11 and I would say around Christmas of last year I had the most long and thick beautiful eyelashes I ever seen. I was very impatient, I thought this is not going to work and then their they were and I won&#x27;t stop using it because my lashes are beautiful and I have blue eyes and I get compliments all the time on my eyes. So take the plunge and try the product. I did not get any side effects as they claim</li>
