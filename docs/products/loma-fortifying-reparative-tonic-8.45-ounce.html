            <li>This product is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love Loma!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and smells like coconuts</li>
            <li>Had to get some of my own.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>I love Loma products.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and how it helps condition hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product was just ok.</li>
            <li>I like the nourishing oil better.</li>
            <li>The smell, the shine it puts in my hair and how healthy it keeps my hair</li>
            <li>I like the bottle better, too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and the nourishing oil and love both.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to see it being sold here.</li>
            <li>Its so silky and smooth and sleek which I love since my hair tends to friz and by puffy.</li>
            <li>Best product for dry hair!!!</li>
            <li>Never leaked and no annoying plastic caps to remove.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks these days thanks to Loma!</li>
            <li>LOVE this so much  </li>
            <li>I also love that it protects colored hair because we all know how much coloring hair costs.</li>
            <li>while leaving my hair soft and silky this tonic does tend to lend itself to a more static electric charge than the nourishing oil which leaves my hair feeling a bit heavier (although still soft and silky.)  </li>
            <li>Both are great products for smoothing out dead ends and protecting your hair from heat.</li>
            <li>I use this on my ends afterwards and to calm any fly-aways.</li>
            <li>The price was right and I will purchase it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product helps nourish your hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>There are only two differences for my bleached and colored hair between the 2: 1) smell - the nourishing oil has a more stronger vanilla scent and this tonic</li>
            <li>Really defines and holds the curls and waves!</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the Loma Oil and, while they are ok, I want my Pearatin back!</li>
            <li>I learned about Loma Organics from my hair stylist who said that they have one of the best formulas for repairing damaged hair because they ingredient list is so short compared to other&#x27;s and completely organic.</li>
            <li>This repairing tonic is able to strengthen and soften the ends of my hair which are normally dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li>Great for my long hair clients but far too greasy for my short hair clients.  </li>
            <li>A little oily, but makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li>The amazon price was much lower than the salon price</li>
            <li>I have been using Loma products for awhile now and really like them.</li>
            <li>Same great product but smaller bottle, bigger price!</li>
            <li>All of the other products I have used, I had felt the need to increase the amount that I put in my hair because it had not been able to cover all of my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my hair is always soft without feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have found that Loma allows my color to stay more vibrant for a longer time than any other colored hair treatment did.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Now with Loma I can use a relatively small amount compared to before and still have better results.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product and any other product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and little bit fruity.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>and oh so soft</li>
            <li>I have very long, think, colored hair that breaks easily at the ends due to daily blow drying, straightening or curly.</li>
            <li>I usually use about a little bit more than the size of a quarter of the serum and then work the product into the ends of my hair first while moving my way up so by the time I get to my scalp there is barely any oil left on my hands which makes my hair look shiny instead of greasy.</li>
            <li>It always makes my hair feel so soft and definitely tames flyaways.  </li>

            <li> It does last a long time because you use just a little.</li>

            <li> This product does not leave your hair greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, slightly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Nourishing Hair Oil but decided to give this tonic a go again instead this time.  </li>
            <li> so if you have a flakey scalp rub this into your scalp with a tough bristle brush for 10 minutes before you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> This product has helped my hair tremendously...keeps my hair from drying out but does not weigh it down...</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Pearatin by my hair dresser.  I have curly, slightly frizzy hair.  This product does not leave your hair greasy or weighted down.  I love Loma!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It leaves your hair like silk.  Can also be used on your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years and love it! The smell is amazing and my hair is always soft without feeling greasy or weighed down. The amazon price was much lower than the salon price so I was very excited to see it being sold here.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser put some in my hair and then straightened it. My hair was so soft and shiny, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was my hair. Had to get some of my own.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t tried this one and is great for my wavy, frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how it helps condition hair.</li>
            <li> Seen such a change in my hair!  Its so silky and smooth and sleek which I love since my hair tends to friz and by puffy. I started to see changes immediately especially once I started using the shampoo and conditioner. I love this product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product leaks everywhere!</li>
            <li> I would never be without this!  It is especially amazing for color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Loma products for awhile now and really like them. This product was just ok. I like the nourishing oil better. Product arrived on time and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shinny and oh so soft</li>
            <li> This is awesome for controlling frizz on curly hair! It helps with the fly-aways too, and adds shine! I mix it with the Loma Organics Curvature Curly Crème in my palm, then apply to damp hair and dry with a diffuser. Really defines and holds the curls and waves!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!! The smell, the shine it puts in my hair and how healthy it keeps my hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Loma Oil and, while they are ok, I want my Pearatin back! I used Pearatin three or four times a day. I like the bottle better, too. Never leaked and no annoying plastic caps to remove. It was faster than the pump, just open and pour.  Now the Pearatin is $150 for the same size bottle as this Soma product? What the heck?</li>
            <li> Amazing product and smells like coconuts</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by a friend.  After purchasing Loma on Amazon and using it for about a month now,  I have noticed a difference in my hair.  The price was right and I will purchase it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!!! I love it! A little oily, but makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li> Replaced Loma Pearatin Fortifying Repairative Serum.  Same great product but smaller bottle, bigger price!</li>
            <li> awesome organic product and lasts about a year - love!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Best product for dry hair!!! Best oil I have ever used👍</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It always makes my hair feel so soft and definitely tames flyaways.  I have used this product for years and it has always been great!</li>
