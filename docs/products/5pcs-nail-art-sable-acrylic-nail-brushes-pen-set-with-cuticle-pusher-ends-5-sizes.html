            <li>I love the Brushes</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $5 including shipping for this set.</li>
            <li>So stylish and cute.</li>
            <li>I got these mostly for the smallest one (3D nailart), I will say the point started to go out on me after awhile, but I think they are still pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>thee are exactly like described and love them makes doing my acrylic nails easier, I got fast service and was packaged great</li>
            <li>The brushes work fine</li>
            <li>Used them last night for a nail repair and they worked great.  </li>
            <li>These are rather cheaply made.</li>
            <li>cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>This set is worth triple the price, and they work fabulously.</li>
            <li>I love how these brushes come so fast and how the acrylic just slides on the nail</li>
            <li>These design is pretty cool also!</li>
            <li>They are just cheaply made, but then again I also didn&#x27;t pay very much for them.</li>
            <li>The tips fall off within the first use, but they were cheap so it offsets it.</li>
            <li>Its s good first set, but DEFINITELY not for professionals.</li>
            <li>Alway nice to have extra nail supplies</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because you really have to clean them well to get off the acrylic that \\&quot;mysteriously\\&quot; cakes on.</li>
            <li>Clean them with EACH application and save up for REAL hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Good quality, but the brushes are alittle stiff at first, but do the job well!</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, but I will be buying higher quality brushes from now on.</li>
            <li>I have used two of them a few times and both give a good balance.</li>
            <li>The handle has a good grip for me, not too long or too short.</li>
            <li>They are just pretty generic brushes nothing special</li>
            <li>I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It was a cheap enough price</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t lose much.</li>
            <li>I have used these on acrylic nails, and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Decent quality brushes, will buy again.</li>
            <li>but I have had to super glue the heads back on.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>they are good brushes i just had to glue the brush back onto a few of the handles ive only tried them once</li>
            <li>As a professional, you need the control of acrylic and these let you.</li>
            <li>They are stiff a little, as long as you dip them in the monomer for a bit, they are good to go.</li>

            <li> They work as well as the brushes I bought from Sallys.</li>
            <li> I have gone to many local stores, and the prices on nail brushes are outrageous. This set is worth triple the price, and they work fabulously. I even ordered another set.</li>
            <li> These bushes r really good for 3d art. I really like them a lot. The most thing I liked was the colors</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Used them last night for a nail repair and they worked great.  Very pleased with the brushes.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love how these brushes come so fast and how the acrylic just slides on the nail this is the second time I bought these and I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Great product. I got it 2 weeks before the expected date and I love them. The same set sells at Sally&#x27;s for close to $30.00 so I save a bunch!</li>
            <li> Decent quality brushes, will buy again.</li>
            <li> am no profecional but love this brushes great price and arived just as promissed, great for learning how to do nails on my own..</li>
            <li> Exacly what I was expecting, I just don&#x27;t like how long I have to wait for these it seems like all nail products take so long to arrive.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles get clogged with the acrylic mixture no matter what you do. I tried cleaning the brush between each nail application, with water, acrylic liquid, and constant toweling, but none of these things worked. I guess you get what you pay for, but I will be buying higher quality brushes from now on. I only got one use out of each brush, as they were rock hard after every use.</li>
            <li> They are just pretty generic brushes nothing special but they get the job done no doubt about it. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes to add to my collection of acrylic supplies. I give it 3 stars because you really have to clean them well to get off the acrylic that \\&quot;mysteriously\\&quot; cakes on. It was a cheap enough price so I didn&#x27;t lose much. These are great brushes but you REALLY have to watch it or you will ruin them. Clean them with EACH application and save up for REAL hair brushes.</li>

            <li> Alway nice to have extra nail supplies and these was prefect for my needs. Thank You. I love the Brushes</li>

            <li> cheap brushes. They are good for practicing however to get good at acrylic application you do need good brushes. These won&#x27;t help with that.</li>
            <li> These are not sable and the acrylic sticks to them.  They fan out when you use them.  Good for one use if you can get through 10 nails.</li>
            <li> they are good brushes i just had to glue the brush back onto a few of the handles ive only tried them once but they seem good</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST ACRYLIC BRUSHES IVE COME ACROSS. I HAVE TRIED THE GEL BRUSH FROM THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE AND IT CLUMPED UP THE BRISTLES AND ATE AWAY AT THE HANDLE IF ANY OF THE LIQUID GOT ON THE HANDLE. THESE DO NEITHER. WELL WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes . So stylish and cute. Arrived earlier than expected. Does both jobs great. I loved the colors. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> The tip at the ends of these brushes is perfect for nail art.  The cuticle pushing ends are great and work like a charm!</li>
            <li> I hate them. The yellow brush broke when I tried using it.. acrylic. Sticks to brush. Blah blah. Brushes just suck period. I will not buy them again. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> thee are exactly like described and love them makes doing my acrylic nails easier, I got fast service and was packaged great</li>
