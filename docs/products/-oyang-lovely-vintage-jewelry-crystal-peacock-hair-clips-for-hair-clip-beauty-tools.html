            <li>This review would be five stars if not for the fact that shipping from china takes for-fricken-ever and a cost effective warehouse would benefit this company.</li>

            <li>I also bought extra to give as gifts, this is a really great gift at a really great price.</li>
            <li>large and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>being said this item just arrived 3 weeks ahead of schedule and is absolutely breathtaking-ly beautiful.</li>
            <li>its very well made, and just beautiful.</li>

            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours truly; Drew Boger-Brewster</li>

            <li>I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift for Christmas (stocking stuffer), lovely colors.</li>
            <li>it is more like a broach than a hair clip.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Absolutely gorgeous and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I read the reviews so felt quite safe in ordering this item even though I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 4 more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the color</li>
            <li>hope to see more colors soon</li>

            <li>Just Ok... price &#x3D; quality</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how most people end up wearing it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this clip.</li>
            <li>Bright, fun and cute.</li>
            <li>I will hopefully be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better looking in person.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it was more substantial</li>
            <li>It is definitely more for show than as a functional hair clip.</li>
            <li>This is affordable and stunning.</li>
            <li>Receive many compliments when I wear them.</li>
            <li>Now this is the best one, I truly love this one , my favorite color  , need some more different colors</li>
            <li>I love the way it holds my hair, and</li>
            <li>I recieved many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li>My friend really appreciated this gift--green is her favorite color, and she had tears in her eyes when she thanked me afterwards, she has beautiful hair and this will help her feel special...</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s weight, fine hair may not be able to hold it.</li>
            <li>I have bought 4 of these in different colors, and they are all beautiful and elegant.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in every style they have available.</li>
            <li>I loved these so much</li>
            <li>Will make a interesting, unique gift.  </li>
            <li>This looks like it easily could sell for $15.</li>
            <li>Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>Exactly as showed in the picture, nice colors.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful clips - this is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Back when I used to have hair (I&#x27;m undergoing chemo), I bought this beautiful hair clip.  </li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my friend because she has curly black hair and the clip stays in her hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It also stores easily clipped to a purse pocket and stays secure when not in use.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty!</li>
            <li>and it is huge.</li>
            <li>The size if perfect for pinning my hair up; it&#x27;s just too heavy.</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic item for the price.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t be concerned with the price tag, just enjoy the beauty.</li>
            <li>Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented.</li>
            <li>Shipping took a long time, but the piece was beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Had already bought one  in purple and loved it enough to order more colors.  </li>
            <li>but I still think that it is very nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>beautiful more than just a little.</li>
            <li>It is pretty huge and I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this hairclip so much!  </li>
            <li>This clip was able to do that and it looks so fancy and pretty and looks costly....</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like it might be tiny, but its beautiful and large!</li>
            <li>beautiful and heavy, much nicer than I expected-ordering more for christmas gifts!</li>
            <li>, I wish that I had gotten it instead, When I open the package, it was just amazing and very pretty, we both had fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>Cool style &amp; coloring.</li>
            <li>Quality is good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>item is absolutely lovely high quality product!  </li>
            <li>It was nice for the price, if you are accustomed to cheap, yet pretty hair pieces normally bought from a dollar store.</li>
            <li>This clip was stunning online, but to have it in my hand, then in my hair, really blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
            <li>The stones are well set and the color is fairly true to the photo.</li>
            <li>Though I do say that is bigger than the picture, but its a good buy</li>
            <li>This clip is strong, durable, and pretty.</li>
            <li>The clip is very pretty and looks good with my red hair.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was amazed by the size and heft of it but knew it would be OK, because the giftee has an incredible head of hair - lots of it, and long enough to carry a pin like this.</li>
            <li>more in a different color for me and 2 in 2 more colors for my sister and mother.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and well made.</li>
            <li>Beautiful green color peacock.</li>
            <li>my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO pretty!</li>
            <li>and it is as pretty as it shows in the picture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anyone wear such a stunning piece of hair jewelry!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too pretty to pass up!</li>
            <li>It looks great in a mess of curled hair.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>It is beautifully made with pretty green stones.</li>
            <li>,it took 4 weeks to get here,but I already knew it would take a while,the price makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others.</li>
            <li>Way worth what i paid .</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li>Heavy set hairpin that is very well made, crystals are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at the measurements and it is very large.  </li>
            <li>However, it is very large.</li>
            <li>My hair is mid length and very fine.</li>
            <li>was very sad,its very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>It is stunning and will add glamour to a simple hair bun or ponytail!</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s pretty, so I just put my hair in an up do and use it to accessorize the look.  </li>
            <li>This piece is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Like I said, the clip itself is quite pretty.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more</li>
            <li>It is so pretty</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it a crafter/artisan at a show noticed it as I was looking at her work</li>
            <li>This looks SO pretty</li>
            <li>Those clips are much larger than I expected yet are just great.</li>
            <li>I was expected some jewels to be missing or something for the price, but it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It takes up my whole head pretty much!</li>
            <li>Nice design at good price, but a little too heavy as it&#x27;s made of molded alloy.  </li>
            <li>Very elegant and of a heavy metal.  </li>
            <li>Then again, I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>I must say this clip is much prettier in real life!</li>
            <li>Shipping took several months but other than that it looks and works great.</li>
            <li>Despite of being quite heavy hold hair well and look very elegant.</li>
            <li>, it was strong enough to hold up a large bun all by itself.</li>
            <li>they are large, 5-6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is fairly large, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>It cost virtually nothing at all and was certainly cheaper than a plastic hair clip from Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>They are large, and quite sturdy, and one holds my hair up for the whole day.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fast enough considering it&#x27;s free shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li>Did not get green only turquoise workmanship was great</li>
            <li>Very resonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Really....</li>
            <li>I already got compliments on it and people couldn&#x27;t believe how much I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>The clasp holds very well in my hair.</li>
            <li>Got it really fast</li>
            <li>2day, fast ship fr: China.</li>
            <li>Very Happy,ThankU.</li>
            <li>I really like this peacock hair clip.</li>
            <li>Very Sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually much lovelier in person than it is online.</li>
            <li>I may have to wait until my hair is much longer to wear it, and then clip it when my hair is in a ponytail or something.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy hair clip.</li>
            <li>The clip was better than expected.</li>
            <li>The clip itself holds very well</li>
            <li>Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
            <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy hair clip.</li>
            <li>I get complemented on them everyday and that feels nice.</li>
            <li>It is a nice green color, sparkly etc.</li>
            <li>as i  have kind of thick very curly hair,  it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I have long hair and they are fine to hold it and</li>
            <li>and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait</li>
            <li>I can wear it comfortably all day long.</li>
            <li>I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted.</li>
            <li>I was please with the quality, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>Seriously I am not some robot paid by this company to comment...</li>
            <li>Very pretty but too big!</li>
            <li>Very pretty, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li>Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li>Wow, this hair pin was so large.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The area around the neck and dark green beads holds it great, but at the tail end, my hair just sort of slides out, and isn&#x27;t being gripped at all.</li>
            <li>Nothing cheap about this clip.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived almost 3 weeks before expected delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>i bought a few more</li>
            <li>the only problem is there is a long delivery time for it, satisfied with product</li>
            <li>Although it took what seems like an extra long time to arrive, once it did - I was quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Very heavy and best for thick hair.</li>
            <li>They are not only very lovely and eye-catching, they are also quite hardy and so well made that they hold secure even with my thick hair!!</li>
            <li>This would probably be great for someone with thick or very long hair.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but took way to long to get here.</li>
            <li>Amazing  heavy duty and having super thick Italian hair it holds it will defiantly be buying more in different colors</li>
            <li>Clip and overall pin seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>This thing is bigger than it&#x27;s picture indicates, it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li>so I was actually pleasantly surprised when they arrived!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several compliments on how pretty this clip is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy but looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>Would love to see one in black and another in white.</li>
            <li>It is a clamp type (similar to a ficcare) but it has little teeth inside to help grip your hair more.  </li>
            <li>This is an item you dont see frequently.</li>
            <li>( one of the perm&#x27;s of getting old)</li>
            <li>Light weight, but not cheap.</li>
            <li>but order early if this is for an event or gift.</li>
            <li>I was really suprised when it came in at how big it is.</li>
            <li>Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li>These clips are large and heavy and slide out of my hair if I don&#x27;t first use a hair band (those covered elastic bands like a rubber band).  </li>
            <li>I would consider this a large hair ornament.&lt;br /&gt;Great for long hair being put up.</li>
            <li>It is large and will hold up long hair.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s fairly large, it&#x27;s not loud</li>
            <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be barrettes, but they are alligator clips hold my bangs back very well.</li>
            <li>if  you have thin straight hair i imagine it would slide right out.  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore this, one of the larger green stones came out.  </li>
            <li>its on the large side but not to heavy</li>
            <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> yet I don&#x27;t think it will look nice on my head.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are nice gifts for anyone.</li>
            <li> This review would be five stars if not for the fact that shipping from china takes for-fricken-ever and a cost effective warehouse would benefit this company.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> And would like nice</li>
            <li> It was in a nice packaging and nice quality.</li>

            <li> i would have liked to have got it.</li>
            <li> Love this, it looks great and the price is even better.</li>
            <li> But a great way to dress up your hair for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> It may take a while to reach here since it ships from Asia, but it is absolutely beautiful and worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Very cute and stylish hair clips.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments, and will probably be ordering in more colors!</li>
            <li> OK , then, nice hairpiece.</li>
            <li> if you are thinking of them for gifts, they are super nice in that the jewels are good quality and well set.</li>
            <li> I also bought extra to give as gifts, this is a really great gift at a really great price.</li>
            <li> large and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> being said this item just arrived 3 weeks ahead of schedule and is absolutely breathtaking-ly beautiful.</li>
            <li> its very well made, and just beautiful.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but if you have more than fine hair, forget about it.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours truly; Drew Boger-Brewster</li>
            <li> I got more of an aqua color.  </li>
            <li> Order it,it will be one of your favorite hair accessories.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I need more hair to wear it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> The colors are stunning.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift for Christmas (stocking stuffer), lovely colors.</li>
            <li> it is more like a broach than a hair clip.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews so felt quite safe in ordering this item even though I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 4 more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the color</li>
            <li> hope to see more colors soon</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and worth the wait</li>
            <li> Just Ok... price &#x3D; quality</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how most people end up wearing it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this clip.</li>
            <li> Bright, fun and cute.</li>
            <li> I will hopefully be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better looking in person.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it was more substantial</li>
            <li> It is definitely more for show than as a functional hair clip.</li>
            <li> This is affordable and stunning.</li>
            <li> Receive many compliments when I wear them.</li>
            <li> Now this is the best one, I truly love this one , my favorite color  , need some more different colors</li>
            <li> I love the way it holds my hair, and</li>
            <li> I recieved many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> My friend really appreciated this gift--green is her favorite color, and she had tears in her eyes when she thanked me afterwards, she has beautiful hair and this will help her feel special...</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s weight, fine hair may not be able to hold it.</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 of these in different colors, and they are all beautiful and elegant.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in every style they have available.</li>
            <li> I loved these so much</li>
            <li> Will make a interesting, unique gift.  </li>
            <li> This looks like it easily could sell for $15.</li>
            <li> Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Exactly as showed in the picture, nice colors.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful clips - this is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Back when I used to have hair (I&#x27;m undergoing chemo), I bought this beautiful hair clip.  </li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my friend because she has curly black hair and the clip stays in her hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It also stores easily clipped to a purse pocket and stays secure when not in use.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty!</li>
            <li> and it is huge.</li>
            <li> The size if perfect for pinning my hair up; it&#x27;s just too heavy.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic item for the price.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be concerned with the price tag, just enjoy the beauty.</li>
            <li> Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time, but the piece was beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Had already bought one  in purple and loved it enough to order more colors.  </li>
            <li> but I still think that it is very nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> beautiful more than just a little.</li>
            <li> It is pretty huge and I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this hairclip so much!  </li>
            <li> This clip was able to do that and it looks so fancy and pretty and looks costly....</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like it might be tiny, but its beautiful and large!</li>
            <li> beautiful and heavy, much nicer than I expected-ordering more for christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> , I wish that I had gotten it instead, When I open the package, it was just amazing and very pretty, we both had fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> Cool style &amp; coloring.</li>
            <li> Quality is good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> item is absolutely lovely high quality product!  </li>
            <li> It was nice for the price, if you are accustomed to cheap, yet pretty hair pieces normally bought from a dollar store.</li>
            <li> This clip was stunning online, but to have it in my hand, then in my hair, really blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
            <li> The stones are well set and the color is fairly true to the photo.</li>
            <li> Though I do say that is bigger than the picture, but its a good buy</li>
            <li> This clip is strong, durable, and pretty.</li>
            <li> The clip is very pretty and looks good with my red hair.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was amazed by the size and heft of it but knew it would be OK, because the giftee has an incredible head of hair - lots of it, and long enough to carry a pin like this.</li>
            <li> more in a different color for me and 2 in 2 more colors for my sister and mother.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made.</li>
            <li> Beautiful green color peacock.</li>
            <li> my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO pretty!</li>
            <li> and it is as pretty as it shows in the picture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anyone wear such a stunning piece of hair jewelry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pretty to pass up!</li>
            <li> It looks great in a mess of curled hair.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> It is beautifully made with pretty green stones.</li>
            <li> ,it took 4 weeks to get here,but I already knew it would take a while,the price makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others.</li>
            <li> Way worth what i paid .</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li> Heavy set hairpin that is very well made, crystals are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the measurements and it is very large.  </li>
            <li> However, it is very large.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid length and very fine.</li>
            <li> was very sad,its very pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> It is stunning and will add glamour to a simple hair bun or ponytail!</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s pretty, so I just put my hair in an up do and use it to accessorize the look.  </li>
            <li> This piece is really pretty.</li>
            <li> Like I said, the clip itself is quite pretty.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more</li>
            <li> It is so pretty</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it a crafter/artisan at a show noticed it as I was looking at her work</li>
            <li> This looks SO pretty</li>
            <li> Those clips are much larger than I expected yet are just great.</li>
            <li> I was expected some jewels to be missing or something for the price, but it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It takes up my whole head pretty much!</li>
            <li> Nice design at good price, but a little too heavy as it&#x27;s made of molded alloy.  </li>
            <li> Very elegant and of a heavy metal.  </li>
            <li> Then again, I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> I must say this clip is much prettier in real life!</li>
            <li> Shipping took several months but other than that it looks and works great.</li>
            <li> Despite of being quite heavy hold hair well and look very elegant.</li>
            <li> , it was strong enough to hold up a large bun all by itself.</li>
            <li> they are large, 5-6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is fairly large, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It cost virtually nothing at all and was certainly cheaper than a plastic hair clip from Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> They are large, and quite sturdy, and one holds my hair up for the whole day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fast enough considering it&#x27;s free shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li> Did not get green only turquoise workmanship was great</li>
            <li> Very resonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Really....</li>
            <li> I already got compliments on it and people couldn&#x27;t believe how much I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> The clasp holds very well in my hair.</li>
            <li> Got it really fast</li>
            <li> 2day, fast ship fr: China.</li>
            <li> Very Happy,ThankU.</li>
            <li> I really like this peacock hair clip.</li>
            <li> Very Sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually much lovelier in person than it is online.</li>
            <li> I may have to wait until my hair is much longer to wear it, and then clip it when my hair is in a ponytail or something.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy hair clip.</li>
            <li> The clip was better than expected.</li>
            <li> The clip itself holds very well</li>
            <li> Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
            <li> The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy hair clip.</li>
            <li> I get complemented on them everyday and that feels nice.</li>
            <li> It is a nice green color, sparkly etc.</li>
            <li> as i  have kind of thick very curly hair,  it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I have long hair and they are fine to hold it and</li>
            <li> and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait</li>
            <li> I can wear it comfortably all day long.</li>
            <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted.</li>
            <li> I was please with the quality, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> Seriously I am not some robot paid by this company to comment...</li>
            <li> Very pretty but too big!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li> Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li> Wow, this hair pin was so large.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> The area around the neck and dark green beads holds it great, but at the tail end, my hair just sort of slides out, and isn&#x27;t being gripped at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing cheap about this clip.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived almost 3 weeks before expected delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> i bought a few more</li>
            <li> the only problem is there is a long delivery time for it, satisfied with product</li>
            <li> Although it took what seems like an extra long time to arrive, once it did - I was quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy and best for thick hair.</li>
            <li> They are not only very lovely and eye-catching, they are also quite hardy and so well made that they hold secure even with my thick hair!!</li>
            <li> This would probably be great for someone with thick or very long hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but took way to long to get here.</li>
            <li> Amazing  heavy duty and having super thick Italian hair it holds it will defiantly be buying more in different colors</li>
            <li> Clip and overall pin seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> This thing is bigger than it&#x27;s picture indicates, it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li> so I was actually pleasantly surprised when they arrived!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several compliments on how pretty this clip is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy but looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> Would love to see one in black and another in white.</li>
            <li> It is a clamp type (similar to a ficcare) but it has little teeth inside to help grip your hair more.  </li>
            <li> This is an item you dont see frequently.</li>
            <li> ( one of the perm&#x27;s of getting old)</li>
            <li> Light weight, but not cheap.</li>
            <li> but order early if this is for an event or gift.</li>
            <li> I was really suprised when it came in at how big it is.</li>
            <li> Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> These clips are large and heavy and slide out of my hair if I don&#x27;t first use a hair band (those covered elastic bands like a rubber band).  </li>
            <li> I would consider this a large hair ornament.&lt;br /&gt;Great for long hair being put up.</li>
            <li> It is large and will hold up long hair.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s fairly large, it&#x27;s not loud</li>
            <li> I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be barrettes, but they are alligator clips hold my bangs back very well.</li>
            <li> if  you have thin straight hair i imagine it would slide right out.  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore this, one of the larger green stones came out.  </li>
            <li> its on the large side but not to heavy</li>
            <li> These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if very fine hair would hold it, but my hair is medium to thick and curly and holds it</li>
            <li> I have rather fine but thick hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it works with other types of hair.</li>
            <li> It is really BIG - If you have a pixie cute, thin hair or some other problem, do NOT buy this pin.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it photographs much nicer than it looks in person.</li>
            <li> I have long fine thin hair and bought this clip to dress it up.</li>
            <li> but Metal and well made, feel they will last a long time for such an inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> the scale of small, medium or large.  </li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t planning on using it as the only thing to keep your hair in place, I would recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> It is flashy, inexpensive,big, comfortable and has not pulled a hair on my head.</li>
            <li> It is about 4 inches long and has some weight to it.  </li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> Around as long as my hand.</li>
            <li> I wear this clip in my hair when I twist my long hair and put it up.</li>
            <li> If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time.</li>
            <li> Bigger Than expected, about 4 1/2 inches from the tail to the face.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it again, and will in the future order other hair clips from this seller.</li>
            <li> It was almost as long as my head!</li>
            <li> This hair clip took a very long time to arrive from China.</li>
            <li> but I seriously can&#x27;t get it to stay in place because it weighs so much.</li>
            <li> I have three different colours in these now, the blue, the purple and the green.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the clip is on the heavy side and it has to be placed carefully to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like 7in long and 4in wide.</li>
            <li> i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> The clip isn&#x27;t strong enough to stay put by itself, which is a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> A little bit larger than the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> Avaiable in a wide range of colors.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> As much as I like heft in quality, this is just a tad heavy, even for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This came a few weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the dark green stones in the middle of the body look shinier in the picture than in reality.</li>
            <li> Much larger (over 4\\&quot; in length) than I expected and very heavy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have fine and thin hair, and did not have enough hair for clip to hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure anyone who buys it won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> They can be used in other ways too -</li>
            <li> and I usually need a big clip to hold up my hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Would still like to get other colors</li>
            <li> Will be getting other colors aswell 😊</li>
            <li> I immediately purchased additional colors to go with other outfits.</li>
            <li> They were packaged with extreme care.</li>
            <li> The photos do them absolutely no justice!</li>
            <li> the coloring in so sharp and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kinda big and a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but a little heavy on the head and now useless with a missing stone.</li>
            <li> It starts to pull my hair down and by midday, I have to remove it.</li>
            <li> cant wait to order other colors!</li>
            <li> Arrived in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, black and shoulder long and</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year now, and unfortunately I might have to order a new one soon, since I&#x27;ve been having problems with the pin staying in the clasp to keep it all together.  </li>
            <li> x 2-3&amp;#34;, not for the little girls</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it is very heavy and difficult to wear in a lot of styles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints here!!!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the purple clip and needed the green for a friend to accessorize for a wedding.</li>
            <li> Heavy for the hair.  </li>
            <li> I got it to wear on the side of chemo caps but this one is so poorly made that I likely won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few colors for self, daughter and gifts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect forest green with lime green accents&lt;</li>
            <li> However the shipping took forever to begin with and was even a week late from the expected date.</li>
            <li> However, it is a heavy clip, so thin/fine hair probably wont work with it.</li>
            <li> It was heavy, though, and needed &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not cheap</li>
            <li> However when I got it it was was way to big(and heavy).</li>
            <li> To heavy to stay in your hair</li>
            <li> i have thick long curly hair and my moms hair is shorter and thin wavy and works for her hair aswell.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect and sometimes my hair starts to slip, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> No more plastic clips for me!  </li>
            <li> its that big :(</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair not for you.  </li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Was unable to track the package, was getting worried.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices.</li>

            <li> Very lovely pin.  It is about 4 inches long and has some weight to it.  It stays fairly well in my hair when I twist and wear it up.  It is not perfect and sometimes my hair starts to slip, but that is to be expected.  The clip is very pretty and looks good with my red hair.  You cannot wear this as a side hair clip because of the size but it is perfect for wearing your hair up.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours truly; Drew Boger-Brewster</li>
            <li> Nice heavy hair clip. It&#x27;s beautiful and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is pretty huge and I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it. Looks sturdy though and the stones are well set. I am thinking of what I can do with this as I don&#x27;t think I can use it on my hair. My hair is thick, black and shoulder long and yet I don&#x27;t think it will look nice on my head. My husband laughed when he saw the size of the clip... its that big :(</li>
            <li> I like it, because it have a uniqueness to it. Cool style &amp; coloring. This is an item you dont see frequently.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made. Very resonably priced.  Very heavy and best for thick hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore this, one of the larger green stones came out.  Contacted seller, and they responded they had no record of my purchase.  Very pretty, but a little heavy on the head and now useless with a missing stone.</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> Really.... Big. Around as long as my hand. But gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The clip is gorgeous.  I already got compliments on it and people couldn&#x27;t believe how much I paid for it.  The problem is that the color that I got wasn&#x27;t the one pictures.  I got more of an aqua color.  It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The colors are prettier than pictured. I had purchased the purple clip and needed the green for a friend to accessorize for a wedding.</li>
            <li> Arrived in less than two weeks. That&#x27;s fast enough considering it&#x27;s free shipping from overseas. Exactly as showed in the picture, nice colors. 4.7&amp;#34; is a bit big for me but can&#x27;t complain since I should have known that before placing the order. Quality is good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful. Almost the size of my hand. The price is right too. I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Just ordered 3 more.  ! more in a different color for me and 2 in 2 more colors for my sister and mother.</li>
            <li> This vintage crystal peacock hair clip is just as a hoped it would be,absolutely stunning,not cheeping looking at all.The clasp holds very well in my hair.Shipping took a while but it was coming from China,it took 4 weeks to get here,but I already knew it would take a while,the price makes it worth it.Order it,it will be one of your favorite hair accessories.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  Heavy for the hair.  If you have thin hair not for you.  My daughter has thick curly hair.  Just looks beautiful on her.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I have three different colours in these now, the blue, the purple and the green. They are all perfect, and I get tons of compliments when I wear them. They come well packaged and in great condition. I definitely recommend buying them. It may take a while to reach here since it ships from Asia, but it is absolutely beautiful and worth the wait. I&#x27;m sure anyone who buys it won&#x27;t be disappointed. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it looks beautiful. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This clip is fairly sturdy and keeps all of my shoulder lengh hair up.  I have gotten many compliments, and will probably be ordering in more colors!</li>
            <li> Wow, this hair pin was so large. The picture makes it look like it might be tiny, but its beautiful and large!</li>
            <li> Will make a interesting, unique gift.  Avaiable in a wide range of colors.  Clip and overall pin seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> I received this almost 2 weeks before predicted arrival date. I was expected some jewels to be missing or something for the price, but it was in perfect condition. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It&#x27;s SO pretty! My only problem with it is how it holds the hair. I have rather fine but thick hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it works with other types of hair. The area around the neck and dark green beads holds it great, but at the tail end, my hair just sort of slides out, and isn&#x27;t being gripped at all.</li>
            <li> It does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter kept oohing and ahhing over this gorgeous pieces of hair jewelry, because that is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair clip is so amazing.  Very elegant and of a heavy metal.  It is a clamp type (similar to a ficcare) but it has little teeth inside to help grip your hair more.  I&#x27;m not sure if very fine hair would hold it, but my hair is medium to thick and curly and holds it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take about a month or so to get.  I will be ordering more from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful clips - this is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased. They are large, and quite sturdy, and one holds my hair up for the whole day. They can be used in other ways too - they look good clipped onto a jacket lapel or collar. Whichever way you want to use them you&#x27;ll be sure to get compliments!</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it photographs much nicer than it looks in person. I got it to wear on the side of chemo caps but this one is so poorly made that I likely won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a gift for my mom, and it is even more beautiful than in the picture. I was please with the quality, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful green color peacock. I get alot of compliments on my hair accessories. Would love to see one in black and another in white.</li>
            <li> Nice! Got it really fast and it is as pretty as it shows in the picture! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOW!! great product and it is huge. I need more hair to wear it. I am glad I ordered. Great buy</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and fast shipping. I love this item! This hair clip is very beautiful. The colors are stunning. I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> beautiful and heavy, much nicer than I expected-ordering more for christmas gifts! they are large, 5-6&amp;#34; x 2-3&amp;#34;, not for the little girls</li>
            <li> do not know how they can make an item like this for the price they sell it for. the only problem is there is a long delivery time for it, satisfied with product</li>
            <li> Very nice hair pin for the price, kinda heavy but beautiful glow and color, perfect for people with lots of hair</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. However it is much bigger than appears, as about 5&amp;#34; across. But a great way to dress up your hair for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> My friend really appreciated this gift--green is her favorite color, and she had tears in her eyes when she thanked me afterwards, she has beautiful hair and this will help her feel special...</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of all the items I purchased,  I am now looking for some horse hair clips. I just hope I can find some at this provider.</li>
            <li> Rcv&#x27;d 2day, fast ship fr: China. item is absolutely lovely high quality product!  Very Happy,ThankU.</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for each side of my pony tail. I like them and have gotten compliments while wearing them. These clips are large and heavy and slide out of my hair if I don&#x27;t first use a hair band (those covered elastic bands like a rubber band).  I make a regular pony tail and then clip the peacocks on either side of the pony tail, covering the elastic band.  The peacocks have never fallen out of my hair when clipping them in this waythis way.</li>
            <li> I love this hairclip so much!  I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year now, and unfortunately I might have to order a new one soon, since I&#x27;ve been having problems with the pin staying in the clasp to keep it all together.  Then again, I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> Clip is great. It is flashy, inexpensive,big, comfortable and has not pulled a hair on my head. I have bought a few colors for self, daughter and gifts.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 6 stars! I&#x27;ve never seen anyone wear such a stunning piece of hair jewelry! Incredible price and the photos online don&#x27;t do this hair clip justice. It is stunning and will add glamour to a simple hair bun or ponytail!</li>
            <li> I really like this peacock hair clip. It is beautifully made with pretty green stones. It is fairly large, which I don&#x27;t mind. The size if perfect for pinning my hair up; it&#x27;s just too heavy. It starts to pull my hair down and by midday, I have to remove it. This would probably be great for someone with thick or very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long fine thin hair and bought this clip to dress it up. The only draw back is that the clip is on the heavy side and it has to be placed carefully to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I must say this clip is much prettier in real life! Not only that but it is big in size. I have long, thick hair and I usually need a big clip to hold up my hair. This clip was able to do that and it looks so fancy and pretty and looks costly....but it&#x27;s not!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It was nice for the price, if you are accustomed to cheap, yet pretty hair pieces normally bought from a dollar store.</li>
            <li> As much as I like heft in quality, this is just a tad heavy, even for my thick hair. I just adore the color, quality and price though</li>
            <li> OK , then, nice hairpiece. Gave it as a gift for Christmas (stocking stuffer), lovely colors. The recipient will be pleased!</li>
            <li> The piece was beautiful.  I didn&#x27;t look at the measurements and it is very large.  it is more like a broach than a hair clip.  It weighs several ounces and it much too heavy for anyone to wear.  I can&#x27;t get it to stay in my hair even if I put all my hair in it.  I have shoulder length, thick hair.  For a play or community drama one might find a purpose.  Or as a scarf or sweater pin, but it is of no use for hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, the colors are amazing and it looks great. Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down. Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This clip was stunning online, but to have it in my hand, then in my hair, really blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality. Nothing cheap about this clip.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived almost 3 weeks before expected delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again!</li>
            <li> It is a bigger than I thought but I still think that it is very nice, especially for the price.I have purchase in 3 colors and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous and at such a great price. These are nice gifts for anyone. Very cute and stylish hair clips. :)</li>
            <li> This thing is bigger than it&#x27;s picture indicates, it&#x27;s really pretty and it&#x27;s well made. The finish takes out some of the glare and adds to it&#x27;s beauty. It took time to get here but it was great when it did. This review would be five stars if not for the fact that shipping from china takes for-fricken-ever and a cost effective warehouse would benefit this company.</li>
            <li> bought this to attach to a veil for the peacock themed wedding and it was perfect size.  I removed the clip part on the back and sewed it on the back of the comb on the veil.  Very Sturdy.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my friend because she has curly black hair and the clip stays in her hair perfectly.  This was too heavy for my straight blond hair but it&#x27;s great if you have some wave for the clip to hang on to.  It&#x27;s a little heavy but looks amazing!  She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I like it but I wish I can just slip it on but I didn&#x27;t think it was big  and won&#x27;t stay on . You have to have your hair up or in a bun . And would like nice</li>
            <li> I read the reviews so felt quite safe in ordering this item even though I couldn&#x27;t. Get over how inexpensive it was. I ordered two and gave one away as a gift. This looks like it easily could sell for $15. Well made and makes quite the glassy statement. No more plastic clips for me!  Shipping is slower than what I am used to but I orders the items and forgot about them so I was actually pleasantly surprised when they arrived! ( one of the perm&#x27;s of getting old) I just ordered 4 more.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> This hair clip was a pleasant surprise. Much larger (over 4\\&quot; in length) than I expected and very heavy and sturdy. The stones are well set and the color is fairly true to the photo. Because of it&#x27;s weight, fine hair may not be able to hold it. I would definitely recommend this piece!I have also ordered this in the coral color with the same satisfaction.</li>
            <li> The clip isn&#x27;t strong enough to stay put by itself, which is a little disappointing.  I think the problem is with the gap between the clip and the tines.  I still think it&#x27;s pretty, so I just put my hair in an up do and use it to accessorize the look.  As long as you aren&#x27;t planning on using it as the only thing to keep your hair in place, I would recommend this item.  It&#x27;s too pretty to pass up!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect forest green with lime green accents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see more colors soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> It is wonderful. It is very Nice and looks great in my hair.  I got this before Thanksgiving and I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is so nice, it&#x27;s made well and looks great in my hair. I bought a couple of these in different colors. I do recommend this hairclip.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> this clip is very elaborate. It&#x27;s also kinda big and a little heavy. if  you have thin straight hair i imagine it would slide right out.  as i  have kind of thick very curly hair,  it works pretty well</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and worth the wait</li>
            <li> Just Ok... price &#x3D; quality</li>
            <li> This piece is really pretty. It&#x27;s actually much lovelier in person than it is online. But ohmigerd it&#x27;s gigantic. I&#x27;m growing out a pixie and have a lot of hair but I seriously can&#x27;t get it to stay in place because it weighs so much. The hair that it&#x27;s holding ends up just drooping. I may have to wait until my hair is much longer to wear it, and then clip it when my hair is in a ponytail or something. I don&#x27;t know how most people end up wearing it. I may try to pin it to my winter coat or something so I get some use out of it. Like I said, the clip itself is quite pretty.</li>
            <li> Back when I used to have hair (I&#x27;m undergoing chemo), I bought this beautiful hair clip.  It cost virtually nothing at all and was certainly cheaper than a plastic hair clip from Wal-Mart.  It looks hand-made and none of the stones have fallen out yet.  I look forward to using it again, and will in the future order other hair clips from this seller.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy hair clip. A little bit larger than the palm of my hand. Very cute for an up-do for  the daytime or evening out.</li>
            <li> Did not get green only turquoise workmanship was great just wish I had the colors I ordered&lt;br /&gt;Would still like to get other colors</li>
            <li> This hair clip took a very long time to arrive from China. Be forewarned. When it arrived, I was amazed by the size and heft of it but knew it would be OK, because the giftee has an incredible head of hair - lots of it, and long enough to carry a pin like this. It is really BIG - If you have a pixie cute, thin hair or some other problem, do NOT buy this pin. The giftee loved it, however and it was just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Good gift and well packaged and in good condition was a nice thing for me to do</li>
            <li> My sister is into thing that are different, and when she seen this she had me order it for her and I did, I wish that I had gotten it instead, When I open the package, it was just amazing and very pretty, we both had fallen in love with it. Though I do say that is bigger than the picture, but its a good buy i&#x27;m thinking of getting another one</li>
            <li> This is beautiful! I get so many compliments when I wear this clip.</li>
            <li> Shipping took several months but other than that it looks and works great.</li>
            <li> It was in a nice packaging and nice quality.It looks great .I will buy more and its a great gift</li>
            <li> Those clips are much larger than I expected yet are just great. Despite of being quite heavy hold hair well and look very elegant.</li>
            <li> Seriously I am not some robot paid by this company to comment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said this item just arrived 3 weeks ahead of schedule and is absolutely breathtaking-ly beautiful. It&#x27;s sturdy, It&#x27;s attractive and is perfect to hold my hair. If your considering purchasing...DO IT! You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> We love the hair clip, and the color, good quality for the price. However the shipping took forever to begin with and was even a week late from the expected date. Was unable to track the package, was getting worried.</li>
            <li> This clip is gorgeous! Took about 10-11days to get to me, So it arrived way ahead of schedule 😍💚 its on the large side but not to heavy i have thick long curly hair and my moms hair is shorter and thin wavy and works for her hair aswell. Way worth what i paid . Totally adorable ! Will be getting other colors aswell 😊</li>
            <li> Very pretty but too big! It was almost as long as my head!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Beautiful. Good quality</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece and cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;On the scale of small, medium or large.  I would consider this a large hair ornament.&lt;br /&gt;Great for long hair being put up.</li>
            <li> I wear this clip in my hair when I twist my long hair and put it up. I&#x27;ve had several compliments on how pretty this clip is. It is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This came in beautiful condition. The only draw back is that it is very heavy and difficult to wear in a lot of styles. Worth the price and I do get lots of compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> Bright, fun and cute. Light weight, but not cheap. This product is amazing and so was the packaging.The clip was better than expected. However, it is not very sturdy. I would prefer to put it in or clip it onto your bun, as shown in the picture. It does not hold your hair up by itself. All around, very good product. I will hopefully be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty! It is large and will hold up long hair. I received a lot of compliments on this item.</li>
            <li> I loved these so much I ordered one in every color. the only reason I give it a 3 star rating is the 6 week waiting period. don&#x27;t let that hold you back though, I wear these every day. I have long hair and they are fine to hold it and beautiful more than just a little. I get complemented on them everyday and that feels nice. this is a fantastic item for the price. they are very beautiful and sturdy. If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time. for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry. if you are thinking of them for gifts, they are super nice in that the jewels are good quality and well set. the clip itself is in no way chincy, they put in the effort to make a great hair clip and i would order again, in fact i did order again.  they are the best clips i own now. but order early if this is for an event or gift. it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li> So beautiful exactly the way I imagine it even better!!! Definitely buying more I love it thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, especially for the cost. Love it!</li>
            <li> This hairclip is really cute! It&#x27;s even better looking in person. I love the color and it was more substantial then I expected. The clip itself holds very well, it was strong enough to hold up a large bun all by itself. However, it is a heavy clip, so thin/fine hair probably wont work with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really beautiful, it&#x27;s just took me almost 2 months to wait for it. So if you don&#x27;t the time, then it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time, but the piece was beautiful.  It was heavy, though, and needed &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; bobby pins to keep it in place. It is definitely more for show than as a functional hair clip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but took way to long to get here. It is a nice green color, sparkly etc. This piece is big but not too big. It looks great in a mess of curled hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 of these in different colors, and they are all beautiful and elegant. I expected them to be barrettes, but they are alligator clips hold my bangs back very well. I would recommend this item in any or all colors.</li>
            <li> it came within a week of ordering it. its very well made, and just beautiful. its a lot bigger than it looks&lt;br /&gt;in the pics. im extremely pleased with it! cant wait to order other colors!</li>
            <li> Nice design at good price, but a little too heavy as it&#x27;s made of molded alloy.  Also, the dark green stones in the middle of the body look shinier in the picture than in reality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and just fell in LOVE! My hair is mid length and very fine. It holds a French Twist with out any additional help. I can wear it comfortably all day long. I immediately purchased additional colors to go with other outfits. They arrived and were more than I could ask for! Just BEAUTIFUL!  Not cheap but Metal and well made, feel they will last a long time for such an inexpensive price.  Best purchase I havemade in a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift for my sister in law.  It is so pretty, I bought one in almost every color!</li>
            <li> my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  I keep it on the hook so I can see it when I want.  Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
            <li> This is affordable and stunning. If you know anyone who loves a bit of bling, this is absolutely gorgeous. don&#x27;t be concerned with the price tag, just enjoy the beauty.</li>
            <li> This came a few weeks earlier than expected. large and beautiful.  Thank you. I ordered two so I could give my sister one and will order anoithere one for myself.l</li>
            <li> Amazing  heavy duty and having super thick Italian hair it holds it will defiantly be buying more in different colors</li>
            <li> Although it took what seems like an extra long time to arrive, once it did - I was quite pleased with it.  Had already bought one  in purple and loved it enough to order more colors.  The first time I wore it a crafter/artisan at a show noticed it as I was looking at her work and she wanted all the details and even tried it on. Although it&#x27;s fairly large, it&#x27;s not loud so it still works. It also stores easily clipped to a purse pocket and stays secure when not in use. This is not a barrette, it is indeed a clip.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but if you have more than fine hair, forget about it. It doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair up. I am considering to gift it away.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well constructed.  I bought several of these in different colors. Receive many compliments when I wear them.</li>
            <li> This looks SO pretty, it looks fanastic in your hair. I gave it as a gift and wish I bought one for me as well.</li>
            <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> Now this is the best one, I truly love this one , my favorite color  , need some more different colors</li>
            <li> When I purchased I thought it was going to be an averaged sized hair clip. However when I got it it was was way to big(and heavy). It takes up my whole head pretty much! I was so bummed about the size because the clip itself is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> This clip is strong, durable, and pretty. I love the way it holds my hair, and the color of the stones is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture! Bigger Than expected, about 4 1/2 inches from the tail to the face. Very Beautiful!</li>
            <li> This hairclip is gorgeous. I recieved many compliments on it. However, it is very large. I was really suprised when it came in at how big it is. It&#x27;s like 7in long and 4in wide.</li>
            <li> Great for putting hair up</li>
            <li> The hair clip is so gorgeous I thought it was a brooch the coloring in so sharp and the item is a winner</li>
            <li> i never recieved it. was very sad,its very pretty. i would have liked to have got it.</li>
            <li> very beautiful hair clip.  I unfortunately have fine and thin hair, and did not have enough hair for clip to hold.  is beautiful in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I truly love these &amp;#34;peacock&amp;#34; hair clips!!! They are not only very lovely and eye-catching, they are also quite hardy and so well made that they hold secure even with my thick hair!! Absolutely no complaints here!!!</li>
            <li> To heavy to stay in your hair</li>
            <li> Love this, it looks great and the price is even better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous! Heavy set hairpin that is very well made, crystals are gorgeous! Came in 3 weeks ahead of time which was awesome! I will be buying more in every style they have available. I also bought extra to give as gifts, this is a really great gift at a really great price.</li>
