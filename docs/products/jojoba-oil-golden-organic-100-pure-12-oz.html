            <li>It cleans---it moisturizes----this is just the most amazing beauty and skin-care product--ever.</li>
            <li>She told me it was the oil most like what our bodies produce naturally and therefore the best for removing eye makeup.  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Maybe even better.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST moisturizer for human skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>that smells like some kind overly sweet pastry (chocolate cake.</li>

            <li>the full delivery amount wasn&#x27;t paid by the sender!</li>

            <li>Works well if you are making your own serums, but if you put in fridge it will get hard since it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li>The oil isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you get your jojoba oil from Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended. :)</li>
            <li>Save money, just buy the oil and mix up your own personal care products!</li>
            <li>The oil was fresh and it lasted a looonngg time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>They shipped RIGHT away), the shipping will be combined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price was right</li>
            <li>They shipped RIGHT away), the shipping will be combined.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but that was a little unprofessional.</li>
            <li>I find this organic oil to not do such a good job at keeping the skin clear as the pure oil did.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hot oil mix and also my Shea butter mix.</li>
            <li>This is the 5th or 6th bottle of Jojoba Oil I&#x27;ve purchased and the first of this brand.</li>
            <li>I may also try it as a hot oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is always expensive so this is a good value!!</li>
            <li>My only problem was that I had to pay more when the mailman brought it to my door</li>
            <li>I was so glad to be able to purchase this size jojoba oil for such a low price!</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is always expensive so this is a good value!!</li>
            <li>E. oil and my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This jojoba oil is fairly light, as far as oils go.</li>
            <li>This jojoba oil is super high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go back to &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; as opposed to &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; since my skin responds better to the pure oil that is a vitamin shoppe brand.</li>
            <li>even though I don&#x27;t get as large a bottle for the money.</li>
            <li>I have purchased to a few times now and use it for so many things!</li>
            <li>If you Google it, you&#x27;ll find out it isn&#x27;t really an oil, but a wax.</li>
            <li>Use at night because it is very oily, too oily to use during the day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this as a conditioner on my natural hair and when it time to flat iron it make it so effortless.</li>
            <li>i put like a few drops on at night before going to sleep and after washing my face and i wake up with a fresh face and my skin just looks more hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>Especially if you order other products from Dr. Adorable (which I recommend!</li>
            <li>Especially if you order other products from Dr. Adorable (which I recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>I suppose this oil is fine for other parts of the body, but not so much for my face.</li>
            <li>Really does help clear up your skin also.</li>
            <li>Glass bottles seem to be the safe choice but few use them.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this brand, I used to use pure jojoba oil (not organic) from the Vitamin Shoppe, which worked wonders for keeping my skin soft and clear of acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li>There are no imperfections and it is exceptionally clear.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t stink or burn eyes, I can use it first and then apply any other moisturizer, but usually don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as great as the expensive jojoba oils out there!</li>
            <li>The others have had almost no smell, or at most, a wonderfully subtle nutty fragrance.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding pure jojoba oil, this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets about this product and I will always use it.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is chemically most like human natural body oils, so it absorbs readily and doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty greasy feeling like most other oils that just sit on the surface.  </li>
            <li>And definitely not a pleasant kind of chocolate cake smell) and expired milk mixed together (yes an odd combination indeed).</li>

            <li> and they agreed that it seems like some other oil mixed into the jojoba oil.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s blah not really what I had expected.</li>

            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s something in the processing, or if perhaps it&#x27;s going rancid.</li>
            <li> Also, recently read that plastic bottles could be dangerous containers to jojoba oil - the plastic leaches into the oil</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty awful)</li>
            <li> Order this product--you will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used it in one of my recipes and it really feels good on my skin&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering this one again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t stink or burn eyes, I can use it first and then apply any other moisturizer, but usually don&#x27;t have to. Works well if you are making your own serums, but if you put in fridge it will get hard since it&#x27;s good quality. Really does help clear up your skin also.</li>
            <li> I bought this because many people told me the good things that the oil helps and this is really good. And It&#x27;s so big!</li>
            <li> This product is good for oil treatments. I also use the Jojoba Oil before I Co Wash my hair,  it gives my hair added moisture and shine. I would recommend this product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A good skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Another great product by Dr. Adorable.  The price is reasonable and the oil is great. I use it in my hot oil mix and also my Shea butter mix. I highly recommend that you get your jojoba oil from Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Have been using it in a mix with grapeseed and argan for face cleansing. Has a mild scent and bottle arrived fast and safe with no leaking.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th or 6th bottle of Jojoba Oil I&#x27;ve purchased and the first of this brand. The others have had almost no smell, or at most, a wonderfully subtle nutty fragrance. This bottle doesn&#x27;t smell good. Not sure if it&#x27;s something in the processing, or if perhaps it&#x27;s going rancid. It feels like the other Jojoba oils, so my comment is only in reference to the odor -- which may or may not have to do with the freshness. The price was good, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Once I tried eye lash extensions and the tech recommended this oil.  She told me it was the oil most like what our bodies produce naturally and therefore the best for removing eye makeup.  I&#x27;ve been buying it faithfully ever since.  Never irritates.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I made some skin cream and put this in it and put it on my face. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have an odor. I may also try it as a hot oil hair treatment. Save money, just buy the oil and mix up your own personal care products!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my hair. But I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s good for my skin as well. It came well packaged and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is always expensive so this is a good value!! Especially if you order other products from Dr. Adorable (which I recommend! They shipped RIGHT away), the shipping will be combined. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. I have purchased to a few times now and use it for so many things! Our house doesn&#x27;t function without it now!</li>
            <li> I am happy  i add it to my shampoos&lt;br /&gt;got the package fairly soon, was packed to keep it safe from damage&lt;br /&gt;the price was right</li>
            <li> I love the product for my skin and hair, face excluded. It makes my skin feel softer and it&#x27;s not oily. My only problem was that I had to pay more when the mailman brought it to my door bc the full delivery amount wasn&#x27;t paid by the sender! WTH?! The product is good, but that was a little unprofessional.</li>
            <li> This was the best value I could find for jojoba oil, and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was going rancid or what, but it smelled a little funky to me. If you Google it, you&#x27;ll find out it isn&#x27;t really an oil, but a wax. I buy mine locally (no funky smell &#x27;cause it&#x27;s fresher) even though I don&#x27;t get as large a bottle for the money. Also, recently read that plastic bottles could be dangerous containers to jojoba oil - the plastic leaches into the oil and you apply oil to your body and...Glass bottles seem to be the safe choice but few use them. The plastic bottles have thalates(?sp) which are carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a moisturizer on my face, and as a deep conditioner for my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to be able to purchase this size jojoba oil for such a low price! The oil was fresh and it lasted a looonngg time. Great score!</li>
            <li> I rated this product as a number 5 because it worked well in my homemade products.  I go more for my money.  I would recommend this product for any that make homemade products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blah not really what I had expected. I think it might even be breaking me out a lol more</li>
            <li> A great bargain and I have used it in making sugar scrubs.  Well worth the price and I would be again.</li>

            <li> This jojoba oil is super high quality. There are no imperfections and it is exceptionally clear. I am quite happy with this purchase. The oil arrived quickly and in great condition. I am using the jojoba oil (along with some castor) to wash my face. It is amazing. I also made some leave in conditioner and detangler sprays for my children. Both turned out awesome. Highly recommended. :)</li>
            <li> I loved the oil it worked for my needs and will purchase again in the future&lt;br /&gt;Great great great great</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good product. I love using jojoba on my body after showers. The oil isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quick. It&#x27;s also great for hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Use it from head to toe. Leaves my face feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding pure jojoba oil, this is the real thing. If using for massage, u might want to mix with other oils but I want to know what I am using....the &amp;#34;massage oils&amp;#34; tend to give me a rash....give the truth in product like this oil</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is always expensive so this is a good value!! Especially if you order other products from Dr. Adorable (which I recommend! They shipped RIGHT away), the shipping will be combined. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product, it&#x27;s very gentle and smooth on my skin plus it&#x27;s unsented which is a double bonus. I use it everyday especially in the winter months. I have no regrets about this product and I will always use it.</li>
            <li> I use this jojoba oil on my face every day. It&#x27;s just as great as the expensive jojoba oils out there! Maybe even better. I would recommended it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very good product and is a multipurpose product! I use it for my body and to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this brand, I used to use pure jojoba oil (not organic) from the Vitamin Shoppe, which worked wonders for keeping my skin soft and clear of acne and blemishes. I find this organic oil to not do such a good job at keeping the skin clear as the pure oil did. I&#x27;m going to go back to &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; as opposed to &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; since my skin responds better to the pure oil that is a vitamin shoppe brand. I suppose this oil is fine for other parts of the body, but not so much for my face.</li>
            <li> jojoba oil is great and can be added to aloe and/or lanolin for use as a hand or hair cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend heartily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> This is the BEST moisturizer for human skin.  Jojoba oil is chemically most like human natural body oils, so it absorbs readily and doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty greasy feeling like most other oils that just sit on the surface.  I blend this with aloe vera gel, Vit. E. oil and my favorite essential oils.  Lavender for evening moisturizing and citrus or rose for daytime.</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a conditioner on my natural hair and when it time to flat iron it make it so effortless. I very happy I found a bigger bottle to. I can not live without this oil. This will definitely be my go to store.</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is fairly light, as far as oils go. It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent, which surprised me. It&#x27;s a beautiful color, and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> as a carrier for essential oils, jojoba oil is unsurpassed.  especially for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Use at night because it is very oily, too oily to use during the day. I use on my neck and face</li>
            <li> Something&#x27;s not right with the bottle I received. There&#x27;s this odd smell to it (it&#x27;s pretty awful) that smells like some kind overly sweet pastry (chocolate cake. And definitely not a pleasant kind of chocolate cake smell) and expired milk mixed together (yes an odd combination indeed). I had someone else have a whiff of it and they agreed that it seems like some other oil mixed into the jojoba oil. A quite large bottle for a cheap price, I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Great price as well.  I was worried about the shipping process but the oil was delivered with great care and the packaging was fantastic.  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> i put like a few drops on at night before going to sleep and after washing my face and i wake up with a fresh face and my skin just looks more hydrated and soft.</li>
