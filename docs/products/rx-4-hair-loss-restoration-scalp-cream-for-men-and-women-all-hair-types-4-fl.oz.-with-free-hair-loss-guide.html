            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I can see how healthy my hair is</li>
            <li>Like most of us, I&#x27;ve tried everything that was supposed to curtail \\&quot;shedding and hair loss\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>make sure you buy the set of 3 as they work together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to understand how companies and products get reviews like they do.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this cream.</li>
            <li>To my relief and pleasant surprise, I began to notice positive results in 4-6 weeks after using the shampoo and cream.  </li>
            <li>I believe it has already helped reduce the fallout from my scalp, and my hair feels very clean after using.</li>
            <li>Best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>This scalp cream is a great, more natural remedy to hair loss.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of using RX 4 hair loss Restoration  shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t have anymore bold spot and my hair got longer and fuller,I&#x27;m thrilled</li>
            <li>very good results although started using it recently</li>
            <li>I did not want to use chemical treatment and was happy to find Rx4 products which promised organic, natural ingredients for my hair thinning problem.  </li>
            <li>First off, this cream is very creamy and soft to the touch, and the smell is very pleasant, not too girly, just a very sweet pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve found that every product I&#x27;ve purchased from this hair loss line is very effective.</li>
            <li>From what I have experienced, this cream does wonders on many different levels.</li>
            <li>Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...</li>
            <li>was so strong that it remained on my pillow</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fine</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and think it is great for men, since it&#x27;s so simple and fast to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a huge difference these 3 products have made.  </li>
            <li>,I massage it in with my finger tips and scalp feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night, enjoy the massage and shampoo/condition in the AM.  </li>
            <li>I started applying this amaizing cream about one week ago, so its qiite early to judge about its actual results, however, today as I went to work, to my greatest surprise, my co-workers complemented on the healthy and shiny look of my hair.</li>
            <li>Still using it, so far so good</li>
            <li>and I have to say I was always so jealous of his beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li>Still early to tell but so far I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s clean and free of all the products I was compensating with and stays manageable all day.  </li>
            <li>The results happened quickly and I was so impressed, I decided to dab a little on my scalp too to see if it would do anything.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using</li>
            <li>He wanted something, but he didn&#x27;t want to smell super girly and he wanted it to be quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>The product lacks any true testimonials if you google it.</li>
            <li>This treatment is light and creamy, and is quickly absorbed into the scalp.</li>
            <li>This company has the best products for hair loss I have ever came across and better than that this company cares.they keep in touch with you to make sure you are a 100% satisfied and genuinely care about their consumer base.</li>
            <li>All are worthy of 10 stars.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product that really works and is easy to apply this is right for you!</li>
            <li>He had better hair than me in high school.</li>
            <li>but it would be really great to see him confident enough to go out in public without a hat.</li>
            <li>good friend gave me the Restoration Scalp Cream as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;After a good month the results are dramatic for me.</li>
            <li>Just received this new scalp cream and love the improvement in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review EVER!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>love that it is made of natural products and dermatologist recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The RX makes my hair feel soft and look healthy.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for some success.  </li>
            <li>know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been friends since we were about 14 yrs old :)</li>
            <li>So far I am very much satisfied with the product, however, no improvement to my hearline yet which is my problem at the moment.</li>
            <li>I have easily irritated scalp and this causes no negative reactions and it is super gentle.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, this is the stuff right here.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes my scalp very, very itch!!!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>So far so good have not used long enough to see growth but love the smell and feel of this priduct.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty greasy</li>
            <li>I have different factors that result in my hair loss; I have scalp psoriasis flare ups every once in a while and no prescription is good enough and the psoriasis causes my scalp to itch and burn all night.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>By now I feel quite positive about the results I will have in a month!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>But pretty fast shipping</li>
            <li>I got real results after the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It’s very creamy, but if a little is applied, it absorbs quickly and it feels very light on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I am trying Aveda now and within 10 days there is new growth, however natural botanicals are volimizing too much and my fine hair is to tangled and dropping when trying to comb or style it.</li>
            <li>After about six weeks - I&#x27;m getting the same consistent results I&#x27;ve experienced almost from the very start - little to no shedding and now...</li>
            <li>I noticed such a huge difference in hair loss using the shampoo alone</li>
            <li>IT, S A VERY HELPFUL PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t stop selling this product it really works.</li>
            <li>My head felt very relaxed as if it was a side effect.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell u if it worked or not,.</li>
            <li>I am really a skeptic, but will give it the time recommended.  </li>
            <li>the company is very unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>fact it makes my whole body itch!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It  really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Looks like she is not losing as much hair when she washes it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being here for us RX 4 people &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It has organic ingredients and lots of nutrients for real hair growth .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really gotten rid of my embarrassing hair loss with this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>A very noticeable difference in about two weeks.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have thinning at the crown of my head and really focus on putting it there but also on my part line.</li>
            <li>Imagine losing your anxiety to shampoo everyday and loving the way your hair looks?  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>I will definitely update if I see significant results in hair</li>
            <li>My scalp actually looks good and the flare up is easing/calming down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been losing hair steadily every time I wash my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have just started using this cream and have high hopes that it will help my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>The application of the cream is easy and I do it every other night before I go to bed and wash my hear in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any results but have been losing more hair since I started using it few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>I can see new growth.</li>
            <li>My body is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>After first use I realized I could apply it only if I was planning on staying home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 16 days now and the shedding has stopped completely!</li>
            <li>I like the ingredients in this product ,the directions are simple to follow and we are hopeful that there will be a positive outcome.</li>
            <li>I lose large amounts after shampooing and conditioning and the loss still seems the same after all these months.</li>
            <li>Now it has almost completely stopped the fallout and what&#x27;s growing back is thicker ,stronger and so much healthier.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived on time, but it is too early to tell whether or not the product works.</li>
            <li>I have been using complete RX hair loss kit for 3 weeks, 3 nights a week.  </li>
            <li>My mom so far loves this product ,her hair is acually growing .</li>
            <li>A couple of tips:  since the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, don&#x27;t expect a lush lather.  </li>
            <li>I am menopausal in early 60&#x27;s and began to notice hair thinning and loss on crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed no difference at all as far as hair loss too.</li>
            <li>I think I was so disturbed wondering whose fingers were in the product , which was unsettling that I did not give it a fair try.</li>
            <li>I separate my hair in lines one at a time and quickly rub a dab down the line onto my scalp</li>
            <li>With the scalp help, I’ve noticed less shedding, and I have fine, low density curls, so every strand is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50 year old female and attribute the hair loss to normal changes and stress.  </li>
            <li>It might regrow hair, but it&#x27;s far from &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; The consistency is more like a styling cream and very thick.</li>
            <li>Some new tiny hair noticeable after two weeks of treatment.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really interfere with styling; can apply to dry hair for daytime application.</li>
            <li>The cream isn’t super thick ,but it’s not super light, it does have weight to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, but it does have a nice smell and my hair loss seems to have decreased.  </li>
            <li>I have been steadily losing my fine, thin hair after almost four years of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!.</li>
            <li>and it’s natural; it actually restores my scalp.</li>
            <li>apply this directly to my scalp only on wash day after I washed and conditioned, but before I add a styler.</li>
            <li>just started using, but I am concentrating on my edges, they have gotten thin from excessive use of hair extensions, hoping to see excellent results in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently received the RX 4 and at this moment, I&#x27;m enjoying the scent and the way it makes my dry, dull and thinning hair, feel like hair again!</li>
            <li>yes,will order again  this formulation,used daily one could save 400 follicles yearly.usa firm that needs supporting by sales to britain.no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I can see how healthy my hair is</li>
            <li> Like most of us, I&#x27;ve tried everything that was supposed to curtail \\&quot;shedding and hair loss\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> make sure you buy the set of 3 as they work together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to understand how companies and products get reviews like they do.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this cream.</li>
            <li> To my relief and pleasant surprise, I began to notice positive results in 4-6 weeks after using the shampoo and cream.  </li>
            <li> I believe it has already helped reduce the fallout from my scalp, and my hair feels very clean after using.</li>
            <li> Best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> This scalp cream is a great, more natural remedy to hair loss.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of using RX 4 hair loss Restoration  shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t have anymore bold spot and my hair got longer and fuller,I&#x27;m thrilled</li>
            <li> very good results although started using it recently</li>
            <li> I did not want to use chemical treatment and was happy to find Rx4 products which promised organic, natural ingredients for my hair thinning problem.  </li>
            <li> First off, this cream is very creamy and soft to the touch, and the smell is very pleasant, not too girly, just a very sweet pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found that every product I&#x27;ve purchased from this hair loss line is very effective.</li>
            <li> From what I have experienced, this cream does wonders on many different levels.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...</li>
            <li> was so strong that it remained on my pillow</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and think it is great for men, since it&#x27;s so simple and fast to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a huge difference these 3 products have made.  </li>
            <li> ,I massage it in with my finger tips and scalp feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night, enjoy the massage and shampoo/condition in the AM.  </li>
            <li> I started applying this amaizing cream about one week ago, so its qiite early to judge about its actual results, however, today as I went to work, to my greatest surprise, my co-workers complemented on the healthy and shiny look of my hair.</li>
            <li> Still using it, so far so good</li>
            <li> and I have to say I was always so jealous of his beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li> Still early to tell but so far I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s clean and free of all the products I was compensating with and stays manageable all day.  </li>
            <li> The results happened quickly and I was so impressed, I decided to dab a little on my scalp too to see if it would do anything.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using</li>
            <li> He wanted something, but he didn&#x27;t want to smell super girly and he wanted it to be quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but this one really works.</li>
            <li> The product lacks any true testimonials if you google it.</li>
            <li> This treatment is light and creamy, and is quickly absorbed into the scalp.</li>
            <li> This company has the best products for hair loss I have ever came across and better than that this company cares.they keep in touch with you to make sure you are a 100% satisfied and genuinely care about their consumer base.</li>
            <li> All are worthy of 10 stars.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that really works and is easy to apply this is right for you!</li>
            <li> He had better hair than me in high school.</li>
            <li> but it would be really great to see him confident enough to go out in public without a hat.</li>
            <li> good friend gave me the Restoration Scalp Cream as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;After a good month the results are dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> Just received this new scalp cream and love the improvement in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review EVER!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> love that it is made of natural products and dermatologist recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The RX makes my hair feel soft and look healthy.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for some success.  </li>
            <li> know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been friends since we were about 14 yrs old :)</li>
            <li> So far I am very much satisfied with the product, however, no improvement to my hearline yet which is my problem at the moment.</li>
            <li> I have easily irritated scalp and this causes no negative reactions and it is super gentle.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, this is the stuff right here.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It makes my scalp very, very itch!!!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> So far so good have not used long enough to see growth but love the smell and feel of this priduct.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty greasy</li>
            <li> I have different factors that result in my hair loss; I have scalp psoriasis flare ups every once in a while and no prescription is good enough and the psoriasis causes my scalp to itch and burn all night.</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> By now I feel quite positive about the results I will have in a month!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> But pretty fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got real results after the first shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It’s very creamy, but if a little is applied, it absorbs quickly and it feels very light on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I am trying Aveda now and within 10 days there is new growth, however natural botanicals are volimizing too much and my fine hair is to tangled and dropping when trying to comb or style it.</li>
            <li> After about six weeks - I&#x27;m getting the same consistent results I&#x27;ve experienced almost from the very start - little to no shedding and now...</li>
            <li> I noticed such a huge difference in hair loss using the shampoo alone</li>
            <li> IT, S A VERY HELPFUL PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop selling this product it really works.</li>
            <li> My head felt very relaxed as if it was a side effect.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell u if it worked or not,.</li>
            <li> I am really a skeptic, but will give it the time recommended.  </li>
            <li> the company is very unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> fact it makes my whole body itch!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It  really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Looks like she is not losing as much hair when she washes it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks for being here for us RX 4 people &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It has organic ingredients and lots of nutrients for real hair growth .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really gotten rid of my embarrassing hair loss with this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> A very noticeable difference in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see much improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have thinning at the crown of my head and really focus on putting it there but also on my part line.</li>
            <li> Imagine losing your anxiety to shampoo everyday and loving the way your hair looks?  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> I will definitely update if I see significant results in hair</li>
            <li> My scalp actually looks good and the flare up is easing/calming down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been losing hair steadily every time I wash my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have just started using this cream and have high hopes that it will help my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The application of the cream is easy and I do it every other night before I go to bed and wash my hear in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results but have been losing more hair since I started using it few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> I can see new growth.</li>
            <li> My body is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> After first use I realized I could apply it only if I was planning on staying home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 16 days now and the shedding has stopped completely!</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients in this product ,the directions are simple to follow and we are hopeful that there will be a positive outcome.</li>
            <li> I lose large amounts after shampooing and conditioning and the loss still seems the same after all these months.</li>
            <li> Now it has almost completely stopped the fallout and what&#x27;s growing back is thicker ,stronger and so much healthier.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, but it is too early to tell whether or not the product works.</li>
            <li> I have been using complete RX hair loss kit for 3 weeks, 3 nights a week.  </li>
            <li> My mom so far loves this product ,her hair is acually growing .</li>
            <li> A couple of tips:  since the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, don&#x27;t expect a lush lather.  </li>
            <li> I am menopausal in early 60&#x27;s and began to notice hair thinning and loss on crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed no difference at all as far as hair loss too.</li>
            <li> I think I was so disturbed wondering whose fingers were in the product , which was unsettling that I did not give it a fair try.</li>
            <li> I separate my hair in lines one at a time and quickly rub a dab down the line onto my scalp</li>
            <li> With the scalp help, I’ve noticed less shedding, and I have fine, low density curls, so every strand is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old female and attribute the hair loss to normal changes and stress.  </li>
            <li> It might regrow hair, but it&#x27;s far from &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; The consistency is more like a styling cream and very thick.</li>
            <li> Some new tiny hair noticeable after two weeks of treatment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really interfere with styling; can apply to dry hair for daytime application.</li>
            <li> The cream isn’t super thick ,but it’s not super light, it does have weight to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, but it does have a nice smell and my hair loss seems to have decreased.  </li>
            <li> I have been steadily losing my fine, thin hair after almost four years of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!.</li>
            <li> and it’s natural; it actually restores my scalp.</li>
            <li> apply this directly to my scalp only on wash day after I washed and conditioned, but before I add a styler.</li>
            <li> just started using, but I am concentrating on my edges, they have gotten thin from excessive use of hair extensions, hoping to see excellent results in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently received the RX 4 and at this moment, I&#x27;m enjoying the scent and the way it makes my dry, dull and thinning hair, feel like hair again!</li>
            <li> yes,will order again  this formulation,used daily one could save 400 follicles yearly.usa firm that needs supporting by sales to britain.no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair.</li>
            <li> You do not use nearly the same amount as you&#x27;d use of any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like your product and for the high price, I would like to try RX for hair loss again in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not last long enough to get result!!</li>
            <li> In order to apply this product I am forced to apply excessive mechanical stress on my hair contributing to more hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Over the years my hair has been becoming increasingly thin!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using long enough to make a difference!</li>
            <li> LITTLE TO NO SHEDDING AND NEW GROWTH</li>
            <li> So far, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy and you really only use a little tab.</li>
            <li> hours later no itchy or dry</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first due to this product not having any reviews, but I was really determined to try anything that would help my skin issues.</li>
            <li> know this is a LONG review...</li>
            <li> I use it daily on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> , I try to wash it every other day only.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have LONGhair (it&#x27;s like 1/2 way down my back)</li>
            <li> After using various dandruff shampoos, she is seeing less scalp psoriasis after using product.  </li>
            <li> but I would not buy this again as I have to wash my hair after every application and as I am trying to save the little hair I have left</li>
            <li> This is a bit harder to rub in than a shampoo, but if it works who cares.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing ingredients but it did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not much in it now.</li>
            <li> Used faithful but no results, wasted money and time, get my hair back on track!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone from handfuls and handfuls of hair while rinsing in the shower to minimal \\&quot;normal\\&quot; amounts.  </li>
            <li> I also use a bit in my temple area on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is more moisturized and not so dry like usual, it also won’t itch for a few days, and when it does itch and burn, it’s not half as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning severe hair loss for awhile now due to medications</li>
            <li> , I usually don&#x27;t get suds until the 2nd time I wash, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> When I did finally get product, still some missing  out  jar, didn&#x27;t  bother by  returning  again!  </li>
            <li> Now we are 42 and he shaves his head due to the balding that&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> At 42 he is all grown up now and he is not looking for waste long hair at this point</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream in combination with RX&#x27;s other products for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and mix it with other products since it&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for almost 4 months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to be extremely blunt.</li>
            <li> consistency is like a very wet lotion,</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty disappointed the product doesn&#x27;t help with alopecia like it stated.</li>
            <li> flakes of dead and dry skin are vanishing.</li>
            <li> However, the reason I bought this system is that I recently went through a death in my family...and was having a hard time dealing.</li>
            <li> Although jar is small, it only takes a little dab on my crown to do the job.</li>
            <li> Veryyyyy vague directions, nothing about how often to use, how much to apply, nor do you massage it through out your hair or just the places you need it.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results yet.. Will keep using but so far seems like my scalp eczema got even worse...</li>
            <li> I have been battling eczema for years, ever since I was 5 years old and this year has been the worse to date.</li>
            <li> After washing and towel drying my hair, I applied small amounts all over scalp, I do have dry itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use a very small amount on my scalp overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still a bit too soon to see if this product will work as a restoration, but I can say that I&#x27;m seeing much less hair in the drain after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> and I still use less shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less breakage.</li>
            <li> Styling is a breeze - my hair in drying in half the time now</li>
            <li> Not only was I amazed at the results, but my beautician was quite shocked, so much so, that she is going to buy some for herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing little sprouts of hair throughout my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff, and rubs it on his head everyday.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m one of the few that does not like the smell, but it&#x27;s not a make or break thing for me.</li>
            <li> There were few follow ups from the product company</li>
            <li> Again, another product that was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Will have to update my review a few months into the treatment.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to try it  that I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews, not sure if it works because what I didn&#x27;t find in the reviews was how greasy this cream is.</li>
            <li> have tried this product and gave it my all for over than 6 months, and nothing has changed, its pointless and</li>
            <li> No more itching and scratching.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m now past the return time frame and basically just lost my money and months of applying this to my hair.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this cream my hair looked dry, damaged and unhealthy but not now!</li>
            <li> It was a dull wierd effect.</li>
            <li> but it is simply too creamy to applied every day, after application your hair looks dirty and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem with plaque psoriases on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I think the depression &amp; not taking care of myself for several weeks after caused my hair to really thin and start falling out :(</li>
            <li> I was losing hair from medications and very slow thyroid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product&lt;</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me after I noticed my hair was startng to thin out.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows that don&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li> False advertising didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from excessive dandruff</li>
            <li> , I truly believe that there are fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it didn&#x27;t help, even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I literally have noticed no difference whatsoever which is really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it! Don&#x27;t know if it works cause it makes my hairy to greasy!</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a couple times as I just received it last week. I realy like the scent of it. So far, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy and you really only use a little tab. It has already made my hair feel fuller and more body so even that is an improvement in just a couple uses.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty disappointed the product doesn&#x27;t help with alopecia like it stated. But pretty fast shipping that&#x27;s why I give it two stars.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results yet.. Will keep using but so far seems like my scalp eczema got even worse...</li>
            <li> IT, S A VERY HELPFUL PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine I I&#x27;m 51 and for the last 5  years my hair has thinned out to the point I have to wear a wigs all the time. I  have seen great improvement and will continue to use this product I would like the wig to be a choice.</li>
            <li> Save your money,  used for a couple of weeks did nothing,  felt like putting lotion on my scalp,  made my hair greasy,  I should have known better when on the jar itself it said good for psorasis. Learned my lesson you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This a great product. I have tried many products, but this one really works. I was losing hair from medications and very slow thyroid. Hair has started to grow back and believe me this is wonderful. Thank you so to the company who makes this</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working.  I can see new growth.</li>
            <li> My husband is getting to the age where he is starting to lose his hair. He wanted something, but he didn&#x27;t want to smell super girly and he wanted it to be quick and easy to use. Then I saw this Restoration Scalp Cream for Men &amp; Women by RX 4 Hair Loss, and thought that this would be perfect for him. First off, this cream is very creamy and soft to the touch, and the smell is very pleasant, not too girly, just a very sweet pleasant smell. My husband loves this stuff, and rubs it on his head everyday. He said that he can actually feel it working, and he has even started to sprout some tiny baby hairs. I am very pleased with this product and think it is great for men, since it&#x27;s so simple and fast to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is a bit harder to rub in than a shampoo, but if it works who cares. I am using this with the shampoo, so you can check my comments under the review for it. Lastly, I am using it at night and shampooing in the morning. I will update as I see results.</li>
            <li> it is so dry,if you can put more oil,it will heip a lot</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed. In order to apply this product I am forced to apply excessive mechanical stress on my hair contributing to more hair loss.  A lighter/foamy product is what I need, not this paste. I  want my money back.</li>
            <li> After washing and towel drying my hair, I applied small amounts all over scalp, I do have dry itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a tingly sensation when Applied,I massage it in with my finger tips and scalp feels smooth. hours later no itchy or dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using, but I am concentrating on my edges, they have gotten thin from excessive use of hair extensions, hoping to see excellent results in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is made of natural products and dermatologist recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband will also be giving it a shot</li>
            <li> Makes my hair greasy.  I bought this because I wanted volume.  This does not work.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t stop selling this product it really works.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using long enough to make a difference!</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, but it is too early to tell whether or not the product works. I have not felt the tingly sensation others have spoken about but am looking forward to the results.</li>
            <li> False advertising didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this cream. I have been steadily losing my fine, thin hair after almost four years of breastfeeding. My hormones seem all out of whack and I&#x27;ve been losing hair steadily every time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a bit too soon to see if this product will work as a restoration, but I can say that I&#x27;m seeing much less hair in the drain after washing my hair. I only use a very small amount on my scalp overnight. I wash it out in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy (which I was concerned about). I think I&#x27;m one of the few that does not like the smell, but it&#x27;s not a make or break thing for me. I will definitely update if I see significant results in hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> This scalp cream is a great, more natural remedy to hair loss. I have different factors that result in my hair loss; I have scalp psoriasis flare ups every once in a while and no prescription is good enough and the psoriasis causes my scalp to itch and burn all night. With this, I have noticed a great amount of improvement. My scalp is more moisturized and not so dry like usual, it also won’t itch for a few days, and when it does itch and burn, it’s not half as bad as it was before. My scalp actually looks good and the flare up is easing/calming down. I’ve never used anything that helped this well and it’s natural; it actually restores my scalp. With the scalp help, I’ve noticed less shedding, and I have fine, low density curls, so every strand is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this directly to my scalp only on wash day after I washed and conditioned, but before I add a styler. I separate my hair in lines one at a time and quickly rub a dab down the line onto my scalp and I cover my entire head. I don’t wash it out, I just apply my styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a good sized jar and it smells great; you can really notice the lemongrass scent in this. The cream isn’t super thick ,but it’s not super light, it does have weight to it. It’s very creamy, but if a little is applied, it absorbs quickly and it feels very light on my scalp. It spreads very easily, like a lotion or body butter, and it’s not greasy at all despite all the added oils. I love the natural ingredients and the wonderful selection of the ingredients. I have easily irritated scalp and this causes no negative reactions and it is super gentle. It soothes and feels good on my scalp and doesn’t seem to clog my follicles.</li>
            <li> yes,will order again  this formulation,used daily one could save 400 follicles yearly.usa firm that needs supporting by sales to britain.no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  customer</li>
            <li> I recently received the RX 4 and at this moment, I&#x27;m enjoying the scent and the way it makes my dry, dull and thinning hair, feel like hair again! The RX makes my hair feel soft and look healthy. I just apply the cream and pull my hair back in a bun. Will update further improvements!</li>
            <li> The container had been used. I was so anxious to try it  that I did. Then I wondered whose fingers and whose hair ...... This was my fault! My head felt very relaxed as if it was a side effect. It was a dull wierd effect. My body is very sensitive. I woke up and washed it out of my hair at 3:03 AM.The scent of lemon was so strong that it remained on my pillow and I got up again to change the pillow case. I realy feel that this may be a good product, but just not for me.  I am one of the 17 out of 78?  I am re thinking this line . I think I was so disturbed wondering whose fingers were in the product , which was unsettling that I did not give it a fair try. I am trying Aveda now and within 10 days there is new growth, however natural botanicals are volimizing too much and my fine hair is to tangled and dropping when trying to comb or style it. It smells a little like your product and for the high price, I would like to try RX for hair loss again in a couple weeks. I was too hasty. You will hear from me soon.</li>
            <li> Too soon to evaluate results, but I would suggest that you offer the option for a larger size.</li>
            <li> Did not last long enough to get result!!</li>
            <li> Some new tiny hair noticeable after two weeks of treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews, not sure if it works because what I didn&#x27;t find in the reviews was how greasy this cream is. As a women that styles her hair it was too greasy to use and then style your hair. Veryyyyy vague directions, nothing about how often to use, how much to apply, nor do you massage it through out your hair or just the places you need it. After first use I realized I could apply it only if I was planning on staying home. Seems better for a man&#x27;s hair since they can just comb it through, for the price directions would have been nice, won&#x27;t buy it again, bought vitamins instead.</li>
            <li> Great product to massage onto scalp &amp; leave over night to block DHT. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing ingredients but it did not work as expected. There were few follow ups from the product company but It is greezy and not east to apply on fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell u if it worked or not,.Nice packaging and cream</li>
            <li> I have been using complete RX hair loss kit for 3 weeks, 3 nights a week.  Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Scalp Cream.  Have not as of yet seen any growth.  Product claims it may take up to 4 months to see results.  I am hoping for some success.  I am really a skeptic, but will give it the time recommended.  If no growth after 4 months I will try a different product.</li>
            <li> I have been battling eczema for years, ever since I was 5 years old and this year has been the worse to date. A co-worker of mine had bought from the seller before and recommended I check into their cream. I was a bit skeptical at first due to this product not having any reviews, but I was really determined to try anything that would help my skin issues. Sure enough, this is the stuff right here. The results happened quickly and I was so impressed, I decided to dab a little on my scalp too to see if it would do anything. From what I have experienced, this cream does wonders on many different levels. I&#x27;m very pleased with my order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Another winner!! This company has the best products for hair loss I have ever came across and better than that this company cares.they keep in touch with you to make sure you are a 100% satisfied and genuinely care about their consumer base.I have had thinning severe hair loss for awhile now due to medications I must take and I noticed such a huge difference in hair loss using the shampoo alone I had to try this too.Now it has almost completely stopped the fallout and what&#x27;s growing back is thicker ,stronger and so much healthier.Even my Dr.could not believe the difference in so short a time.Try this product your hair will love you for it.</li>
            <li> very good results although started using it recently</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement with growth or volume of my hair. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my first review EVER! I&#x27;m not one to do reviews...but, some of them helped me decide to try this product. So, I thought I&#x27;d write a review to help those of you who are &amp;#34;on the fence&amp;#34; about ordering. I have only been using this product for almost 2 weeks. You should know I was kinda sceptical, too :) See, I am an instant gratification kinda girl. I like to see results immediately-lol. I actually waited until I got all three products: the shampoo, conditioner and scalp cream. I figured using them all together would work faster than using just the shampoo...and, it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair. However, the reason I bought this system is that I recently went through a death in my family...and was having a hard time dealing. I think the depression &amp; not taking care of myself for several weeks after caused my hair to really thin and start falling out :( I have to admit...this product line has truly been a blessing! Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!. It&#x27;s crazy!!! I reallly noticed it when I pull my hair back in a ponytail...I didn&#x27;t have to wrap the pontytail holder around my hair as many times as I had before-COOL! I also have a lot of body...it&#x27;s AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also should know...the customer service is AMAZING! They are there for you anytime you need help. It blew me away! I had been putting the scalp cream on at night and noticed that my hair was kinda greasy in the morning...so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning. Worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it. You do not use nearly the same amount as you&#x27;d use of any other shampoo and conditioner. They do suggest shampooing twice before conditioning...and I still use less shampoo. I have LONGhair (it&#x27;s like 1/2 way down my back)...and I only use about a dime-nickel size squirt. So, that lets me know that it&#x27;ll last a while-woo hoo! I do have to say, I usually don&#x27;t get suds until the 2nd time I wash, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. Oooh...oooh...I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less breakage. Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...and there&#x27;s not much in it now. I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a LONG review...but, I hope it helps you :) Good luck &amp; God bless!</li>
            <li> When I did finally get product, still some missing  out  jar, didn&#x27;t  bother by  returning  again!  Used faithful but no results, wasted money and time, get my hair back on track!</li>
            <li> Also, they said they will refund the order if you dont see results, which I tried to provide my order number but they keep deleting my comment.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this product and gave it my all for over than 6 months, and nothing has changed, its pointless and the company is very unprofessional.&lt;br /&gt;again my order number is  Order# 002-6958724-4013042&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product. I have not seen any results but have been losing more hair since I started using it few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to a dermatologist who recommended that I stop using it because it worsens hair loss. This product might be soothing to the scalp and hence its used for psoriasis but NOT hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue how this product got good reviews here, I truly believe that there are fake. The product lacks any true testimonials if you google it. Again, another product that was just a waste of money. smells good though so it deserves that one star haha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;It makes my scalp very, very itch!!!&lt;br /&gt;In fact it makes my whole body itch!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I can get a refund</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Although jar is small, it only takes a little dab on my crown to do the job.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of using RX 4 hair loss Restoration  shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t have anymore bold spot and my hair got longer and fuller,I&#x27;m thrilled and yes I will definitely purchase all 3 of them again, thank you team RX.</li>
            <li> So far so good have not used long enough to see growth but love the smell and feel of this priduct.</li>
            <li> Over the years my hair has been becoming increasingly thin! I wanted to find a product that would make my hair thicker and prevent it from falling out and shedding. Well I had already started using  the RX 4 shampoo for hair loss and it was working like a charm, so I ordered the cream for my scalp and applied generously, the scent is lite and the product is creamy and not greasy. I massaged it into my scalp and it felt amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for 16 days now and the shedding has stopped completely! I love this product and I will continue to buy it! I would recommend this product to  to anyone who is trying  to stop shedding and hair loss.</li>
            <li> Together with their shampoo, it has stopped my wife&#x27;s hair from falling out! Great!</li>
            <li> Feels good, but I still needs time to prove it&#x27;s effect.</li>
            <li> WAYYY TOO GREASY AND STICKY. I used it one time and stopped.</li>
            <li> Still using it, so far so good</li>
            <li> I do like the way it makes my scalp feel, relieves the itchy feeling.  Hoping that it does help with the hair loss too.</li>
            <li> It  really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference!</li>
            <li> I love it. Great Product ! Thanks!! A+++++</li>
            <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
            <li> Wife has been using this product now for several weeks. Looks like she is not losing as much hair when she washes it. She likes product! Smells great!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me after I noticed my hair was startng to thin out. What a waste. I didnt see any improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This stuff really works. with in 30 days I notice my hair growing even in balding areas.. I&#x27;ve just ordered my 2nd jar. Defiantly 5 stars</li>
            <li> My mom so far loves this product ,her hair is acually growing .</li>
            <li> Good product, still no results..</li>
            <li> I love it.I can see how healthy my hair is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, but it does have a nice smell and my hair loss seems to have decreased.  Will have to update my review a few months into the treatment.</li>
            <li> I like the RX products. This cream is non-greasy and I use over night. I don&#x27;t apply during the day as it flattens the hair.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem with plaque psoriases on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;A good friend gave me the Restoration Scalp Cream as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;After a good month the results are dramatic for me. The red and&lt;br /&gt;crusty flakes of dead and dry skin are vanishing. No more itching and scratching. It is a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;for my scalp.  I use it daily on wet and dry hair. I strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product in conjunction with the RX4 Hair Loss shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Larry R. Craycraft, Muncie, IN</li>
            <li> It does help if used daily.</li>
            <li> TIME FOR AN UPDATE...LITTLE TO NO SHEDDING AND NEW GROWTH IS HAPPENING  After about six weeks - I&#x27;m getting the same consistent results I&#x27;ve experienced almost from the very start - little to no shedding and now...I&#x27;m seeing little sprouts of hair throughout my scalp.  What a huge difference these 3 products have made.  Imaging looking  forward to shampooing and styling your hair.  I&#x27;m thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!!    I bought the three part system with Shampoo, conditioner and this cream.  All are worthy of 10 stars.  I&#x27;m two weeks in and I&#x27;ve gone from handfuls and handfuls of hair while rinsing in the shower to minimal \\&quot;normal\\&quot; amounts.  Prior to RX I was shampooing 3x per week dreading the experience.  I got an email from the company when I ordered the products to follow the directions and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.  Shampoo/Condition 5x per week so I&#x27;m about 11 shampoos in.  I got real results after the first shampoo.  Regarding is this product \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; - it&#x27;s a cream so yes there can be build up.  I put this on at night, enjoy the massage and shampoo/condition in the AM.  I also use a bit in my temple area on wet hair.  Like most of us, I&#x27;ve tried everything that was supposed to curtail \\&quot;shedding and hair loss\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m a 50 year old female and attribute the hair loss to normal changes and stress.  Imagine losing your anxiety to shampoo everyday and loving the way your hair looks?  That&#x27;s what these products are doing for me.  I&#x27;ve taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; photo and will post an \\&quot;after\\&quot; at 60 days.  A couple of tips:  since the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, don&#x27;t expect a lush lather.  Leave it on for 2 minutes and repeat the process.  Styling is a breeze - my hair in drying in half the time now that it&#x27;s clean and free of all the products I was compensating with and stays manageable all day.  I&#x27;ve already reordered the shampoo and conditioner.  I feel like the cream will last about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can not express how very excited we were to receive an opportunity to review this product as part of a promotion ! My husband and I have been friends since we were about 14 yrs old :) and I have to say I was always so jealous of his beautiful long hair. He had better hair than me in high school. At one point we had a contest to see whose hair could grow the longest and of course he won. Now we are 42 and he shaves his head due to the balding that&#x27;s going on. We have been looking for something to help and when I was offered this opportunity I jumped at the chance . I like the ingredients in this product ,the directions are simple to follow and we are hopeful that there will be a positive outcome. At 42 he is all grown up now and he is not looking for waste long hair at this point but it would be really great to see him confident enough to go out in public without a hat. He has only been using this product about a week and I will be updating on his progress as he progresses.</li>
            <li> bought this one but it is simply too creamy to applied every day, after application your hair looks dirty and sticky. Cant say yet if helps or not but I would not buy this again as I have to wash my hair after every application and as I am trying to save the little hair I have left, I try to wash it every other day only.</li>
            <li> Have just started using this cream and have high hopes that it will help my hair loss.  I realize that nothing happens overnight so will give this a chance to work. Thanks for being here for us RX 4 people &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found that every product I&#x27;ve purchased from this hair loss line is very effective. This restoration scalp cream is one of my favorites. It is very easy to apply and really gets the job done. It has organic ingredients and lots of nutrients for real hair growth . I&#x27;ve really gotten rid of my embarrassing hair loss with this product and couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that really works and is easy to apply this is right for you!</li>
            <li> A very noticeable difference in about two weeks. Not only was I amazed at the results, but my beautician was quite shocked, so much so, that she is going to buy some for herself. Where I once had  to pull longer hair to cover my exposed scalp, it is no longer necessary. Best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream in combination with RX&#x27;s other products for a couple of weeks now. The cream may be working for hair loss, but it definitely isn&#x27;t a great product for grooming. It leaves my hair looking dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! make sure you buy the set of 3 as they work together.</li>
            <li> Just received this new scalp cream and love the improvement in my hair.  Still early to tell but so far I am impressed.  Great addition to the smampoo &amp; conditioner program. Even hair dresser noticed difference in hair.  Thank you for great products at a great price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything, left hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Got lost in delivery.refunded immediately.thanks</li>
            <li> I am menopausal in early 60&#x27;s and began to notice hair thinning and loss on crown of my head. I did not want to use chemical treatment and was happy to find Rx4 products which promised organic, natural ingredients for my hair thinning problem.  To my relief and pleasant surprise, I began to notice positive results in 4-6 weeks after using the shampoo and cream.  My daughter suffers from excessive dandruff so I ordered the scalp cream for her.  After using various dandruff shampoos, she is seeing less scalp psoriasis after using product.  I like the results I&#x27;m getting, and plan to reorder shampoo and scalp cream for myself.</li>
            <li> I tried this for awhile, I don&#x27;t know if it worked.  I couldn&#x27;t see much improvement.  It&#x27;s a white cream and it take awhile to work into your hair and scalp.  Requires a lot of rubbing because it you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re hair will have this white film over it.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I use it all the time and mix it with other products since it&#x27;s  consistency is like a very wet lotion,</li>
            <li> I started applying this amaizing cream about one week ago, so its qiite early to judge about its actual results, however, today as I went to work, to my greatest surprise, my co-workers complemented on the healthy and shiny look of my hair. Before I started using this cream my hair looked dry, damaged and unhealthy but not now! In about one week I have notised amazing transformation in the overal appearance of my hair. The application of the cream is easy and I do it every other night before I go to bed and wash my hear in the morning. The cream has also nice smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hear greasy as you wash them with shampoo in the morning. So far I am very much satisfied with the product, however, no improvement to my hearline yet which is my problem at the moment. I bought this product to help regrow my hair on the thinning spots on my forehead. Hopefully I will notice visible results and improvement after one month as it is written in the description of this cream. I will write my another review after 30 days with the visible results if any. By now I feel quite positive about the results I will have in a month!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Just another cream on the market. No benefits at all!!!</li>
            <li> This treatment is light and creamy, and is quickly absorbed into the scalp. I believe it has already helped reduce the fallout from my scalp, and my hair feels very clean after using. Doesn&#x27;t really interfere with styling; can apply to dry hair for daytime application.</li>
            <li> pretty well job excellent</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work at all. I had really high hopes after reading all the positive reviews so I took a leap of faith and tried it out. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for almost 4 months. I have thinning at the crown of my head and really focus on putting it there but also on my part line. It&#x27;s pretty greasy but I wash it out in the morning. I literally have noticed no difference whatsoever which is really disappointing. I also have put it on my eyebrows every night since it arrived. I have thin eyebrows that don&#x27;t grow. No change there as well. I have also noticed no difference at all as far as hair loss too. I lose large amounts after shampooing and conditioning and the loss still seems the same after all these months. I would&#x27;ve liked a refund but I&#x27;m now past the return time frame and basically just lost my money and months of applying this to my hair. Very disappointed it didn&#x27;t help, even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I just received this and I&#x27;m going to be extremely blunt. This stuff is crap. It might regrow hair, but it&#x27;s far from &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; The consistency is more like a styling cream and very thick. If anything this will make your hair look thinner. Completely disappointed. I&#x27;d love to understand how companies and products get reviews like they do. I&#x27;d bet good money they&#x27;re paid or work for the company. The ONLY way I might consider using this is if my hair was extremely short, if not shaved, so it wouldn&#x27;t appear so greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this. I have alopecia and I use this combined with an essential oil blend to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my buzz cut.</li>
