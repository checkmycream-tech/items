            <li>It is no longer available retail.</li>

            <li>One even said it smelled like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>None of them lasted on me like my old standbys and none smelled as good to me.  </li>
            <li>I try to buy as many as 12 to 14 bottles when its priced right.  </li>
            <li>When I found it on here I was so excited that there was still some of it somewhere that was available for purchase.</li>
            <li>This is not the original scent and the bottle has changed.  </li>
            <li>When the original Night Musk came out backin the eighties, I combined it with Bonne Bell Skin Musk Oil</li>
            <li>My problem is do I keep quite about this and the price goes up and harder to get, or just share this great</li>
            <li>Working in a grocery store, I receive compliments daily on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>I love this and always used it,now I can&#x27;t buy it because its much.</li>

            <li>Classic, sexy evening scent.</li>

            <li>This is a natural sexy but clean smelling fragrance .</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Being a musk-lover, I was totally excited to smell this perfume after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and it smelled different on me than it did on others, which I think a good perfume should do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that this has been available for the last 5 years or so.</li>
            <li>It is fresh smelling-not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.  :)</li>
            <li>It is light enough to wear in the daytime, then go into the night with a light touch-up.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li>His first question was, \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li>Occasionally, out of nowhere, a waft of the Night Musk will come my way, and I think what a lovely scent it is.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and continue to receive compliments on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never change, even though I can only purchase it on -line.(can&#x27;t find in any store, any more).</li>
            <li>Thanks for the service!</li>
            <li>When it was discontinued from manufacture, I was able to still buy it from various sources.</li>
            <li>The only place I have been able to find it now is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wear this fragrance a lot, I have worn it probably since it was first introduced in the 1980&#x27;s, and I guess you could call it my signature scent.  </li>
            <li>the scent is not to much just right for me</li>
            <li>Great for going out on the town, down to the local bar or staying in for a night of fun.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find, so I am glad to be able to purchase it on-line.</li>
            <li>Great price, same quality as I expected &amp; fast reliable shipping.</li>
            <li>It does not smell as good or last as long</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>(although I&#x27;m not fond of food-based perfumes), and there wasn&#x27;t much risk with it being inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and I guess thats why I like it so much.</li>
            <li>An old personal favorite of mine</li>
            <li>it has a sweet, light-ish musky smell in it that I like, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s positively overwhelmed by a scent that I can only describe as \\&quot;cheap-perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to get your attention, but in a classy way.  </li>
            <li>It is the only one that every single time I put it on I get a compliment on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li>I am an older woman (56).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has always remained high quality and I will keep with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>For fear it may go or the price gets to high.  </li>
            <li>that your old perfume?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several hundred dollars later and many years wiser, I&#x27;m back to wearing my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, one of the few I can wear without getting a headache.  </li>
            <li>Coupled with the fact that they soon after purchased Bonne Bell&#x27;s Skin Musk Oil and modified the smell of that, I decided to search for a new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think this is new old stock, with the emphasis on old.  </li>
            <li>last year May2014 for more then half the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone if you like the soft smell.</li>
            <li>The cologne(s) had turned darker color and a noticeable fragrance issue developed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m anything but and nearly gag every time I walk past a department store fragrance section because they&#x27;re so strong.</li>
            <li>Was sooo looking forward to having my old scent back since the stores quit carrying it.</li>
            <li>I was followed around by a young man who when I noticed him following me, told me that his girlfriend wears this perfume and he loves it!</li>
            <li>I love it, use it every day probably for the past 20 years, does not compare to any other cologne that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> Its kind of warm and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is a natural sexy but clean smelling fragrance .</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Being a musk-lover, I was totally excited to smell this perfume after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and it smelled different on me than it did on others, which I think a good perfume should do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this has been available for the last 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> It is fresh smelling-not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.  :)</li>
            <li> It is light enough to wear in the daytime, then go into the night with a light touch-up.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li> His first question was, \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li> Occasionally, out of nowhere, a waft of the Night Musk will come my way, and I think what a lovely scent it is.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and continue to receive compliments on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never change, even though I can only purchase it on -line.(can&#x27;t find in any store, any more).</li>
            <li> Thanks for the service!</li>
            <li> When it was discontinued from manufacture, I was able to still buy it from various sources.</li>
            <li> The only place I have been able to find it now is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance a lot, I have worn it probably since it was first introduced in the 1980&#x27;s, and I guess you could call it my signature scent.  </li>
            <li> the scent is not to much just right for me</li>
            <li> Great for going out on the town, down to the local bar or staying in for a night of fun.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find, so I am glad to be able to purchase it on-line.</li>
            <li> Great price, same quality as I expected &amp; fast reliable shipping.</li>
            <li> It does not smell as good or last as long</li>
            <li> Very misleading.</li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;m not fond of food-based perfumes), and there wasn&#x27;t much risk with it being inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> and I guess thats why I like it so much.</li>
            <li> An old personal favorite of mine</li>
            <li> it has a sweet, light-ish musky smell in it that I like, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s positively overwhelmed by a scent that I can only describe as \\&quot;cheap-perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to get your attention, but in a classy way.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one that every single time I put it on I get a compliment on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li> I am an older woman (56).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has always remained high quality and I will keep with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> For fear it may go or the price gets to high.  </li>
            <li> that your old perfume?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several hundred dollars later and many years wiser, I&#x27;m back to wearing my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, one of the few I can wear without getting a headache.  </li>
            <li> Coupled with the fact that they soon after purchased Bonne Bell&#x27;s Skin Musk Oil and modified the smell of that, I decided to search for a new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think this is new old stock, with the emphasis on old.  </li>
            <li> last year May2014 for more then half the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone if you like the soft smell.</li>
            <li> The cologne(s) had turned darker color and a noticeable fragrance issue developed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anything but and nearly gag every time I walk past a department store fragrance section because they&#x27;re so strong.</li>
            <li> Was sooo looking forward to having my old scent back since the stores quit carrying it.</li>
            <li> I was followed around by a young man who when I noticed him following me, told me that his girlfriend wears this perfume and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I love it, use it every day probably for the past 20 years, does not compare to any other cologne that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> evening, I was sitting at the computer looking at different perfume sites when I wondered if I might still like Aviance Night Musk despite the change in fragrance and likewise, since it had been so long, would the change in Sking Musk still be as obvious to</li>
            <li> With this last bottle I didn!t get any &amp; the scent didn!t last as long.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;He flat out said, You are wearing Aviance Night Musk by Prince Matchabelli.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this for a long time</li>
            <li> Although I can detect a slight change in the scent, it&#x27;s not as apparent to me as it was all those years ago.  </li>
            <li> If I was going to equate it to an outfit, I would say it is similar to a woman wearing a shoulder-less red dress that went down just short of the knee, with 3 to 4 inch slide-on heels, wearing the hair up, and dangling earrings, on the arms of a man wearing a dark suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has become very difficult to find in the stores, so I am glad I can still find it online...</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I was like a little girl, I was in such a hurry to try them on.  </li>
            <li> Used to get it all the time until they quit selling it a few years back.</li>
            <li> She has worn it for years and it is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Have looked in local stores for a long time , unable to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wife has been using this product for nearly 30 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this from amazon and actually when i first smelled it i wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
            <li> And the money I&#x27;ve spent!</li>
            <li> During the time I was trying all those other perfumes, no one ever commented on them.  </li>
            <li> During the time I was trying all those other perfumes, no one ever commented on them.  </li>
            <li> The bottle I usually get was not the same it</li>
            <li> However, my wife, whom I bought this for this year as well as last was not satisfied with it and again, threw it away.</li>
            <li> received it today and was most disappointed...</li>
            <li> is there any other reason not to purchase it?  </li>
            <li> Smells like it is pretty old :(</li>
            <li> this did not fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> It also lasted a long time on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, alas, Prince Matchabelli bought the scent and they radically changed the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> I figured that even if I didn&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s rare that I flat-out hate a perfume</li>
            <li> My late step-father in law would always ask me to buy it for him on amazon as a gift for his wife at Christmas.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FRAGRANCE FOR THE PAST 27 OR 28 YEARS!  </li>
            <li> My wife asserts that these are simply left over merchandise and have &#x27;gone bad&#x27;, as colognes will do.</li>
            <li> But turned out to be not a good idea.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all about this produce.  </li>
            <li> NOT A HAPPY CAMPER</li>
            <li> Why change it when it ain&#x27;t broken....</li>
            <li> but maybe it was a poor seller.  </li>
            <li> alas no luck.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in this last bottle.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Dangerously stinky, is what.</li>
            <li> I have used Aviance NIght Musk for years &amp; was so disappointed when I could no longer find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> and my husband hated it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not the original scent and the bottle has changed.  I am not happy at all about this produce.  Was sooo looking forward to having my old scent back since the stores quit carrying it. This is not at all the same product and should have a different name. Very misleading. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years.  It is the only one that every single time I put it on I get a compliment on how nice I smell.  Tried others - - no compliments.  Why change it when it ain&#x27;t broken....</li>
            <li> I love this perfume; it has a beautiful fragrance but is not overpowering.  Downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day so you have to reapply.</li>
            <li> No problems! Love this perfume! Wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> I got this from amazon and actually when i first smelled it i wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.But a month later i started wearing it and i love it!!! Its kind of warm and soft at the same time.I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance all the time but can&#x27;t find it in a store anymore.  So happy to find it online.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and was devistated when I could no longer get in in a store. Luckily for me Amazon once again provided the solution, the seller that I purchased it from was also awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the only purfume i&#x27;ve ever worn, besides a splurge on a 60 bottle of Dune. Working in a grocery store, I receive compliments daily on how good I smell. (Never on the Dune!) Can&#x27;t be found ANYWHERE except on line now. Mayjor inconvenience! But just happy to see it&#x27;s still being made so far.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 20 years and I love it. I get so many compliments on it everywhere I go. Very sexy smell...so I&#x27;m told...lol. It has become very difficult to find in the stores, so I am glad I can still find it online...Prince Matchabelli...Please don&#x27;t stop making this perfume!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years  fhen I couldn&#x27;t  find it  in our area now I have it back and I love it</li>
            <li> This is my mother in laws favorite perfume and can&#x27;t be purchased in stores around here anymore.  Is going to make the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> When the original Night Musk came out backin the eighties, I combined it with Bonne Bell Skin Musk Oil and this was my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent for years.  I seldom went through a day without a compliment and my husband loved the scent as much as I did.  It was reasonably priced and it smelled different on me than it did on others, which I think a good perfume should do. It also lasted a long time on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, alas, Prince Matchabelli bought the scent and they radically changed the smell of it.  I&#x27;ve never been able to understand why they did that but maybe it was a poor seller.  Coupled with the fact that they soon after purchased Bonne Bell&#x27;s Skin Musk Oil and modified the smell of that, I decided to search for a new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all kinds of perfumes in the last twenty years or so.  None of them lasted on me like my old standbys and none smelled as good to me.  And the money I&#x27;ve spent! The last perfume I tried that I thought would become my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; cost $90 a bottle and my husband hated it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One evening, I was sitting at the computer looking at different perfume sites when I wondered if I might still like Aviance Night Musk despite the change in fragrance and likewise, since it had been so long, would the change in Sking Musk still be as obvious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to Amazon and discovered that each was still available and I decided to order them.  When they arrived, I was like a little girl, I was in such a hurry to try them on.  Guess what?  Although I can detect a slight change in the scent, it&#x27;s not as apparent to me as it was all those years ago.  And best of all, the scent lingered for four hours until my husband came home from work.  His first question was, \\&quot;Is that your old perfume?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several hundred dollars later and many years wiser, I&#x27;m back to wearing my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent. Occasionally, out of nowhere, a waft of the Night Musk will come my way, and I think what a lovely scent it is.  It just seems to work with my body chemistry, especially with the Skin Musk, which I put on before I spray on the perfume.  It just smells like \\&quot;me\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy it&#x27;s still available and I so hope that Amazon will continue to stock it.  During the time I was trying all those other perfumes, no one ever commented on them.  Today I went shopping and a lady stopped me to tell me that I smelled so good!  It made my day!the Skin Musk, which I put on before I spray on the perfume.  It just smells like \\&quot;me\\&quot;.  I am so happy it&#x27;s still available and I so hope that Amazon will continue to stock it.  During the time I was trying all those other perfumes, no one ever commented on them.  Today I went shopping and a lady stopped me to tell me that I smelled so good!  It made my day!</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this and alway get tons of compliments when I have it on! I don&#x27;t like to wear anything else!</li>
            <li> I wanted a lite very mild earthy type smell.  this did not fit the bill.  it was too flowery for me.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found one of their products besides Wind Song, which I find too strong.  Aviance is a very light and truly delightful fragrance I get many compliments on when wearing.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Why has this perfume gone up to $72.00 when I got it last year May2014 for more then half the price.I love this and always used it,now I can&#x27;t buy it because its much.</li>
            <li> this has always been a faforite of mine and i will keep on using it the scent is not to much just right for me</li>
            <li> I thought they had quit making this product. When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled. This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find, so I am glad to be able to purchase it on-line. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance. I purchase it quite often. I have always been satisfied by the quality and service of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Like alot of women I used this cologne years ago then all of a sudden it dissapeared from stores. I was just thrilled when I came across it online so ordered it right away. I was dissappointed in it when I received it...just not the same as it used to be. It does not smell as good or last as long but, I also found the musk perfume oil which has not changed!! Just wish you could get it in a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have wore this for many years and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always remained high quality and I will keep with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST perfume.  I get many compliments on it, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but online.  I would recommend it to anyone if you like the soft smell.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00021717C Aviance Night Musk by Prince Matchabelli for Women 1.5 oz Extradordinary Cologne Natural Spray]]It has a nice scent and stays with you just like perfume. I will stay with this product forever!No allergy reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and continue to receive compliments on a regular basis.  I switched perfumes one time and the compliments stopped so I went back to Aviance and comments on the scent returned, so I am a sold on this product!  An added bonus, it is inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I like being able to purchase my favorite cologne. It is no longer available retail.</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever.  An old personal favorite of mine, I thought was no longer available</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this for a long time wish that there was a bath and body scrub too.</li>
            <li> I have used Aviance NIght Musk for years &amp; was so disappointed when I could no longer find it in the stores. I was holding out hope that they might have some available in sets that are sold around the holidays but alas no luck. When I found it on here I was so excited that there was still some of it somewhere that was available for purchase. Great price, same quality as I expected &amp; fast reliable shipping. Would definitely order from here again. Thank you for offering great product &amp; service!</li>
            <li> Smells like it is pretty old :(</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. But remember it is a musk so it smells different on everyone! I always get compliments about smelling good!</li>
            <li> I give this product  5 stars. I love it, use it every day probably for the past 20 years, does not compare to any other cologne that I&#x27;ve tried. People are always telling me &amp;#34;you smell so good, what are you wearing&amp;#34;? I&#x27;ll never change, even though I can only purchase it on -line.(can&#x27;t find in any store, any more). Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Hope that they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Prince Matchabelli is another company that has been around for a fair amount of time &amp; still produces great products without trying to cut corners.&lt;br /&gt;The ladies can use this spray any time of the day or night &amp; never be out of place wherever they go. The scent is not overpowering like so many others can be. This is a very sweet &amp; powdery scent that can used anytime,anywhere.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years, loves it.</li>
            <li> The bottle I usually get was not the same it didn!t have the crown on it &amp; it didn!t smell the same. I always got great compliments on how good it smelled . With this last bottle I didn!t get any &amp; the scent didn!t last as long. Was very disappointed in this last bottle.  Sorry -------.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite perfume. So glad someone on Amazon had it for her. It is a very pleasant and reasonably priced musk. Thanks for the service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite Cologne! Love it and the company shipped right away and the price was great. Very happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, one of the few I can wear without getting a headache.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne Spray...been using for over 25 years...Always get compliments...at this point, when I walk into my animal shelter, staff will say...&amp;#34;Carol is here&#x27;.. Realize it is individual body chemistry, but sure is my favorite...bought 10 bottles last order...always worried it might discontinue!</li>
            <li> What the hell is this,  I&#x27;ll need to do some research but perhaps I&#x27;m looking for Jovan&#x27; Night Musk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has no musk and makes my nose bleed.......</li>
            <li> Does not smell the same anymore. Used to get it all the time until they quit selling it a few years back. I sprayed it and didn&#x27;t like it but I figured I&#x27;d try it anyways. But turned out to be not a good idea. In fact when I wore it, instead of compliments I got complaints from people I worked with and at home. One even said it smelled like cheap perfume. Eeks! Not getting it ever again. This is the reverse of what I used to get told when I wore it. Guess I will have to give up on ever getting it again.</li>
            <li> So happy that I found this. It was my favorite cologne at one time.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 1 star rating, because the order arrived timely. However, my wife, whom I bought this for this year as well as last was not satisfied with it and again, threw it away. This was her favorite cologne for many years. When it was discontinued from manufacture, I was able to still buy it from various sources. The last three purchases(including the 2 from Amazon) were not acceptable. The cologne(s) had turned darker color and a noticeable fragrance issue developed. My wife asserts that these are simply left over merchandise and have &#x27;gone bad&#x27;, as colognes will do. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this has been available for the last 5 years or so. My late step-father in law would always ask me to buy it for him on amazon as a gift for his wife at Christmas. (He doesn&#x27;t use the internet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am an older woman (56). I was followed around by a young man who when I noticed him following me, told me that his girlfriend wears this perfume and he loves it! &amp;#34;He flat out said, You are wearing Aviance Night Musk by Prince Matchabelli.&amp;#34; I have been wearing this perfume since it came on to the market. It is light enough to wear in the daytime, then go into the night with a light touch-up.</li>
            <li> Have looked in local stores for a long time , unable to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wife has been using this product for nearly 30 years.&lt;br /&gt; Glad to find it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FRAGRANCE FOR THE PAST 27 OR 28 YEARS!  I HOPE IT NEVER GETS DISCONTINUED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i HAVE RECEIVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS TOO.  :)</li>
            <li> I think this is new old stock, with the emphasis on old.  It is stinky.  I couldn&#x27;t return it because it was deemed &amp;#34;dangerous.&amp;#34;  Please.  Dangerously stinky, is what.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, they should bring this back on the market. This is a natural sexy but clean smelling fragrance . Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for quite some time and I get a lot of compliments on it.  After I put it on I don&#x27;t keep smelling it and forget I have it on until someone compliments me on how good I smell.  I can&#x27;t get at local stores so I have to order it but am thankful I can.</li>
            <li> Being a musk-lover, I was totally excited to smell this perfume after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it today and was most disappointed...it has a sweet, light-ish musky smell in it that I like, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s positively overwhelmed by a scent that I can only describe as \\&quot;cheap-perfume smell.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, don&#x27;t mistake me for a perfume snob--I&#x27;m anything but and nearly gag every time I walk past a department store fragrance section because they&#x27;re so strong. But this has a chemical undertone that I wouldn&#x27;t want people to associate with me. It reminds me of the 80s...all the perfumes seemed to have it back then.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the only scent I can wear that does,t react with my body chemicals. It is fresh smelling-not overpowering.  Every time I wear it in public,people will say\\&quot;you really smell good! What scent are you wearing?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years and continue to get compliments often.  When you find that fragrance that works for you, stick with it!  The only place I have been able to find it now is on Amazon.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Ordered this without even knowing what it smells like.  I figured that even if I didn&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s rare that I flat-out hate a perfume (although I&#x27;m not fond of food-based perfumes), and there wasn&#x27;t much risk with it being inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply, this is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled.  It&#x27;s strong enough to get your attention, but in a classy way.  This smells like something you would wear if you were going to a fancy restaurant.  If I was going to equate it to an outfit, I would say it is similar to a woman wearing a shoulder-less red dress that went down just short of the knee, with 3 to 4 inch slide-on heels, wearing the hair up, and dangling earrings, on the arms of a man wearing a dark suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I smell it, I think how great it is that some purchases sometimes work out so well.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and has done so for many years. It is a wonderful perfume and she and I would recommend it to anyone. Also your service was great.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother. She has worn it for years and it is getting harder and harder to find. Shipping was fast.Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance a lot, I have worn it probably since it was first introduced in the 1980&#x27;s, and I guess you could call it my signature scent.  I dont douse myself in it like a lot of women do with fragrance, and I often get compliments on my fragragrance, and am asked what I am wearing.  Im glad that this scent has remained true to its origins and not changed formulations. It doesnt have an overpowering muskiness and I guess thats why I like it so much.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I would ever wear!</li>
            <li> Classic, sexy evening scent. Great for going out on the town, down to the local bar or staying in for a night of fun.</li>
            <li> This is the best buy I ever made.  And I never plan on changing it.  My problem is do I keep quite about this and the price goes up and harder to get, or just share this great find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also notice that it smells different on each person..  My friend put it on and I also and others could smell it differently on each of us.  Always got great responses to it.  Been using this for years(many years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I try to buy as many as 12 to 14 bottles when its priced right.  For fear it may go or the price gets to high.  This is my gold and affordable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When wearing this I feel so beautiful,special and proud. And the find on a good price is even a bigger thrill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU  THANK YOU  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> i will buy this every time i finish bottlle. its my favorite. please always stock it.. i love it so much</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I worn this when I was in High School and everyone loved it both girls and boys. This is one of my all time favs and I do purchase it to remind me of the sweet time in my life . . . love the smell of any musk.</li>
            <li> When your wife loves it and you love the fragrance being around her.......is there any other reason not to purchase it?  I will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend.  She had said that she loved it but couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  She&#x27;s happy...I&#x27;m happy!</li>
