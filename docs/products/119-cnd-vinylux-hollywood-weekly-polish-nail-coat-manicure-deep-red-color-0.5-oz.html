            <li>I used the Vinylux top coat with this and had some chipping after about 4 days.  </li>
            <li>All in One better.</li>
            <li>Even without top coat it lasted 10 days.  </li>

            <li>great nail polish that stays on longer than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Great polish and will last for ever.  </li>
            <li>With this polish, I am assured a full week&#x27;s of wear and they will remain almost intact.  </li>
            <li>good stays on longer than regular nail polish,but still chips</li>
            <li>This polish is outstanding in that it dries quickly, lasts a full seven days without chipping and seems to make my nails much stronger.  </li>
            <li>This color is great too, a little shiny which I like.</li>
            <li>, my nails had a distinct pinkish tone which I do not like.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, and nice for the holidays, but I prefer flat polish.</li>
            <li>I have issues w/nail polish lasting more than 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li>My polish lasted over a week with no chipping, and came off easily with regular nail polish remover!</li>
            <li>I also like that it can be removed with regular, acetone free nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>They work really well for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried other colors and they were better.</li>
            <li>That said, be aware that this particular shade is more of a hot pink (with gold flecks mixed in) than a true red.</li>
            <li>I love this color and yes, it does last longer on me than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; color is a nice red with a slight shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>Red color is pretty.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about it any other way.  </li>
            <li>The color is okay, but so hard to get off.  </li>
            <li>It took a little extra rubbing to remove, but came off fine with regular polish remover.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails and get at least 7 days of full wear.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m usually afraid to wear red polish because chips are so obvious, but now I&#x27;m free to wear red again!</li>
            <li> Only lasts a few days like a regular polish does.</li>
            <li> It lasted longer than regular polish, but not a full week.</li>
            <li> Even after 2 coats, I still felt like it wasn&#x27;t on thick enough.  </li>
            <li> This polish seems to fall off and become chipped quickly, not like the others</li>

            <li> I was so surprised that it was so long wearing without damaging my nails or being difficult to remove!</li>
            <li> The reason we wear a base coat is so that the intense color does not discolor finger nails.  </li>
            <li> I did not use a base coat as the instructions stated and my fingernails had a red tint once the polish was off.  </li>
            <li> This polish is very thin.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, you cannot use a base coat.  </li>

            <li> Polish works great and lasted about 10 days before it showed too much wear on my finger nails. Still looks great on my toe nails after two weeks. The &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; color is a nice red with a slight shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> Has a hint of gold I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but is nice.</li>
            <li> Looks good but didn&#x27;t stay as well as gel. STAINED my nails!</li>
            <li> I loved wearing this over the holidays!</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li> This polish seems to fall off and become chipped quickly, not like the others</li>
            <li> Rated 2  stars  Chipping on day 3  cheapr  polish have been better l let my friend try it  .she is  Still laughing....</li>
            <li> I love this color and yes, it does last longer on me than regular nail polish.  Not a week, but about 4 days with no chips.  I also like that it can be removed with regular, acetone free nail polish remover.  On the negative side, you cannot use a base coat.  I have tried, and it chips within a day on my hands.  The reason we wear a base coat is so that the intense color does not discolor finger nails.  That plus is lost with this polish and after removal, my nails had a distinct pinkish tone which I do not like.  If discoloration does not occur on your nails, then this will be a great polish for you.</li>
            <li> Had a manicure yesterday.  Red color is pretty.  Lasts 7 to 10 days. !!  Great polish.  Colors are close to bottle.</li>
            <li> great nail polish that stays on longer than regular nail polish.  Love this color, great for the holidays!  Would recommend this. Shipped fast</li>
            <li> Did not like the iridescent color.  It lasted longer than regular polish, but not a full week. I have tried other colors and they were better.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a plain/shiny red, but it actually has a gold, shimmery undertone.  Pretty, and nice for the holidays, but I prefer flat polish. Personal preference.</li>
            <li> This polish is great! After 2 weeks I only had minor wear on the tips. I&#x27;m usually afraid to wear red polish because chips are so obvious, but now I&#x27;m free to wear red again! It took a little extra rubbing to remove, but came off fine with regular polish remover. I also used the top coat, which added shine.</li>
            <li> Best polish, does not rub off the tips of nails.</li>
            <li> I love Vinylux.... I&#x27;ve tried the stickers you put on with heat and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the wear I get from Vinylux. I paint my nails and get at least 7 days of full wear. I&#x27;m a technology teacher, with short nails, so the tips of my nails take a beating on the keyboard, but the polish stays put. Love this!</li>
            <li> I had a manicure done at a salon with this polish, and fell in love with the Vinylux line. My polish lasted over a week with no chipping, and came off easily with regular nail polish remover! I was so surprised that it was so long wearing without damaging my nails or being difficult to remove! I&#x27;ll be stocking up on more colors! Scarlet Letter is a beautiful deep red...perfect for fall manicures!</li>
            <li> I have issues w/nail polish lasting more than 2 or 3 days.  With this polish, I am assured a full week&#x27;s of wear and they will remain almost intact.  I don&#x27;t have to be applying extra coats of polish to cover up  chips.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy</li>
            <li> This polish is very thin. Even after 2 coats, I still felt like it wasn&#x27;t on thick enough.  I used the Vinylux top coat with this and had some chipping after about 4 days.  Regular nail polish remover does take it off, but not as easily as regular polish.  I did not use a base coat as the instructions stated and my fingernails had a red tint once the polish was off.  So between the stained fingernails, consistency of the polish and it chipping even after they said it would last a week, I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly rated in Consumer Reports.  The color is okay, but so hard to get off.  Nothing special about it any other way.  Still like Essie or Sally Hanson All in One better.</li>
            <li> Great polish and will last for ever.  Even without top coat it lasted 10 days.  Product and color are a keeper.</li>
            <li> I love these polishes. They work really well for me. This color is great too, a little shiny which I like.</li>
            <li> good stays on longer than regular nail polish,but still chips</li>
            <li> Does not last a week as promised. Only lasts a few days like a regular polish does.</li>
            <li> This is my go to color for the Holidays!  Love the no chip CND Vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I wore this polish for the week like video said, then wore a different color, nails got weak and broke.  Would like to return</li>
            <li> This polish is outstanding in that it dries quickly, lasts a full seven days without chipping and seems to make my nails much stronger.  I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> CND Vinylux is the best nail polish line on the market today. I don&#x27;t use anything else anymore because of how well these polishes work and last. That said, be aware that this particular shade is more of a hot pink (with gold flecks mixed in) than a true red.</li>
