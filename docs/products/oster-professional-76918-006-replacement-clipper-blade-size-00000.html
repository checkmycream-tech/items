            <li>Love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Excellent Quality, but did&#x27;nt shave as close as I thought it would based on prior reviews.  </li>
            <li>Did leave scalp a bit irritated, but I think that had to do with making too many passes</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I chose the 00000 (0.2mm).</li>
            <li>and I love the product.</li>
            <li>If your trying to leave more hair use the #1 with a guard attachment of the desired length you would like to remain on the head.</li>
            <li>I simply love the quality of the 76 and it&#x27;s accessories.</li>
            <li>Great add on or replacement blade for whole head clipping.</li>
            <li>Nice and tight.....very smooth</li>

            <li>Does ok.</li>
            <li>I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades.</li>
            <li>I am bald on top and used to shave my head.</li>
            <li>Love this blade.  </li>
            <li>rust/etc since I purchased it many months ago.  </li>
            <li>Great item, working well, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice and precise clean cuts.</li>
            <li>It lets me go 1 week between cuts more comfortably than with the 000.</li>
            <li>Perfect for shaving my beard before military deployments.  </li>
            <li>This clipper takes my beard down to a one day growth length - which is perfect for finishing up with a razor.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>I use it on a 3-4 day cycle and it cuts just fine.  </li>
            <li>Love the product,  quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Perfect cut for those of use who are not ready to totally shave our heads, perfect fit for classic 76 clipper,</li>
            <li>so you can then shave smooth with a razor, just keep the 000 blade as it is fine for that.  </li>
            <li>Came nice and fast</li>
            <li>fantastic blades</li>
            <li>Fantastic cut</li>
            <li>Its a clip on so its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t they include this finest available blade in the original kit?  </li>
            <li>I own the Classic 76</li>
            <li>blade.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived ahead of schedule in the original packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The professional clippers are very nice - no plastic guards - just swap out the whole clipping blade.</li>
            <li>Always a good product that keeps my hair verrrrrrry short, just the way I like it.  </li>
            <li>I was told that Oster doesn&#x27;t make the Agion blades anymore which may be true</li>
            <li>This is perfect for \\&quot;high and tight\\&quot; haircuts, and any other close cuts where you want an</li>
            <li>I had the classic 76 clippers for a while with the 0.5 mm and these are so much better .</li>
            <li>shave bold</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>Gets right to the skin just like a clean up trimmer.</li>
            <li>I clean them after every use with barbicide solution, dry them up real good, and then apply oil until the following week that I reuse them to cut my hair...</li>
            <li>I have been using the 000 (0.5mm) blades that came with my Oster Classic 76, and they&#x27;re great, but I need to use it about every three days to keep my hair as short as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>This is a great blade that gives u the bald head in less time and with no nicks.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty straight-forward item, deserving an equally concise description.</li>
            <li>The 000 was not cutting it for me anymore.</li>
            <li>it, and worth every penny</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>but right on the package of the blade I received</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own to get the closest shave possible and don&#x27;t mind a tiny bit of stubble, then the 00000 is the way to go for sure.  </li>
            <li>Easy blade change out for professional or beginner use.</li>
            <li>My Classic 76 came with the 000 blade and it works fine, but I wanted to try this blade as I saw the reviews saying it gave a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Today I got the 00000 in the mail (very fast shipping from Beauty 4 U) and they are exactly what I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish they had this product in the EU region at a better price, so I have to order from Amazon.com, pay import duty, extra freight, etc and still make a saving!</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I should HAVE bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>First off the product in the picture which is the AGION blade is not what the seller BYPLE is selling.</li>
            <li>saved me so much money by buying this and shaving my husband hair myself !</li>
            <li>Take care if you have a zit on your head, it will get sliced off with the hair (really!).</li>
            <li>The product is  good after a few months of use I&#x27;m beginning to see some rust build up..</li>
            <li>For most folks no mod neccessary, but if you want super close (I try to match where my hair is receding all around)</li>
            <li>These blades keep cool, and plow through overdue growth to bring back your clean neck and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 3 year old Oster &amp;#34;00000&amp;#34; blade was old and rust spots on it but worked way better.</li>
            <li>Quality blade that needs very little to stay in good operation.</li>
            <li>That was too messy...got too many nicks...took too long.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and cuts close without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>But by the touch you can really tell its a nice and tight cut.</li>
            <li>The difference wasn&#x27;t all that much, but at these tiny lengths, the smallest difference is huge.  </li>
            <li>Cuts hair very close, won&#x27;t pull hair or cut the skin.</li>
            <li>Cuts REALLY CLOSE.</li>
            <li>like really close).</li>
            <li>With mod, this blade cuts 1/2 day growth close.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this fine-quality, close-cutting and durably-built</li>
            <li>Love the ease of changing blades to do a military cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does heat up fast</li>
            <li>(I was worried that it would not cut much closer than my 000.  </li>
            <li>i use it every 2-3 weeks, does not require much time or effort to do my head.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>These blades provide a really close haircut for anyone wanting that near-bald look.</li>
            <li>Oh and this is Bill Tracy really.  </li>
            <li>If you are not sure if these are appropriate for you, please check with the manufacturer of your clippers before purchasing!</li>
            <li>I would caution any/all users to keep it perfectly clean, brushing after every use and thoroughly oiled, not only for lubrication, but to prevent corrosion.  </li>
            <li>i got it for my oster classic 76</li>
            <li>: These are designed to work with the Oster Classic 76 (and compatible) clipper sets.</li>
            <li>I have the Oster classic system.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it,  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li>Would be nicer if it cut a little closer since this seems to be the closest cut of the fitting blades.</li>
            <li>Just got this blade for my new 76.</li>
            <li>Looks used, but I thought I purchased new.</li>
            <li>Oster is such a smart product!</li>
            <li>I cut my hair weekly; this was the only size that could cut close enough on these clippers that took enough of the top, then finish it up with trimmers.</li>
            <li>It could be completely my fault...</li>
            <li>The mod is simple.</li>
            <li>For my skin and hair color, my hair doesn&#x27;t actually look that much shorter than the 000 blade.</li>
            <li>-and old, bald guy...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m slightly annoyed that I have to own two, wholly un-used blades to make my clipper work.&lt;br /&gt;Heck</li>
            <li>I just need it super close, because graying hair on dark brown skin shows up with 1 or 2 days growth.</li>
            <li>will cut you with the powerful motor or the 76 and sharp moving blade.</li>
            <li>What you will get is the regular OLDER blade.when</li>
            <li>It cuts ok but it does NOT fit flush against the clipper body as all my other replacement blades.</li>
            <li>If you want a completely bald feel &amp; look, will still need to shave your head with a traditional shaver.</li>
            <li>and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue!</li>
            <li>Did a slight mod.</li>
            <li>this will take down any fluff you might have right to 1/20 of an inch.</li>

            <li> Cuts REALLY CLOSE.</li>
            <li> like really close).</li>
            <li> With mod, this blade cuts 1/2 day growth close.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this fine-quality, close-cutting and durably-built</li>
            <li> Love the ease of changing blades to do a military cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does heat up fast</li>
            <li> (I was worried that it would not cut much closer than my 000.  </li>
            <li> i use it every 2-3 weeks, does not require much time or effort to do my head.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> These blades provide a really close haircut for anyone wanting that near-bald look.</li>
            <li> Oh and this is Bill Tracy really.  </li>
            <li> If you are not sure if these are appropriate for you, please check with the manufacturer of your clippers before purchasing!</li>
            <li> I would caution any/all users to keep it perfectly clean, brushing after every use and thoroughly oiled, not only for lubrication, but to prevent corrosion.  </li>
            <li> i got it for my oster classic 76</li>
            <li> : These are designed to work with the Oster Classic 76 (and compatible) clipper sets.</li>
            <li> I have the Oster classic system.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it,  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li> Would be nicer if it cut a little closer since this seems to be the closest cut of the fitting blades.</li>
            <li> Just got this blade for my new 76.</li>
            <li> Looks used, but I thought I purchased new.</li>
            <li> Oster is such a smart product!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair weekly; this was the only size that could cut close enough on these clippers that took enough of the top, then finish it up with trimmers.</li>
            <li> It could be completely my fault...</li>
            <li> The mod is simple.</li>
            <li> For my skin and hair color, my hair doesn&#x27;t actually look that much shorter than the 000 blade.</li>
            <li> -and old, bald guy...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m slightly annoyed that I have to own two, wholly un-used blades to make my clipper work.&lt;br /&gt;Heck</li>
            <li> I just need it super close, because graying hair on dark brown skin shows up with 1 or 2 days growth.</li>
            <li> will cut you with the powerful motor or the 76 and sharp moving blade.</li>
            <li> What you will get is the regular OLDER blade.when</li>
            <li> It cuts ok but it does NOT fit flush against the clipper body as all my other replacement blades.</li>
            <li> If you want a completely bald feel &amp; look, will still need to shave your head with a traditional shaver.</li>
            <li> and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue!</li>
            <li> Did a slight mod.</li>
            <li> this will take down any fluff you might have right to 1/20 of an inch.</li>
            <li> My haircut looked like I just got it nearly 5 days later due to how close the shave is.  </li>
            <li> He loves to have his hair High and tight.</li>
            <li> Such a tight cut, super heavy duty blade.</li>
            <li> also I&#x27;m hopping to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I used the other blade, the 1 and found it extremely short.  </li>
            <li> I give myself a high and tight every two weeks and between this and my other blades makes for a sharp barber shop cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I searched long and carefully trying to ensure I got OEM quality</li>
            <li> More than half the teeth on the blade were broken, not sure why anyone didn&#x27;t catch that before shipping</li>
            <li> Turn blade over in your hand slightly loosen the 2 screws, with your thumbs push upper blade toward edge of lower blade (as close as you like).</li>
            <li> Be careful though it will nick like a razor.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as expected, and even exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Close as you need to be for a military &amp;#34;High &amp; Tight&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Does just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful though, these clippers are really sharp.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my face with this on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I thought about too late, but next week I&#x27;ll try to remember.</li>
            <li> I place the blades on edge and pushed down against bathroom tile and checked with magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> so I do have to spay it down with cooling spray.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because it&#x27;s a knockoff or what, but the &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; part of my blade chipped off 2 days after i bought it from setting my clippers down on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> They are still sharp, and working properly just sucks to see the few dots of rust build up.</li>
            <li> Cuts closer than previous one.</li>
            <li> What I am most unhappy about is Amazon allowing false advertising of the products they sell on their web site (this in spite of the fact that you have been notified a number of times in the reviews on your web site that the products received were not as they were described).</li>
            <li> You advertise on probably half of all of your Oster blades as having the Agion coating, when you know that they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so I would think that Oster has made quite a few blades since 2007.Its not worth returning the blade &amp; paying the shipping when I didn&#x27;t make the mistake</li>
            <li> TIGHT...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t feel any with the grade, but very slight stubble against the grade.</li>
            <li> but it was hard to distinguish from others and end the end</li>
            <li> (I was experimenting with different cutting angles and directions.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously well engineered clipper blade.</li>
            <li> Be careful when cut to watch for cutting angle.</li>
            <li> You are advertising that your Oster blades have a Agion coating, which is false.</li>
            <li> In spite of that fact, you are falsely advertising that the blades you are selling do have the Agion coating</li>
            <li> Over all will order again once this clip becomes useless....</li>
            <li> , this is a must-have in your hair cutting arsenal.</li>
            <li> Pulls my hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> This blade is a piece of crap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this blade is so fantastic, I knocked my mother-in-law to the ground &amp; gave her a baldy cut! now she looks better!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect. Cuts hair very close, won&#x27;t pull hair or cut the skin. Love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> THE  Package  was  clearly  open. the  blade itself  is  good  for  low  bald  fades for the  1st  guide  line</li>
            <li> it cuts so close, people be like maaaaaaaan how u cut it so close??? i got it for my oster classic 76</li>
            <li> I have the triple and quad 0 clippers and talked with a barber about getting closer this is amazing.  Gets right to the skin just like a clean up trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty straight-forward item, deserving an equally concise description. You&#x27;re looking at a blade set for the Oster 76 (and compatible) clippers. This is perfect for \\&quot;high and tight\\&quot; haircuts, and any other close cuts where you want an almost-shaved look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the self-groomers to the pro barbers, this is a must-have in your hair cutting arsenal. These blades keep cool, and plow through overdue growth to bring back your clean neck and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cut close enough to use as trimmers for in-between haircut edging/shaping as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: These are designed to work with the Oster Classic 76 (and compatible) clipper sets. If you are not sure if these are appropriate for you, please check with the manufacturer of your clippers before purchasing!</li>
            <li> this blade is great!  this will take down any fluff you might have right to 1/20 of an inch.</li>
            <li> Always a good product that keeps my hair verrrrrrry short, just the way I like it.  I just wish they had this product in the EU region at a better price, so I have to order from Amazon.com, pay import duty, extra freight, etc and still make a saving!</li>
            <li> I usually shave my face with this on a regular basis.  Cuts REALLY CLOSE. Quality blade that needs very little to stay in good operation.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously well engineered clipper blade.</li>
            <li> Top Of The Line!!!! Bought from Amazon and saved $20!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality, but did&#x27;nt shave as close as I thought it would based on prior reviews.  If you want a completely bald feel &amp; look, will still need to shave your head with a traditional shaver.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of usage out of this blade.  It is excellent for balding and close shaves.</li>
            <li> The product is  good after a few months of use I&#x27;m beginning to see some rust build up.. It could be completely my fault... I clean them after every use with barbicide solution, dry them up real good, and then apply oil until the following week that I reuse them to cut my hair... They are still sharp, and working properly just sucks to see the few dots of rust build up. Over all will order again once this clip becomes useless....</li>
            <li> Just got this blade for my new 76. Did a slight mod. Loosened screws and brought the blades (upper and lower  almost flush (like really close). Cut head bald. Blade got all the hair off...can&#x27;t feel any with the grade, but very slight stubble against the grade. Did leave scalp a bit irritated, but I think that had to do with making too many passes (I was experimenting with different cutting angles and directions. That was yesterday. Today not feeling irritated, but will see if I get razor bumps. I don&#x27;t think so, but this cut is as close to a razor as I have had. With mod, this blade cuts 1/2 day growth close. For most folks no mod neccessary, but if you want super close (I try to match where my hair is receding all around) you can play with blade. Didn&#x27;t do a before after pic cause I thought about too late, but next week I&#x27;ll try to remember. I just need it super close, because graying hair on dark brown skin shows up with 1 or 2 days growth. The mod is simple. Turn blade over in your hand slightly loosen the 2 screws, with your thumbs push upper blade toward edge of lower blade (as close as you like). Mine is almost flush. I place the blades on edge and pushed down against bathroom tile and checked with magnifying glass. then tighten while still holding against tile. Be careful when cut to watch for cutting angle. Too close to perpendicular with scalp will cut you with the powerful motor or the 76 and sharp moving blade. I already did this so you don&#x27;t have to try at home. Bald is Bad!</li>
            <li> This is as close a cut as you&#x27;ll get in the Oster clipper blade line - the ol&#x27; quintuple zero!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would imagine it could shave a head well. But personally, I use this both on my neck and to get my sideburns squared away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this fine-quality, close-cutting and durably-built AgION \\&quot;00000\\&quot; blade.</li>
            <li> It works great. Cuts closer than previous one. The 000 was not cutting it for me anymore. The 00000 is what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 000 (0.5mm) blades that came with my Oster Classic 76, and they&#x27;re great, but I need to use it about every three days to keep my hair as short as I&#x27;d like.  Today I got the 00000 in the mail (very fast shipping from Beauty 4 U) and they are exactly what I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have said that the 00000 leaves your head looking like about one day&#x27;s stubble after shaving with a razor, and that seems correct.  I&#x27;ve never shaved my head with a razor, but after using this blade, the hair on my head was shorter than the two day beard I had.  I considered buying the 0000 (0.25mm) instead, but I&#x27;m glad I chose the 00000 (0.2mm).</li>
            <li> Get nice and close. Got exactly what I wanted. Came nice and fast and I love the product. Works great</li>
            <li> This came with my Oster clipper.  I will never use it - too short!  I used the other blade, the 1 and found it extremely short.  I have now ordered longer blades.  If you want short hair, this blade is for you, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Nice and precise clean cuts. Easy blade change out for professional or beginner use. I would recommend this blade.</li>
            <li> These things are awesome, it works exactly like I&#x27;d hoped it would ! I had the classic 76 clippers for a while with the 0.5 mm and these are so much better .</li>
            <li> I have the Oster classic system. One of my blades is #000. So I got this one to. You can feel the difference. I should HAVE bought it in the first place.  SW</li>
            <li> Oster is such a smart product! I own the Classic 76 and I use it to cut my husbands hair. Love the ease of changing blades to do a military cut. He loves to have his hair High and tight. I switch out blades from #1,#000,#0000,#00000 to fade his sides! If your trying to leave more hair use the #1 with a guard attachment of the desired length you would like to remain on the head. Oster Rocks. You can use universal guard attachments if you don&#x27;t want to use the Oster brand.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Awesome delivery too!</li>
            <li> Great for close cuts. I give myself a high and tight every two weeks and between this and my other blades makes for a sharp barber shop cut.&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up fast so I do have to spay it down with cooling spray.</li>
            <li> Bad Product! Pulls my hair instead of cutting it. My 3 year old Oster &amp;#34;00000&amp;#34; blade was old and rust spots on it but worked way better. Do not buy this product, you will be very disappointed with its results. Cannot cut my hair with this blade.</li>
            <li> Perfect cut for those of use who are not ready to totally shave our heads, perfect fit for classic 76 clipper,</li>
            <li> fantastic blades - I got the 0000 and 00000 - they shave close - thus the point of the 0000 .25mm and 00000 .2mm.      The professional clippers are very nice - no plastic guards - just swap out the whole clipping blade.</li>
            <li> This blade cuts amazingly short. I simply love the quality of the 76 and it&#x27;s accessories. For my skin and hair color, my hair doesn&#x27;t actually look that much shorter than the 000 blade. But by the touch you can really tell its a nice and tight cut. It lets me go 1 week between cuts more comfortably than with the 000.</li>
            <li> Love the product,  quick delivery.  Works great with my machine,  I highly recommend it,  thank you so much I&#x27;ll be back to shop</li>
            <li> Very high quality and cuts close without any irritation.  When asking my father-in-law who is a barber when I should get it sharpened, &amp;#34;not in your lifetime&amp;#34;.  I guess that is assuring?!</li>
            <li> meet expectations,very good, is for people they want to&lt;br /&gt;to shave bold also I&#x27;m hopping to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great add on or replacement blade for whole head clipping. Only leaves a five o&#x27;clock shadow. Be careful though it will nick like a razor.</li>
            <li> I have now had a chance to try this blade set once.  It works exactly as expected, and even exceeds my expectations.  (I was worried that it would not cut much closer than my 000.  However, it&#x27;s a LOT closer than the 000.)</li>
            <li> OSTER HAS BECOME THE KING OF CLIPPERS. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH ALL OF MY OSTER GEAR.....OSTER....THATS ALL I NEED TO SAY -</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Nice and tight.....very smooth</li>
            <li> I cut my hair weekly; this was the only size that could cut close enough on these clippers that took enough of the top, then finish it up with trimmers. End result looks great.  I would buy this size blade again and would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Excellent item &amp; service</li>
            <li> This blade is a piece of crap.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because it&#x27;s a knockoff or what, but the &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; part of my blade chipped off 2 days after i bought it from setting my clippers down on my bathroom counter.  No dropping, nothing.  And now its a 25 dollar paper weight that was used successfully once and will cut you if you try to use it again.  Dont recommend buying this blade from here...</li>
            <li> I wanted to triple deuce I don&#x27;t know why this is not it but it&#x27;s fine I&#x27;ll deal with it</li>
            <li> Cuts hair bald love this blade</li>
            <li> First off the product in the picture which is the AGION blade is not what the seller BYPLE is selling. What you will get is the regular OLDER blade.when I contacted the seller BYPLE I was told that Oster doesn&#x27;t make the Agion blades anymore which may be true I have no idea but BYPLE went on to say that I received the NEWEST blade Oster makes but right on the package of the blade I received it says 2007 so I would think that Oster has made quite a few blades since 2007.Its not worth returning the blade &amp; paying the shipping when I didn&#x27;t make the mistake so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it.If you are in the market for the Agion blade just look on the net  they can be found for under $20 because you won&#x27;t get it from this seller.</li>
            <li> Works awesome on pups and me!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yup cut my hair too</li>
            <li> Does ok. You need to be mindful when shaving with this product for it will snag on your skin. Would be nicer if it cut a little closer since this seems to be the closest cut of the fitting blades.</li>
            <li> I will preface my statement by saying I love my Oster clippers and blades. What I am most unhappy about is Amazon allowing false advertising of the products they sell on their web site (this in spite of the fact that you have been notified a number of times in the reviews on your web site that the products received were not as they were described). You are advertising that your Oster blades have a Agion coating, which is false. None of the blades I was sent have this coating (I brought 8 blades) and I found out after receiving the non Agion blades that Oster no longer uses this coating on their blades for about a year now. In spite of that fact, you are falsely advertising that the blades you are selling do have the Agion coating and I am very surprised that a reputable company like Amazon would allow this extensive false advertising to continue! You advertise on probably half of all of your Oster blades as having the Agion coating, when you know that they don&#x27;t. Shame on you Amazon!</li>
            <li> since i got this blade (size 00000), i haven&#x27;t visited a barber. i use it every 2-3 weeks, does not require much time or effort to do my head.&lt;br /&gt;love it, and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Close as you need to be for a military &amp;#34;High &amp; Tight&amp;#34; look....however for a proper fade you need to regress to blades 0000,000,0A, then 1</li>
            <li> I am bald on top and used to shave my head. That was too messy...got too many nicks...took too long. I got the five zero blade for my oster clippers..it leaves what amounts to two or three days growth on my head and I can buzz my head in about five minutes when I do it once a week. This is a great blade that gives u the bald head in less time and with no nicks. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> TIGHT... This is as close to a shaved head as youre going to get without a razor</li>
            <li> Super product. Bald as a babies butt</li>
            <li> saved me so much money by buying this and shaving my husband hair myself ! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> As described and on time</li>
            <li> It cuts ok but it does NOT fit flush against the clipper body as all my other replacement blades. I searched long and carefully trying to ensure I got OEM quality but it was hard to distinguish from others and end the end took a gamble on this one.</li>
            <li> Quality 00000 blade but it is the regular one, not the Arctic Collection blade.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived ahead of schedule in the original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving my beard before military deployments.  This clipper takes my beard down to a one day growth length - which is perfect for finishing up with a razor.  Before getting this clipper I was spending an hour shaving my beard off and continually emptying a clogged razor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cut and oh so close.  My haircut looked like I just got it nearly 5 days later due to how close the shave is.  I would definitely recommend the Oster 76 and the 00000 blade to others.</li>
            <li> More than half the teeth on the blade were broken, not sure why anyone didn&#x27;t catch that before shipping</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. It adds an extra &amp;#34;crispness&amp;#34; to my son&#x27;s bald fades. I highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a really close haircut for anyone wanting that near-bald look. Just be careful though, these clippers are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with oil on it. Looks used, but I thought I purchased new.</li>
            <li> Well Gosh!!  Why don&#x27;t they include this finest available blade in the original kit?  The bade set is just fine,  perfect for my needs and I&#x27;m slightly annoyed that I have to own two, wholly un-used blades to make my clipper work.&lt;br /&gt;Heck yes!  The 5-0 blade set is about as close as one can get without using soap and a razor.  I use it on a 3-4 day cycle and it cuts just fine.  I would caution any/all users to keep it perfectly clean, brushing after every use and thoroughly oiled, not only for lubrication, but to prevent corrosion.  For Skin Heads - or those who wish, this is the blade-set of choice.  -and old, bald guy...</li>
            <li> Love this blade.  It&#x27;s as close to a bald cut as you can get.  It&#x27;s a great product and has had no problems/rust/etc since I purchased it many months ago.  Will update if any problems occur but I am not expecting that.</li>
            <li> Such a tight cut, super heavy duty blade.</li>
            <li> Great item, working well, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my hair low/bald. Its a clip on so its easy to clean. Its get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works great and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> My Classic 76 came with the 000 blade and it works fine, but I wanted to try this blade as I saw the reviews saying it gave a much closer shave.  I did a comparison and shaved part of my head with the 000 and another part with the 00000 blade.  The difference wasn&#x27;t all that much, but at these tiny lengths, the smallest difference is huge.  If you&#x27;re using the 000 blade to get hair shorter so you can then shave smooth with a razor, just keep the 000 blade as it is fine for that.  if you want to just use the buzzer on it&#x27;s own to get the closest shave possible and don&#x27;t mind a tiny bit of stubble, then the 00000 is the way to go for sure.  Oh and this is Bill Tracy really.  I&#x27;m on my wife&#x27;s account posting under her name, lol</li>
            <li> This one gets me almost bald. Well constructed, good price and quick delivery. Does just what I expected. Take care if you have a zit on your head, it will get sliced off with the hair (really!). Good purchase.</li>
