            <li>It works best of the &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; I have tried.</li>
            <li>but it works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>But the spray... ooohhh, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>works great!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice item!</li>
            <li>I have the unscented roll on which is great as well but wish I had the lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to all the aluminum compounds, so this is great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>Works great but needs to be reapplied once or twice throughout the day to remain effective.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it arrived in a roll-on rather than a spray.  </li>
            <li>eco-friendly and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use to &amp;</li>
            <li>This product has a nice scent as well.</li>
            <li>It works best on clean skin, so I apply it right after my shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>These crystal sprays are the best product I have found for natural Deoderant &amp; I</li>
            <li>But it is a great deoderant if you put it on right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Crystal lavender/white tea deodorant is great and works really well.</li>
            <li>I love this product but everytime I get one the pump stops working before the product is gone.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i was able to take this 4 ounces with me in my carry on on an airplane.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Yep, it smells more like water than it does like any scent at all.</li>
            <li>what I love about the crystal sprays is that you don&#x27;t feel residue on your underarms all day, it feels like nothing.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love my Crystal stick roll on and saw it in the recommended products.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works better the longer you use it.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>A nice light scent while helping to prevent body odor.</li>
            <li>for the most part you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My most favorite deoddorants scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is ok.</li>
            <li>Well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>love the lavender scent.</li>
            <li>Liked the free shipping.</li>
            <li>The roll-on I got works OK, though.</li>
            <li>Very nice light fresh floral smell.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Love the spray as it is easy on your skin.</li>
            <li>I alternate it with Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals, which is also very good but can irritate my skin if I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is very effective and all natural.  </li>
            <li>I apply it to areas that sweat other than the underarms (I use a crystal for my underarms), and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The spray is easy to use everywhere.</li>
            <li>And oh! I&#x27;d have to make sure when applying; they&#x27;d have to be clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the spray before, and found it was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance and works okay, but I don&#x27;t find it nearly as effective as the plain roll-on Crystal kind that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>The tube in the bottle is too cheap....</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also light and pleasing.  </li>
            <li>Works well &amp; is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>far so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and lightweight (the scent is also nice, not too overpowering)and yet keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li>I love the lavender scent, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the spray goes on everywhere opposed to the roll on which is amazing</li>
            <li>Even if you are entirely clean out of the shower, you are still applying it to your skin.  </li>
            <li>This had a fresh and light scent.</li>
            <li>I have gotten several compliments from people telling me that I smell good after I used this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasant and not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;Please allow the spray deodorant to dry before you put your clothes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of the name of it right now, but it had a fresh lavender scent that was light and airy.</li>
            <li>I use this as a replacement for normal deodorant, and i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of lavender scents, but this deodorant smells very pleasant and lasts me the entire day.</li>
            <li>This definitely keeps odors at bay and even works like a healthy antiperspirant!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh, clean smell from it...as long as it&#x27;s not too hot outside this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop sweat, but I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot anyway, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t really consider that good information because even many traditional deodorants aren&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>is very good, I recommend having a delicate and fresh scent, in addition to use for the body, I apply it to clothes and into bed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and am quite happy.</li>
            <li>I do have to apply it 2 - 3 times throughout the day, especially on hot days, but if you are a light perspirer you will probably only need to apply it once.</li>
            <li>I still use it and it is still effective, but it definitely retained some of the stinky pit scent.</li>
            <li>It is kind of drippy at first, but does dry with no residue.</li>
            <li>I am so sad they stopped selling this in my area, it&#x27;s literally the best deodorant ever.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either:</li>
            <li>Love this product- use it daily</li>
            <li>Once my symptoms disappeared, I was FINALLY able to go back to my deodorant.</li>
            <li>All natural, smells good, &amp; lasts a really, really long time.</li>
            <li>But, I quickly learned that this is a plus, not a negative.  </li>
            <li>This nicely tones things down, without smelling perfumed or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and really keeps you dry.</li>
            <li>I really miss the spray I used to buy that is no longer manufactured.</li>
            <li>Great product, was delivered on time, &amp; was not defective or broken upon delivery</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat that much</li>
            <li>Or else once applied to a stinky pit, your whole stick will be stinky pit scent.</li>
            <li>It definitely runs out a lot faster, but who doesn&#x27;t like fresh, lavendery fresh smelling pits?</li>
            <li>Spray-on natural deodorants will be fresh and clean until the last spray.</li>
            <li>They last a long time &amp; work great, especially if combined with a crystal stick.</li>
            <li>Remember to use it on clean skin in order for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an issue with large almost like zits in the armpit area, since i stopped using normal deodorant and switched to this</li>
            <li>I have tried over 10 natural deodorants and have yet to find one that is strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and isn&#x27;t strong or harshly offensive like other deodorants or perfumes can be.</li>
            <li>I purchased for a white tea scent which I didn&#x27;t smell, lavanda more likely.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and fades rather quickly, but that&#x27;s ok, as it still keeps me from smelling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All crystal products are high quality.</li>
            <li>This natural product works better than other deodorants and anti-antiperspirants</li>
            <li>I perspire heavily and this prevents it and doesn&#x27;t contain any cancer-causing aluminum (to date) which I love.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I live in GA and it&#x27;s already heating up.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong but it last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The Crystal Essence deodorants work pretty well, but do tend to wear off after a while, especially with exercise.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that it wouldnt be able to stop me from sweating in the middle of summer, so I enlisted family and friends to tell me if I needed something new.  </li>
            <li>So Soft that i used to use a while ago.</li>
            <li>Its natural and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Natural roll-on types are effective(Aubrey HI-C), but they get contaminated from re-using them in the arm pit.  </li>
            <li>But camomile  and jasmine are soft scents.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural too.  </li>
            <li>I will admit I was surprised this product affected me as I have used the pomegranate (spray) fragrance before with no issues.</li>
            <li>I could just put a few drops of essential oil into a bottle and add water to get an even better scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the solid stick which was good but not great.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate  is strong and hard to use if wearing perfume.</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t work for someone with really bad BO or who sweats alot, but for those who don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but not to white tea nor lavender, so thought this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We will only use natural SPRAY-ON deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the whole panoply of natural, non-aluminum deodorants, and this one is the winner, hands down!</li>
            <li>Ive been using strickly this for a few months now and its never failed on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of organic and natural deodorants the past year, but this one is the only one that has really gotten along with my skin.  </li>
            <li>So, if you have sensitive skin like I do, and have been having trouble with natural deodorants, this may be for you!</li>

            <li> I was a little concerned that it wouldnt be able to stop me from sweating in the middle of summer, so I enlisted family and friends to tell me if I needed something new.  </li>
            <li> So Soft that i used to use a while ago.</li>
            <li> Its natural and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Natural roll-on types are effective(Aubrey HI-C), but they get contaminated from re-using them in the arm pit.  </li>
            <li> But camomile  and jasmine are soft scents.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural too.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I was surprised this product affected me as I have used the pomegranate (spray) fragrance before with no issues.</li>
            <li> I could just put a few drops of essential oil into a bottle and add water to get an even better scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the solid stick which was good but not great.</li>
            <li> The pomegranate  is strong and hard to use if wearing perfume.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t work for someone with really bad BO or who sweats alot, but for those who don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but not to white tea nor lavender, so thought this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We will only use natural SPRAY-ON deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the whole panoply of natural, non-aluminum deodorants, and this one is the winner, hands down!</li>
            <li> Ive been using strickly this for a few months now and its never failed on me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of organic and natural deodorants the past year, but this one is the only one that has really gotten along with my skin.  </li>
            <li> So, if you have sensitive skin like I do, and have been having trouble with natural deodorants, this may be for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through hot hot long days with just one application and the stinkiness failed to penetrate the defense of the salt spray.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This will keep you dry and refreshed all day.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problem all summer long, not even at the beach!  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very fragrant, so my husband can wear it too without any concerns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to wet it and apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically water, with a small scent of something of which is a total mystery.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at first, but I needed a spray that I can use to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; during the day.  </li>
            <li> The other scents (and the unscented version) work too, but nothing comes close to the lavender.</li>
            <li> Super disappointing since it all seemed well and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stick can be a little rough.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not especially effective.  </li>
            <li> I also wash with tea tree oil soap to cut down on the chance of it failing</li>
            <li> I am really sad to say this stuff gave me welts under my arms and big red itchy patches of irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brand before without this reaction too, so something odd is going on with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have a very active job, and dislike feeling all sweaty and stinky.  </li>
            <li> Same goes with the roll-on but a little worse.</li>
            <li> It starts to wear off when I do heavy workouts at night</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> also calmed the irritation in my underarms from using Primal Pit paste (guess the baking soda was too harsh).</li>
            <li> The lavender/white tea in particular smells very bad mixed with body odor.  </li>
            <li> No more deodorant stains on my clothes either...</li>
            <li> Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same reaction to this product as Kristi R.  </li>
            <li> At least I think it does.....</li>
            <li> I noticed painful, red welts showing up under my arms.</li>
            <li> I might have to bite the bullet and go back to the aluminum monster :(</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave a disgusting, white, crusty residue or any type of residue, for that matter, on your clothing.</li>
            <li> Too bad, this will not qualify as a satisfactory replacement.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great but needs to be reapplied once or twice throughout the day to remain effective. Otherwise great product!! Easier than a salt rock.</li>
            <li> Crystal lavender/white tea deodorant is great and works really well. Love the smell and really keeps you dry. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product but everytime I get one the pump stops working before the product is gone. The tube in the bottle is too cheap....</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Works well I use it with the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Very nice light fresh floral smell.</li>
            <li> The Crystal Essence deodorants work pretty well, but do tend to wear off after a while, especially with exercise.  The lavender/white tea in particular smells very bad mixed with body odor.  The combination produces a musty smell.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction was that the scent was too \\&quot;mild\\&quot;.  But, I quickly learned that this is a plus, not a negative.  I apply it to areas that sweat other than the underarms (I use a crystal for my underarms), and it is awesome!  I have a very active job, and dislike feeling all sweaty and stinky.  This nicely tones things down, without smelling perfumed or overpowering.  It works best on clean skin, so I apply it right after my shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh, clean smell from it...as long as it&#x27;s not too hot outside this stuff is great. Unfortunately I live in GA and it&#x27;s already heating up. I might have to bite the bullet and go back to the aluminum monster :( Going to try using this in addition to the salt stick I have as well and see if that improves performance</li>
            <li> After using this , I will not go back to the traditional deoderant sticks . This kept my odor under control . It didn&#x27;t leave a residue. The sticks were always a hassle to wash off the skin. This had a fresh and light scent. Remember to use it on clean skin in order for it to work properly. I will spray it once after I shower at night . Then once again the morning .</li>
            <li> I am really sad to say this stuff gave me welts under my arms and big red itchy patches of irritation.  I have sensitive skin, but not to white tea nor lavender, so thought this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff must have something in it that is not hypoallergenic.  Super disappointing since it all seemed well and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brand before without this reaction too, so something odd is going on with this one.  The unscented seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my luck.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works all day. It starts to wear off when I do heavy workouts at night but I only smell sweaty and not musty.</li>
            <li> the best of the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; products I have found.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a non antiperspirant deodorant and this was suggested to me. it reminds me a lot of Skin So Soft that i used to use a while ago. the smell is nice and clean. i was able to take this 4 ounces with me in my carry on on an airplane. the pump nozzle still works. i do use it a handful of times throughout the day because i feel i need too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of organic and natural deodorants the past year, but this one is the only one that has really gotten along with my skin.  Others create rashes, or clog up my pores.  This does neither.  It&#x27;s nice and lightweight (the scent is also nice, not too overpowering)and yet keeps me dry.  So, if you have sensitive skin like I do, and have been having trouble with natural deodorants, this may be for you!</li>
            <li> good stuff. eco-friendly and effective.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the spray goes on everywhere opposed to the roll on which is amazing goes where you apply it. I have the unscented roll on which is great as well but wish I had the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of deodorant.  Its natural and no chemicals.  The spray is even easier to use so I definitely recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Received mine today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!&lt;br /&gt;So far so good (day1).....&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;Please allow the spray deodorant to dry before you put your clothes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After maybe a week from now (today is 04-7-15), I will post an update.</li>
            <li> We have used this Crystal Essence Spray shampoo for about a year now.  We will only use natural SPRAY-ON deodorants.  Natural roll-on types are effective(Aubrey HI-C), but they get contaminated from re-using them in the arm pit.  Even if you are entirely clean out of the shower, you are still applying it to your skin.  Spray-on natural deodorants will be fresh and clean until the last spray. This will keep you dry and refreshed all day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the reviews I&#x27;m seeing. This is not a body spray. It&#x27;s basically water, with a small scent of something of which is a total mystery. My daughter is a lavender freak. I told her to close her eyes and I&#x27;d spray it on her and I wanted her to tell me what it smelled like. Her answer? Water. Yep, it smells more like water than it does like any scent at all. I could just put a few drops of essential oil into a bottle and add water to get an even better scent. No. I&#x27;m not kidding. Believe me, I wish I were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed. I will never buy this again. I really miss the spray I used to buy that is no longer manufactured. I can&#x27;t think of the name of it right now, but it had a fresh lavender scent that was light and airy. Too bad, this will not qualify as a satisfactory replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of lavender scents, but this deodorant smells very pleasant and lasts me the entire day. what I love about the crystal sprays is that you don&#x27;t feel residue on your underarms all day, it feels like nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love my Crystal stick roll on and saw it in the recommended products.  It has a nice light fragrance and works okay, but I don&#x27;t find it nearly as effective as the plain roll-on Crystal kind that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  It&#x27;s nice to use to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; before going out, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again when this container runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for all the areas of your body (not your under arms) that sweat or smell. It is not going to stop you from sweating. It is not an antiperspirant. But it is a great deoderant if you put it on right after getting out of the shower. It works better the longer you use it. Lasts a long time. One bottle lasts me months and I use it everyday. Highly recommend it. Have been using it now for 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> Love the spray as it is easy on your skin. Stick can be a little rough. The spray is easy to use everywhere. The pomegranate  is strong and hard to use if wearing perfume. But camomile  and jasmine are soft scents. Deodorant  never quite did the job but this works so well I never worry ever about oder. Love this.  I sray this on my feet and in my shoes also</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old. She loves it. It was time for a deodorant but I don&#x27;t like the idea of her using a traditional one. It works well for her. For me, its not an option. I have tried over 10 natural deodorants and have yet to find one that is strong enough for me. But I wouldn&#x27;t really consider that good information because even many traditional deodorants aren&#x27;t strong enough for me. This product has a nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> These crystal sprays are the best product I have found for natural Deoderant &amp; I have tried a ton! They last a long time &amp; work great, especially if combined with a crystal stick.</li>
            <li> It works best of the &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; I have tried. I am allergic to all the aluminum compounds, so this is great. I alternate it with Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals, which is also very good but can irritate my skin if I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li> is very good, I recommend having a delicate and fresh scent, in addition to use for the body, I apply it to clothes and into bed</li>
            <li> I use this as a replacement for normal deodorant, and i love it. I&#x27;ve had an issue with large almost like zits in the armpit area, since i stopped using normal deodorant and switched to this I&#x27;ve had no further issues.</li>
            <li> A nice light scent while helping to prevent body odor. I use this on days when I won&#x27;t have time to shower till later in the day. Keeps me smelling nice and fresh. At least I think it does.....</li>
            <li> Will try oil next. Not worth buying. it feels like water up under your arms and you still get my musky. for the most part you don&#x27;t but sometimes you do.</li>
            <li> My most favorite deoddorants scent.  Ive been using strickly this for a few months now and its never failed on me.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I also wash with tea tree oil soap to cut down on the chance of it failing</li>
            <li> Great product, was delivered on time, &amp; was not defective or broken upon delivery</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  The scent is not too strong but it last for a long time.  I don&#x27;t sweat that much I can&#x27;t how it works for everyone but it works perfectly for me.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural too.  I&#x27;m about to throw away all my left over Axes now.</li>
            <li> Ooops, I should have paid attention to the White Tea part of the product. I thought it was just Lavender. The scent is ok. This definitely keeps odors at bay and even works like a healthy antiperspirant!</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at first, but I needed a spray that I can use to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; during the day.  Very nice item! I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> This natural product works better than other deodorants and anti-antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried.  The fragrance is also light and pleasing.  Well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Awesome! No more deodorant stains on my clothes either...</li>
            <li> Not especially effective.  Spray&#x27;s scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the spray nozzle gets clogged but rinsing in hot water usually fixes it. It&#x27;s usually necessary to do it several times.</li>
            <li> I have tried a multitude of deodorants over the years and this is the only one I have tried that ACTUALLY works! It also doesn&#x27;t leave a disgusting, white, crusty residue or any type of residue, for that matter, on your clothing. It smells really nice and isn&#x27;t strong or harshly offensive like other deodorants or perfumes can be. I have gotten several compliments from people telling me that I smell good after I used this. It has a natural-esque fragrance. I perspire heavily and this prevents it and doesn&#x27;t contain any cancer-causing aluminum (to date) which I love. I do have to apply it 2 - 3 times throughout the day, especially on hot days, but if you are a light perspirer you will probably only need to apply it once. I am so sad they stopped selling this in my area, it&#x27;s literally the best deodorant ever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either: Ammonium Alum, also known as ammonium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate or Potassium Alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate. Both potassium and ammonium alum have the same potential toxicity as Aluminum Chlorohydrate there for its an Aluminum salt just like aluminum chlorohydrate. Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
            <li> Love this product- use it daily</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  Works well &amp; is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> All natural, smells good, &amp; lasts a really, really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the whole panoply of natural, non-aluminum deodorants, and this one is the winner, hands down! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and am quite happy. The other scents (and the unscented version) work too, but nothing comes close to the lavender. And it&#x27;s not very fragrant, so my husband can wear it too without any concerns.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a white tea scent which I didn&#x27;t smell, lavanda more likely.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that it wouldnt be able to stop me from sweating in the middle of summer, so I enlisted family and friends to tell me if I needed something new.  Absolutely no problem all summer long, not even at the beach!  This is very effective and all natural.  Definitely try it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve used the solid stick which was good but not great. I&#x27;d have to wet it and apply. And again. And again. And oh! I&#x27;d have to make sure when applying; they&#x27;d have to be clean. Or else once applied to a stinky pit, your whole stick will be stinky pit scent. Same goes with the roll-on but a little worse. Your stinky pit, if applied to your stinky pit will stay on the roller-ball and pass through the rest of the liquid. I still use it and it is still effective, but it definitely retained some of the stinky pit scent. But the spray... ooohhh, it&#x27;s the best! Before you start to feel stinky, just spray it on there contamination-care-free. It definitely runs out a lot faster, but who doesn&#x27;t like fresh, lavendery fresh smelling pits? I&#x27;ve been through hot hot long days with just one application and the stinkiness failed to penetrate the defense of the salt spray. And I&#x27;ve got some stinky pits without these. Mhmm.</li>
            <li> It works quite well. It is kind of drippy at first, but does dry with no residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same reaction to this product as Kristi R.  Initially, I had no problems, but about 1/3 into the bottle I noticed painful, red welts showing up under my arms. I actually made a trip to the doctor, but she was unsure of of the problem and suggested it might be yeast. I was instructed to use no deodorant and no shaving, and I was given a topical cream to apply. Once my symptoms disappeared, I was FINALLY able to go back to my deodorant. So, I went back to using this spray, and within a week I had problems again. Stopped using this deodorant about a month ago, and I have had NO irritation since. I will admit I was surprised this product affected me as I have used the pomegranate (spray) fragrance before with no issues.</li>
            <li> works great! also calmed the irritation in my underarms from using Primal Pit paste (guess the baking soda was too harsh).</li>
            <li> love the lavender scent. Liked the free shipping. All crystal products are high quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it arrived in a roll-on rather than a spray.  I was expecting a spray (like in the picture / description), rather than a roll-on.  It works, but - why not \\&quot;Spray\\&quot; as described in the description?  I&#x27;ve used the spray before, and found it was easy to use.  The roll-on I got works OK, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. The scent is subtle and fades rather quickly, but that&#x27;s ok, as it still keeps me from smelling. It doesn&#x27;t stop sweat, but I don&#x27;t sweat a whole lot anyway, so that&#x27;s fine. This wouldn&#x27;t work for someone with really bad BO or who sweats alot, but for those who don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s great.</li>
