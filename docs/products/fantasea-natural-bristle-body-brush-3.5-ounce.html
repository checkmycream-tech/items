            <li>It has good strong bristles.  </li>
            <li>not so it is very good and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;frankenseitz</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really sensitive and this is perfect!</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s done great!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent quality, natural bristled brush for this pricepoint.  </li>

            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Feels great and exfoliated really well!</li>
            <li>This is a good brush with nice soft bristles and a good grip.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even commented that my skin looked and felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this to scrub my scalp and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also, it fits nicely into my hands and I have arthritis in both hands and can still use this easily.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so easily manipulated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and effective, but it doesn&#x27;t scratch up your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to hold and is perfect for use in the shower--not too soft and not too abrasive.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t lost many bristles, time will tell how it holds up, but for the money it seems a very good brush.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the handle too, makes it easier to hold onto when you&#x27;re washing.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>Great items - fast shipping</li>
            <li>So I do love this product, but I have to admit it hurts a bit to do it.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and more even.</li>
            <li>B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32 Ounce Bottle]] and this stuff</li>
            <li>The strap secures my hand in place and gives me better control of the brush.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I bought it to help deal with ingrown hair after epilating, and I&#x27;m sure it will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I use body scrub on my feet daily and this brush is perfect for applying, whether I&#x27;m in the shower or bath!</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this body brush more than the one I already had (the one w/</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>i dont have this problem any more.</li>
            <li>The size, texture of the bristles and the design is more than you can ask for.  </li>
            <li>I may just buy more fir Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect firmness for your entire body.</li>
            <li>I like this brush as it does allow me to get a good grip and the bristles aren&#x27;t so soft or spaced out that I can&#x27;t get a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about six months, using it most days.</li>
            <li>Good product and fun to use.</li>
            <li>I love the size and the feel.</li>
            <li>And it makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>I love that it straps on your hand</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more for exfoliating you...</li>
            <li>dont love it.</li>
            <li>Used daily and is the best body brush that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is making a difference for me and it is enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>I have bought more than one of these, 2 for me (1 for each bathroom), and more for gifts, all well received.  </li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>Initially bought this as an exfoliating brush to use while in the shower, and it worked wonderfully for that.</li>
            <li>Even after a day or two of not shaving, my legs still feel better.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>the fantasea brush more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think I prefer the fantasea as it does the job of exfoliating and is more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better by then.</li>
            <li>But it leaves fibers all over your body which then continue to itch you and make you paranoid of finding more fibers on yourself.</li>

            <li>Perfect for dry skin brushing to exfoliate and tone.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great for exfoliation and makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for dry brushing!</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and takes soap very  nicely.</li>
            <li>Actually feels very good and does help exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>experienced brushers might find this suitable, but it actually left me with visible scratches, so I had to say goodbye*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits on my hand, is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But mine adjusted to this very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, as well.</li>
            <li>The handle is well attached and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and holds up, but the grip for me is not as easy with the band over my hand...</li>
            <li>Easy to soap up and rinse off.  </li>
            <li>The canvas handle helps it stay on your hand easily and also helps to hang it on a hook inside my bathroom cabinet for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size, fitting well in the palm of your hand, and the strap makes it very convenient to use.</li>

            <li>and they smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I got this brush, thinking that it would do just as fine without a handle and steep price tag, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine brush for the body.</li>
            <li>Just needs an elastic hand strap to make it more comfortable to hold (it&#x27;s just woven fabric that won&#x27;t hold small hands) but bristles are perfect.</li>
            <li>This product is great makes skin super soft and removes cellular.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I used it after it was dry and LOVED it!</li>
            <li>Description was accurate.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t lost enough weight to know if the method works, I do know that this brush is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>skin brushing is not only great because it&#x27;s exfoliating, but also it&#x27;s invigorating.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The price was cheap</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d hoped for, but it still works well and gets skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is this cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>One step up would be the Kingsley Sisal Body Brush ($7.99 Amazon.com for Prime members free shipping).  </li>
            <li>In the morning when I shave my legs are so smooth.</li>
            <li>Its just an EXTREMELY cheap exfoliator brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>Strap Fits Comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Really cheaply manufactured.  </li>
            <li>but  I still enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfect for more sensitive areas like my midsection and upper arms.</li>
            <li>It is also a comfortable size to hold.</li>
            <li>Feels fantastic on the skin.</li>
            <li>Just a comfortable brush that feels invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I like the feel of the bristles, and the brush is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my dogs because I had heard that a natural bristle brush was good for a dog&#x27;s coat.</li>
            <li>Loved the \\&quot;hand-held\\&quot; design and the natural bristles - that&#x27;s why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Good, natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li>wish it were more secure in my hand; the strape is too lose, but other than that, i&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>On top of that, the price was right.</li>
            <li>this is perfect for dry brushing, like the strap, and the bristles are the perfect texture (not too hard, not to soft to be effective)</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to handle just the right bristle strength.</li>
            <li>Not painful and brush is perfect firmness, not too firm.</li>
            <li>makes it super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Absolute best dry brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Good bristles for dry brushing and easier to use than many brushes .</li>
            <li>I love glowy skin, so we&#x27;ll see how much this helps!</li>
            <li>The elemis also seems to be of better quality, as the fantasea lost its bristles on the first day, whereas the elemis stayed intact.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my sister…</li>
            <li>I LOVE it so much!  </li>
            <li>Works great for dry brushing</li>
            <li>But overall I am thrilled with the brush, doing a much better job than my clairsonic is at this point.</li>
            <li>Great for dry brushing the skin</li>
            <li>Great for dry brushing for lymphatic stimulation.  </li>
            <li>This is a great body brush and can be used for dry brushing or just to wash your body with.</li>
            <li>Works great as a dry skin brush for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry brushing or for use in the shower with shower gel.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>so I can clean it.</li>
            <li>I came out of my shower squaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It comes with suggestions as to how to clean the brush and when you should replace it, but I will buy another one whenever I feel like it isn&#x27;t working anymore, which may or may not be when they recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great for Dry Brushing</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the product considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice body brush, good for exfoliating, not too harsh on your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this one and intend to keep it in my travel bag to be able to dry brush when traveling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Very good to clean dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, like any brush you can buy in any store.</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is great and the brush works as expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for dry-brushing a couple times, and I find it to be a good stimulating firmness without being too abrasive, but I can also use a Salux pretty much all over and not have any issues, so I may have a higher tolerance/thicker skin than some.</li>
            <li>Also the packaging that the brush came in was open, so it could&#x27;ve been a used one, but good thing I&#x27;m using it for my hedgehogs.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t expect that&#x27;d be much of a problem for most folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>and it really aids in a better application of the tanner.</li>
            <li>I can control the level of exfoliation easily by simply adding or removing pressure and the handle allows for a good grip.  </li>
            <li>But good brush overall.</li>
            <li>&quot; - so true.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my scalp (I&#x27;m not bald, so it works through short hair) to knock off flakes, which makes my head feel good after brushing.</li>
            <li>The brush is not bad.</li>
            <li>, it does have a strong odor at first, but after 2-3 washes, the odor is gone.</li>
            <li>I recommend running it under warm water and rubbing the fibers back and forth with your hand and washing it with a body soap, then rub the bristles back and forth some more under the warm water to wash the soap out.</li>
            <li>and this is a great addition to my other brushes.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s very maneuverable and easy to use, clean, etc.</li>
            <li>This brush works great, really softens the skin, as for helping with cellulite couldn&#x27;t tell you, I have only used it a week.</li>
            <li>im sure that if i was using this daily i would have better results.</li>
            <li>This brush sheds bristles quickly.</li>
            <li>I received this brush fairly quickly in the mail and it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>that helps the water from ruining the brush as quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for several months now and have been very happy to see that the bristles have held together and it hasn&#x27;t gotten gross or moldy being stored in the shower.</li>
            <li>The brush arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted, as I wanted to do some light brushing of my legs and arms in the shower, without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit soft, but suitable for my needs.  </li>
            <li>i have purchased so many brushes and most of them fall flat ( literally) ...</li>
            <li>Being new to dry brushing, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a brush and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Good for dry body brushing.  </li>
            <li>Having heard that dry brushing is good for the lymphatic system, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Good quality brush, I use it for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>good brush to get started with a dry brushing routine.</li>
            <li>It was only good for the first week.</li>
            <li>If you want to try dry brushing this is a good way to start.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use this for skin brushing and it&#x27;s exactly the bristles I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I really love all the natural bristles on this brush!  </li>
            <li>I use this to dry brush before/after epilating, It&#x27;s really been helping a great deal with the ingrown hairs I was getting from epilating, I don&#x27;t notice any bristles falling out</li>
            <li>And my skin is super soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>though it does shed, as others have observed, I think this is a great little bod brush for the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect - not too soft are too harsh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need another one, but since it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone that is on a detox cleanse or anyone that has a lot of dead skin after the winter.</li>
            <li>Would recommend if you need to use in the shower to give a cleaner and healthier skin glow to make your body feel fresh.</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s made of natural fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I love this product  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care, but now I&#x27;ve found that it actually would be kind of nice to have a longer handle on it to reach my back.</li>
            <li>That could be a good thing for some, but not me, its too rough to use on my body, so I use it as a foot brush instead.</li>
            <li>so the only way to use it is by having a nice grip on the brush</li>
            <li>I do far more damage by scratching an itchy spot with my fingers.</li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m rather pleased...</li>
            <li>It works well for getting it to lay nice and neatly, with all the hairs going the same direction.</li>
            <li>It is a nice brush and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change in my legs appearance after using it, but it definitely gets the blood flowing and feels really good.</li>
            <li>This product is worth what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to see how often I use it, to see if it will be worth replacing.  </li>
            <li>So far, this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Only thing that could be better is an adjustable strap, but overall it works great and is high quality.</li>
            <li>Still works, but I have to make extra sure to clean the cracks.</li>
            <li>it is easy to slip over your hand and dry brush your skin for a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This brush has just the right bristles to invigorate your skin without causing a rash.</li>
            <li>It is just right.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just right to leave my skin fully invigorated and not sore.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>even my husband noticed right away.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>just right for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think the bristles are just right.  </li>
            <li>the handle that kind of looks like a toilet bowl cleaner also sold on Amazon)</li>
            <li>Does a good job of scrubbing my less sensitive skin (legs and arms mostly).  </li>
            <li>The wood is smooth and highly polished.</li>
            <li>High quality and fit&#x27;s my hand well.</li>
            <li>Just wish the strap was available in a more feminine fit and it rinsed out a little easier.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft enough to enjoy the task of exfoliation</li>
            <li>You will feel envigorated and refreshed and should notice great improvement in your skin&#x27;s tone and texture in just a few days!</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect, not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not too hard but are still strong and do an excellent job of dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>I feel fortunate to have found a new supplier.</li>
            <li>bristles aren&#x27;t too soft, nor too strong.</li>
            <li>There are a few different methods I have found, so see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>Its very handy like literally, if your a female it fits from the tip of your middle finger to the end of the palm of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not too rough and not too soft, feels very nice.</li>
            <li>Going into it with this expectation alone, I was highly surprised and pleased with how many benefits I achieve from dry brushing.</li>
            <li>The bristle are not the softest,kinda scratch a little, but gets into pores good.</li>
            <li>Has held up very well and would purchase again when needed!</li>
            <li>First thing, the brush is most definitely SYNTHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Yeah you&#x27;ll pay more, but it&#x27;ll last longer and not shred your skin.</li>
            <li>I put a bit of soap on the brush and then rub my face with it, the brush is definitely taking off the top layers of skin</li>
            <li>I will however say that it is a natural bristle brush (which is important to me)</li>
            <li>but then i found out it was because i was using hot water, and ever since i dont use it so hot</li>
            <li>But still, I love it, especially for the price/quality ratio.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap though a couple of bucks, it&#x27;s not worth much more.</li>
            <li>First time I have used a body brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The hair of the brush feels like plastic, nothing like the first 2 I had.</li>
            <li>I first heard about body brushing on the Bethany tv show.</li>
            <li>First time skin brusher.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of rough</li>
            <li>and my skin has become soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, i noticed bristles shedding, but i didnt think anything of it.</li>
            <li>and it really intensify the results!</li>
            <li>I actually like this one better as its easier to control and move around on my body.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li>It does smell funny when you first take it out</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>You want to keep your skin soft, looking youthful and cellulite free?</li>
            <li>Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I had gotten one sooner ;-)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>My first skin brush.</li>
            <li>A more pricey one is not necessary.</li>
            <li>I only bought 2, but wish I had purchased more.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for----at</li>
            <li>Good size and the bristles are firm but not too scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, firm bristles, convenient handle strap for ease of use.  </li>
            <li>The cloth/fiber strap prevents slippage and the shape is comfortable for my hand - two problems with my previous favorite from Body Shop.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use for dry brushing in my massage business.</li>
            <li>Love this natural body brush to use during shower time to exfoliate my skin, after drying off and applying lotion my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush, not too stiff.</li>
            <li>Not too stiff but perfect for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li>I feel like it slides around more that way with my hand flat against it, so</li>
            <li>Since using this brush combined with Dr. Bronners soap, my skin has never felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Does not seem natural and had scratches on it, they were nice enough to refund my money</li>
            <li>Bristles are just firm enough, and product size is ideal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and it has a handy little loop to hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>when this brush arrived, it&#x27;s a nice wooden brush with a strong canvas-type material handle, and the bristles are soft enough to use on your face!  </li>
            <li>Some discoloration on the wood handle from continuous use, but overall the brush has lasted a long time with minimal bristle loss (much much longer than a popular brand easily found at most stores).</li>
            <li>It really does work if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li>It works great for exfoliating and is gentler than other brushes which are rather coarse.</li>
            <li>After the first use a whole tuft came out.</li>
            <li>I love using these body brushes, they are just the right size to fit in my hand and they&#x27;re not so hard that it hurts to use.</li>
            <li>The bristles are still nice and stiff, and firmly attached to the brush, so it seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft, providing great exfoliation without too much irritation.</li>
            <li>It is gross, but the results after of my smooth soft skin are so worth it!</li>
            <li>Love the way this feels when I dry brush my skin before the shower</li>
            <li>I had heard about dry bushing one&#x27;s skin to promote healthy blood flow and reduce cellulite, well I&#x27;ve found that to be true!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really do love using this dry brush.  </li>
            <li>The strap on the back makes it easy to hook my hand into it and not drop it while I&#x27;m brushing.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin (I&#x27;m prone to eczema breakouts every so often) which is a plus.</li>
            <li>had never used a dry skin brush before, but I am in love.</li>
            <li>Love to use this brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>It had an extremely strong toxic scent, its bristles starting falling out as soon as I removed it from its packaging.</li>
            <li>The cloth band is a bit large over my hand, but I don&#x27;t always use it.</li>
            <li>I massage my body with upward, large, circular movements.</li>
            <li>This is when you use the brush in a certain direction, depending on what body part you are using it on, to help with circulation and exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>it will just limit it to certain spots.</li>
            <li>Was put off by the size at first ( smaller than my other dry brush) but turns out it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most high quality brush in the world, but I use it to dry brush my legs before a shower and it works very well!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get your back, but that is fine if you just want something to scrub your arms and legs while  in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adjust the pressure to your personal liking, it takes all the dead skin off and lets lotion soak in nice and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small oval shape makes it easy to grip and the bristles seem to be strongly stuck in place.</li>
            <li>Its a good brush, if you like really hard brush</li>
            <li>The very first time using the product, an entire cluster of bristles came right out.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very concerned about it being too abrasive, this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li>price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Do not use much pressure.  </li>
            <li>the brush itself is very well-made.</li>
            <li>so I am being more careful to put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But I find that I am using 3 times as much soap with this brush because it just doesn&#x27;t hold it.  </li>
            <li>You can use it anywhere on your body, but it does the job and really cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>I think this might be better for in shower use when wet in place of a loofah/wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>The bristles really get the blood flowing and perk me up.</li>
            <li>It really works well as a skin brush.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Really works great, do it everyday, follow up with Nivea body firming lotion, you will see a different texture in your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels MUCH softer post shower</li>
            <li>so I use it gently maybe once a week.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems with losing bristles or the strap coming off as some others have reported - perhaps because I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer my Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush, it is much softer and does not cause itching.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>OK, so I decided to hop on this body brushing trend, and bought this baby even though the reviews were a clutter of confusingness (too rough?</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see how body brushing will improve my life in any material way, and I&#x27;m materialistic,</li>
            <li>I got this product by mistake, so I don&#x27;t have much to review about it.</li>
            <li>Wanting to remove much of it</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me fast though</li>
            <li>which I appreciated</li>
            <li>Really helps minimize the cellulite on the legs.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Most likely will order a few more.</li>
            <li>Love the brush, though it does shed a tiny bit, but all natural brushes shed.</li>
            <li>Nice firm bristles.</li>
            <li>Helps increase circulation and remove dead skin for a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Love that the bristles are natural and that the handle is made of solid wood.  </li>
            <li>More likely it&#x27;s for your pet alligator or to remove old paint from furniture.</li>
            <li>you order this make sure you receive an natural bristle hair brush, otherwise send it back.</li>
            <li>LOVE to dry brush!!  </li>
            <li>The elemis is also stiffer, which may mean it makes a better exfoliation tool, but I find that I enjoy the feel of</li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush for trying out dry-brushing skin, so this review doesn&#x27;t cover how good the brush is if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are nice, soft enough to not hurt the skin too much, but stiff enough that you feel you&#x27;re actually exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li>so my hand will slip right out , as well as sometimes they feel like they&#x27;re too soft</li>
            <li>you feel really like extra clean on your skin with this body brush.</li>
            <li>This body brush makes me feel so clean after a long day in a hot shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality brush, no ruffles or frills except possibly the little hand strap on the back, which I actually have found is kind of a pain to try to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i REALLY prefer the stiffer ones of my older brush then again</li>
            <li>In the beginning it felt nice but that didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft enough to not irritate but firm enough to do the job,  and the perfect size.</li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend it to other.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are great for dry exfoliating but no so harsh that they irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>It has strong bristles but doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive skin red.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry brushing which I am now totally addicted to doing before bed.</li>
            <li>This brush is good to use both dry and wet.</li>
            <li>This product did have a strange smell when first opened, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>It is probably fine for dry brushing, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the shower.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the company would clearly state what material the bristles are made of, but I assume that if they were boar bristles, the cost would be significantly higher.</li>
            <li>A little more abrasive that I prefer, but great for dry brushing none the less!</li>
            <li>Use this on dry skin before you get in the shower, and your skin will feel so smooth after.</li>
            <li>and it is still holding steady.</li>
            <li>I bought it for skin brushing, to remove dead skin cells for fresh smooth skin.</li>
            <li>There is a large-loose handle that only a giant could appropriately use to brush their body.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is decent and well-made.  </li>
            <li>inexpensive but decent quality.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it before my Finulite cream to get rid of any dirt.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve had many wooden brushes not hold well in the past, but the awesome reviews got me to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ones remaining are nice to use, but I am afraid to use it as directed that more bristles will just keep falling out.</li>
            <li>They are a fairly decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It works great, but quite a few of the bristles came out on the first few uses, so I would stand in the shower to catch the bristles</li>
            <li>The handle works so far for me, it hasn&#x27;t stretched out and makes it easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my body because I have sensitive skin and this brush is too harsh but for hard areas like feet is perfect.</li>
            <li>With most brushes the bristles are too stiff for my skin but after using this a few times it&#x27;s very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Ladies, order from another seller on Amazon.com or purchase a real natural bristle brush from Bath &amp; Body Works or Bed Bath</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and am looking for a much softer bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I would recommend it is a great hand brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles give a vigorous exfoliation without tearing up my skin, but this could maybe be a bit much for someone with really sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like this brush so far.</li>
            <li>I cant gather the courage to use it for more than few seconds, which is why I gave it 3</li>
            <li>will buy a few more</li>
            <li>and I noticed way more dead skin flakes in my bed after waking up.</li>
            <li>If your brush is still too harsh, you might want to wash it a couple more times under warm/hot water.</li>
            <li>but i think that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I use a normal loofah for exfoliation</li>
            <li>The wood hasn&#x27;t cracked in any way, shape or form, and the strong canvas cloth handle is still as firmly attached and functional as it was straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>It is the right level of stiffness for me, and I would definitely recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Maybe with more frequent use, it might soften up a little.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a new skin brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to start a new skin regimen for not my face.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m new to brushing</li>
            <li>This body brush does exactly what I expected and has held up fantastically after much use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s thinner and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>Brushing the skin seems to have far more benefits than just sloughing off dead skins cells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the craftsmanship is great, there&#x27;s a rubbery base between the bristles and the wood that protects the bristles and blocks out water to keep the wood damage- free.</li>
            <li>I use it for cellulite and although I don&#x27;t know if it works, it is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried many bath brushes and they are either too stiff or too soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, but hard enough to brush off dead skin, which makes it perfect as a body brush.</li>
            <li>Affordable and natural bristles, would order again for gifts!</li>
            <li>: Just bought a second one for my hubby, since he loves it so much too!</li>
            <li>Soft but exfoliates!</li>
            <li>my husband glides this brush over my back -is very relaxing and soothing and also eases itchiness!  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact when they see me get the brush they will come and compete over who get brushed first.</li>
            <li>Starts out a little stiff, but with time and use the bristles soften making a more comfortable exfoliation / and improved circulation treatment.</li>
            <li>At first the bristles felt stiff, but my body quickly became acclimated to this brush.</li>
            <li>brushes come as brush heads with a wooden backing and strap for an easy grip, but the elemis comes with a detachable handle, which would be useful for brushing the back and other hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The benefits of dry brushing or skin brushing seem great reading on it, but not sure if it&#x27;s ACTUALLY doing anything.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd brush I order (my dog ate the first 2), the first 2 seemed natural, now the 3rd one not at all.</li>
            <li>Normally my dogs don&#x27;t really like being brushed</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I&#x27;m wanting extra smooth legs, I&#x27;ll dry brush</li>
            <li>Love the hardness to it, I use it for dry and wet brushing and my skin has never been softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super soft, but definitely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I only spend about a minute before I shower quickly brushing over my arms, legs and back</li>
            <li>I use this dry brush before I shower and use coconut oil to moisturize right after.</li>
            <li>The bristles have just the right degree of stiffness to remove dry skin without being too scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Now I just have to be more religious about actually doing the dry brushing thing.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to skin brushing, and I bought this as my first ‘dry’ brush.</li>
            <li>It does shed a little but it was for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little harsher but most reviews say the opposite</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect firmness, hard enough to be a bit scratchy but not so hard that it feels like you&#x27;re scraping off your flesh.</li>
            <li>This is clearly a straight-from-a-warehouse in China purchase.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but sturdy enough to really stimulate the skin.</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s quite soft.  </li>
            <li>Not as soft as I would like..</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t slough off too much skin, but just enough to help get softer skin.</li>
            <li>my last brush lasted about a year, i really thought the wood would give out, but it was the plastic that cracked and released the hairs.</li>
            <li>but personally I dont like it for this reason as it really hurts when trying to use it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Over time the bristles become a bit softer from what another review said for extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Fantasea Natural Bristle Body Brush, 3.5 Ounce.  </li>
            <li>The body brush is soft but some of the brissels come out.</li>
            <li>Or my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This brush leaves my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even said that he has never felt skin this soft.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are undoubtedly 100% plastic, there is NOTHING natural about this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is already soft even before using this brush so I don&#x27;t know if it is making it softer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>These natural bristle body brushes can go for up to $40 in a spa.</li>
            <li>I wish it was sold by Amazon directly.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and looks healthier, especially now during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Coarse, but not too much so.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>too soft?</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles fell out (and continue to shed) but the brush is soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>Too soft for skin brushing.</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower, and while the bristles are good (sturdy, but not scratchy), the hand strap (instead of a handle) make it difficult to use all over the body.</li>
            <li>otherwise it works well enough, the strap makes it possible to hold, and it makes a nice lather, its not too stiff, but they fall apart after some time.</li>
            <li>It actually isn&#x27;t any thing more than a extremely stiff hair brush.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try dry skin brushing, but with pretty sensitive skin, was worried it would cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in buying a dry brush.</li>
            <li>I received a brush that out of each little spout (assuming a body brush has a grid of about 200-300 spouts), each spout was full of snythetic like your toothbrush acrylic plastic bristles containing one natural bristle</li>
            <li>Overall thought a decent product.</li>
            <li>B00898EIAS Brush Deluxe Circular Handle 100% Boar Bristle Body Brush, Firm Bass Brushes 1]].</li>
            <li>This brush is a little too soft for someone who has been brushing regularly, but would be fine to start with.  </li>
            <li>Simple product - Item was as expected and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This natural bristle body brush is great at getting the dead skin off those tough areas.</li>
            <li>When I first got this it looked like it would be rough on the skin,</li>
            <li>But after the second and third, the bristles were coming out in LARGE quantities.</li>
            <li>I used to have something similar but on a large wooden handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too stiff and rough on my chest and stomach would like it a lot better if not so rough on my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering again in the future when I need a new one</li>
            <li>Makes dry brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li>It works very well for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush; I use it for dry brushing in the morning.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well for dry exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even using less lotion, which is rare for me this time of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>About to buy another one, because I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;ve had my first one for just too long.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s honestly too inexpensive to bother with shipping it back - completely annoyed,</li>
            <li>Upon first use, the bristles did fall out as other users had mentions.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in dry body brushing.</li>
            <li>and I can press harder on certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing a different, similar product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this small and simple brush.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is built well -- doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall apart, and it&#x27;s made with natural materials (save for the white plastic part</li>
            <li>This product is not firm enough for me.  </li>
            <li>The brush wasn&#x27;t too rough, and worked really well.</li>
            <li>I use this for dry body brushing to help drain my lymphatic system, but mainly to get rid of some stretch marks, i havent been using the brush every day like i am supposed to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for a while now, bought it as a replacement for a similar one I found at TJ Maxx that got old.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, and used with firming lotion, definitely helps in that area</li>
            <li>have no regrets about purchasing this brush, and I hope this seller continues to stock this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A crack has developed in the wooden body.</li>
            <li>I barely press on my skin though because I am not trying to tear my skin</li>
            <li>I have since purchased a different brush with firmer bristles; I would recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The one minor issue was a bit of plastic base chipped off when I dropped it, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li>It helps a little if I take a shower right after using the brush, then applying lotion.</li>
            <li>Dont waste your money, buy something a little more expensive for the better quality!</li>
            <li>Bristles do not fall out and the brush is super firm, but not enough to hurt your skin</li>
            <li>Its not super pretty or fancy......</li>
            <li>Four stars because it seems less durable (bristles came out the first time brushing).</li>
            <li>If you suffer from eczema, I highly recommend dry brushing!</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying out dry brushing for yourself!</li>
            <li>is holding up very well - bristles are not falling out like on other brands i have used.  </li>
            <li>It is much softer than other ones she bought.</li>
            <li>but the fabric loop that you slip your hand through is much too wide for smaller hands.</li>
            <li>I would prefer the bristles to be a little more stiff, but it is doing its job.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (Large)]] or Bass</li>
            <li>Not too hard, not too soft - just right.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to use on my little ones with a gentle touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item arrived well packaged in a USPS First Class Mail bubbled envelope, inside it was in a medium-thick plastic bag (lots of waste already).</li>
            <li>arrived with one of the sides of the strap halfway removed from the bottom of the bristles &amp; quite a few of the bristles fell off at the first use.</li>
            <li>I use my natural bristle brush for dry exfoliation before getting in the shower, it was a little scratchy the first 2 times I used it</li>
            <li>The fantasea seems to be hard enough to brush off dead skin cells (and I could see the white dust coming off and feel my skin becoming smoother), but soft enough to feel enjoyable and more like a massage than a desperate attempt to scratch off dead skin cells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might wear down faster than the elemis and it comes without a handle, but I think the much cheaper price makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are hard enough to exfoliate but not too harsh for more sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>It can feel a little abrasive at first, but I only use it on my legs and elbows.</li>
            <li>The brush is stiff when you first get it out of the package.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of dry natural bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles were too soft for dry skin brushing.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get in on the dry brushing craze, and so far it lives up to it&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a natural bristle, which is what you want in a dry brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m getting all the wild results that some people claim with dry brushing-</li>
            <li>Using this for dry brushing and my skin is SO soft now.</li>
            <li>The handle is a little large for my hand, but I can still use the brush with ease.</li>
            <li>not to hard or soft and works well for dry brushing and wet brushing, just be sure to hang somewhere to dry after</li>
            <li>Unless I am gripping the wood edges tight, this makes it hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li>This brush feels soft but is sturdy enough to hold up to several minutes of dry brushing.</li>
            <li>This is a technique where you vigorously brush your skin BEFORE getting into the shower, in large, firm, circular strokes.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and very coarse hair due to an endocrine disorder..</li>

            <li> I kind of wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so easily manipulated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and effective, but it doesn&#x27;t scratch up your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to hold and is perfect for use in the shower--not too soft and not too abrasive.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t lost many bristles, time will tell how it holds up, but for the money it seems a very good brush.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the handle too, makes it easier to hold onto when you&#x27;re washing.  </li>
            <li> I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> Love it  </li>
            <li> Great items - fast shipping</li>
            <li> So I do love this product, but I have to admit it hurts a bit to do it.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and more even.</li>

            <li> The strap secures my hand in place and gives me better control of the brush.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help deal with ingrown hair after epilating, and I&#x27;m sure it will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I use body scrub on my feet daily and this brush is perfect for applying, whether I&#x27;m in the shower or bath!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this body brush more than the one I already had (the one w/</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> i dont have this problem any more.</li>
            <li> The size, texture of the bristles and the design is more than you can ask for.  </li>
            <li> I may just buy more fir Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect firmness for your entire body.</li>
            <li> I like this brush as it does allow me to get a good grip and the bristles aren&#x27;t so soft or spaced out that I can&#x27;t get a good scrub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about six months, using it most days.</li>
            <li> Good product and fun to use.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the feel.</li>
            <li> And it makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> I love that it straps on your hand</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more for exfoliating you...</li>
            <li> dont love it.</li>
            <li> Used daily and is the best body brush that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is making a difference for me and it is enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> I have bought more than one of these, 2 for me (1 for each bathroom), and more for gifts, all well received.  </li>
            <li> Really love it.</li>
            <li> Initially bought this as an exfoliating brush to use while in the shower, and it worked wonderfully for that.</li>
            <li> Even after a day or two of not shaving, my legs still feel better.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> the fantasea brush more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think I prefer the fantasea as it does the job of exfoliating and is more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much better by then.</li>
            <li> But it leaves fibers all over your body which then continue to itch you and make you paranoid of finding more fibers on yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this brush....</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> Nope, after a month of use her legs are surely losing whatever cottage cheese was there.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I have purchased 2 brushes.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Why spend more?</li>
            <li> I am going to buy a couple more to keep on hand in case</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am most pleased with the body brush.  </li>
            <li> They absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> Would surely pay much more for something of quality.  </li>
            <li> Love it and use every day.</li>
            <li> see no need to pay more when this one does such a great job!</li>
            <li> You might find better if you look around.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even notice many bristles coming out like I would expect.</li>
            <li> I get a really smooth shave!</li>
            <li> This one would be better for the body and not for the face.</li>
            <li> love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good combination of softness and firmness to give you a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I use this brush right after I shower to give my skin some good circulation.</li>
            <li> Good price, bristles are just the right soft/hardness.</li>
            <li> Many my skin is sooo soft and I feel so clean and relaxed, This is the best thing I ever invested in.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality brush, which is very gentle to the skin..</li>

            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect tool for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect amount of stiffness for a beginner at dry brushing like I am.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a dry body brush which it is perfect for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin brushing to exfoliate and tone.  </li>
            <li> I love the shape of this brush and the strap makes it easy to keep in my hand.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for exfoliation and makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for dry brushing!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and takes soap very  nicely.</li>
            <li> Actually feels very good and does help exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> experienced brushers might find this suitable, but it actually left me with visible scratches, so I had to say goodbye*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits on my hand, is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But mine adjusted to this very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, as well.</li>
            <li> The handle is well attached and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and holds up, but the grip for me is not as easy with the band over my hand...</li>
            <li> Easy to soap up and rinse off.  </li>
            <li> The canvas handle helps it stay on your hand easily and also helps to hang it on a hook inside my bathroom cabinet for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size, fitting well in the palm of your hand, and the strap makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to carry for travel.</li>
            <li> It is strongly made.</li>
            <li> Here I was thinking this was just good for a nice deep scrubbing.</li>
            <li> and they smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I got this brush, thinking that it would do just as fine without a handle and steep price tag, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine brush for the body.</li>
            <li> Just needs an elastic hand strap to make it more comfortable to hold (it&#x27;s just woven fabric that won&#x27;t hold small hands) but bristles are perfect.</li>
            <li> This product is great makes skin super soft and removes cellular.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I used it after it was dry and LOVED it!</li>
            <li> Description was accurate.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t lost enough weight to know if the method works, I do know that this brush is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> skin brushing is not only great because it&#x27;s exfoliating, but also it&#x27;s invigorating.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The price was cheap</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;d hoped for, but it still works well and gets skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is this cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> One step up would be the Kingsley Sisal Body Brush ($7.99 Amazon.com for Prime members free shipping).  </li>
            <li> In the morning when I shave my legs are so smooth.</li>
            <li> Its just an EXTREMELY cheap exfoliator brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> Strap Fits Comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Really cheaply manufactured.  </li>
            <li> but  I still enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s perfect for more sensitive areas like my midsection and upper arms.</li>
            <li> It is also a comfortable size to hold.</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic on the skin.</li>
            <li> Just a comfortable brush that feels invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I like the feel of the bristles, and the brush is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my dogs because I had heard that a natural bristle brush was good for a dog&#x27;s coat.</li>
            <li> Loved the \\&quot;hand-held\\&quot; design and the natural bristles - that&#x27;s why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Good, natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> wish it were more secure in my hand; the strape is too lose, but other than that, i&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> On top of that, the price was right.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for dry brushing, like the strap, and the bristles are the perfect texture (not too hard, not to soft to be effective)</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to handle just the right bristle strength.</li>
            <li> Not painful and brush is perfect firmness, not too firm.</li>
            <li> makes it super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolute best dry brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Good bristles for dry brushing and easier to use than many brushes .</li>
            <li> I love glowy skin, so we&#x27;ll see how much this helps!</li>
            <li> The elemis also seems to be of better quality, as the fantasea lost its bristles on the first day, whereas the elemis stayed intact.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my sister…</li>
            <li> I LOVE it so much!  </li>
            <li> Works great for dry brushing</li>
            <li> But overall I am thrilled with the brush, doing a much better job than my clairsonic is at this point.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing the skin</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing for lymphatic stimulation.  </li>
            <li> This is a great body brush and can be used for dry brushing or just to wash your body with.</li>
            <li> Works great as a dry skin brush for my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing or for use in the shower with shower gel.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> so I can clean it.</li>
            <li> I came out of my shower squaky clean.  </li>
            <li> It comes with suggestions as to how to clean the brush and when you should replace it, but I will buy another one whenever I feel like it isn&#x27;t working anymore, which may or may not be when they recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for Dry Brushing</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the product considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice body brush, good for exfoliating, not too harsh on your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this one and intend to keep it in my travel bag to be able to dry brush when traveling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Very good to clean dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, like any brush you can buy in any store.</li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is great and the brush works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for dry-brushing a couple times, and I find it to be a good stimulating firmness without being too abrasive, but I can also use a Salux pretty much all over and not have any issues, so I may have a higher tolerance/thicker skin than some.</li>
            <li> Also the packaging that the brush came in was open, so it could&#x27;ve been a used one, but good thing I&#x27;m using it for my hedgehogs.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t expect that&#x27;d be much of a problem for most folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> and it really aids in a better application of the tanner.</li>
            <li> I can control the level of exfoliation easily by simply adding or removing pressure and the handle allows for a good grip.  </li>
            <li> But good brush overall.</li>
            <li> &quot; - so true.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my scalp (I&#x27;m not bald, so it works through short hair) to knock off flakes, which makes my head feel good after brushing.</li>
            <li> The brush is not bad.</li>
            <li> , it does have a strong odor at first, but after 2-3 washes, the odor is gone.</li>
            <li> I recommend running it under warm water and rubbing the fibers back and forth with your hand and washing it with a body soap, then rub the bristles back and forth some more under the warm water to wash the soap out.</li>
            <li> and this is a great addition to my other brushes.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s very maneuverable and easy to use, clean, etc.</li>
            <li> This brush works great, really softens the skin, as for helping with cellulite couldn&#x27;t tell you, I have only used it a week.</li>
            <li> im sure that if i was using this daily i would have better results.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds bristles quickly.</li>
            <li> I received this brush fairly quickly in the mail and it was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> that helps the water from ruining the brush as quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for several months now and have been very happy to see that the bristles have held together and it hasn&#x27;t gotten gross or moldy being stored in the shower.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted, as I wanted to do some light brushing of my legs and arms in the shower, without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit soft, but suitable for my needs.  </li>
            <li> i have purchased so many brushes and most of them fall flat ( literally) ...</li>
            <li> Being new to dry brushing, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a brush and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Good for dry body brushing.  </li>
            <li> Having heard that dry brushing is good for the lymphatic system, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush, I use it for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> good brush to get started with a dry brushing routine.</li>
            <li> It was only good for the first week.</li>
            <li> If you want to try dry brushing this is a good way to start.</li>
            <li> Fits my hand very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use this for skin brushing and it&#x27;s exactly the bristles I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I really love all the natural bristles on this brush!  </li>
            <li> I use this to dry brush before/after epilating, It&#x27;s really been helping a great deal with the ingrown hairs I was getting from epilating, I don&#x27;t notice any bristles falling out</li>
            <li> And my skin is super soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> though it does shed, as others have observed, I think this is a great little bod brush for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect - not too soft are too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need another one, but since it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone that is on a detox cleanse or anyone that has a lot of dead skin after the winter.</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you need to use in the shower to give a cleaner and healthier skin glow to make your body feel fresh.</li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s made of natural fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I love this product  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care, but now I&#x27;ve found that it actually would be kind of nice to have a longer handle on it to reach my back.</li>
            <li> That could be a good thing for some, but not me, its too rough to use on my body, so I use it as a foot brush instead.</li>
            <li> so the only way to use it is by having a nice grip on the brush</li>
            <li> I do far more damage by scratching an itchy spot with my fingers.</li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;m rather pleased...</li>
            <li> It works well for getting it to lay nice and neatly, with all the hairs going the same direction.</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change in my legs appearance after using it, but it definitely gets the blood flowing and feels really good.</li>
            <li> This product is worth what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see how often I use it, to see if it will be worth replacing.  </li>
            <li> So far, this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Only thing that could be better is an adjustable strap, but overall it works great and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Still works, but I have to make extra sure to clean the cracks.</li>
            <li> it is easy to slip over your hand and dry brush your skin for a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This brush has just the right bristles to invigorate your skin without causing a rash.</li>
            <li> It is just right.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just right to leave my skin fully invigorated and not sore.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> even my husband noticed right away.</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> just right for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think the bristles are just right.  </li>
            <li> the handle that kind of looks like a toilet bowl cleaner also sold on Amazon)</li>
            <li> Does a good job of scrubbing my less sensitive skin (legs and arms mostly).  </li>
            <li> The wood is smooth and highly polished.</li>
            <li> High quality and fit&#x27;s my hand well.</li>
            <li> Just wish the strap was available in a more feminine fit and it rinsed out a little easier.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft enough to enjoy the task of exfoliation</li>
            <li> You will feel envigorated and refreshed and should notice great improvement in your skin&#x27;s tone and texture in just a few days!</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect, not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not too hard but are still strong and do an excellent job of dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I feel fortunate to have found a new supplier.</li>
            <li> bristles aren&#x27;t too soft, nor too strong.</li>
            <li> There are a few different methods I have found, so see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> Its very handy like literally, if your a female it fits from the tip of your middle finger to the end of the palm of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not too rough and not too soft, feels very nice.</li>
            <li> Going into it with this expectation alone, I was highly surprised and pleased with how many benefits I achieve from dry brushing.</li>
            <li> The bristle are not the softest,kinda scratch a little, but gets into pores good.</li>
            <li> Has held up very well and would purchase again when needed!</li>
            <li> First thing, the brush is most definitely SYNTHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yeah you&#x27;ll pay more, but it&#x27;ll last longer and not shred your skin.</li>
            <li> I put a bit of soap on the brush and then rub my face with it, the brush is definitely taking off the top layers of skin</li>
            <li> I will however say that it is a natural bristle brush (which is important to me)</li>
            <li> but then i found out it was because i was using hot water, and ever since i dont use it so hot</li>
            <li> But still, I love it, especially for the price/quality ratio.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap though a couple of bucks, it&#x27;s not worth much more.</li>
            <li> First time I have used a body brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The hair of the brush feels like plastic, nothing like the first 2 I had.</li>
            <li> I first heard about body brushing on the Bethany tv show.</li>
            <li> First time skin brusher.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of rough</li>
            <li> and my skin has become soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, i noticed bristles shedding, but i didnt think anything of it.</li>
            <li> and it really intensify the results!</li>
            <li> I actually like this one better as its easier to control and move around on my body.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li> It does smell funny when you first take it out</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> You want to keep your skin soft, looking youthful and cellulite free?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I had gotten one sooner ;-)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> My first skin brush.</li>
            <li> A more pricey one is not necessary.</li>
            <li> I only bought 2, but wish I had purchased more.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for----at</li>
            <li> Good size and the bristles are firm but not too scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, firm bristles, convenient handle strap for ease of use.  </li>
            <li> The cloth/fiber strap prevents slippage and the shape is comfortable for my hand - two problems with my previous favorite from Body Shop.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use for dry brushing in my massage business.</li>
            <li> Love this natural body brush to use during shower time to exfoliate my skin, after drying off and applying lotion my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff but perfect for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li> I feel like it slides around more that way with my hand flat against it, so</li>
            <li> Since using this brush combined with Dr. Bronners soap, my skin has never felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Does not seem natural and had scratches on it, they were nice enough to refund my money</li>
            <li> Bristles are just firm enough, and product size is ideal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and it has a handy little loop to hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> when this brush arrived, it&#x27;s a nice wooden brush with a strong canvas-type material handle, and the bristles are soft enough to use on your face!  </li>
            <li> Some discoloration on the wood handle from continuous use, but overall the brush has lasted a long time with minimal bristle loss (much much longer than a popular brand easily found at most stores).</li>
            <li> It really does work if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> It works great for exfoliating and is gentler than other brushes which are rather coarse.</li>
            <li> After the first use a whole tuft came out.</li>
            <li> I love using these body brushes, they are just the right size to fit in my hand and they&#x27;re not so hard that it hurts to use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are still nice and stiff, and firmly attached to the brush, so it seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft, providing great exfoliation without too much irritation.</li>
            <li> It is gross, but the results after of my smooth soft skin are so worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels when I dry brush my skin before the shower</li>
            <li> I had heard about dry bushing one&#x27;s skin to promote healthy blood flow and reduce cellulite, well I&#x27;ve found that to be true!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really do love using this dry brush.  </li>
            <li> The strap on the back makes it easy to hook my hand into it and not drop it while I&#x27;m brushing.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin (I&#x27;m prone to eczema breakouts every so often) which is a plus.</li>
            <li> had never used a dry skin brush before, but I am in love.</li>
            <li> Love to use this brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> It had an extremely strong toxic scent, its bristles starting falling out as soon as I removed it from its packaging.</li>
            <li> The cloth band is a bit large over my hand, but I don&#x27;t always use it.</li>
            <li> I massage my body with upward, large, circular movements.</li>
            <li> This is when you use the brush in a certain direction, depending on what body part you are using it on, to help with circulation and exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> it will just limit it to certain spots.</li>
            <li> Was put off by the size at first ( smaller than my other dry brush) but turns out it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most high quality brush in the world, but I use it to dry brush my legs before a shower and it works very well!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get your back, but that is fine if you just want something to scrub your arms and legs while  in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adjust the pressure to your personal liking, it takes all the dead skin off and lets lotion soak in nice and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small oval shape makes it easy to grip and the bristles seem to be strongly stuck in place.</li>
            <li> Its a good brush, if you like really hard brush</li>
            <li> The very first time using the product, an entire cluster of bristles came right out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very concerned about it being too abrasive, this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Do not use much pressure.  </li>
            <li> the brush itself is very well-made.</li>
            <li> so I am being more careful to put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But I find that I am using 3 times as much soap with this brush because it just doesn&#x27;t hold it.  </li>
            <li> You can use it anywhere on your body, but it does the job and really cleans your skin.</li>
            <li> I think this might be better for in shower use when wet in place of a loofah/wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> The bristles really get the blood flowing and perk me up.</li>
            <li> It really works well as a skin brush.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Really works great, do it everyday, follow up with Nivea body firming lotion, you will see a different texture in your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels MUCH softer post shower</li>
            <li> so I use it gently maybe once a week.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with losing bristles or the strap coming off as some others have reported - perhaps because I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer my Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush, it is much softer and does not cause itching.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> OK, so I decided to hop on this body brushing trend, and bought this baby even though the reviews were a clutter of confusingness (too rough?</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see how body brushing will improve my life in any material way, and I&#x27;m materialistic,</li>
            <li> I got this product by mistake, so I don&#x27;t have much to review about it.</li>
            <li> Wanting to remove much of it</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me fast though</li>
            <li> which I appreciated</li>
            <li> Really helps minimize the cellulite on the legs.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Most likely will order a few more.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, though it does shed a tiny bit, but all natural brushes shed.</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristles.</li>
            <li> Helps increase circulation and remove dead skin for a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Love that the bristles are natural and that the handle is made of solid wood.  </li>
            <li> More likely it&#x27;s for your pet alligator or to remove old paint from furniture.</li>
            <li> you order this make sure you receive an natural bristle hair brush, otherwise send it back.</li>
            <li> LOVE to dry brush!!  </li>
            <li> The elemis is also stiffer, which may mean it makes a better exfoliation tool, but I find that I enjoy the feel of</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush for trying out dry-brushing skin, so this review doesn&#x27;t cover how good the brush is if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are nice, soft enough to not hurt the skin too much, but stiff enough that you feel you&#x27;re actually exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li> so my hand will slip right out , as well as sometimes they feel like they&#x27;re too soft</li>
            <li> you feel really like extra clean on your skin with this body brush.</li>
            <li> This body brush makes me feel so clean after a long day in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality brush, no ruffles or frills except possibly the little hand strap on the back, which I actually have found is kind of a pain to try to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i REALLY prefer the stiffer ones of my older brush then again</li>
            <li> In the beginning it felt nice but that didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft enough to not irritate but firm enough to do the job,  and the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend it to other.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are great for dry exfoliating but no so harsh that they irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> It has strong bristles but doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive skin red.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry brushing which I am now totally addicted to doing before bed.</li>
            <li> This brush is good to use both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> This product did have a strange smell when first opened, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> It is probably fine for dry brushing, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the shower.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the company would clearly state what material the bristles are made of, but I assume that if they were boar bristles, the cost would be significantly higher.</li>
            <li> A little more abrasive that I prefer, but great for dry brushing none the less!</li>
            <li> Use this on dry skin before you get in the shower, and your skin will feel so smooth after.</li>
            <li> and it is still holding steady.</li>
            <li> I bought it for skin brushing, to remove dead skin cells for fresh smooth skin.</li>
            <li> There is a large-loose handle that only a giant could appropriately use to brush their body.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is decent and well-made.  </li>
            <li> inexpensive but decent quality.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it before my Finulite cream to get rid of any dirt.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve had many wooden brushes not hold well in the past, but the awesome reviews got me to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones remaining are nice to use, but I am afraid to use it as directed that more bristles will just keep falling out.</li>
            <li> They are a fairly decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It works great, but quite a few of the bristles came out on the first few uses, so I would stand in the shower to catch the bristles</li>
            <li> The handle works so far for me, it hasn&#x27;t stretched out and makes it easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my body because I have sensitive skin and this brush is too harsh but for hard areas like feet is perfect.</li>
            <li> With most brushes the bristles are too stiff for my skin but after using this a few times it&#x27;s very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Ladies, order from another seller on Amazon.com or purchase a real natural bristle brush from Bath &amp; Body Works or Bed Bath</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and am looking for a much softer bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I would recommend it is a great hand brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles give a vigorous exfoliation without tearing up my skin, but this could maybe be a bit much for someone with really sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like this brush so far.</li>
            <li> I cant gather the courage to use it for more than few seconds, which is why I gave it 3</li>
            <li> will buy a few more</li>
            <li> and I noticed way more dead skin flakes in my bed after waking up.</li>
            <li> If your brush is still too harsh, you might want to wash it a couple more times under warm/hot water.</li>
            <li> but i think that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I use a normal loofah for exfoliation</li>
            <li> The wood hasn&#x27;t cracked in any way, shape or form, and the strong canvas cloth handle is still as firmly attached and functional as it was straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> It is the right level of stiffness for me, and I would definitely recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Maybe with more frequent use, it might soften up a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a new skin brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to start a new skin regimen for not my face.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m new to brushing</li>
            <li> This body brush does exactly what I expected and has held up fantastically after much use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s thinner and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Brushing the skin seems to have far more benefits than just sloughing off dead skins cells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the craftsmanship is great, there&#x27;s a rubbery base between the bristles and the wood that protects the bristles and blocks out water to keep the wood damage- free.</li>
            <li> I use it for cellulite and although I don&#x27;t know if it works, it is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried many bath brushes and they are either too stiff or too soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, but hard enough to brush off dead skin, which makes it perfect as a body brush.</li>
            <li> Affordable and natural bristles, would order again for gifts!</li>
            <li> : Just bought a second one for my hubby, since he loves it so much too!</li>
            <li> Soft but exfoliates!</li>
            <li> my husband glides this brush over my back -is very relaxing and soothing and also eases itchiness!  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact when they see me get the brush they will come and compete over who get brushed first.</li>
            <li> Starts out a little stiff, but with time and use the bristles soften making a more comfortable exfoliation / and improved circulation treatment.</li>
            <li> At first the bristles felt stiff, but my body quickly became acclimated to this brush.</li>
            <li> brushes come as brush heads with a wooden backing and strap for an easy grip, but the elemis comes with a detachable handle, which would be useful for brushing the back and other hard-to-reach places.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The benefits of dry brushing or skin brushing seem great reading on it, but not sure if it&#x27;s ACTUALLY doing anything.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd brush I order (my dog ate the first 2), the first 2 seemed natural, now the 3rd one not at all.</li>
            <li> Normally my dogs don&#x27;t really like being brushed</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I&#x27;m wanting extra smooth legs, I&#x27;ll dry brush</li>
            <li> Love the hardness to it, I use it for dry and wet brushing and my skin has never been softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super soft, but definitely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I only spend about a minute before I shower quickly brushing over my arms, legs and back</li>
            <li> I use this dry brush before I shower and use coconut oil to moisturize right after.</li>
            <li> The bristles have just the right degree of stiffness to remove dry skin without being too scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Now I just have to be more religious about actually doing the dry brushing thing.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to skin brushing, and I bought this as my first ‘dry’ brush.</li>
            <li> It does shed a little but it was for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little harsher but most reviews say the opposite</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect firmness, hard enough to be a bit scratchy but not so hard that it feels like you&#x27;re scraping off your flesh.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a straight-from-a-warehouse in China purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but sturdy enough to really stimulate the skin.</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s quite soft.  </li>
            <li> Not as soft as I would like..</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t slough off too much skin, but just enough to help get softer skin.</li>
            <li> my last brush lasted about a year, i really thought the wood would give out, but it was the plastic that cracked and released the hairs.</li>
            <li> but personally I dont like it for this reason as it really hurts when trying to use it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Over time the bristles become a bit softer from what another review said for extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fantasea Natural Bristle Body Brush, 3.5 Ounce.  </li>
            <li> The body brush is soft but some of the brissels come out.</li>
            <li> Or my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This brush leaves my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even said that he has never felt skin this soft.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The bristles themselves are undoubtedly 100% plastic, there is NOTHING natural about this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is already soft even before using this brush so I don&#x27;t know if it is making it softer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> These natural bristle body brushes can go for up to $40 in a spa.</li>
            <li> I wish it was sold by Amazon directly.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and looks healthier, especially now during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Coarse, but not too much so.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> too soft?</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles fell out (and continue to shed) but the brush is soft to the skin.</li>
            <li> Too soft for skin brushing.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower, and while the bristles are good (sturdy, but not scratchy), the hand strap (instead of a handle) make it difficult to use all over the body.</li>
            <li> otherwise it works well enough, the strap makes it possible to hold, and it makes a nice lather, its not too stiff, but they fall apart after some time.</li>
            <li> It actually isn&#x27;t any thing more than a extremely stiff hair brush.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try dry skin brushing, but with pretty sensitive skin, was worried it would cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in buying a dry brush.</li>
            <li> I received a brush that out of each little spout (assuming a body brush has a grid of about 200-300 spouts), each spout was full of snythetic like your toothbrush acrylic plastic bristles containing one natural bristle</li>
            <li> Overall thought a decent product.</li>
            <li> B00898EIAS Brush Deluxe Circular Handle 100% Boar Bristle Body Brush, Firm Bass Brushes 1]].</li>
            <li> This brush is a little too soft for someone who has been brushing regularly, but would be fine to start with.  </li>
            <li> Simple product - Item was as expected and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This natural bristle body brush is great at getting the dead skin off those tough areas.</li>
            <li> When I first got this it looked like it would be rough on the skin,</li>
            <li> But after the second and third, the bristles were coming out in LARGE quantities.</li>
            <li> I used to have something similar but on a large wooden handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too stiff and rough on my chest and stomach would like it a lot better if not so rough on my more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering again in the future when I need a new one</li>
            <li> Makes dry brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li> It works very well for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush; I use it for dry brushing in the morning.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for dry exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even using less lotion, which is rare for me this time of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> About to buy another one, because I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;ve had my first one for just too long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s honestly too inexpensive to bother with shipping it back - completely annoyed,</li>
            <li> Upon first use, the bristles did fall out as other users had mentions.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in dry body brushing.</li>
            <li> and I can press harder on certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing a different, similar product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this small and simple brush.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is built well -- doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall apart, and it&#x27;s made with natural materials (save for the white plastic part</li>
            <li> This product is not firm enough for me.  </li>
            <li> The brush wasn&#x27;t too rough, and worked really well.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry body brushing to help drain my lymphatic system, but mainly to get rid of some stretch marks, i havent been using the brush every day like i am supposed to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a while now, bought it as a replacement for a similar one I found at TJ Maxx that got old.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft, and used with firming lotion, definitely helps in that area</li>
            <li> have no regrets about purchasing this brush, and I hope this seller continues to stock this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A crack has developed in the wooden body.</li>
            <li> I barely press on my skin though because I am not trying to tear my skin</li>
            <li> I have since purchased a different brush with firmer bristles; I would recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The one minor issue was a bit of plastic base chipped off when I dropped it, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> It helps a little if I take a shower right after using the brush, then applying lotion.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, buy something a little more expensive for the better quality!</li>
            <li> Bristles do not fall out and the brush is super firm, but not enough to hurt your skin</li>
            <li> Its not super pretty or fancy......</li>
            <li> Four stars because it seems less durable (bristles came out the first time brushing).</li>
            <li> If you suffer from eczema, I highly recommend dry brushing!</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying out dry brushing for yourself!</li>
            <li> is holding up very well - bristles are not falling out like on other brands i have used.  </li>
            <li> It is much softer than other ones she bought.</li>
            <li> but the fabric loop that you slip your hand through is much too wide for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the bristles to be a little more stiff, but it is doing its job.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (Large)]] or Bass</li>
            <li> Not too hard, not too soft - just right.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough to use on my little ones with a gentle touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item arrived well packaged in a USPS First Class Mail bubbled envelope, inside it was in a medium-thick plastic bag (lots of waste already).</li>
            <li> arrived with one of the sides of the strap halfway removed from the bottom of the bristles &amp; quite a few of the bristles fell off at the first use.</li>
            <li> I use my natural bristle brush for dry exfoliation before getting in the shower, it was a little scratchy the first 2 times I used it</li>
            <li> The fantasea seems to be hard enough to brush off dead skin cells (and I could see the white dust coming off and feel my skin becoming smoother), but soft enough to feel enjoyable and more like a massage than a desperate attempt to scratch off dead skin cells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might wear down faster than the elemis and it comes without a handle, but I think the much cheaper price makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are hard enough to exfoliate but not too harsh for more sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> It can feel a little abrasive at first, but I only use it on my legs and elbows.</li>
            <li> The brush is stiff when you first get it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of dry natural bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles were too soft for dry skin brushing.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get in on the dry brushing craze, and so far it lives up to it&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a natural bristle, which is what you want in a dry brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m getting all the wild results that some people claim with dry brushing-</li>
            <li> Using this for dry brushing and my skin is SO soft now.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little large for my hand, but I can still use the brush with ease.</li>
            <li> not to hard or soft and works well for dry brushing and wet brushing, just be sure to hang somewhere to dry after</li>
            <li> Unless I am gripping the wood edges tight, this makes it hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> This brush feels soft but is sturdy enough to hold up to several minutes of dry brushing.</li>
            <li> This is a technique where you vigorously brush your skin BEFORE getting into the shower, in large, firm, circular strokes.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and very coarse hair due to an endocrine disorder..</li>
            <li> We already have a dedicated dry brush type brush so this one is for sudsing and general bathing.</li>
            <li> My dear departed grandfather used to say, \\&quot;Only a rich man can afford poor quality\\</li>
            <li> If it feels a little rough at first, just keep using it and it will break in.</li>
            <li> the bristles feel a little rough at first</li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough to not grate my skin (and I usually have SENSITIVE skin).  </li>
            <li> this item arrived with other ordered items and the way it was packaged completely smashed all of the bristles - who ever packed</li>
            <li> I love this body brush as it is soft but yet stiff enough to scrub your dry skin without irritating it.  </li>
            <li> its firm enough to do the job but not hard enough it hurts.</li>
            <li> The bristle is hard at first, in fact very hard, but it quickly softened up to the point where it almost felt like a different product within weeks.</li>
            <li> Bristles seem very still and irritating, and when this brush got wet my whole shower smelled like a locker room the next day.</li>
            <li> At first I bought this as a dry skin brush, but i&#x27;m to lazy to do it every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes at Bed, Bath and Beyond, Target, and a long time ago at Bath and Body.</li>
            <li> Its soft enough to not cause irritation, but firm enough so that it does exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> This brush seems to be just right - not abrasive, but stiff enough to feel like you are actually removing dead skin, etc.</li>
            <li> but this will last a long time!</li>
            <li> You loosen dead skin sells and promote new cell growth through stimulation.  </li>
            <li> Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Bristles come off easily, especially when used for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I started looking into dry brushing and was taken back by the prices of some of the brushes that I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I have recently started dry brushing after hearing about the benefits.</li>
            <li> The body brush does get rid of all the dry skin that&#x27;s left from being outdoors.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try out dry brushing.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re starting a dry brushing routine</li>
            <li> But after dry brushing it is almost totally gone!</li>
            <li> I dry brush for the next two days</li>
            <li> I got into dry brushing several months ago.</li>
            <li> I previously tried a brush with man made bristles and it was too flexible and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times so far.  </li>
            <li> But even though its soft, the constantly shedding bristles makes this a waste.</li>
            <li> and i found that the bristles on this brush were a little too soft.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry brushing before my daily or twice a day showers because I&#x27;ve read about the benefits of dry brushing everywhere on the web.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to grip the brush so hard, which makes brushing gently easier.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this one; it is much too hard for me.  </li>
            <li> The brush sheds a little the first few times that you use it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too rough but are hard enough to really scrub my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to scrub my legs because I had a bad case of the &amp;#34;strawberry legs&amp;#34; ever since I purchased this brush I noticed amazing results and</li>
            <li> Just mentioning they were soft, even when dry, I prefer our slightly stiffer bristled brush we have for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying, unsuccessfully, to lose a lot of weight for a long time, and have a fear of sagging skin after I lose all the weight.</li>
            <li> This was not soft as suggested in the reviews.</li>
            <li> Not too soft and not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> The body brush didn&#x27;t take long to ship, and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> just so I have one for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I think if it was too soft it wouldn&#x27;t serve its purpose of removing dead skin and stimulating circulation.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but firm.</li>
            <li> i gave 4 stars cause the rope like strap thing was a bit long for me</li>
            <li> Rough enough to do it job, but not to the point it hurts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Might take a few days to get used to if you&#x27;re used to soft sponges though.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than it looks in picture and when I using it I realized it was too rough.</li>
            <li> Will eventually get a stiffer brush, as my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> Bristles are also very coarse and rough.</li>
            <li> I thought the bristles were too soft for what I wanted to use the brush for but after using it a few days</li>
            <li> Not too soft, not too harsh.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no way to do a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush if the brush itself has coarse bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> Being an old guy I seem to have a lot of dead skin on my body.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not soft; I just wanted them stronger.</li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the package and felt the bristles with my hand, it felt a little stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristled of this brush are just right....not too rough so that it scratches the skin, but still sturdy enough to remove surface dry skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and the bristles are too stiff for sensitive parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Bristles not too stiff - not too soft.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it is super duper hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> I usually have 2 opened and ready to use, one for my feet and the other for the rest of me.</li>
            <li> bristles were a little bit softer than I expected but not toooo soft.</li>
            <li> Due to the chemical smell coming off of it, I would definitely not put this on my body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still only a little red</li>
            <li> This prevents it from holding any soap suds for very long.  </li>
            <li> Oh, this seller did take a very long time to ship though.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for dry brushing.  </li>

            <li> Use it for dry brushing my skin before baths, leaves skin silky.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses seems to have stopped and there are enough left to do the job.</li>
            <li> Then every few days I bring it in the shower and use it wet (also after using it dry, but I use it softly in the shower)</li>
            <li> It has firm but not rough bristles.</li>
            <li> Over the intervening time, 8 more have come out and the white plastic base (between the wood body and bristles) has cracked in several places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a firm sensation, but not rough at all.</li>

            <li> Not too hard or soft!  </li>
            <li> It is firm enough to use for dry brushing for lymph and exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily for 5 min just before I shower to exfoliate any dead dry skin off the surface, followed by moisturizer just after I towel off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my skin delicate or over sensitive but this brush is way too rough for me to use for dry brushing</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it wet or dry!</li>
            <li> There is a little band on the back of it to hold it when you are doing what ever you bought it for.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought two and keep one for dry use and the other in the shower.</li>
            <li> A the bristles are software than my other brush that I use for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I try to dry brush every other day.</li>
            <li> Not too hard or too soft.</li>

            <li> The bristles are not too hard, not too soft;</li>
            <li> Not too hard not too soft.</li>
            <li> not too soft, not too hard, does the job.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not too hard or too soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li> if there was no plastic and the bristles were in the wood - it would last so much longer, so i think it&#x27;s just designed to fail.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but considering the price, I&#x27;m not overly concerned about this.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks, its still the same.</li>
            <li> brush is so rough and the bristles fall out</li>
            <li> This product was too rough for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware if your skin cannot handle rough bristles.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be really rough.  </li>
            <li> Really rough bristles.</li>
            <li> this brush was too rough for the shower...</li>
            <li> I knew it wasnt because i was being too rough with it or</li>
            <li> But I suppose that can be expected over time with any brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not to rough and none of the bristle has fallen out and the wood hasn&#x27;t chipped at all.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower, wet.  </li>
            <li> The brush is kinda rough so being careful is advised.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just firm enough to really be invigorating without hurting my skin or irritating it.  </li>
            <li> not a real body</li>
            <li> The hand strap is also very loose and non-adjustable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too rough on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm, but not too harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the strap is a bit large for me, but I have very small hands</li>
            <li> but the bristles were not as stiff as the one I currently have.</li>
            <li> The white plastic at the base of the bristles that holds it in place also cracked with just regular use and no dropping or anything, and the bristles started to fall off to the point where you would have to clean the drain after every use to prevent clogging.</li>
            <li> scrub myself down with it before every shower, yes dry.</li>
            <li> Other brushes I tried were just too rough and the bristles never softened.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to create increased circulation when used to dry brush your skin, but not so firm as to cause discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Other brushes MAY have harder/softer bristles that won&#x27;t get the job done correctly.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews to check what everyone says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even after the first use, some bristles are coming off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t scratch like other brushes have.</li>
            <li> At first, it can be a bit uncomfortable while the skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!</li>
            <li> The little dimples on the backs of my legs are still there, but my ankles do look a little smaller, so I think if anything, it&#x27;s helping my circulation.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like this item.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is going to last longer than 3 or 4 uses</li>
            <li> The rough bristles make it very hard to use on soft skin like the arms and legs.</li>
            <li> One step down would be a rough washcloth.</li>
            <li> Very, very rough on skin</li>
            <li> Bristles are VERY rough.</li>
            <li> The bristles were not too hard nor too soft for scrubbing off dead skin.</li>
            <li> , the strap is a little loose</li>
            <li> We are detoxing and this brush was needed to dry brush dead skin to leave our body feeling refresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to start a dry brushing routine for my skin a few months ago</li>
            <li> I wanted a body brush that was firm enough to exfoliate my skin, yet not so firm that it made me bleed.</li>
            <li> I use the brush before I shower on dry skin to remove dead skin cells, increase blood circulation, and battle against cellulite.</li>
            <li> Missy our youngest dog, who hated brushing the most, will actually come up and rub against the brush if she sees it in my hand.</li>
            <li> its a little bit stiff, i personally like it</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer and harder than other body brushes I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not too hard, but firm enough to feel the effects of dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Needed a stiff brush for dry brushing, increasing circulation etc.</li>
            <li> this is definitely not a brush for the face or other delicate skin areas.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get used to since it&#x27;s so rough.</li>
            <li> bristles fell out during every use and i personally think it&#x27;s too small, and i have little hands.</li>
            <li> I use it wet in the shower and it feels like it sloughs off so much dead skin.</li>
            <li> A few bristles came out but not much.  </li>
            <li> The item as a whole is poor in quality, has many nicks and scratches, has lots of plastic, and smells very bad.</li>
            <li> This body brush is a little rough, but it does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t feel painful &amp; by the 3rd time it was just right - still stiff but not scratchy.</li>
            <li> But after no more than 5 or 6 light uses, the plastic band around the base started to come apart and big clumps of bristle started to shed off and clog up my shower.  </li>
            <li> bristles on brush are firm enough to scrub well, but not too hard that you&#x27;ll hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> DO NOT get this brush wet though, it will make it smell weird until it completely dries.</li>
            <li> I typically forgo it and just hold it gripped in my hand.</li>
            <li> These ones are stiff enough to get the job done, without being to hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it works when wet though.</li>
            <li> I dry brush at least three times a week to promote lymphatic flow.</li>
            <li> It is slightly uncomfortable to use, but I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Received this little brush weeks after I ordered it and it smelled like toxic plastic.  </li>
            <li> when using the brush i found that i get these little itchy bumps after.</li>
            <li> A little slice of heaven in the shower.</li>
            <li> Sheds a little bit..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little harsh on the face</li>
            <li> The brush has hard bristles, so it is rough against the skin.</li>
            <li> Not too rough and hard.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this thing are hard and are rough.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it smelt like a dead animal</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> Not to harsh and abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Use it before your shower for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Before getting into the shower use this brush to increase circulation and remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I dropped about a pound of dead skin.</li>
            <li> Based on some researching I&#x27;ve done it is recommended to use this once a week to get dead skin off</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s because of excess dead skin.</li>
            <li> (Not to harsh on the skin)</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> It literally sloughs off a layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li> It increases circulation, exfoliates dead skin, and &#x27;smoothes&#x27; cellulite.</li>
            <li> and I can see the dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> and this is not too harsh at all for me.</li>
            <li> It removes dirt and oil, and dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after using it everyday for two weeks</li>
            <li> and I was amazed how much dead skin it removed.</li>
            <li> I use it before I get into the shower to take off any dead skin that way</li>
            <li> Fits well in the hand and the bristles are firm but doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch the skin off.</li>
            <li> That makes shower time less!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s less than $2.00 now!)</li>
            <li> I like that brush for every day use .Its not very soft or neither very hard and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Please change the description of this product to &amp;#34;Fantasea Stiff Synthetic Skin Scapper.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but it is still plenty stiff.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a bit too stiff for my face/neck area</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a brush like this one.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, the bristles are slightly tough but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> But sometimes I have little flareups on my body when I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> the black dots/pores slowly start to decrease in size as well as fade.</li>
            <li> the bristles are too weak when wet and with soap.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the brush shows excessive wear as I would recommend you consider buying something else instead.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure why, but my skin doesn&#x27;t itch before brushing, but itches a lot for about 20 minutes after using it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this the past week and yesterday I met up with a friend who I saw about two weeks ago</li>
            <li> The bristles on my brush are irregular in length, as seen in the picture :/</li>
            <li> So small, it is almost microscopic.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to use this before showering</li>
            <li> and I really expected it to be poorly made, or made of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is helping...</li>
            <li> My hair grows in crazy directions and causes shave bumps and doesn&#x27;t leave my legs soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The handle helps to hold this small brush that fits in my rather small hand.</li>
            <li> You can literally see the dead skin flying off of you like dust!</li>
            <li> taking all my dead skin away!</li>
            <li> think it might just be the seller I used BigFly-something, who sold inferior or simply the wrong brush to</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bristles are a bit too stiff for dry brushing or for me using in the shower on skin with soap.</li>
            <li> The fact that after using it it caused my legs to break out in a horrible rash that took weeks to heal and that it stripped off more skin than I wanted it to, it loses the rest of its stars.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still hard as ever even after 4 months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush if you&#x27;re concerned about bristles being to hard.</li>
            <li> If this brush runs to hard, try brushing lighter.</li>
            <li> This brush is too hard for me.  </li>
            <li> so I was worried it was going to be too hard on me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hard as you would think.  </li>
            <li> like it and its not too hard against your skin.</li>
            <li> Now the hard part is making myself brush every day.</li>
            <li> I worried that it would be too hard.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t press hard at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m delicate</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a hair shy of being too rough...</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for well over a year now and can say without a doubt this brush is built with exceptionally shoddy craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I works well in my hand as I have a very small hand.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this aren&#x27;t to hard as some people say some brushes have bristles that are very hard.</li>
            <li> not good, cracked after a week</li>
            <li> So tired of shoddy quality products.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are fixed in a plastic base, which does not mold or mildew like some of the wood ones.</li>
            <li> &amp; they all have been too expensive or too stiff.</li>
            <li> Initially, some of it&#x27;s bristles came off :(</li>
            <li> This is definitely abrasive, not to the point that it is painful, but it&#x27;s definitely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to got through the hassle of sending it back, but the base glue that holds the bristles is cracked.  </li>
            <li> , I like to shower and then apply a thin layer of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It was missing a few tufts as indicated by the holes in the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> can feel a slight tingle (not in a bad way at all)</li>
            <li> Will be looking for an alternative, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be on the softer side, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> That is unfortunately what I need though.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable, but doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after i stopped going into tanning beds to exfoliate my skin before using fake tan.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry -</li>
            <li> bad water, bad skin, wash cloths are a mess...</li>
            <li> The bristles sit embedded in a hard plastic base, which is glued to a wood slab.</li>
            <li> , the bristles are rooted in a flat plastic base which is then attached to the wood base - I didn&#x27;t notice this in the pics (although now that I look, there it is) and it was mildly disappointing, but hey, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t think it was a bad deal</li>
            <li> i needed it for my bad cellulite</li>
            <li> but either way now it doesnt seem that painful to use it</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold up well and does not shed too terribly.  </li>

            <li> So happy I ordered this product!  Affordable and natural bristles, would order again for gifts!</li>
            <li> Starts out a little stiff, but with time and use the bristles soften making a more comfortable exfoliation / and improved circulation treatment.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry brushing</li>
            <li> Excellent body brush. ... Good for dry body brushing.  Not too hard or too soft. .. does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the brush shows excessive wear as I would recommend you consider buying something else instead.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the bath. We already have a dedicated dry brush type brush so this one is for sudsing and general bathing. (Immediately imagined Generals in a bath tub, snicker snicker)&lt;br /&gt;Anyways so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were a little bit softer than I expected but not toooo soft. Just mentioning they were soft, even when dry, I prefer our slightly stiffer bristled brush we have for dry brushing. This did a nice lather job with the bar soap we use and felt nice for scrub a dub dubbing.</li>
            <li> Just needs an elastic hand strap to make it more comfortable to hold (it&#x27;s just woven fabric that won&#x27;t hold small hands) but bristles are perfect.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s quite soft.  Softer then I imagined it to be.  Actually feels very good and does help exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> Received this little brush weeks after I ordered it and it smelled like toxic plastic.  I sent it back as I would never use this brush on my body, not even to scrub pans!</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you need to use in the shower to give a cleaner and healthier skin glow to make your body feel fresh.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for dry brushing. Not too soft, and not too hard. Gorgeous brush. Makes dry brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels when I dry brush my skin before the shower</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for dry brushing.  I had never dry-brushed before, but I like it.  The bristled of this brush are just right....not too rough so that it scratches the skin, but still sturdy enough to remove surface dry skin cells.  The only drawback is that you cannot reach parts of your back, since there is no handle.  For this price, though, it is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for dry-brushing a couple times, and I find it to be a good stimulating firmness without being too abrasive, but I can also use a Salux pretty much all over and not have any issues, so I may have a higher tolerance/thicker skin than some. If you&#x27;re very concerned about it being too abrasive, this may not be the one for you. I don&#x27;t know if it will soften up if you wash the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bristles are rooted in a flat plastic base which is then attached to the wood base - I didn&#x27;t notice this in the pics (although now that I look, there it is) and it was mildly disappointing, but hey, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry brushing!</li>
            <li> I use it for cellulite. Fits my hand perfect for the occasion.</li>
            <li> I like it, does a good job of cleaning my feet. I don&#x27;t use it on my body because I have sensitive skin and this brush is too harsh but for hard areas like feet is perfect. Not as soft as I would like.. And doesn&#x27;t get softer with use.. it&#x27;s still hard as ever even after 4 months.</li>
            <li> Great! Just as described.</li>
            <li> When I first got this it looked like it would be rough on the skin, not so it is very good and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;frankenseitz</li>
            <li> I love this body brush as it is soft but yet stiff enough to scrub your dry skin without irritating it.  Has held up very well and would purchase again when needed!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this body brush.  Being new to dry brushing, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a brush and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended in a Pinterest post about dry brushing. I took a leap of faith and purchased it. I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great alternative to loofahs.  I love the handle too, makes it easier to hold onto when you&#x27;re washing.  It&#x27;s great for exfoliating so you get that nice glow about your skin.</li>
            <li> This body brush is a little rough, but it does it&#x27;s job! I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously so I can&#x27;t say that I have achieved the results I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. The bristles are not too stiff. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and it has a handy little loop to hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush on a whim. I&#x27;ve been looking for a body brush for awhile &amp; they all have been too expensive or too stiff. This one is what I wanted. It&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the price was right. Going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.  It fits nicely in the palm of your hand.  The bristles are perfect - not too soft are too harsh.  It was very economical and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this brush to use for dry brushing. I&#x27;ve been trying, unsuccessfully, to lose a lot of weight for a long time, and have a fear of sagging skin after I lose all the weight. One method I had heard of was dry brushing, and figured I&#x27;d give it a go. While I haven&#x27;t lost enough weight to know if the method works, I do know that this brush is great for exfoliating. Sometimes if I&#x27;m wanting extra smooth legs, I&#x27;ll dry brush my legs really good before I hop in the shower to shave, and then also exfoliate with another product in the shower. It does what I got it for.</li>
            <li> I use this to dry brush before/after epilating, It&#x27;s really been helping a great deal with the ingrown hairs I was getting from epilating, I don&#x27;t notice any bristles falling out and it&#x27;s the perfect firmness, hard enough to be a bit scratchy but not so hard that it feels like you&#x27;re scraping off your flesh.</li>
            <li> Very, very rough on skin (something dry brushes are not supposed to be). Will be looking for an alternative, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try dry skin brushing, but with pretty sensitive skin, was worried it would cause irritation. This brush has just the right bristles to invigorate your skin without causing a rash. And I love that it&#x27;s made of natural fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin brushing is not only great because it&#x27;s exfoliating, but also it&#x27;s invigorating. It feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel a slight tingle (not in a bad way at all) once I&#x27;ve used this brush, and I feel like it&#x27;s helping to desensitize my skin a bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is built well -- doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall apart, and it&#x27;s made with natural materials (save for the white plastic part the bristles come out of). The fabric strap is very handy so you don&#x27;t have to grip the brush so hard, which makes brushing gently easier. My sensitive skin is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a value!</li>
            <li> This was not soft as suggested in the reviews.</li>
            <li> Bristles come off easily, especially when used for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels. I plan on using it twice a week. The handle is a little large for my hand, but I can still use the brush with ease.</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both really liked this body brush, while it lasted. We used this brush as part of our sauna routine (one sauna a week) for about 8 months until the bristles wore out. The bristles were not too hard nor too soft for scrubbing off dead skin. The strap was great for making sure you didn&#x27;t drop the brush when it was soapy. For the price I don&#x27;t think it was a bad deal but I&#x27;m going to try a different product in the hopes that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! Not too firm,not too soft!Helps to exfoliate and makes my skin softer.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The brush has hard bristles, so it is rough against the skin. I was thinking it would be on the softer side, but I was wrong. Also the packaging that the brush came in was open, so it could&#x27;ve been a used one, but good thing I&#x27;m using it for my hedgehogs.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower.  Love it  It fits on my hand, is easy to use.  Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product  have had about one week ~ my skin feels amazing after I use it!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this aren&#x27;t to hard as some people say some brushes have bristles that are very hard. These ones are stiff enough to get the job done, without being to hard. I would recommend this brush if you&#x27;re concerned about bristles being to hard. If this brush runs to hard, try brushing lighter. Other brushes MAY have harder/softer bristles that won&#x27;t get the job done correctly. Read other reviews to check what everyone says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of dry brushing or skin brushing seem great reading on it, but not sure if it&#x27;s ACTUALLY doing anything. It also helps get rid of cellulite on the body, which I haven&#x27;t tried it all for that yet. Don&#x27;t brush all the time with this or it will then irritate ur skin, just as if you continued scratching your skin with your nails it&#x27;ll eventually hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, read the benefits of dry skin brushing. It&#x27;s soothing. Cats like it too!</li>
            <li> This product is not firm enough for me.  I purchased a body brush from another company and could see and feel it exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> First thing, the brush is most definitely SYNTHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! Next thing, it sheds bristles profusely. Lastly, it is super duper hard and stiff. It actually isn&#x27;t any thing more than a extremely stiff hair brush. My hair brush is actually more pleasant to use. Please change the description of this product to &amp;#34;Fantasea Stiff Synthetic Skin Scapper.&amp;#34; There is nothing natural about this product!!!!!!!!!! Ladies, order from another seller on Amazon.com or purchase a real natural bristle brush from Bath &amp; Body Works or Bed Bath Beyond. Yeah you&#x27;ll pay more, but it&#x27;ll last longer and not shred your skin.</li>
            <li> Very handy and relaxing to use.</li>
            <li> Great items - fast shipping</li>
            <li> Absolute best dry brush I have ever used.  Not too soft and not too harsh.  It is just right.  No need to find another brand.</li>
            <li> fabulous...will order again!</li>
            <li> I start dry brushing and this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> Does not seem natural and had scratches on it, they were nice enough to refund my money</li>
            <li> I like the brush but the bristles were not as stiff as the one I currently have. It seems to be a good quality though - I just have to get used to softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive.  Well made. Do not use much pressure.  Might leave your skin red.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for dry brushing. Bristles are neither too hard or soft &amp; the brush itself is very well-made. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is slightly uncomfortable to use, but I do have very sensitive skin. Also, I&#x27;m not sure why, but my skin doesn&#x27;t itch before brushing, but itches a lot for about 20 minutes after using it. It helps a little if I take a shower right after using the brush, then applying lotion. Also, the strap is way too big for my hand.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Thank you!! I use this for dry brushing before I get into the shower. I have eczema and dry brushing helps.</li>
            <li> I just started using this the past week and yesterday I met up with a friend who I saw about two weeks ago and she asked what I am doing with my face because it looks great. So I do love this product, but I have to admit it hurts a bit to do it. I put a bit of soap on the brush and then rub my face with it, the brush is definitely taking off the top layers of skin so I am being more careful to put on moisturizer. But overall I am thrilled with the brush, doing a much better job than my clairsonic is at this point.</li>
            <li> I use this dry brush before I shower and use coconut oil to moisturize right after. It incredibly reduces cellulite and smooths out skin. My skin is softer and more even.</li>
            <li> The bristles are fairly soft and not too rough but the bristle bundles are far apart, meaning there is a lot of empty space between.  This prevents it from holding any soap suds for very long.  I use Dr. Bronners castile soap [[ASIN:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32 Ounce Bottle]] and this stuff suds up to a great foam and lasts forever!  But I find that I am using 3 times as much soap with this brush because it just doesn&#x27;t hold it.  The price was cheap and so I took the chance.  It is probably fine for dry brushing, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the shower.  Should&#x27;ve went ahead with Swissco [[ASIN:B000ROKSYC Swissco Birch Wood Bath Brush Boar Bristle 16\\&quot; (Large)]] or Bass [[ASIN:B00898EIAS Brush Deluxe Circular Handle 100% Boar Bristle Body Brush, Firm Bass Brushes 1]].</li>
            <li> I started dry brushing my skin for about a month now. It has done wonders for my skin. Cleared up the bumps on both upper arms and left my skin glowing. This brush is a perfect size for body brushing. The strap secures my hand in place and gives me better control of the brush. The bristles are just right to leave my skin fully invigorated and not sore. Dry brushing energizes my mood and benefits my skin. So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Just got this brush. It&#x27;s firm, but not too harsh on sensitive skin. I bought it to help deal with ingrown hair after epilating, and I&#x27;m sure it will do the trick. Unfortunately, even after the first use, some bristles are coming off.</li>
            <li> Description was accurate. Good quality for price. I have not had an issue with bristles falling out. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Works good. Not sure if it&#x27;s really taking of dead skin or not.</li>
            <li> The body brush didn&#x27;t take long to ship, and it was packaged well. The brush wasn&#x27;t too rough, and worked really well. The quality is amazing too!</li>
            <li> I started looking into dry brushing and was taken back by the prices of some of the brushes that I&#x27;ve come across. I got this brush, thinking that it would do just as fine without a handle and steep price tag, and it gets the job done. I&#x27;m rather flexible to I can reach my back just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is pretty big to me since I have small hands but it&#x27;s comfortable to hold. The bristles are not too hard, not too soft; just right and they smell pretty nice. I like the smell of dry natural bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice bristles ! Feels good.</li>
            <li> Bristles keep falling out.</li>
            <li> I read an article about the benefits of dry brushing, so I decided to buy this body brush. Initially, some of it&#x27;s bristles came off :( The bristles on my brush are irregular in length, as seen in the picture :/ I tried it and the bristles are too stiff for sensitive parts of my body. I&#x27;m giving it a one star for on time delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a well made brush and I use it alot. You can use it anywhere on your body, but it does the job and really cleans your skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great item for price! I like the size; it&#x27;s very maneuverable and easy to use, clean, etc. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This brush is too hard for me.  I do have sensitive skin and am looking for a much softer bristle brush.  I can&#x27;t use this one; it is much too hard for me.  The size and quality is great.  It would work for someone who prefers a firmer bristle.</li>
            <li> This brush is all you need of youre looking for a body brush.  Not too rough and hard. Nice and soft enough to enjoy the task of exfoliation</li>
            <li> I love using these body brushes, they are just the right size to fit in my hand and they&#x27;re not so hard that it hurts to use. I usually have 2 opened and ready to use, one for my feet and the other for the rest of me. I use body scrub on my feet daily and this brush is perfect for applying, whether I&#x27;m in the shower or bath!</li>
            <li> Good size. A little more abrasive that I prefer, but great for dry brushing none the less!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this body brush more than the one I already had (the one w/ the handle that kind of looks like a toilet bowl cleaner also sold on Amazon) but I just couldn&#x27;t. I suffer from keratosis pilaris and dry brushing really helps (along with in shower exfoliators &amp; serious moisturizing) and i found that the bristles on this brush were a little too soft. i REALLY prefer the stiffer ones of my older brush then again thats just me and might be because Ive been dry brushing for a while. I think this might be better for in shower use when wet in place of a loofah/wash cloth. I will however say that it is a natural bristle brush (which is important to me) so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great brush for exfoliating the skin. If it feels a little rough at first, just keep using it and it will break in.</li>
            <li> I bought this to drybrush my skin for exfoliation and cellulite reduction and it does a wonderful job. Doesn&#x27;t scratch like other brushes have.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks and it is still holding steady. Size wise it&#x27;s length it equivalent to that of my Mach III Razer + handle. Width wise I would say a deck of card.</li>
            <li> I have recently started dry brushing after hearing about the benefits. I decided to get this brush because it seemed nice and was a good price. It works very well for dry brushing. DO NOT get this brush wet though, it will make it smell weird until it completely dries.</li>
            <li> This body brush does exactly what I expected and has held up fantastically after much use! It is great at firming and exfoliating skin  and feels wonderful to use. Only thing that could be better is an adjustable strap, but overall it works great and is high quality.</li>
            <li> Great for body brushing.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing the skin</li>
            <li> you feel really like extra clean on your skin with this body brush. The bristles are very soft and takes soap very  nicely.</li>
            <li> I threw mine in the garbage! Don&#x27;t know why it smelt like a dead animal but it did. I even had to ask my hubby if I my smell was off and he said throw it in garbage! So I did.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> perfect body brush. Doesn&#x27;t slough off too much skin, but just enough to help get softer skin. I think this along with good exfoliation and moisturizing help sunless tanners look better.</li>
            <li> This brush works great, really softens the skin, as for helping with cellulite couldn&#x27;t tell you, I have only used it a week. I love it an would tell people to buy it. I don&#x27;t get things free or paid to give a good review, so I am being honest. Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry body brushing to help drain my lymphatic system, but mainly to get rid of some stretch marks, i havent been using the brush every day like i am supposed to but i have noticed some improvement, so im sure that if i was using this daily i would have better results. the bristles feel a little rough at first but you do get used to it after a couple of uses. and also it causes me to itch when i start showering but then i found out it was because i was using hot water, and ever since i dont use it so hot i dont have this problem any more. so over all i do like the product.</li>
            <li> It works great, but quite a few of the bristles came out on the first few uses, so I would stand in the shower to catch the bristles so I did not have to sweep after using it. It is simple and does the job.</li>
            <li> This does what I bought it to do. I find my skin stays clearer when I use a good abrasive scrub every morning. This is definitely abrasive, not to the point that it is painful, but it&#x27;s definitely uncomfortable. That is unfortunately what I need though.</li>
            <li> Love this natural body brush to use during shower time to exfoliate my skin, after drying off and applying lotion my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> So small, it is almost microscopic. Yet another product made in China that is not fir for purpose. Save your time and money.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect tool for dry brushing.  I love it and would highly recommend it to other.  The size, texture of the bristles and the design is more than you can ask for.  This is my second order.</li>
            <li> I sought a dry brush to help wake me up in the morning -- and it works. The bristles really get the blood flowing and perk me up. My only complaint is that the strap is a bit large for me, but I have very small hands so I don&#x27;t expect that&#x27;d be much of a problem for most folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Just bought a second one for my hubby, since he loves it so much too!</li>
            <li> It really works well as a skin brush. Very soothing. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care, but now I&#x27;ve found that it actually would be kind of nice to have a longer handle on it to reach my back. But still, I love it, especially for the price/quality ratio. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I had been reading up on the benefits of dry brushing. I was so happy when I found this brush! It was a steal! The bristles are perfect, not too hard and not too soft. And its good quality craftsmanship too. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I do not use this as often as I should.  It&#x27;s great for exfoliation and makes my skin very soft.  I use it before applying self tanner and it really aids in a better application of the tanner.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds bristles quickly.</li>
            <li> takes some getting used to</li>
            <li> I received this brush fairly quickly in the mail and it was packaged well.  The brush itself has a strap across the back to slide your hand in.  This strap is slightly big but does not matter to me.  The quality of the brush is great and the brush works as expected.  I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in buying a dry brush.</li>
            <li> my last brush lasted about a year, i really thought the wood would give out, but it was the plastic that cracked and released the hairs. when using the brush i found that i get these little itchy bumps after. i think the stock they use, pokes into my skin or something. otherwise it works well enough, the strap makes it possible to hold, and it makes a nice lather, its not too stiff, but they fall apart after some time. i&#x27;m on my second, it&#x27;s cheap though a couple of bucks, it&#x27;s not worth much more. if there was no plastic and the bristles were in the wood - it would last so much longer, so i think it&#x27;s just designed to fail.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This body brush makes me feel so clean after a long day in a hot shower. Many my skin is sooo soft and I feel so clean and relaxed, This is the best thing I ever invested in. I may just buy more fir Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Its a good brush, if you like really hard brush but personally I dont like it for this reason as it really hurts when trying to use it. I have had it for 3 weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t softened yet. Maybe with more frequent use, it might soften up a little. The rough bristles make it very hard to use on soft skin like the arms and legs. I cant gather the courage to use it for more than few seconds, which is why I gave it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/17/2012&lt;br /&gt;I am updating this review as after finally getting myself to use it 2-3 times a week, I have realized the bristles have gotten softer and maybe I have gotten accustomed to them...but either way now it doesnt seem that painful to use it and I am actually loving this now.</li>
            <li> Simple product - Item was as expected and shipped quickly. Would purchase through them again</li>
            <li> I use this to scrub my face and neck while showering. It has strong bristles but doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive skin red. Great brush.</li>
            <li> First time I have used a body brush.  It feels good on my skin...and is making my skin smoother.  I brush before I&lt;br /&gt;shower and it feels good!</li>
            <li> I use this brush regular and it does wake up my skin and gets the blood flowing. Adjust the pressure to your personal liking, it takes all the dead skin off and lets lotion soak in nice and easy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think for under $4 I would be getting a quality brush. The bristles are fixed in a plastic base, which does not mold or mildew like some of the wood ones. It&#x27;s the perfect firmness for your entire body. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like this brush as it does allow me to get a good grip and the bristles aren&#x27;t so soft or spaced out that I can&#x27;t get a good scrub.  I can control the level of exfoliation easily by simply adding or removing pressure and the handle allows for a good grip.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush; I use it for dry brushing in the morning. I&#x27;ve had it for about six months, using it most days. The bristles are still nice and stiff, and firmly attached to the brush, so it seems to be good quality. I like the strap that is attached on the back. There is no handle, but I&#x27;ve never found a reason for it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Bristles are not too hard but are still strong and do an excellent job of dry brushing.  The cotton like strap for your hand is nice to have and helpful.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, like any brush you can buy in any store. I use it for enhancing circulation in my legs, and performs the job well.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time to get rid of my dry skin and it does the job well! I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good product and fun to use.</li>
            <li> This brush is great!! I have sensitive skin so I was worried it was going to be too hard on me but I found its perfect and I can press harder on certain areas of my body. Over time the bristles become a bit softer from what another review said for extremely sensitive skin but I&#x27;m really sensitive and this is perfect! I dry brush my skin before I get in the shower for detox (I have Lyme disease) I&#x27;ll be ordering again in the future when I need a new one but this will last a long time! I love it!</li>
            <li> Product just as described</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last a month. Delivered on the 5th of April and it is worn out by the 30th. Don&#x27;t waste you money. I decided to try it out, but should of stayed with aYerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush that can be used with a handle or without. Without a doubt, it is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Fantasea Natural Bristle Body Brush, 3.5 Ounce.  Perfect amount of rigidity for the skin. Not to harsh and abrasive.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strap as shown which makes you hang onto it so you don&#x27;t drop it.  Getting to your back is a challenge as well.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing for lymphatic stimulation.  Use it before your shower for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Was put off by the size at first ( smaller than my other dry brush) but turns out it is perfect.  Easier to brush knees/ elbows etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a while now, bought it as a replacement for a similar one I found at TJ Maxx that got old. Unfortunately the bristles are a bit too stiff for dry brushing or for me using in the shower on skin with soap. Ive been using on my feet in the shower since I can take a rougher feel there, hoping to soften bristles some but after a few weeks, its still the same. That could be a good thing for some, but not me, its too rough to use on my body, so I use it as a foot brush instead. :/</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most high quality brush in the world, but I use it to dry brush my legs before a shower and it works very well! I love the size and the feel.</li>
            <li> Bristles seem very still and irritating, and when this brush got wet my whole shower smelled like a locker room the next day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about with this product is that when it is damp - it smells damp. I wash it with shampoo about twice a week, but it is hastle.&lt;br /&gt;I scrub myself down with it before every shower, yes dry. It is uncomfortable, but doesn&#x27;t hurt. It is kind of like a korean scrub. It makes my skin soft, and used with firming lotion, definitely helps in that area too.&lt;br /&gt;The size, handle, and price are all on point.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a brush I use for dry brushing, but I use this as a wet and dry brush! Excellent exfoliation! Great bristles, Good handle and feel. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this is perfect for dry brushing, like the strap, and the bristles are the perfect texture (not too hard, not to soft to be effective) will buy a few more just so I have one for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> AWESOME product and very satisfied</li>
            <li> Bristles are VERY rough. Expect them to be that way when you buy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s thinner and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It looked used and it was out of its wrapper before I opened it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my skin delicate or over sensitive but this brush is way too rough for me to use for dry brushing</li>
            <li> The body brush is soft but some of the brissels come out. The price is good.</li>
            <li> I had heard about dry bushing one&#x27;s skin to promote healthy blood flow and reduce cellulite, well I&#x27;ve found that to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caution I would have is that it took me using the product a couple of times to get my skin used to the sensation. In addition, I wish the handle on the brush was adjustable...i have smaller hands so the only way to use it is by having a nice grip on the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for skin brushing and it&#x27;s exactly the bristles I was looking for! Have not noticed any bristles falling out, but keep in mind I don&#x27;t use this for bathing just skin brushing</li>
            <li> Found out the use for this to try is Dry Brushing! Before getting into the shower use this brush to increase circulation and remove dead skin. That makes shower time less!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd brush I order (my dog ate the first 2), the first 2 seemed natural, now the 3rd one not at all. The hair of the brush feels like plastic, nothing like the first 2 I had.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself and my husband.We are detoxing and this brush was needed to dry brush dead skin to leave our body feeling refresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> I really liked this body brush! I bought it for skin brushing, to remove dead skin cells for fresh smooth skin. It worked like a charm. The bristles did take a while to get used to, but once you do you will fall in love with skin brushing!</li>
            <li> I practically refuse to use anything but a good brush for my skin. Brushing the skin seems to have far more benefits than just sloughing off dead skins cells. And it makes my skin feel better. I notice a definite difference when I&#x27;m using the brush versus a rag or sponge. Or my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. Always have. Other brushes I tried were just too rough and the bristles never softened. I want to exfoliate and strengthen my skin. Not torture it. But this brush has never irritated my skin. I do far more damage by scratching an itchy spot with my fingers. At first, it can be a bit uncomfortable while the skin adjusts. But mine adjusted to this very quickly. It is strongly made. After months of use, mine has not lost any bristles. The wood hasn&#x27;t cracked in any way, shape or form, and the strong canvas cloth handle is still as firmly attached and functional as it was straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> The bristles are softer then I&#x27;d hoped for, but it still works well and gets skin smooth.  I love that it straps on your hand</li>
            <li> Its not super pretty or fancy......It gets the job done....Its easy to use and I find it a very good cleansing device...I would recommend</li>
            <li> Great for the price, has been holding up &amp; working well!</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel. I use it wet in the shower and it feels like it sloughs off so much dead skin. It does take a little while to get used to since it&#x27;s so rough.</li>
            <li> Recently started body brushing. This brush leaves my skin soft and glowing. Very satisfied with this product. My boyfriend even said that he has never felt skin this soft. He can&#x27;t keep his hands off me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hard as you would think.  The body brush does get rid of all the dry skin that&#x27;s left from being outdoors.</li>
            <li> I wanted a body brush for my son who has excema so I got this.&lt;br /&gt;It did come on time, but the package was all broke when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is so rough and the bristles fall out so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not at all happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a week in the shower skin feels great every time after using it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for its purpose.  It&#x27;s not so stiff that I can&#x27;t use it, which is always a danger because I have ridiculously sensitive skin, but it is stiff enough to do what it is supposed to.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, as well.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin but I bought this after purchasing a different version that was way too scratchy. This one provides the amount of abrasion I would expect without leaving scratches in  my skin</li>
            <li> Its very handy like literally, if your a female it fits from the tip of your middle finger to the end of the palm of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and its not too hard against your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to start reviewing things. Bare-bones style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is serving massage realness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles aren&#x27;t too soft, nor too strong. A little slice of heaven in the shower.</li>
            <li> good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Having heard that dry brushing is good for the lymphatic system, I decided to give it a try. This is a good brush with nice soft bristles and a good grip. Now the hard part is making myself brush every day.</li>
            <li> This item arrived well packaged in a USPS First Class Mail bubbled envelope, inside it was in a medium-thick plastic bag (lots of waste already). This is clearly a straight-from-a-warehouse in China purchase. It had an extremely strong toxic scent, its bristles starting falling out as soon as I removed it from its packaging. The bristles themselves are undoubtedly 100% plastic, there is NOTHING natural about this product. The bristles sit embedded in a hard plastic base, which is glued to a wood slab. There is a large-loose handle that only a giant could appropriately use to brush their body. The item as a whole is poor in quality, has many nicks and scratches, has lots of plastic, and smells very bad. I would not use this on my body, for anyone looking for a holistic/natural/organic product - look elsewhere. It is this cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this brush! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in dry body brushing.</li>
            <li> I first heard about body brushing on the Bethany tv show. She said use it before you shower on dry skin and keep the brush dry. She said to start at your feet and brush upwards in short strokes towards your heart. My skin is already soft even before using this brush so I don&#x27;t know if it is making it softer. But I do know it feels incredibly good and gets rid of all the itchies on my skin. I use it on my entire body except face. Not painful and brush is perfect firmness, not too firm.</li>
            <li> Used it for dry brushing. I love it!! Works like a dream and its durable. I&#x27;m ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I have just begun dry brushing but I really like this brush. When I first took it out of the package and felt the bristles with my hand, it felt a little stiff. But when I used it on my body, it wasn&#x27;t at all. I think if it was too soft it wouldn&#x27;t serve its purpose of removing dead skin and stimulating circulation. It is the right level of stiffness for me, and I would definitely recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really love all the natural bristles on this brush!  The elastic strap holds it security in your hand.  Great!</li>
            <li> this is not what i thought it was......it&#x27;s more for exfoliating you... i needed it for my bad cellulite lol</li>
            <li> I like it dont love it. Lol</li>
            <li> This is a great body brush and can be used for dry brushing or just to wash your body with.</li>
            <li> Great price. Not too stiff but perfect for dry skin brushing. Invigorating. Handles seem attached well. The wood is smooth and highly polished. These are a great value.</li>
            <li> Use this on dry skin before you get in the shower, and your skin will feel so smooth after. It can feel a little abrasive at first, but I only use it on my legs and elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to use this before showering but I used mine in the shower and yuck! It smelled very strongly - similar to a &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; smell. I tried to remember to use it before the shower and couldn&#x27;t remember to do it. So I gave it away. It probably works well for what it is intended, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Works great as a dry skin brush for my face and neck.  Perfect texture.</li>
            <li> Used daily and is the best body brush that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> First time skin brusher.  Has changed my life.  It feels so good.  I dropped about a pound of dead skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft. It is kind of rough but that&#x27;s what I would expect from a body scrubbing brush. Good quality. I have not noticed any bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> this is definitely not a brush for the face or other delicate skin areas.  It is exactly what I wanted, as I wanted to do some light brushing of my legs and arms in the shower, without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> Good brush, easy to hold and seems to be made well. Now I just have to be more religious about actually doing the dry brushing thing.</li>
            <li> Great all around brush in the shower!</li>
            <li> This is a good brush. I use it for cellulite and although I don&#x27;t know if it works, it is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times so far.  Based on some researching I&#x27;ve done it is recommended to use this once a week to get dead skin off but I could be wrong. Nonetheless I have found it to work for me as I feel my skin is softer. Especially my neck area, it tends to get itchy and I think it&#x27;s because of excess dead skin. I find that when I skip on using it my skin becomes itchy all over and I noticed way more dead skin flakes in my bed after waking up. The handle works so far for me, it hasn&#x27;t stretched out and makes it easy to hold onto. The bristles are soft but firm.</li>
            <li> Feels great and exfoliated really well! Just wish the strap was available in a more feminine fit and it rinsed out a little easier.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for dry brushing my skin to help with lymphedema.  It has the right softness in the bristles, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It fits my hand well, and the band keeps it in place while I use it.</li>
            <li> Love the hardness to it, I use it for dry and wet brushing and my skin has never been softer and shinier. Fully recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it does have a strong odor at first, but after 2-3 washes, the odor is gone.</li>
            <li> Really works great, do it everyday, follow up with Nivea body firming lotion, you will see a different texture in your skin. Excercise, lots of water is also a part of your beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> its a little bit stiff, i personally like it but probably others would not. its very good for exfoliating. after a couple months of use it has not lost its stiffness. i have not had any bristles fall out either.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product.  This product was too rough for my skin.  When I used it to brush off the dry skin, it dug holes into my skin.  Maybe I&#x27;m delicate but I did not apply a lot of pressure.  Buyer beware if your skin cannot handle rough bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles were too soft for dry skin brushing.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Just as expected! Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 brushes. Very pleased with the quality. I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes at Bed, Bath and Beyond, Target, and a long time ago at Bath and Body. However, these stores no longer carry body brushes. I feel fortunate to have found a new supplier. Order arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I really love using this brush!  It is the perfect amount of stiffness for a beginner at dry brushing like I am.  I have health issues that cause my lymphatic system to get backed up and I get swollen glands.  This is making a difference for me and it is enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> bristles fell out during every use and i personally think it&#x27;s too small, and i have little hands.</li>
            <li> I dry brush at least three times a week to promote lymphatic flow. This brush does the job. It has firm but not rough bristles. The handle is well attached and it is easy to use. The bristles are soft enough to use on my little ones with a gentle touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to scrub my legs because I had a bad case of the &amp;#34;strawberry legs&amp;#34; ever since I purchased this brush I noticed amazing results and the black dots/pores slowly start to decrease in size as well as fade. I am very satisfied with this product however I gave it a four star rating because the bristles tend to shed, the strap is a little loose so my hand will slip right out , as well as sometimes they feel like they&#x27;re too soft but it also depends on how you are scrubbing. Needless to say I would recommend it is a great hand brush.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush, I use it for dry brushing. Wish the brisels were a bit firmer. But good brush overall.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, though it does shed a tiny bit, but all natural brushes shed. I use it for dry brushing before my daily or twice a day showers because I&#x27;ve read about the benefits of dry brushing everywhere on the web. I love glowy skin, so we&#x27;ll see how much this helps!</li>
            <li> arrived with one of the sides of the strap halfway removed from the bottom of the bristles &amp; quite a few of the bristles fell off at the first use.</li>
            <li> These natural bristle body brushes can go for up to $40 in a spa. I am very happy with the quality of this brush and the price!</li>
            <li> The brush itself is decent and well-made.  However, I got this to use for dry brushing to help with cellulite, and it hasn&#x27;t made any difference.  It is good for exfoliating though.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating brush. Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and heard no complaints and got it at a great price.</li>
            <li> great for exfoliation. inexpensive but decent quality.</li>
            <li> Good size and the bristles are firm but not too scratchy.  I was worried it would be really rough.  Also, it fits nicely into my hands and I have arthritis in both hands and can still use this easily.</li>
            <li> This product is great makes skin super soft and removes cellular.</li>
            <li> This was for wife but what can you say about a body brush? Have no complaints so must work.</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristles. Sheds a little bit..and I don&#x27;t like the smell. I use it for dry body brushing before a bath!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a dry body brush which it is perfect for. (Not to harsh on the skin) granted I&#x27;ve only used 7+ times and I bought it a month ago But so far I&#x27;m rather pleased...i gave 4 stars cause the rope like strap thing was a bit long for me so I don&#x27;t use it I just grab around the brush to use</li>
            <li> I have bought more than one of these, 2 for me (1 for each bathroom), and more for gifts, all well received.  Mild bristled brush perfect for light exfoliation and just generalized body cleansing more effective than a washcloth.  One step up would be the Kingsley Sisal Body Brush ($7.99 Amazon.com for Prime members free shipping).  One step down would be a rough washcloth.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for dry brushing before I shower. Works great and the strap is perfect.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, the bristles did fall out as other users had mentions. But after removing the loose ones, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  Perfect firmness. Rough enough to do it job, but not to the point it hurts. My skin feels MUCH softer post shower and I&#x27;m looking forward to the circulatory benefits that come along with dry brushing as well.</li>
            <li> well made &amp; great price</li>
            <li> It cleans well except private parts, that you need a washcloth. The bristle are not the softest,kinda scratch a little, but gets into pores good.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Spas want to charge over $20 for similar body brushes.  Really love it. I can see the dry skin brushing away, but it&#x27;s still genle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a body brush. It&#x27;s ever-so-slightly rougher than I&#x27;d like, but it gets the job done. However, my husband has discovered a second use for it—combing his beard. It works well for getting it to lay nice and neatly, with all the hairs going the same direction.</li>
            <li> Excellent body brush but why are they so overpriced here?  Do a internet search and you&#x27;ll find them for cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I like that brush for every day use .Its not very soft or neither very hard and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> About 10% of the bristles have fallen out which was a bit of a surprise but after a few uses seems to have stopped and there are enough left to do the job.</li>
            <li> I use this to dry brush my body...feels good and is great for exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I bought this product because it was so inexpensive (it&#x27;s less than $2.00 now!) and I really expected it to be poorly made, or made of plastic.  I was shocked when this brush arrived, it&#x27;s a nice wooden brush with a strong canvas-type material handle, and the bristles are soft enough to use on your face!  It&#x27;s so nice, I don&#x27;t really need another one, but since it&#x27;s so cheap I&#x27;m buying another one anyway and I&#x27;ll tuck it away for the future!  Oh, this seller did take a very long time to ship though.  I think my order took almost 2 weeks.  I wish it was sold by Amazon directly.  But otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great brush, has nice balance between stiffness and softness, and you can work up a decent lather with it and its at a good price. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might take a few days to get used to if you&#x27;re used to soft sponges though.</li>
            <li> Initially bought this as an exfoliating brush to use while in the shower, and it worked wonderfully for that. Then I did some reading and found out about dry brushing. I was thrilled to find out this brush would work perfectly for just that. I used it after it was dry and LOVED it! It&#x27;s a great multi-purpose brush and I would recommend it wet or dry!</li>
            <li> The brush is not bad. It doesn&#x27;t hurt on the skin. It works for me! I mainly use it before my Finulite cream to get rid of any dirt.</li>
            <li> great brush....great price.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I immediately felt the difference in my skin and even my husband noticed right away. I am buying another as a Christmas gift for my mom so I would definately recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little harsh on the face so I use it gently maybe once a week.</li>
            <li> Really rough bristles.</li>
            <li> this brush was too rough for the shower... I use it as a dry brush for sloughing dry skin - works well. Good Quality.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than it looks in picture and when I using it I realized it was too rough.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a brush like this one.I tried a lot on the market and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> The handle is handy, it&#x27;s the perfect size and shape, and it is just the right firmness. On top of that, the price was right. Overall very pleased. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try out dry brushing. Of course, because I wanted to try it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something that may or may not work. This brush is great! It&#x27;s small oval shape makes it easy to grip and the bristles seem to be strongly stuck in place. The cloth band is a bit large over my hand, but I don&#x27;t always use it. I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily since it arrived and my skin has become soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This body brush is excellent quality. With most brushes the bristles are too stiff for my skin but after using this a few times it&#x27;s very comfortable to use. I got it to help increase blood circulation in my legs and feet by brushing from my feet up in an upward motion since my feet were beginning to swell often from the amount of time I have to spend working at my computer. This has worked wonders and my feet don&#x27;t swell anymore. I bought two and keep one for dry use and the other in the shower. Works great for skin exfoliation too!</li>
            <li> Good bristles for dry brushing and easier to use than many brushes . I wish it was a little harsher but most reviews say the opposite so if you dry brush and want a softer bristle , this is for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is helping...but I really do love using this dry brush.  I just dry rub my body before I get in the shower. Takes about a minute and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to got through the hassle of sending it back, but the base glue that holds the bristles is cracked.  Still works, but I have to make extra sure to clean the cracks.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and very coarse hair due to an endocrine disorder.. My hair grows in crazy directions and causes shave bumps and doesn&#x27;t leave my legs soft to the touch. I use a skin brush daily at night, apply moisturizer and sleep. In the morning when I shave my legs are so smooth. Even after a day or two of not shaving, my legs still feel better. so happy!</li>
            <li> Nice. Easy to use. A the bristles are software than my other brush that I use for dry brushing. Overall thought a decent product.</li>
            <li> My newest beauty regime is dry skin brushing and this is a great addition to my other brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer and harder than other body brushes I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect for dry skin brushing to exfoliate and tone.  I recommend it, thank you!</li>
            <li> wish it were more secure in my hand; the strape is too lose, but other than that, i&#x27;m happy i ordered it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use as a &amp;#34;dry brush&amp;#34;.  This is a technique where you vigorously brush your skin BEFORE getting into the shower, in large, firm, circular strokes.  You loosen dead skin sells and promote new cell growth through stimulation.  Dry brushing is also considered a way to &amp;#34;break up&amp;#34; cellulite.  This brush is soft enough to not irritate but firm enough to do the job,  and the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after i stopped going into tanning beds to exfoliate my skin before using fake tan. After the first use, i noticed bristles shedding, but i didnt think anything of it. But after the second and third, the bristles were coming out in LARGE quantities. I knew it wasnt because i was being too rough with it or anything like that. Its just an EXTREMELY cheap exfoliator brush. Dont waste your money, buy something a little more expensive for the better quality!</li>
            <li> not good, cracked after a week and the brushes started to fall off. i was disapointed. waste of money. wo</li>
            <li> Good quality, firm bristles, convenient handle strap for ease of use.  Good price.  Great for dry brushing or for use in the shower with shower gel.  Helps increase circulation and remove dead skin for a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to hold and is perfect for use in the shower--not too soft and not too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Got this to help with cellulite. It really does work if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve owned. Soft but exfoliates! Buying another!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for the price.Thank yoU!</li>
            <li> I bought this to start a dry brushing routine for my skin a few months ago and I&#x27;m happy with the results. My skin looks and feels so much better. I&#x27;m even using less lotion, which is rare for me this time of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets about purchasing this brush, and I hope this seller continues to stock this item.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and clean and it dries over night after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re starting a dry brushing routine, I would recommend this one (unless you have issues reaching your back, or bending over and need a brush with a handle).</li>
            <li> I wanted a body brush that was firm enough to exfoliate my skin, yet not so firm that it made me bleed. LOL ... This product did the trick and I am happy with it. Good quality. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love that the bristles are natural and that the handle is made of solid wood.  The bristles are a bit soft, but suitable for my needs.  Strap Fits Comfortably.  Handles well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Haven&#x27;t had any problems with losing bristles or the strap coming off as some others have reported - perhaps because I don&#x27;t use it very often.  But I suppose that can be expected over time with any brush.</li>
            <li> Really cheaply manufactured.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Due to the chemical smell coming off of it, I would definitely not put this on my body.  Thankfully, Amazon took them back.</li>
            <li> perfect nice strong bristles! i have purchased so many brushes and most of them fall flat ( literally) ... this one is the keeper! It gives a nice exfoliation and leaves your skin feeling great!!!</li>
            <li> bristles are course and fall out with every use. this feels like it was not intended for human skin. More likely it&#x27;s for your pet alligator or to remove old paint from furniture.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this small and simple brush. I do wish the company would clearly state what material the bristles are made of, but I assume that if they were boar bristles, the cost would be significantly higher. The size is perfect for my hand, and the cost is very acceptable.</li>
            <li> Held up well, feels great!</li>
            <li> I purchased these body brushes for the purpose of exfoliation.  Some sources suggest there are other benefits to body brushing, but I can&#x27;t quite find anything solid on these other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the fantasea brush for some $3-4 and the elemis, regarded as the best body brush by one review (found via google), which cost me $36.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes come as brush heads with a wooden backing and strap for an easy grip, but the elemis comes with a detachable handle, which would be useful for brushing the back and other hard-to-reach places.  The elemis also seems to be of better quality, as the fantasea lost its bristles on the first day, whereas the elemis stayed intact.  The elemis is also stiffer, which may mean it makes a better exfoliation tool, but I find that I enjoy the feel of the fantasea brush more.  The fantasea seems to be hard enough to brush off dead skin cells (and I could see the white dust coming off and feel my skin becoming smoother), but soft enough to feel enjoyable and more like a massage than a desperate attempt to scratch off dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I prefer the fantasea as it does the job of exfoliating and is more enjoyable.  It might wear down faster than the elemis and it comes without a handle, but I think the much cheaper price makes up for it.  Four stars because it seems less durable (bristles came out the first time brushing).</li>
            <li> Great product and just the size I need to get the job done. I use this brush to stimulate my skin before applying an It Works Ultimate Body Applicator and it really intensify the results!</li>
            <li> good brush to get started with a dry brushing routine. I would prefer the bristles to be a little more stiff, but it is doing its job.  Using it for 5-10min each night before showering. Its been 7 days and my skin is already noticibly softer. Will eventually get a stiffer brush, as my skin is not sensitive. Do some research about the benefits of dry brushing!</li>
            <li> my husband glides this brush over my back -is very relaxing and soothing and also eases itchiness!  this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and have been using it for a while although I will be replacing it soon.  Every time I get out of the shower after using this, about 15 minutes later I start to itch all over for about 10-20 minutes.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the effect of exfoliation or if it is an allergic reaction.  Bristles are also very coarse and rough. I much prefer my Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush, it is much softer and does not cause itching.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from eczema, I highly recommend dry brushing! I&#x27;ve had a patch of skin on the inside of my elbow for months that was always raised and red, and would be itchy on and off. But after dry brushing it is almost totally gone! It&#x27;s still only a little red but it&#x27;s not raised anymore and almost never itchy there.  I try to dry brush every other day. But sometimes I have little flareups on my body when I&#x27;m lazy or I forget to dry brush but when I start to feel it coming I dry brush for the next two days and it&#x27;s so much better by then. Of course this might or might not work for your skin type but I just wanted to put my experience out there and how well it worked for me!  This brush is great for dry brushing. I&#x27;m not sure how well it works when wet though. The brush is stiff when you first get it out of the package. I recommend running it under warm water and rubbing the fibers back and forth with your hand and washing it with a body soap, then rub the bristles back and forth some more under the warm water to wash the soap out. Let it dry overnight and it&#x27;ll be a bit softer by then.  I also bought this brush twice from different sellers and the bristles were of a slightly different softness/harshness, so there is a variance with that. If your brush is still too harsh, you might want to wash it a couple more times under warm/hot water.</li>
            <li> I use this brush right after I shower to give my skin some good circulation. It is a nice brush and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve had many wooden brushes not hold well in the past, but the awesome reviews got me to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the craftsmanship is great, there&#x27;s a rubbery base between the bristles and the wood that protects the bristles and blocks out water to keep the wood damage- free. The brush itself is perfect for body brushing. The bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft, providing great exfoliation without too much irritation. I use the brush before I shower on dry skin to remove dead skin cells, increase blood circulation, and battle against cellulite. So far it&#x27;s done great! My boyfriend even commented that my skin looked and felt very smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough. The handle helps to hold this small brush that fits in my rather small hand.</li>
            <li> I used to have something similar but on a large wooden handle.  I actually like this one better as its easier to control and move around on my body.</li>
            <li> not to hard or soft and works well for dry brushing and wet brushing, just be sure to hang somewhere to dry after</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price - this is great for skin brushing and easy to hold onto!  You won&#x27;t be sorry - the strap is nice to keep it attached to your hand as you move around your arms, legs, etc.  Just the right size.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft. I&#x27;ve tried using it several times, but it does not do anything. Came in a cheap plastic wrapping too and is poorly packaged which caused some of the bristles to bend. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush to try dry skin brushing.  It works excellent and is just what I wanted.  Good product!</li>
            <li> Good for scratching itchy patches. But it leaves fibers all over your body which then continue to itch you and make you paranoid of finding more fibers on yourself.</li>
            <li> At first I bought this as a dry skin brush, but i&#x27;m to lazy to do it every day so it became my bath brush..kekeke&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not to rough and none of the bristle has fallen out and the wood hasn&#x27;t chipped at all. It makes a good bath brush.</li>
            <li> I received this brush last week and have beend using ot routinely ever night before bed. And my skin is super soft and healthy looking. Only 7 days and I can see an improvement! Loving this!</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower, wet.  Does a good job of scrubbing my less sensitive skin (legs and arms mostly).  I like that the bristles are placed in plastic, that helps the water from ruining the brush as quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this brush....it is easy to slip over your hand and dry brush your skin for a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The brush was not as soft as I had expected but  I still enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> great for dry brushing and the price was awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get in on the dry brushing craze, and so far it lives up to it&#x27;s reputation. I like that it is a natural bristle, which is what you want in a dry brush. It is sturdy and holds up, but the grip for me is not as easy with the band over my hand... I feel like it slides around more that way with my hand flat against it, so I typically forgo it and just hold it gripped in my hand. It&#x27;s been a nice addition to the beauty routine. You can look up diagrams online of how to properly brush for lymph drainage all over your body. There are a few different methods I have found, so see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super soft, but definitely comfortable.  I didn&#x27;t see much change in my legs appearance after using it, but it definitely gets the blood flowing and feels really good.</li>
            <li> This brush fits well in my hand.  The bristles have just the right degree of stiffness to remove dry skin without being too scratchy.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It literally sloughs off a layer of dead skin. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth. After I dry brush, I like to shower and then apply a thin layer of coconut oil. It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> I got into dry brushing several months ago. I had just started epilating and I read that dry brushing helps prevent ingrown hairs. Going into it with this expectation alone, I was highly surprised and pleased with how many benefits I achieve from dry brushing. My skin feels so much softer and looks healthier, especially now during the winter months. Brushing in the morning before I shower makes me feel so awake and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two brushes and this is the softer of the two but it is still plenty stiff. I find it to be a bit too stiff for my face/neck area but it&#x27;s perfect for more sensitive areas like my midsection and upper arms. I use a stiffer brush for my lower arms, legs and feet. I love the shape of this brush and the strap makes it easy to keep in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, not too stiff.</li>
            <li> This product is worth what you paid for. It does shed a little but it was for a cheap price. There is a little band on the back of it to hold it when you are doing what ever you bought it for. The brush is kinda rough so being careful is advised. I bought this as an exfoliating body brush and I love it, it gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the girlfriend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine brush for the body. I kind of wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so easily manipulated. Nothing special</li>
            <li> I use this brush for dry brushing.  It works so well!  The strap on the back makes it easy to hook my hand into it and not drop it while I&#x27;m brushing.  The bristles are just firm enough to really be invigorating without hurting my skin or irritating it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice body brush, good for exfoliating, not too harsh on your skin but it definitely gets the blood moving.  So far I haven&#x27;t lost many bristles, time will tell how it holds up, but for the money it seems a very good brush.  I&#x27;ll have to see how often I use it, to see if it will be worth replacing.  I  like the strap so that I can hang it on a hook in my shower.</li>
            <li> Upon the second time of using the bristles started falling out.  The ones remaining are nice to use, but I am afraid to use it as directed that more bristles will just keep falling out.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for....bristles on brush are firm enough to scrub well, but not too hard that you&#x27;ll hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush! Hurray!</li>
            <li> Ouch. This brush is so prickly that I can&#x27;t even use it on my skin. It is now officially a dog brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Perfect for dry brushing which I am now totally addicted to doing before bed.</li>
            <li> Writing this for my wife. She&#x27;s convinced brushing your cellulite areas with this helps get rid of cellulite. Here I was thinking this was just good for a nice deep scrubbing. Nope, after a month of use her legs are surely losing whatever cottage cheese was there. Amazing.</li>
            <li> great brush i keep in the shower.  is holding up very well - bristles are not falling out like on other brands i have used.  i use it with a creme body wash.  dries out during the day and does not smell mildewy.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day before I get in the shower and it feels really good. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m getting all the wild results that some people claim with dry brushing- The little dimples on the backs of my legs are still there, but my ankles do look a little smaller, so I think if anything, it&#x27;s helping my circulation.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my sister…but then I realized I needed one as well…so I kept if for myself</li>
            <li> Good price, bristles are just the right soft/hardness. The elastic seems sturdy.  I definitely recommend. Body feels amazing after a scrub. I keep it dry and out of the shower to avoid mold.</li>
            <li> I use this to scrub my scalp and it is very comfortable. A crack has developed in the wooden body. So, I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but considering the price, I&#x27;m not overly concerned about this. I&#x27;m just glad to find a brush I can use on my scalp without feeling like the skin is being rubbed off, but still getting a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower and it really nice.  Not too rough and not too soft...just right for my skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is very nice. I am glad that I have purchased 2 brushes. The bristles are not very soft, so you can brush off all your dead skin from your back. Love it.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job when it comes to exfoliating my skin. I barely press on my skin though because I am not trying to tear my skin off!&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush on my legs before I shave and also on the rest of my body when I am wanting to apply my self tanner.  I will buy this brush again when this one needs to be replaced. Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This body brush works great and is easy to hold. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a new skin brush.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry brushing - before I shower I massage my body with upward, large, circular movements. It increases circulation, exfoliates dead skin, and &#x27;smoothes&#x27; cellulite. The brush is harsh enough to ensure a vigorous massage, but soft enough not to irritate my sensitive skin. It is also a comfortable size to hold.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower, and while the bristles are good (sturdy, but not scratchy), the hand strap (instead of a handle) make it difficult to use all over the body. You can&#x27;t get your back, but that is fine if you just want something to scrub your arms and legs while  in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this with a moisturizing body wash, it leaves your skin feeling pleasantly refreshed.</li>
            <li> I got this to do dry brushing.  It does smell funny when you first take it out (I think its the wood treatment).  But after a day ofleaving it out, it doesn&#x27;t smell.  The brush is soft enough to not grate my skin (and I usually have SENSITIVE skin).  It is firm enough to use for dry brushing for lymph and exfoliation.  A few bristles came out but not much.  So glad I purchased it.  Why spend more?</li>
            <li> Good quality, great price. Use for dry skin brushing. Coarse, but not too much so. Bought three - one for myself and two friends. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not too hard, not too soft - just right.  Easy to soap up and rinse off.  Great for scrubbing your body and getting the grime out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Super happy! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of scrub brushes - with and without handles, different materials, etc.  So far, this has been my favorite.  The cloth/fiber strap prevents slippage and the shape is comfortable for my hand - two problems with my previous favorite from Body Shop.  The bristles give a vigorous exfoliation without tearing up my skin, but this could maybe be a bit much for someone with really sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months, I have had no mold growth, no wood cracks, or bristles shedding.  The one minor issue was a bit of plastic base chipped off when I dropped it, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this brush because it&#x27;s made in China.  But now that I have it... I LOVE it so much!  I look forward to each time I use it.  I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s just a hair shy of being too rough... it is absolutely PERFECT to get the blood flowing without scraping yourself up!  I am going to buy a couple more to keep on hand in case I can&#x27;t find this anymore.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this brush!  Not too hard or soft!  This is a great addition to my bath supplies!  My kids are always coloring on themselves and this is how I get the ink off!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Started body brushing about 2 weeks ago and this brush is the perfect brush for the job.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> this item arrived with other ordered items and the way it was packaged completely smashed all of the bristles - who ever packed it ruined it and it&#x27;s honestly too inexpensive to bother with shipping it back - completely annoyed, should have gone to bed bath and beyond.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for several months now and have been very happy to see that the bristles have held together and it hasn&#x27;t gotten gross or moldy being stored in the shower. It works great for exfoliating and is gentler than other brushes which are rather coarse.</li>
            <li> I am most pleased with the body brush.  It is a good quality brush, which is very gentle to the skin..</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but sturdy enough to really stimulate the skin. The handle is a bit too lose for my hand, but overall I can&#x27;t complain, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for well over a year now and can say without a doubt this brush is built with exceptionally shoddy craftsmanship. The very first time using the product, an entire cluster of bristles came right out. Over the intervening time, 8 more have come out and the white plastic base (between the wood body and bristles) has cracked in several places. As a result of all of these bristles coming out, my shower drain routinely gets clogged. I would highly recommend purchasing a different, similar product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality, natural bristled brush for this pricepoint.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this one and intend to keep it in my travel bag to be able to dry brush when traveling.  GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to start a new skin regimen for not my face.  Jesus help me!  The bristles on this thing are hard and are rough.  They will take everything off of you, so for that this gets a star.  The fact that after using it it caused my legs to break out in a horrible rash that took weeks to heal and that it stripped off more skin than I wanted it to, it loses the rest of its stars.  It might work well for feet but I would definitely not use it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my dogs because I had heard that a natural bristle brush was good for a dog&#x27;s coat. Normally my dogs don&#x27;t really like being brushed but they tolerate it because I would offer a treat afterwards. They absolutely love this brush. As a matter of fact when they see me get the brush they will come and compete over who get brushed first. Missy our youngest dog, who hated brushing the most, will actually come up and rub against the brush if she sees it in my hand. Its the perfect size to fit in your hand while brushing the dogs.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to start doing \\&quot;body brushing\\&quot; with a dry brush and had not gotten around to it.  I decided to look for a brush and came across this one.  When I first got it I thought the bristles were too soft for what I wanted to use the brush for but after using it a few days I think the bristles are just right.  Brush seems to be made well but will update after I have been using the brush for a month or so to tell whether or not it holds up.</li>
            <li> You want to keep your skin soft, looking youthful and cellulite free? This is all you need!! I was so very impressed with how good this works for keeping my skin feeling and looking good, and for nearly nothing in cost. I use this daily for 5 min just before I shower to exfoliate any dead dry skin off the surface, followed by moisturizer just after I towel off. I no longer need to reapply lotion through out the day, and I also have saved a lot of $$$ on products that claim to reduce cellulit, because I don&#x27;t need it anyore,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush but mine broke just after a month that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m just giving it a 3 star. The plasctic got separated from the wood. had to have hubby fix it for me..</li>
            <li> Loved the \\&quot;hand-held\\&quot; design and the natural bristles - that&#x27;s why I bought it.  But after no more than 5 or 6 light uses, the plastic band around the base started to come apart and big clumps of bristle started to shed off and clog up my shower.  I chose this because of the design and not the price.  Would surely pay much more for something of quality.  I hope this is re-designed.  So tired of shoddy quality products.  My dear departed grandfather used to say, \\&quot;Only a rich man can afford poor quality\\&quot; - so true.  Think if Amazonites downgrade products w/slip-shod quality design, it will give a message to the vendors of such items.</li>
            <li> Very good to clean dead skin cells. Love it and use every day. Not too soft, not too harsh. Perfect for my skin</li>
            <li> The bristle is hard at first, in fact very hard, but it quickly softened up to the point where it almost felt like a different product within weeks. The white plastic at the base of the bristles that holds it in place also cracked with just regular use and no dropping or anything, and the bristles started to fall off to the point where you would have to clean the drain after every use to prevent clogging. It was only good for the first week.</li>
            <li> Not too rough and not too soft, feels very nice. So far happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the brush \\&quot;sheds\\&quot; but i think that&#x27;s normal. Other than that I like this item. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin (I&#x27;m prone to eczema breakouts every so often) which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This brush is good to use both dry and wet. I use it dry on my arms, legs, and butt and I can see the dead skin coming off. It is gross, but the results after of my smooth soft skin are so worth it! It helps prevent ingrown hairs too. Then every few days I bring it in the shower and use it wet (also after using it dry, but I use it softly in the shower) so I can clean it. Its soft enough to not cause irritation, but firm enough so that it does exfoliate your skin. I recommend it to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> This brush feels soft but is sturdy enough to hold up to several minutes of dry brushing. I am using it for cellulite on my thighs and butt. We&#x27;ll see how it goes. The brush is perfect for this purpose and really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> OK, so I decided to hop on this body brushing trend, and bought this baby even though the reviews were a clutter of confusingness (too rough? too soft? not a real body brush???)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s cut to the chase - body brushing is not for me. I use a normal loofah for exfoliation and I don&#x27;t really see how body brushing will improve my life in any material way, and I&#x27;m materialistic, so that&#x27;s one count against. Also, when I attempted to use this on my virgin skin, it felt like I was rubbing a cheese grater into my arm. There is absolutely no way to do a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush if the brush itself has coarse bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More experienced brushers might find this suitable, but it actually left me with visible scratches, so I had to say goodbye*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*actually I accidentally left it in a hotel</li>
            <li> You can literally see the dead skin flying off of you like dust!</li>
            <li> best brush for exfoliating the body and makes your skin super soft</li>
            <li> good to bathe with it or help to remove cellulite.</li>
            <li> I got this product by mistake, so I don&#x27;t have much to review about it. Everything did go well with the order though.</li>
            <li> Amazing tool for the price. The canvas handle helps it stay on your hand easily and also helps to hang it on a hook inside my bathroom cabinet for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a dry skin brush before, but I am in love. It&#x27;s a firm sensation, but not rough at all. I have fairly sensitive skin and this is not too harsh at all for me. I only spend about a minute before I shower quickly brushing over my arms, legs and back and I can tell my skin is softer and brighter after only a week.&lt;br /&gt;I see no need to pay more when this one does such a great job!</li>
            <li> Scrubs super great!!! This product is a gem.  It removes dirt and oil, and dead skin.  I came out of my shower squaky clean.  It is excellent and doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all.  I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested this and I did not believe them,  I have been using the brush for a couple of weeks now and can see the difference in my skin.  I will continue the practice and buy another</li>
            <li> Very nice quality! Easy to clean and use for dry brushing in my massage business. Not too hard, but firm enough to feel the effects of dry brushing.</li>
            <li> though it does shed, as others have observed, I think this is a great little bod brush for the price. It&#x27;s a nice size, fitting well in the palm of your hand, and the strap makes it very convenient to use. It&#x27;s strong and effective, but it doesn&#x27;t scratch up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying out dry brushing for yourself! You will feel envigorated and refreshed and should notice great improvement in your skin&#x27;s tone and texture in just a few days!</li>
            <li> Worked great. Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> the bristles are great for dry exfoliating but no so harsh that they irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had gotten one sooner ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought this to help dry brush.  This is when you use the brush in a certain direction, depending on what body part you are using it on, to help with circulation and exfoliation.  I noticed after using it everyday for two weeks and then two to three times a week after that, it was easier to shave, I had smoother skin and I saw a difference in the look of my skin. This is a great product for anyone that is on a detox cleanse or anyone that has a lot of dead skin after the winter.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, the bristles are slightly tough but nothing too bad. I bought it to improve the appearance of my skin. I will need more time in order to make a better judgment, but in the meantime it is great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This natural bristle body brush is great at getting the dead skin off those tough areas. Feet, knees, ankles, and elbows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, but hard enough to brush off dead skin, which makes it perfect as a body brush. I also use this on my scalp (I&#x27;m not bald, so it works through short hair) to knock off flakes, which makes my head feel good after brushing. It comes with suggestions as to how to clean the brush and when you should replace it, but I will buy another one whenever I feel like it isn&#x27;t working anymore, which may or may not be when they recommend it.</li>
            <li> but the fabric loop that you slip your hand through is much too wide for smaller hands. Unless I am gripping the wood edges tight, this makes it hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles fell out (and continue to shed) but the brush is soft to the skin. I worried that it would be too hard. But even though its soft, the constantly shedding bristles makes this a waste. You might find better if you look around.</li>
            <li> LOVE to dry brush!!  so healthy to do!!  great for lymph drainage!!  increases circulation!!  all around very healthy to do!!  SELLER 100%</li>
            <li> This was just as what I wanted.  I works well in my hand as I have a very small hand.</li>
            <li> Too soft for skin brushing.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower and it works great. Since using this brush combined with Dr. Bronners soap, my skin has never felt so clean and soft. Some discoloration on the wood handle from continuous use, but overall the brush has lasted a long time with minimal bristle loss (much much longer than a popular brand easily found at most stores). About to buy another one, because I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;ve had my first one for just too long. This product did have a strange smell when first opened, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> Using this for dry brushing and my skin is SO soft now. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Works well and great price. I keep it by my shower and use it every day! I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> works amazing and I don&#x27;t even notice many bristles coming out like I would expect. its firm enough to do the job but not hard enough it hurts. I will definitely be purchasing more when the time comes. also way cheaper then in stores.</li>
            <li> My first skin brush. It feels really good to use. My skin hasn&#x27;t change yet, but even if it didn&#x27;t... Feels so good I&#x27;d use it anyways.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li> Good, natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Strap fits around my hand well and bristles are nicely stimulating.  No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I use my natural bristle brush for dry exfoliation before getting in the shower, it was a little scratchy the first 2 times I used it but it didn&#x27;t feel painful &amp; by the 3rd time it was just right - still stiff but not scratchy. Also fits well in my hand &amp; is good size for reaching all areas.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this brush, a couple of bristles fell out, but it stayed at that. The hand strap is also very loose and non-adjustable. Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good combination of softness and firmness to give you a good exfoliation. I&#x27;ve started dry brushing and using coconut oil after showering and that has taken care of my super-dry winter skin. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great for Dry Brushing</li>
            <li> Perfect. Bristles not too stiff - not too soft. Feels fantastic on the skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to exfoliate my skin before I take an epsom salt bath. This is part of my detox  routine and it does a good job at preparing my body for the water.</li>
            <li> Being an old guy I seem to have a lot of dead skin on my body. Wanting to remove much of it I asked my caregiver for advice. She suggested this brush. She used it July 5 on me and I was amazed how much dead skin it removed. We shall do it again next week. Felt good also&lt;br /&gt;Phil</li>
            <li> I use this as a dry body brush.  It has good strong bristles.  Seems to hold up well and does not shed too terribly.  So far I am happy with the product considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to fit in the palm of your hand and brush all areas you wish of your body. And it&#x27;s size and lack of a bulky handle make storage a breeze. Bristles are just firm enough, and product size is ideal.</li>
            <li> I love this body brush! I use it before I get into the shower to take off any dead skin that way I get a really smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Not too hard not too soft. I offer natural bristle body brushing at my massage practice and this brush is perfect</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for dry brushing. A more pricey one is not necessary. Fits great in the hand with good control.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard enough to exfoliate but not too harsh for more sensitive skins. I just wish it was a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This one would be better for the body and not for the face. If it only had a handle. It&#x27;s too rough on my face.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to skin brushing, and I bought this as my first ‘dry’ brush. At first the bristles felt stiff, but my body quickly became acclimated to this brush. I have since purchased a different brush with firmer bristles; I would recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife prefers this body brush. It is much softer than other ones she bought.</li>
            <li> good brush for the price</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. I have been very happy with the quality, it is not loosing bristles yet.  Also, it&#x27;s design makes it super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many bath brushes and they are either too stiff or too soft. This brush seems to be just right - not abrasive, but stiff enough to feel like you are actually removing dead skin, etc.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for dry exfoliating.</li>
            <li> the plastic cracked and the bristles fell out within 2 weeks of use..&lt;br /&gt;definitely a mistake buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the bristles are too weak when wet and with soap. they just fold over and dont scrub. moreso rub</li>
            <li> I bought this and the bristles fell out. I was disappointed. In the beginning it felt nice but that didn&#x27;t last long. The seller got it to me fast though which I appreciated</li>
            <li> not too soft, not too hard, does the job.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!! Really helps minimize the cellulite on the legs. I highly recommend this product. Reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> If you want to try dry brushing this is a good way to start.</li>
            <li> Great brush at an even greater price!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I only bought 2, but wish I had purchased more.  Bristles do not fall out and the brush is super firm, but not enough to hurt your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and it makes my skin smoother...love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to carry for travel. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for exfoliating which is just what I purchased it for.  Very affordable and does the job.  Fits my hand very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush sheds a little the first few times that you use it.  The bristles are firm enough to create increased circulation when used to dry brush your skin, but not so firm as to cause discomfort.  I previously tried a brush with man made bristles and it was too flexible and soft.  I like this brush and would recommend it to a friend or buy it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for----at a great price!  Bristles are not too hard or too soft.  Just a comfortable brush that feels invigorating.  Comfortable in my hand.  Best brush I found after I gave up looking for a suitable one here in town.  I would definitely recommend this one, and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. The bristles aren&#x27;t too rough but are hard enough to really scrub my skin. I use it to exfoliate and to dry brush.</li>
            <li> Best for face. Soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made item.  I just wish the bristles were a bit stiffer.  They&#x27;re not soft; I just wanted them stronger.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little too soft for someone who has been brushing regularly, but would be fine to start with.  I bought them as inexpensive gifts for some of my co-workers.  They are a fairly decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> bad water, bad skin, wash cloths are a mess... so I got this critter to use instead. I like it, it does what a scrubby brush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush for trying out dry-brushing skin, so this review doesn&#x27;t cover how good the brush is if it gets wet.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are nice, soft enough to not hurt the skin too much, but stiff enough that you feel you&#x27;re actually exfoliating with it. I&#x27;ve had the brush for about two months, and in that time no smell whatsoever has accumulated on it and none of the bristles are falling out. It&#x27;s a good quality brush, no ruffles or frills except possibly the little hand strap on the back, which I actually have found is kind of a pain to try to use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent buy, especially for those looking to try out dry-brushing, in which this seems to be especially effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for about 10 days. I haven&#x27;t noticed any loose bristles. Great for lymph circulation, exfoliation, and skin stimulation. I like the feel of the bristles, and the brush is comfortable in my hand. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Needed a stiff brush for dry brushing, increasing circulation etc. This one is perfect to use in and out of the shower. Fits well in the hand and the bristles are firm but doesn&#x27;t hurt or scratch the skin off. Most likely will order a few more.</li>
            <li> Really like this brush so far. Use it for dry brushing my skin before baths, leaves skin silky.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to handle just the right bristle strength. Love to use this brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived quickly. It was missing a few tufts as indicated by the holes in the base of the brush. After the first use a whole tuft came out. Not sure if this is going to last longer than 3 or 4 uses and I&#x27;m new to brushing so I don&#x27;t press hard at all.</li>
            <li> taking all my dead skin away! I use it every other day! Love it!</li>
            <li> I received a brush that out of each little spout (assuming a body brush has a grid of about 200-300 spouts), each spout was full of snythetic like your toothbrush acrylic plastic bristles containing one natural bristle hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it might just be the seller I used BigFly-something, who sold inferior or simply the wrong brush to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order this make sure you receive an natural bristle hair brush, otherwise send it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too stiff and rough on my chest and stomach would like it a lot better if not so rough on my more sensitive areas. I like it will just limit it to certain spots. High quality and fit&#x27;s my hand well.</li>
