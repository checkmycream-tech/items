            <li>okay fill out of them</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work better than these no matter what.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I wasnt able to work with these brushes they are too pointy.</li>
            <li>Nice! Very dependable!</li>
            <li>but make sure you wash them asap after using one...</li>
            <li>they were ok for the price, they work for what I need them for.</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>but if you need something fast to use this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Cute and useful brushes!</li>
            <li>and I had to soak them more often to clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li>cheap brushes you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>they are cheap</li>
            <li>but the bristles itself feel cheap and</li>
            <li>Theses brushes are really nice and work better than other brushes I own.</li>
            <li>They were very nice, a lot better quality than I expected!  </li>
            <li>Though, I had to continuisly clean my brushes after every use.</li>
            <li>they look great when you first open them</li>
            <li>But for the price they are a good back up brush.</li>
            <li>Just arrived but seems to be in good shape but a lot smaller than is in picture</li>
            <li>Okay so let me start by saying I really like these</li>
            <li>I love the slanted end which allows you to remove excess product if you make a mistake, or use too much.</li>
            <li>I mean I use them with my acrylic nails and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are good for beginners who will likely not treat their brushes correctly at first.</li>
            <li>Do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to!</li>
            <li>The shaping edge on the bottom is wonderful, much better than the angled toothpicks because they are wide and sharp!</li>
            <li>Like It Really colorful</li>
            <li>and I even cleaned it right away...</li>
            <li>Do not get the cheap stuff in the kits, nail art stuff is the only stuff you can get cheap</li>
            <li>The brush begins to fall apart after a little use and therefore these are good temporary brushes</li>
            <li>so much !</li>
            <li>Long lasting good material</li>
            <li>next I&#x27;ll have to clean it after the first hand.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These brushes really suck.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re a little on the thin side, but they seem good for the price, plus i like the cute designed handles!</li>
            <li>I am ordering a new one now, around the 15 dollar range, not quite ready to spend 30 and up yet.</li>
            <li>As a critical nail technician I love these more than the expensive brushes I have.</li>
            <li>Spring for a brush with natural fibers, not manmade synthetics.</li>
            <li>Even soaking them in onyx remover barely worked.</li>
            <li>Using them with acrylic they clump up and are hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Price is awesome but the acrylic sticks to them bad after few uses.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m experimenting but just from this last order cheap nail stuff is no good.</li>

            <li> Love my brushes ! Came earlier than expected can&#x27;t wait to put them to use</li>
            <li> Very nice quality! Do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to! Not cheap like others I&#x27;ve purchased before!</li>
            <li> Great brushes and sizes. Thanks</li>
            <li> cheap brushes you get what you pay for.  i bought alot of these and dont like them. they are cheap</li>
            <li> Although i like the colors of the brushes, they give me a headache not too sure if its because the colors are neon bright or because of the design of the brushes.....by the way  the bristles suck! I like that they are all numbered but the bristles itself feel cheap and the metal part that holds it feels flimsy.. I am actually scared to use them but when I do I will make sure to post a review on how it went. It took forever to get to me, over a month, but i guess thats because i did the standard shipping.. UPDATE: I have used these brushes for my acrylics and I have to say, the bristles did not shed when i cleaned them and everything seemed to stay together. Though, I had to continuisly clean my brushes after every use. It didnt seem to hold the acrylic as good and when it did it would get all clumpy and stuck to it. Maybe its something I am doing wrong? Anyways some of the brushes look the same size [ as in thicknes with the bristles] the only difference I see is that its \\&quot;longer\\&quot;. hmm oh well, the price wasnt too bad. Next time, I will just go to my local beauty store and buying their acrylic brushes.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product get it on time. this is what I was  expecting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! so much !</li>
            <li> Terrible quality brushes. Cheap cheap cheap. Had to glue the together from the start. Acrylic all stuck in the brush. Would never recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought. Did not like them at all. I thought these were for the acrylic and pouder for nails. They are way to hard and do not work doe that at all. I have tried to soften them but no luck.</li>
            <li> no good ..first used they fell apart. for me it was a waste of money. don&#x27;t recomend them. no good!</li>
            <li> These brushes really suck. I use secret Mia acrylic, which just gets balled up and stuck in the brush. Even soaking them in onyx remover barely worked. I got 1 okay fill out of them and it was tough. I am ordering a new one now, around the 15 dollar range, not quite ready to spend 30 and up yet. I am sure it will work better than these no matter what. I am a beginner to acrylic, not to nail art. So I&#x27;m experimenting but just from this last order cheap nail stuff is no good. Brushes,acrylic,monomer,Leduv light,glitter,acrylicmixes,gelbuilder. Do not get the cheap stuff in the kits, nail art stuff is the only stuff you can get cheap</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I use them for sculpting 3d nail designs</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, they did take a while to get here and they&#x27;re a little on the thin side, but they seem good for the price, plus i like the cute designed handles!</li>
            <li> Arrived early and are great!</li>
            <li> Looks very different but i hope it works correctly, ill update soon</li>
            <li> The price for these are phenominal and the product itself is made so durable. Can&#x27;t wait to put them to great use.</li>
            <li> Crappy! The Brussels come out while using and get stuck in the polish or gel or whatever liquid you are using!</li>
            <li> Price is awesome but the acrylic sticks to them bad after few uses.</li>
            <li> These brushes are synthetic meaning you should use them for gel! Using them with acrylic they clump up and are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great for 3D acrylic application. Great price for the variety!!!</li>
            <li> great quality. got within promised ship time.</li>
            <li> Brushes are terrible...they look great when you first open them but once you start using they fall apart. I do not recommend wasting your time or money. These are not for nail art or nail anything. I have no issues with the seller, shipment received when stated.</li>
            <li> It works great ,, love it</li>
            <li> Brushes do not hold the liquid acrylic as well as other brushes . Also they seem to get build-up with the ratio of liquid and powder and I had to soak them more often to clean. But for the price they are a good back up brush.</li>
            <li> Like It Really colorful</li>
            <li> The&#x27;re very cheap! The day I got them they were falling apart... You get what you pay for I guess!!!!</li>
            <li> Just arrived but seems to be in good shape but a lot smaller than is in picture</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all, brushes very stiff and &#x27;plasticky&#x27;. Should have known by the price. Try as I might , I could never form a proper ball of acrylic. Very irritating and made for lumpy nails and tons of filing. Spring for a brush with natural fibers, not manmade synthetics.</li>
            <li> Hated these, clogged up and ruined after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> awesome for the price works great for acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I wasnt able to work with these brushes they are too pointy.</li>
            <li> Nice! Very dependable!</li>
            <li> They last a bit, but not for long. The bristles get frizzy andout of place after a while. Only recommend for 3d work</li>
            <li> Very nice size brushes. They are a bit difficult to clean but if you need something fast to use this is a good product.</li>
            <li> They were very nice, a lot better quality than I expected!  I use them for both gels and acrylics. As a critical nail technician I love these more than the expensive brushes I have. The shaping edge on the bottom is wonderful, much better than the angled toothpicks because they are wide and sharp! Also very easy to flip the brush and use the shaper instead of reaching for another tool! I recomend this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice case very nice brushs.</li>
            <li> These are good for beginners who will likely not treat their brushes correctly at first. The brush begins to fall apart after a little use and therefore these are good temporary brushes</li>
            <li> Okay so let me start by saying I really like these but make sure you wash them asap after using one...I&#x27;m not sure if it was the brush but the acrylic stays in the hairs and I even cleaned it right away...next I&#x27;ll have to clean it after the first hand.</li>
            <li> Works well for doing my own nails</li>
            <li> they were ok for the price, they work for what I need them for. so I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Cute and useful brushes! I mean I use them with my acrylic nails and they work perfectly. Arrived in time too.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for... the brushes weren&#x27;t big enough. ..or thick enough. .. wont buy again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting good material</li>
            <li> I just got them today they look great and can&#x27;t wait to use them to try and start working on my nail art</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them for intended purpose but still a good price for them.</li>
            <li> Theses brushes are really nice and work better than other brushes I own. I love the slanted end which allows you to remove excess product if you make a mistake, or use too much.</li>
