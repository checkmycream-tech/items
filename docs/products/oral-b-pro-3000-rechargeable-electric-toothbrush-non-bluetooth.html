            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it takes forever to charge, otherwise great toothbrush ---</li>
            <li>I will say that the combination worked great and he managed to greatly improve his gum health in just a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it and thats all that counts.</li>
            <li>This one is great for me -- I prefer the rotating head compared to her vibrating-type.  </li>
            <li>The monitor for time is great and the preasure sensor helps to.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>I consider this item to a great buy.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Battery life is great for both units.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is great for both units.  </li>
            <li>In my case (Russia) I had to look for the lowing adapter and happily found it.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Seems well made and looks attractive.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have our preferences on the heads yet, but they all seem to do a great job.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral B since they came out and still happy with it after all these years.</li>
            <li>Obviously a great product but after 70 years using a brush it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>all the time lol.</li>
            <li>this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Both items were great.</li>

            <li>It cleans very effectively and is well made.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li>All-in-all, the Oral-b 3000 is a product with which I think you&#x27;d be quite pleased; but, as I said, it is not, in my opinion, the best electric toothbrush system on the market.</li>
            <li>My gums feel awesome and healthy.      </li>
            <li>Nice job!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this Power Toothbrush!</li>
            <li>If, however, you are like me and find reasons to delay your visit, the Oral-B might be the best choice as it does a better job at cleaning.</li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>It has a great compact size, while still providing a good handle that feels substantial in your hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, there are a couple of ways to look at this fine product, the best would be that it can greatly improve your health by providing a good oral hygienic product.  </li>
            <li>They do a wonderful job keeping my teeth clean and my gums stimulated!</li>
            <li>and it was easily the best brush I had ever used.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B products are reliable and have great products for a healthy mouth!</li>
            <li>I think this is a very good product and more people should buy it</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Braun I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the $20 plug-in Oral-B brush before, which I thought I loved, until I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>and the charge lasts a good week even when using the brush twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Since this Oral-B toothbrush is made by Braun, I felt good about ordering it.</li>
            <li>It met my expectation of a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The build quality seems good to me.</li>
            <li>Good battery life, and brush holder device that comes with it is well designed.</li>
            <li>it cleans good voice  </li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>It lasts good.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to say that I like how this works, the warning light gives you indication if you are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Owned an Oral-b and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The brush unit&#x27;s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn&#x27;t notice a decrease in power.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, perfect.    </li>
            <li>The lower cost of the replacement brush heads and a good sale price also factored into my decision to try out this brush.  </li>
            <li>My gums feel good and I have gum issues.  </li>
            <li>in all, it is a good brush.  </li>
            <li>Replaces one that &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after years of good service.</li>
            <li>* good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go 6 weeks without taking good care of teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day.</li>
            <li>It is for my workmates,and he say it is good</li>
            <li>That may be good for children</li>
            <li>Item shipped as ordered, arrived in good condition and product works as manufacturer suggests.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After checking in with my periodontist, she was delighted at the improvement to my gums and I can see a noticeable difference as well.</li>
            <li>This is a good electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so I was good with the 3000.</li>
            <li>and I could have saved myself from going nuts for a good couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Good selection of brush heads to meet just about any need&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>good thing</li>
            <li>I have used the Spinbrush for years and loved its results.  </li>
            <li>Guess the 40,000 oscillations is about twice as good as the 20,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is lighter and slimmer then the one it replaced, which are good things.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone looking for oral health and a really good tool for brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I get good dental hygiene comments.  </li>
            <li>It is just what I wanted - and a good buy.</li>
            <li>This product is much superior compare to manual or battery operated toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush and loved the way it cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li>My hygienist complimented me on how good my teeth and gums looked.</li>
            <li>Good quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She keeps using it, so it must be working good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just thinner diameter wise.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go in about an</li>
            <li>This was good to know</li>
            <li>The price and product are good.</li>
            <li>The 3 operating modes are all good</li>
            <li>B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that both models are exceptionally good.  </li>
            <li>Both of these models are fairly neat.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Does a really good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good toothbrush that gets compromised by the battery technology Braun is using.</li>
            <li>Got good feedback from my dental office after using the product.  </li>
            <li>The built in timer and pressure indicator light are also excellent features.</li>
            <li>Priced fairly.</li>
            <li>used to be a good unit.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>This gives my teeth an excellent clean.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses the [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] and says it&#x27;s the best brush she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very easy to do the 2 minute cycle, which the dentist should be happy about.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not too much to say here - include a carrying case, and this would be perfect, but as-is its a great buy regardless.</li>
            <li>I always get a good report from the dentist, but this tooth brush is so much better than that!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very bright light,</li>
            <li>Very good brush, light in weight but working well.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush</li>
            <li>I chose the 3000 model, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>She is very glad with it.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the device.</li>
            <li>All in all, for what my needs are and the price of the toothbrush, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Just used the product and was very satisfied, just as advertised.</li>
            <li>works great:-)</li>
            <li>Have used Oral-Bs for years and have always been very pleased.</li>
            <li>This Pro Health model has so many great features, including the quadrant cleaning timer and the pressure sensor.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nice and bright and reminds me not to brush so forecfully.</li>
            <li>very glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li>and I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because while I think it&#x27;s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s a toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush and so does our dental hygienist!</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush!</li>

            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for even better reviews at the Dentist office!</li>
            <li>and I like this one (the 3000) better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>My dentist is going to be so pleased!</li>
            <li>so I decided to upgrade and, boy, am I ever glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love Braun Oral B toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>(I love my coffee!).</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My teeth are glad to have this one!</li>
            <li>They love it and say that it whitens teeth!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE ORAL-B BRUSH!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>but I am in love!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK,I love it!</li>
            <li>It does a great job, easy to use</li>
            <li>Making the leap from cheap manual toothbrushes to the electric Oral-B 3000 has been a joy.</li>
            <li>I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing.</li>
            <li>I must say this is an amazing purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I used it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing device.  </li>
            <li>The variety of brushes to choose are great and they fit on any model.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  </li>
            <li>With that said, the circular brush is actually really effective.</li>
            <li>The charging stand is contact-less, which is a nice feature for something meant to be around water.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to see if I could remove surface stains on my own without the office visit hassle.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Handle feels nice in hand.  </li>
            <li>Nice item.</li>
            <li>I can really feel that my tooth r very clean !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the &#x27;timer&#x27; function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits.</li>
            <li>This is also nice, as manyof us tend to hurry through our brushing routine.</li>
            <li>I liked how the timer indicates each thirty seconds</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the difference this toothbrush has made in my teeth and gums is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I just liked the 2 minute auto shut off the soniccare</li>
            <li>The pressure sensor light is handy and my hygienist seemed happy about this feature as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>but I find it&#x27;s nice to use both.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was good, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>really liked my Oral-B Pulsonic but Braun</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they were user replaceable though..</li>
            <li>Would be nice if the product description specified power supply information.</li>
            <li>I am going through the process of printing yet another label and making yet another trip, at my own expense, to drop off the toothbrush sent to me in error.</li>
            <li>We currently own 3 Oral B electric toothbrushes (including the 3000 model).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked them all</li>
            <li>Honestly, I floss after using the brush and there is nothing to floss because it cleans my teeth that thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I have plaque build-up issues, and I didn&#x27;t feel that the Sonicare was cleaning my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted an electric toothbrush (not just the spinbrush kind either).  </li>
            <li>Liked everything else and would buy again if it just would hold a charge, but they were sold out.</li>
            <li>(yep, I am that kind of person).</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I feel the Sonicare is a bargain in comparison to the oral-B.</li>
            <li>I purchased one for my wife and she liked it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really effectively.</li>
            <li>toothbrush&#x27;s timer feature is also nice, helping you brush all four sections of your mouth for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>The buzz every 30 seconds is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professiona is as good or better than the Oral-B I had for 8 Years</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own one try it.</li>
            <li>doing!&amp;#34;  Kind of anti climactic if you ask me.</li>
            <li>It has 3 speeds which is nice</li>
            <li>I honestly feel that my teeth are cleaner after brushing compared to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided upon this model and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Oscillating heads tend to be better for gums, vibrating heads are all around good.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice to have something to tell you when you&#x27;ve passed the recommended minimum brushing</li>
            <li>and i really liked it.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush and think it works great, but I charge it a lot more often than I&#x27;d like to admit...</li>
            <li>It also feels like a nice massage on my gums.</li>
            <li>Nice features and performs as designed.  </li>
            <li>good product, also purchased better model and cheaper from Costco.</li>
            <li>You have to buy your own.</li>
            <li>I also own the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and feels great.</li>
            <li>- My teeth feels great and clean though.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and will surely  insure a smile for many years with all your teeth intact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>After using this new one for over 3 weeks, I think it is superb:  </li>
            <li>This new model is awesome - there are two speeds</li>
            <li>Perfect time to switch to a new brush.</li>
            <li>The vibration every 30 seconds makes it easy to know that you are doing a good job.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Very easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to damage the battery if you don&#x27;t manage the discharge/charge cycles correctly.</li>
            <li>I love the better features!</li>
            <li>This is a good product that seems to clean effectively.</li>
            <li>More effective for me than sonic care.</li>
            <li>timer is nice if you want to be sure you&#x27;re brushing the recommended</li>
            <li>suitable for anyone.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful &amp; the brush gives your gums a great massage in addition to digging out any food particles that might remain between your teeth.</li>
            <li>but this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Powerful, does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>I love details so the case to hold the brushes is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the brushing action.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums, then the oscillating head will probably be the best choice.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action is excellent.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
            <li>and now that i own the Oral-B 3000 i can say there is an notable upgrade in the cleaning and shining of the teeth.</li>
            <li>The first week after use confirmed that I had made an excellent purchase!</li>
            <li>Have used Sonicare for many, many years and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>the new and latest brush is also great!  </li>
            <li>I love love love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, super easy to bring on a trip in a light bag, stand the charge for a good time, even though it does take some time to charge...</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great toothbrush with some great design improvements.</li>
            <li>And, there are also optional items that are needed because the Oral B DOESN&#x27;T clean between teeth and by itself does not satisfy the need for a good tongue</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and am recommending it to anyone else who is in the market for an effective, moderately priced electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do an excellent job at cleaning teeth, but there is one major issue with them.  </li>
            <li>The condition is very good and it cleaned my teeh 10 times bettter than the normal tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Oral-B-ie - powerful, inexpensive, nice kit!</li>
            <li>It did not hold a charge from the first time I plugged it in--returned it for a sonicare,which I am happy with</li>
            <li>We loved our original Oral-B&#x27;s and had them for many years until this model was a \\&quot;Gold Box\\&quot; deal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, &amp; healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon).</li>
            <li>My oral hygiene is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Tie (higher price Oral B with more features, great value for Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tie (higher price Oral B with more features, great value for Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is a quick overview of the good and</li>
            <li>nice settings and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the easy availability of replacement brushes and the excellent cleaning action of the brush, we would not use anything else.</li>
            <li>Light and Compact, easy to hold with a good grip.    </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and even polished after a brush, the sensation of the brush is actually pleasant and the brush is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-b 3000 electric toothbrush system is very easy to use and does a quite effective job in leaving your teeth feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t think that the pressure detector works in my unit, but I keep a light touch, anyway.</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun Oral-B brushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the pressure sensor and the timer.  </li>
            <li>and I love the power</li>
            <li>My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and did a better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am extremely pleased with the quality and performance of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>As you can see a lot more pros than cons, will be using this for awhile.</li>
            <li>and I feel better after every brush.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely best purchase in quiet a while.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>if anything notable happens I will update this post.  </li>
            <li>I figure that I am like most people when it comes to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>better and stronger spin.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Like I said before I love the brush, but it did take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>The pressure indicator light is especially useful for someone like me, who tends to flatten toothbrush heads in a week.</li>
            <li>I brush more often and for longer with the Oral-b.  </li>
            <li>and it sprays water everywhere through the top of the brush head.</li>
            <li>I do for many things, I began researching and reading reviews here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but I can tell you, I love this features.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li>The three brushing settings are fun to use, so I brush more thorough now which is good.</li>
            <li>Heaps better than your nonelectric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>(They love it too.)  </li>
            <li>Am looking forward to many years of thorough brushing.</li>
            <li>This means the more brushes you get in (across all of your teeth)</li>
            <li>the better you are cleaning them.</li>
            <li>I have used the Oral-b brush  for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break.</li>
            <li>I love the pauses that tell me to move on to another section, and</li>
            <li>but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \\&quot;I bet you haven&#x27;t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\\</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for.    </li>
            <li>My teeth feel more polished, but that&#x27;s just about</li>
            <li>But, in the end, healthy teeth and gums are the goal</li>
            <li>+ 100% better cleaning when compared to manual brushing.    </li>
            <li>But, in the end, healthy teeth and gums are the goal</li>
            <li>Have used many electric toothbrushes ...</li>
            <li>But after many years of use, it died.  </li>
            <li>Wanted another to replace it, so we ordered the 3000 and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would buy it again after I wear it out.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The motion of this model is much more along the lines of what I need from an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I cover my gum line all across the top and bottom teeth then go over my teeth</li>
            <li>That is desined for more plaque removal.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing a interesting things.</li>
            <li>I was out on business travel and combined family travel, was gone for a month, and was no longer able to return the item.</li>
            <li>The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.    </li>
            <li>but I think I prefer it this way because I often spend more than 2 minutes on my teeth.</li>
            <li>If you purchase this product, be sure to test it out before the warranty runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time around I didn&#x27;t wish to spend more than the Pro Care 3000 cost.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc.</li>
            <li>The timer is a great idea to keep you from spending too much time in one area of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I still think I like the way the sonic care cleans better</li>
            <li>but I do like this brush more and more.  </li>
            <li>Been using these for many many years.  </li>
            <li>priced better than my DDS doc&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>There is a variety of many brush heads to choose from.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist suggested one of these years ago and my checkups are much better.</li>
            <li>There are better brushes for you gums.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel better already</li>
            <li>AFTER USING THIS ONE, IT WAS OK</li>
            <li>YES THE SONICARE IS BETTER</li>
            <li>ITS NOT A ROTATING CIRCLE HEAD IS BETTER THAN THE ORAL</li>
            <li>Like the rounded top head</li>
            <li>This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious</li>
            <li>the Oral-B 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overpriced, $73.45, now $88.95, Oral-B Pro 3000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush does not have a replaceable battery, so I&#x27;ll have to trash it even though everything else seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>-B rep said that both models have the 2-minute timer with 30-second signals, one of the better features of the Pro 3000.</li>
            <li>and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For longer trips I love the compactness of the charge base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply the best electric toothbrush I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I do think that more than one brush should be included for this price.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 speeds, the adjustments every 30 seconds and the simplicity of the charger.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth the different speeds &amp; controls.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Had I more faith in electric brushes, I would have bought this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays charged for the longest time, and I enjoy storing my toothbrush head in the covered container!</li>
            <li>MY dentist appointments are much better because my brushing is better.</li>
            <li>My gums look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>will  love  it.</li>
            <li>By the way, my triplet grandchildren love to use it when they come over.  </li>
            <li>Not jaded - just a consumer who has learned better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an oral B for more than 15 years and am just now replacing it.</li>
            <li>Been through 3 handles and who knows how many heads.</li>
            <li>but this is even better.</li>
            <li>Just kidding, but the motor on this one has more RPMs and that makes my teeth feel better.  </li>
            <li>&quot; any time soon, I am satisfied with the switch.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li>we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love this one even more.</li>
            <li>Decided to try the Oral-B and found it better.  </li>
            <li>your mouth - Rota-Dent&#x27;s slide switch is better</li>
            <li>bottom line is if you go regularly to your dentist for a cleaning the Rota-Dent is probably the best choice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months now, and I love it because I could tell the difference when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li>This device also lets you make sure that you brush for the 2-minute time recommended :)</li>
            <li>I had never used an electric brush, I love it</li>
            <li>Returned it found a better deal</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Works better than my sonic care tooth brush</li>
            <li>Works many times better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>In addition, I love the timer-</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush and it has worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great brush that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of use</li>
            <li>Even better than the dentist....</li>
            <li>Guess it works OK, I just feel like I can give more pressure with my hand and a brush.</li>
            <li>3 months after purchasing, the battery lasts for 36 hours at most.  </li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My gums are staying healthy, post-gingivectomy and with this regimen.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are healthy, but after just one brushing with this toothbrush, they feel noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Great product, i would highly recommend the upgrade!</li>
            <li>The head is perfectly sized to get around all my teeth and all the way to the back of my mouth with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The brush cleans much better than Sonicare, since it spins rather than vibrates.</li>
            <li>but this one is better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleaning has more power than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Takes care of your teeth better between six month check ups at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>always a favorite the toothbrush  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t requiring twenty more words is foolish</li>
            <li>It has more power</li>
            <li>I looked at many of the electric toothbrushes, and decided on the Oral B 3000.  </li>
            <li>better yet, I haven&#x27;t noticed any drop off in performance.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Make sure that when you dispose of this unit or batteries you do it at a recycling</li>
            <li>I made sure that there was SOME way I could replace the batteries.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this model.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of electric toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>I used an Interplak for many years and it was okay.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Well designed, no nasty cleanup in any parts.</li>
            <li>All kinda of replacement heads available!</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B did a much better job of massaging and cleaning my gums to keep them healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it ...</li>
            <li>love the power ... would recommend....</li>
            <li>The product was received without any damage (great packaging) and fast service.</li>
            <li>the product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Another great plus was that I was able to purchase this item much cheaper from Amazon than from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I missed a better deal.</li>
            <li>Love the holder</li>
            <li>This brush configuration has been popular for years and does a fantastic job as a rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>I love the adjustable levels of power.  </li>
            <li>Even better.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>This is a billion times better.</li>
            <li>This works so much better than the Sonicare I had for 10+ years.</li>
            <li>This combination couldn&#x27;t be smoother, nor more efficient.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the descriptions and features the Oral B 3000 has.  </li>
            <li>P&amp;G rebates, like most nowadays, come in the form of a debit style card.</li>
            <li>so I knew I would be pleased with this.</li>
            <li>so I can get a better model.</li>
            <li>wasnt sure about the oral b.....</li>
            <li>Read more on the Oral B site.  </li>
            <li>Many Sonic ones I was looking at did not have this feature.  </li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush, with 30 second timers to help me move along from side to side.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have owned many electronic toothbrushes and none compare.</li>
            <li>I love my teeth and want to retain them</li>
            <li>:)  Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also it seems that the oscillating heads are better at cleaning teeth while the sonic vibrating seems to polish and lighten better.  </li>
            <li>There is also a &#x27;whitening&#x27; setting, which polished the tooth more, but is a bit aggressive on gums.  </li>
            <li>Oral B has one of my favorite features, a sensitivity warning.  </li>
            <li>Even replacement heads are more than most manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Even replacement heads are more than most manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a better model</li>
            <li>I had that lasted many years.</li>
            <li>I am glad I chose the 3000.</li>
            <li>This one scrubs more and better.</li>
            <li>so glad I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and my dentist is more than pleased.</li>
            <li>So much better than manually brushing in circles.</li>
            <li>Sure wish there were some way to turn it off.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews and disagree with some.  </li>
            <li>I rind that it is much easier to do a great job of brushing your teeth if you&#x27;re using a power brush like this one.</li>
            <li>My wife and I each use these and love them.  </li>
            <li>It works great, and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>and I would tell you this device is outstanding.</li>
            <li>OK can I have my $50.00 now</li>
            <li>There is hardly a better toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just, okay.  </li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush and will get the replacement heads like the one it comes with.</li>
            <li>Much better than I hoped.</li>
            <li>My guy needs another one and this is the top brand.</li>
            <li>regardless of the brand, electric toothbrushes are worlds better at cleaning teeth than manual brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to get into electric toothbrushing without spending a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought this product mostly for the timer.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had come with more brushes to try out.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did</li>
            <li>The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  </li>
            <li>This was a gift, well liked, very powerful.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush except on/off button requires being pushed just right with some finger pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, holds a long charge and has the power I was looking for;  the price was also great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing clean feeling after you brush.</li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t prepared for the kind of clean a electric brush would bring over a manual.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush, refills are a lil xpensive, but closest thing to a dentist office clean out there.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Light is very easy to see as it lights up.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it to my sister and her husband have gotten one since ive told em my experience.same tooth brush sells for 100$ at walmart so also a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great brush; highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>My first Sonic Care I loved</li>
            <li>I have used some of the cheaper powered brushes and thought they had done an pretty good job at cleaning my teeth and reducing plaque build up.</li>
            <li>After some time searching, I found a pretty good deal on this model elsewhere and ordered.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the new one.</li>
            <li>Great brush  much better than  my five year old oral b</li>
            <li>/&gt;Counter space is important, and surprisingly the Oral B wins.  </li>
            <li>It made picking the 3000 model an easy choice and on top of that, there was a twenty dollar off coupon on it.</li>
            <li>It made picking the 3000 model an easy choice and on top of that, there was a twenty dollar off coupon on it.</li>
            <li>Replaced my older brush - works great and the &amp;#34;Brushing too hard&amp;#34; light is my favorite feature.  </li>
            <li>I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li>My gums used to be very sensitive and sometimes bleed from brushing and this has greatly improved my oral health.</li>
            <li>Our dentists sees the positive results in cleanliness and good gum margins.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth more than 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I normally do not respond to reviews ,however this machine is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>I like it because I can get replacement brushes for very cheap; even target has cheap replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I have tried this brand new Oral B toothbrush, and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure both brands do just fine for cleaning teeth</li>
            <li>Still working fine after being used 2 times a day since August 2012, much better than non-electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and look whiter than ever!</li>
            <li>Mouth feels tingly clean!</li>
            <li>It certainly can give your gums a good</li>
            <li>Best clean I&#x27;ve ever had outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.    </li>
            <li>It is great much easier to charge and keep clean.</li>
            <li>Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>toothbrush came with a very good standard brush head</li>
            <li>Other than those 2 nuisances, it works flawlessly and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how the Oral-B brush removes the stains and whitens his smile.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with the 3000 Professional.  </li>
            <li>I think the light is more of a gimmick than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Replacement handles are relatively cheap when compared to the set.&lt;br /&gt;+ 100% better cleaning when compared to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not that the Braun site is any better as it cannot be accessed with its available links.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>But this Oral B has a sensitive teeth setting and is really great for my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied, and my teeth feel super clean now.</li>
            <li>I bought this nearly 2 years ago and still works great.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B handle has a slim profile which is much more comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Poor</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth better than a Rota-Dent leaving them smooth</li>
            <li>Great upgrade from my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>This is a cool and interesting toothbrush with an electronic face that motivates you to finish brushing until it smiles :)</li>
            <li>a cool product, you ll love it :)</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my old Oral-B since it gave up on me after many many years of good use.</li>

            <li>Amazing price if you buy it at the right times.  </li>
            <li>The 30 sec timing is a great feature that I wouldn&#x27;t have elected to have, but glad it has it!</li>
            <li>Kind of loud but love it otherwise!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li>I like the rotating brush head better than the side to side motion of the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush, had read other reviews that people were having problems with &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; on the power-pack, this isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>The light cannot be turned off and it is very bright and very red.</li>
            <li>they seem to clean better and be easier on the teeth.</li>
            <li>B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head]] or in most stores.</li>
            <li>The circular motion seems to clean teeth better than a vibrating brush.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to see.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call sleek or pretty as opposed to the high-end models that look pretty attractive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts about a week before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li>This an easy to operate Oral-B brush.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying it because I wanted a better way to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to manuver.</li>
            <li>So important for a pre-teen that is too old to want help brushing but isn&#x27;t great at it.</li>
            <li>Directions are easy to follow and within two minutes you are done brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>The setup is really easy.</li>
            <li>Charges though an induction circuit (I believe that is what it is called) which makes recharging the batter about as easy as possible&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>The feature I appreciate the most in this toothbrush is how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love the speed selection and the clean feeling</li>
            <li>and I love that clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t quite so easy to do since this deal combined a Gold Box buy with a factory rebate (one per address).  </li>
            <li>You can use it in the shower and remove and switch the brush head easily.</li>
            <li>Its now easy to brush teeth for that period of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Setup was quite easy, just attach the brush head with one click, charge the toothbrush</li>
            <li>Easy to recharge.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love how clean my mouth feels after each use.</li>
            <li>Powerfull &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My son  gets stains on his teeth easily.  </li>
            <li>and it is better clean for your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Granted, this is a light up function, so you need to be brushing in front of a mirror to really get a good view of it.  </li>
            <li>It was a pain to clean and would require a Q-tip most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush  - love the timer which reminds you to move to the next section of teeth.</li>
            <li>if you want to better clean your teeth you should have this.</li>
            <li>I have been using for about a week and the battery is still going strong with no need to recharge.  </li>
            <li>This 3000 works as good as my older Braun</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, I loved my older Oral-B</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit strong armed</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve now had this unit for five years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also very happy with how long one full charge of the battery can last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong, maybe too strong.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s head is smaller and fits easier into the mouth, and it cleans and polishes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This is my first e brush, and i am loving every bit of it.</li>
            <li>Maybe 4 or 5 years ago I became aware of the Oral-B brand and that they claimed to effectively \\&quot;floss\\&quot; as well.  </li>
            <li>good price to buy, and clean the teeth very well.</li>
            <li>particular model is by far the best one I have purchased so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything is good about the new one except for one thing.  </li>
            <li>She loved the new unit and still has it today after 2 years.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare did its job just fine.</li>
            <li>Once I got used to the noise I was fine with it.</li>
            <li>As a toothbrush it works fine.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothbrush I could feel the difference with the nice smooth feeling that you have when you leave the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I checked the charging stations and they were fine.</li>
            <li>and it is fine.</li>
            <li>The package was fine....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been real.package was fine....</li>
            <li>As a toothbrush it works fine and cleans my teeth well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kept the charge just fine with no dip in power.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be doing a fine job of cleaning  teeth.  </li>
            <li>this model works just fine for us.</li>
            <li>The cleaning it gives me is fine</li>
            <li>I thought I was just fine with my regularl one.  </li>
            <li>AND SHE LIKES IT FINE.</li>
            <li>Have owned cheaper electric toothbrushes which were fine</li>
            <li>Did research and this works just fine.</li>
            <li>super item and service!</li>
            <li>tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good replacement for my old Oral-B (which lasted about 6 years!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to stand up.</li>
            <li>Had an older version that I loved and this one will be easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>This brush works very well and has a nice holder (a bit large maybe but still nice).</li>
            <li>I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this</li>
            <li>but there is one huge issue.</li>
            <li>So this is basically a huge step up for me either way</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed a huge improvement in the health of her teeth.  </li>
            <li>The stuttering sound is just the handle telling you that 30 seconds have elapsed.</li>
            <li>After a week with this toothbrush I can just say I enjoy every minute.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has some nice features to help you know how much to brush.  </li>
            <li>Dual available at Costco, wish for 2 brush is at a comparable cost</li>
            <li>i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get the light flashing as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish there were a way to make the light come on at a lower pressure.  </li>
            <li>Have owned basic Braun elect.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Red\\&quot; light alerts you to when brushing too firmly.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re able to afford this system, it will deliver cleaner teeth and fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re able to afford this system, it will deliver cleaner teeth and fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>Works well, and without all the extra features I did not want, this level is great.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap version of this brush for about three years and it died.  </li>
            <li>I want it to specifically hit along my gum line and this model&#x27;s round head does that perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The storage area is easy to keep clean too.  </li>
            <li>My teeth just don&#x27;t feel as smooth as when I use the Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>So, I can&#x27;t depend on the light whatsoever to let me know when it&#x27;s done charging.  </li>
            <li>but advanced.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Holds its charge, easy to clean,</li>
            <li>I think for the cost of this toothbrush, that is a bit cheap</li>
            <li>I had used an Oral-b electric brush before, but it&#x27;s been about 5 years and the one I had used was a relatively cheap brush.</li>
            <li>Equate brush heads that are supposed to fit Oral-B&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It is much quieter than the newer Sonicare brush I own.  </li>
            <li>What was important to me was that it was an Oral B</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice feature, but something I really don&#x27;t find the need for.  </li>
            <li>Works great and like the  the 30 second reminder that it gives.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The same applies: Great product, competitive price, convenience.</li>
            <li>I like the warning light that turns on when you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Repeadedly, she told me how much she liked it and how I should get one for myself.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It works and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The pressure sensor light will keep you from over brushing and damaging enamel.</li>
            <li>BTW: even after a month of trickle charge the charging light hasn&#x27;t stopped blinking.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is lightweight, and fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the brushes do the same great job.</li>
            <li>And if it is as reliable as the last one, then kudos to Braun and Oral-B for continuing to make a great product.</li>
            <li>Works well and is great when you&#x27;re going to replace your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an important feature unless you tend to hurry through your brushing.  </li>
            <li>the oscillation feels like it is really cleaning around my teeth and getting in the grooves nicely.  </li>
            <li>the oscillation feels like it is really cleaning around my teeth and getting in the grooves nicely.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great dental aid.</li>
            <li>I had a Professional Care model (equivalent to the newer 1000 or 2000 according to the company) which ran perfectly for many years, until the battery started turning itself on and off in the middle of the night (while unplugged.)    </li>
            <li>Timer works great and, especially at the beginning, helps you to time yourself.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions, enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>The multiple settings are great.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li>It is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It works like a car&#x27;s stop light.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works great, my teeth feel cleaner then when I use my standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if they gave more heads, It gets confusing when trying to find which head is the best, It would of been nice if they gave a sample of 4 different types</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Another good note is that the brush accepts the dual action brush heads which I prefer.     </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, spins faster than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Love the indicator light and overall love the brush more than I expected, awesome! .</li>
            <li>I visit my dentist for teeth cleaning every six months, so far, I have had good check-up every time.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better would be a good brush holder.</li>
            <li>The cleaning ability is far superior to any Oral-B I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good ....</li>
            <li>So far, good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Would have loved if they packed the Power Sensitive brush</li>
            <li>This is a good improvement since most people think brushing harder is better (but it is not).</li>
            <li>They are far superior to manual brushes in every regard.  </li>
            <li>They are far superior to manual brushes in every regard.  </li>
            <li>Its good enough for a week or more after you charged battery.</li>
            <li>So far good durability as well</li>
            <li>Liked the old Oral-B model better.  </li>
            <li>The best feature of this model is the red light warning that your are using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and we were happy to be able to exactly replace our old set.</li>
            <li>And even better, they are offering a 50% rebate right now.</li>
            <li>I have had it about a month - no problems so far and leaves a great clean, fresh, feeling.  </li>
            <li>The (detachable) portion of the charging dock that stores extra brush heads is very handy.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice toothbrush and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth &amp; gums, the unit pays for itself handily.</li>
            <li>That is until I used this brush, after just one use my teeth felt as clean and smooth as I just had a cleaning.</li>
            <li>After brushing, my teeth feels smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>After I brush, I always feel like my teeth are clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Had an older slower Oral-B and liked it</li>
            <li>I think they dry best if you run your finger along the brush after rinsing to remove excess water before placing back into their handy charging/holding station.</li>
            <li>This particular model is a nice middle-of-the-road option in terms of features and price.</li>
            <li>I had an older Oral-B, I think it was the 5500 or 5000, which I liked.</li>
            <li>We tried the cheap spin brushes and that was better but now with this his teeth are typically clean on the first try.  </li>
            <li>Live love love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for many years, and every new model seems to get better every time.</li>
            <li>thing is fantastic but be aware you&#x27;ll need some time to get used to it if you&#x27;re a first timer in this kind of electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my first electric toothbrush, and I love using it while my grandkids use theirs.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was love at first vibration.  </li>
            <li>It still had the original battery</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush purchase and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li>(I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any decline in my oral hygiene since the switchover, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush that I can say I really love.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a Sonic Essence toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The 3000 is slimmer and lighter than my original Triumph.</li>
            <li>I never considered that there could be a significant difference in design philosophy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the unit super easy to use and clean, and my teeth feel incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and you won&#x27;t be either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another significant point I think is in the Philips Sonicare&#x27;s favor, customer service.</li>
            <li>However, I called oral-B and explained the situation and that I still had the required original register receipt that would preclude a fraudulent use of that UPC.</li>
            <li>No regrets, good purchase.</li>
            <li>Because of one significant thing: the battery.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for the original Oral-B we used for years.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t have this problem with the original unit.</li>
            <li>This is even better than the first.</li>
            <li>Love the 2 min timer for consistent brushing.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this toothbrush to arrive.  </li>
            <li>this is my first electric toothbrush,and it&#x27;s better than manual brushing,nice experience</li>
            <li>so am happy to pay a little more for Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I really liked my original Oral-B electric toothbrush so purchased this new model.</li>
            <li>That may be true in some instances, but what I didn&#x27;t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was a wonderful gift and so far she seems to love it.</li>
            <li>very much - teeth feel very clean after using.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel refreshingly clean and the grill just sparkles.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that &#x27;just came from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.    </li>
            <li>You can feel the clean.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how clean they feel.</li>
            <li>If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you&#x27;ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times.</li>
            <li>but this one makes my teeth feel really clean</li>
            <li>After each use you can remove the head and put it away to keep it clean.</li>

            <li>My mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Sonicare made my teeth clean, but also hyper-sensitive.  </li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it you notice the difference in how clean your teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I owned a sonic care toothbrush before purchasing this Oral-B brush, and I liked my moderate priced sonic care better than this product.</li>

            <li>For an economical price, you can start using a much more powerful toothbrush than manual brushing</li>
            <li>After a week, I have to clean this too.  </li>
            <li>Even my cleaning lady refused to clean this part of the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sparkling clean after using this power brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as they do after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I have to admit this brush is POWERFUL and does a great job of cleaning and removing stains (big tea drinker).</li>
            <li>So you can clean evenly.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I love the 2-3 speeds and the round bristles do a great job getting between teeth.</li>

            <li>Teeth feel clean and gums massaged.  </li>
            <li>Brushing with a manual toothbrush does not make teeth feel as clean as Oral-B electric.</li>
            <li>I currently own the Oral-B earlier model and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far so good, she seems to like it, and it does make a noticeable difference in her smile.</li>
            <li>Bought this for our special needs daughter.</li>
            <li>Buy one right away !</li>
            <li>This new 3000 it great and very powerful with being sensitive as well.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feel that I get when I use the Oral-B Professional Clean 3000 toothbrush!</li>
            <li>OK, so seeing that it is made in Germany explained the very high build quality of this product.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush is great work, weakness is 2 minutes after the brush does not automatically stop, and the battery is not very to force.</li>
            <li>This model is a good balance between the higher priced models and the lower priced models, though if you don&#x27;t need a sensitive speed setting, I would recommend the Pro 1000.</li>
            <li>This model is a good balance between the higher priced models and the lower priced models, though if you don&#x27;t need a sensitive speed setting, I would recommend the Pro 1000.</li>
            <li>really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the 30-second timer option more than I&#x27;d anticipated - it&#x27;s nice to have a guide for how long to spend on each &#x27;quadrant&#x27;.</li>
            <li>even bright enough to get your attention in a sunlit room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most will recommend whatever they conveniently have on hand to sell at full retail price while they have you captive in the chair.  </li>
            <li>It seem that they last for around 3-4 years, so for the money, I think they&#x27;re pretty great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that feature, really, and I don&#x27;t see a need for three speeds, since that just means I have to keep pressing the button more times to turn the unit off, as it cycles through its speeds.</li>
            <li>So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  </li>
            <li>I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  </li>
            <li>too late this is just perfect  ...</li>
            <li>This product is a true pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>YES THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE WHEN THEY SAID THIS THING WILL SHAKE YOUR HEAD</li>
            <li>We have used Oral-b toothbrushes for the last 10 years and have loved them.  </li>
            <li>I had a 10 year old Sonicare Phillips e3000 which I liked.  </li>
            <li>very good！I want to buy  one more for  my  mom,because  mom  </li>
            <li>Logging on to pay my balance in full and cancel my credit account.</li>
            <li>Logging on to pay my balance in full and cancel my credit account.</li>
            <li>Oral B makes a good, quiet product.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 30-second timers really helps the kids to better understand the length of time required to get a complete and effective brushing.</li>
            <li>This one takes about 24 hours to get the full charge indicator.</li>
            <li>B0002KHT8Y Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush -]]</li>
            <li>Good for removing plaque and gross stuff.</li>
            <li>Still a whole lot better buying from amazon.</li>
            <li>It feels more powerful and the different modes are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Just really cool features.</li>
            <li>It encourages you to brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Loved it and after several years it would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>thing I really like most about this brush is the timer.</li>
            <li>Leave teeth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>good price, i use it daily.</li>
            <li>This brand was recommended by a family member who has used it for several years and told me that every time she gets her teeth cleaned at her dentist&#x27;s office they comment on what a good job she does at home.</li>
            <li>Nicely design product for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have a mouth full of crowns</li>
            <li>I think the 3000 model is the sweet spot of Oral-B Pro range.</li>
            <li>drawback:  kind of loud</li>
            <li>Much better than my old 1000!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light that goes on when you apply too much pressure is obvious, and a good way to be sure you get that right as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They are both very good brushes and clean my teeth and gums much better than the old conventional hand held manual tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it gets my teeth a bit slicker (cleaner) than the new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>In the mornings she uses her regular toothbrush for quick brushes but at night she spends a good 10 minutes using this.</li>
            <li>Also, the price was right, and Amazon threw in a free pack of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>The opportunity to try out this higher end model was easily decided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its so strong it flings the toothpaste off my toothbrush the first time I use it after it has recharged.</li>
            <li>Even though I leave it in the charger, its not as strong as when i first got it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was a great buy</li>
            <li>Great electronic toothbrush, works quite well and is able to really give a deep clean when compared to a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Downside</li>
            <li>slots for 4 different heads, 3 different cleaning cycles, easily clean, very strong, nice timer feature.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they could devise a way to keep it waterproof after replacing it, but then they couldn&#x27;t sell you new one&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Just received our new Oral-B tooth brush which replaces our old one that is almost 8 years old and still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>We always liked our old Oral-B toothbrush but like the new model better because of the pulses that occur every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and it gets more of the tartar off of my teeth than the older electric toothbrush did.</li>
            <li>It happens so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t disput brushing.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush).</li>
            <li>It charged fairly quickly and stays charged.</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush outside of the cheap $10 kind you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>However, my luck I think has run out and I need to start taking better care of my teeth, because I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li>The quality of generic just isn&#x27;t comparable enough to that of the oral b.  Happy brushing!</li>
            <li>looks super</li>
            <li>There are two speeds, but I find the lower speed to be adequate.</li>
            <li>Great product, Fast shipping, Would definitely reccomend to friends and family!!</li>
            <li>it helps ensure I am spending an adequate amount of time brushing.</li>
            <li>but all it is, is a (quickly) rotating brush head.</li>
            <li>The unit seems to be well built, recharges quickly and does a sufficient job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the list, but as I get older I know that I don&#x27;t want any more illnesses.  </li>
            <li>Our third Braun in the last 18 years and the best to date.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, at my last cleaning the dental hygienest says my teeth and gums are looking better and healthier.</li>
            <li>It does not charge all the way and then quickly drops to about 40% charge.</li>
            <li>The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  </li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush and will never go back to standard brushing by hand.  </li>
            <li>Cleans much better than my older Oral-B 3D Excel, which I now use as my portable/vacation toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the charger BTW: it has no metal contacts (some of older power brushes had them) &#x3D;</li>
            <li>It sounds gross, but I love to run my tongue over them because they are so incredibly smooth!</li>
            <li>Luckily I caught it on sale.</li>
            <li>It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>It works great and the rechargeable unit is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes; this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush that performs brushing exactly as my dentist and research tells to do.</li>
            <li>If you are using this brush by yourself, I could see this feature being less great for you since it takes up a lot more counter space than the older models that don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this brushing unit.  </li>
            <li>This one is not near is good as the Sonicaire I had.</li>
            <li>If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information</li>
            <li>Always loved Oral-B. This my third one to own in the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush doesn&#x27;t stay charged to long though</li>
            <li>brush holds a weeks worth of power on a full charge.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a good long time (over a week off the charger) which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>leaves a nice clean feeling and i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I think this Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean</li>
            <li>B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li>The pressure sensitive indicator makes sure you brush with just the right amount of pressure!</li>
            <li>Hope to get many years out of this new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  </li>
            <li>The first time I brushed I probably went for a good four minutes before I realized this thing doesn&#x27;t shut itself off after two minutes like the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For how much this toothbrush costs, there should be an easy way to change the battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and cleans my teeth really well.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product that lives up to the hype as it does exactly what the advertiser and manufacturer says it does.</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty good, and lasts me several days before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, after this past weeks use I have been able to greatly reduce the plaque I get in a problem area of my lower jaw (with large chunks literally breaking away from my teeth).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried those drugstore battery operated toothbrushes for a couple of years, and they were fine, but I always felt like I was trying to cram those large brush heads in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have been very surprised and pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised that it works even better.</li>
            <li>It is single speed which is not as good as 2-speed.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to all!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li>but new one works with old charger too, good on them for not changing the charging</li>
            <li>Would have liked it even more if the required charging frequency was less.</li>
            <li>Circular (rather than that up and down one I used to own) seems far superior.</li>
            <li>It was very important to me to have a pressure sensor and sensitive mode on my toothbrush for post-surgical care.</li>
            <li>Dentist clean after my first brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothbrush, I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>Had my first clean bill of health in ages.</li>
            <li>This is a great little grill maintainer.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the higher price, I cannot believe how clean my teeth feel even by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this is there&#x27;s a light that goes off to signal you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>One advantage that the Oral-b 3000 has over the Philips Sonicare is its light that comes on to warn you when you are applying too much pressure when brushing.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shop around because there are huge price differences among different sellers.    </li>
            <li>- Orange pressure indicator does light up if I put too much pressure against my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a great electric toothbrush for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>The card comes with hefty monthly fees from Citibank to boot and a multi-page contract with detailed legal obligations attached to the use of the card.    </li>
            <li>Now to Sonicare, when I went online to gather information I chatted online with a rep who was very accomadating and even offered a 15% discount code after I asked if there were any specials currently available.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity light works very well.</li>
            <li>These fit bill very well.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Its light and very convenient and an improved design.</li>
            <li>It will last a few years, and it is a great help with cleaning the teeth effectively.</li>
            <li>Ii is powerful</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was better than the Sonicare in that regard.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare brush action was definitely more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; and made my teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>action on this is SO much better than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Unless you just enjoy blowing the extra cash, this model is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  </li>
            <li>With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  </li>
            <li>I love how sensitive the power button is.</li>
            <li>The 30 second timer is a nice feature that allows you to spend that amount of brushing time on the four quadrants of the mouth.</li>
            <li>The one negative comment I have is that the package only comes with one brush head, but I suppose that the nice rebate more than fairly offsets the cost of additional heads.</li>
            <li>Unit automatically recharges after each use (after first full charge) for an hour or two, but can be used immediately.</li>
            <li>The OralB Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush is everything and more than you expect from an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to upgrade to this brush, but it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a powerful brush.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.</li>
            <li>This is a nice contrast with my Up &amp; Up toothbrush which, though it claims it&#x27;ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smoother, cleaner, and I even feel like my breath stays fresh for longer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush to get my teeth and gums into better shape and so far</li>
            <li>Pulses were described as &amp;#34;in and out&amp;#34; action of the bristles; 20,000 per minute seems more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>I continued using my brush and last week got professional confirmation that this thing was doing a great job!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>This model replaced a cheaper model and it was worth the additional expense.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great buy and worth every penny</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Nice solid, quality feel (time will tell...</li>
            <li>Only received one tooth brush, would have been nice to have received two.</li>
            <li>This mid-range electric brush had both of those, which I found to be rare for toothbrushes in this price range.</li>
            <li>the investment (and in my opinion is the sweet spot between the lower speed models and the higher end models with software features I don&#x27;t need).  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>They liked the 5000 - but said the 3000 is the same except the fancy timer.</li>
            <li>It comes with two heads - with different color bands - and a nice holder for them that is covered.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing my teeth almost fun.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and</li>
            <li>Effectively cleans wherever applied, front &amp; back of teeth, between teeth, gum line, even the gums and tongue, without irritation.</li>
            <li>- Compared to my 3-year old Oral-B, there&#x27;s significantly more vibration and strength (the company claims 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillation per minute).  </li>
            <li>It is durable and powerful.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to my next checkup to see if it&#x27;s done as good a job as I believe it&#x27;s doing.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, that&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>This brush gives you the fresh from the dentist feel.  </li>
            <li>The older Oral B it replaced had an easy on/off button to operate</li>
            <li>There are several brush head replacements available, including a floss style, and they appear to be priced better than Sonic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B 3000 was definitely worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>This brand by far is my favorite of all the toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li>so far, this one is a great upgrade from the last one.</li>
            <li>oral-B. In short, the Sonicare is light years better than the oral-B in every aspect</li>
            <li>better than my old oral b vitality brush.  </li>
            <li>This model also comes with a nice stand that holds the brush in place as well as provides a place to store extra tooth brush heads</li>
            <li>battery like is kind of low</li>
            <li>We bought a pair of the Oral B Model 3000 Professional Care Braun Toothbrushs at Costco several years ago and they were great.  </li>
            <li>Like this one better than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old one I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>brush comes with a nice charging stand with a container for extra brush heads.</li>
            <li>Always happy with them though for current purchase I wish Amazon could state clearly on the product voltage required.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than the Sonicare and better so far.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels better, cleaner and my gums have stopped being so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the old one (for five to six years)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few days and am very impressed w/ its operation so far.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>But dentists seem to all say that an electric toothbrush is far better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But dentists seem to all say that an electric toothbrush is far better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the upgrade</li>
            <li>Timer is and pressure indicator are quite useful.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the options of the different heads.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; offers Li-Ion and that is way better, no memory effect, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Another somewhat useful tip from the company: if you are in a hurry, you can count on a recharge time of one hour for every one minute of brush time needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dollar...................</li>
            <li>This is a nice middle ground between the entry level Oral-B models and the high-end ones.</li>
            <li>My pros:  seems superior method to regular toothbrush, good handle size in my hand, good brush size in my mouth, holds a good battery charge, base has spots for extra heads for other family members, pressure sensor light works for me, timer is good.    </li>
            <li>brush makes my teeth feel dentist fresh every single day, and has a pretty good charge as well.</li>
            <li>The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I especially like how my teeth feel very clean and smooth after each use.  </li>
            <li>magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to be able to keep the the brush holder separate due to space limitations on the sink top -</li>
            <li>Really cleans teeth better than the older one</li>
            <li>Wish it would already c ome with replacements but other than that a good product.</li>
            <li>So, she became more aware of this and was more careful.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>the price was right.</li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>Well I was right.</li>
            <li>No need to buy the ones that have bluetooth capabilty, the Oral-B PRO 3000 is just right.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to clean all of that gunk that builds up on it.</li>
            <li>Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.  </li>
            <li>This one really makes a difference in how clean my teeth feel.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it usefull and enjoy it for a long time</li>
            <li>This makes my teeth just as clean and much happier.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and my teeth feels really clean.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare it to, it works very well and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Even with just my first use, my teeth feel so much cleaner!!</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy, we just run it under hot water for a few seconds after brushing, although I suppose if you&#x27;re worried about germs a quick alcohol swab would work even better.  </li>
            <li>like much better than my old one that just vibrated, gets much cleaner love it so far.</li>
            <li>This is a huge upgrade and a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head?</li>
            <li>We feel like it&#x27;s cleaning better than our previous brushes and with the timer feature, we are probably doing a better job.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting my teeth clean when I used my old toothbrush, but nothing compares to the clean feeling I get from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, and it&#x27;s effective enough to skip the extra money for the &#x27;5000&#x27; model.  </li>
            <li>Looks cheap, feels cheap, but that&#x27;s not really that important to me in a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone interested in protecting their smile.</li>
            <li>Great brush, removed all the green from my teeth!</li>
            <li>a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It was kind of a strange feeling to have this thing buzzing in my mouth, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li>very much and just stick to the standard brush mode, but it is very easy to access the mode you want.</li>
            <li>More effective cleaning overall, particular between teeth (professional cleaning brush that came with unit)    </li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more money for more features</li>
            <li>While the brush head is a little bit smaller than the spin brush it works great!  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing toothbrush with ultra long battery life!</li>
            <li>let us send out a new unit to you, free of charge.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>New Oral B works fantastic</li>
            <li>I have a much older model Oral-B and while it still works, this new Oral-B works MUCH MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I use the new one that is more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; at night and the older model in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product that makes my teeth feel dentist-chair clean every time I use it, and appears to clean as well as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush for several weeks now and comparing it to a battery-operated toothbrush, it is significantly more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I swear by my battery toothbrushes for at least 10-15 years now and can attest that it is both economically and professionally a great buy,</li>
            <li>Not as easy to operate as my old one.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very close and definitely adequate.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  </li>
            <li>Something else worth considering: I&#x27;m trying to not line China&#x27;s pockets any more than necessary, and the Oral-B is made in Germany by Braun.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and makes your teeth feel like you just had them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>just rec&#x27;d toothbrush nice fast service and starting to charge as i write .  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a quick review not a critique, really?</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as easy as the $5 spin brush (by far)</li>
            <li>but I only ever use the most powerful one.  </li>
            <li>The 30 second interval buzzes are very helpful to clean your teeth in quadrants, and for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush as a replacement to my previous Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>gave this two stars instead of one because it still seems to clean as well as the older versions.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe that a tiny head could do such a great job.</li>
            <li>I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you&#x27;re not trying to, just when you&#x27;re normally brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One for the left top portion, right top portion, left bottom portion, and right bottom portion of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Not really crazy about the red warning light the unit emits when too much pressure is applied to the brush head, but the light has helped me to reduce the pressure I use to scrub the grill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think I prefer this to the SonicCare models I&#x27;ve used in the past, mostly because I have a lot of crowns, and most of my mouth concerns have more to do with healthy gums rather than my few remaining teeth at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are significantly whiter, while my mouth is much fresher throughout the day, which was a real issue with the</li>
            <li>This is good but the speed is a little faster than I would prefer.</li>
            <li>have been using it for a month now, clean very teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to store, doesn&#x27;t up much space, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>I prefer more distinct toggle switch with 4 positions (off, daily clean, sensitive, and polish).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Stays charged pretty well.</li>
            <li>Pros  Cleans the surfaces really well, the motor is powerful.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is okay; I use it once a day and regular toothbrushes twice a day.</li>
            <li>Im not sure how effective the extra whitening feature is but the sensitive option is great to have for me.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and cleans my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  </li>
            <li>a funny side note.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Braun/Oral-b brush I&#x27;ve had with all this features</li>
            <li>B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] for better whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] for better whitening results.    </li>
            <li>First and foremost, it&#x27;s made in Germany which speaks volumes for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>The reason I give this low rating is because I don&#x27;t think its any better than the Oral-B Pro Care 2000</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts as our first one.</li>
            <li>I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>To turn it off you have to hit the button three times (if you are using the first mode).</li>
            <li>Everything as described, I would never be able to go back to manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well and is kinder to the ears than a Sonic.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better is placement of the on/off button.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>, first thing when I wake up and during brushing.  </li>
            <li>Better, but not significantly better, than most battery-operated</li>
            <li>- Better, but not significantly better, than most battery-operated toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>What I like most is the 30 second timer for doing each quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has given me a noticable difference in my teeth and gums and does exactly what it says it will do in just a matter of weeks.  </li>
            <li>first thing I did when I received this toothbrush was replace the head.</li>
            <li>I use the electric toothbrush similar to how most people use floss.</li>
            <li>Much better than the S-200&#x27;s traditional style toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li>Love the different speed setting and that it also has a storage place for the brushes.</li>
            <li>My first two were more basic model Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li>I do like more basic models...</li>
            <li>First, there are 3 speeds.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  </li>
            <li>It is the same model my wife has been using for years and we are both pleased with it.</li>
            <li>, I ORDERED THIS ONE FIRST</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>First things first, I did not purchase this item here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>From first use I was hooked.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know where to find the replacement heads for this exact model?</li>
            <li>so I can only imagine what the results would be after using a more aggressive tip.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used an electric toothbrush as my dentist recommed that I do.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it lets you know to move onto the next section in your mouth for brushing.</li>
            <li>But it is better than the Sonicare for cleaning the back sides of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>overall I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought 3000 series and instantly noted that it was of much better quality than the Vitality.  </li>
            <li>Because of that I wasn&#x27;t able to use it until the next day.</li>
            <li>My first time with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>First things first.  </li>
            <li>I think the rotation feature is what really makes an electronic toothbrush worth having.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using various Sonciare models for many years, I decided to try this Oral-B.</li>
            <li>either unless you don&#x27;t have a mirror over you sink or don&#x27;t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!  </li>
            <li>It cleans the teeth and gums much better than regular brushing.</li>
            <li>Our first electric toothbrush was a Oral B, and it lasted over five years with two people using it.</li>
            <li>Oral B 3000 definitely has a lot more horsepower.</li>
            <li>So it actually took up more room as separates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this oral B that actually works better.</li>
            <li>However, the toothbrush consistently needs 24+ hours of charge to give just 14 two minute uses.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage daughter, hoping to get her to brush her teeth more.</li>
            <li>I personally get much better cleaning result with the sonicare</li>
            <li>The item arrived within a week and was exactly as described in the description.</li>
            <li>Oral-B makes many different toothbrush heads for the thing, find one you like.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and needed; plus it was about 30 bucks cheaper than it was in Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Considering the massive price difference we went with the 3000 series and are glad we did.  </li>
            <li>Love the 30 second timer feature, reminds me of where I&#x27;m at in my brush.</li>
            <li>I love that I only have to charge it about 1 a month.</li>
            <li>works great - a replacement for a ten plus year old Oral B toothbrush (battery stopped charging on old unit)</li>
            <li>First one lasted for years....</li>
            <li>This one is much more quiet and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>When I first received this brush I thought &amp;#34;this thing is just too powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The pressure indicator light seems too sensitive and flashes even when I&#x27;m just gliding the brush over my teeth/gums.</li>
            <li>Glad to be back with Oral B</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first oral-b.</li>
            <li>In essence they are holding your money hostage with regards to exactly how they will allow you to spend it.</li>
            <li>love the 30 second quadrant timing feature.  </li>
            <li>Like others, I did a lot of reading on buying my first elec toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet been able to test this toothbrush&#x27;s charge since it is advertised to last 7 days, but hope to take it traveling soon.</li>
            <li>But the Oral B is currently $20 higher.  </li>
            <li>But the Oral B is currently $20 higher.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;s even better than the last Oral-B</li>
            <li>I prefer the slower setting, but my husband likes the higher one.  </li>
            <li>I think the extra functions in the 5000 are nothing more than gimmicks.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I like what it does, but it is very noisy!</li>
            <li>More expensive models have more bells and whistles and cost even more, well into a $100+ range, but this one does everything you might want from a toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much cleaner now!  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after the Philips Sonicare Healthy White electric toothbrush stopping taking a charge after about two years.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can rinse the entire handle with no damage.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the sound is a bit loud when I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it feels and looks like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Gave this one a try, it has been great to say the least.</li>
            <li>She protested a bit a first because of the motion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more quiet</li>
            <li>The first electric brush we owned had a smoother feel.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and buy this unit rather than the 5000 - the features are just enough!</li>
            <li>charge stays good for a  few days.</li>
            <li>If your partner uses the other - they are really easy to switch out - and it cleans easily.</li>
            <li>It also blinks at you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is a nice feature and reminder to go easy on yourself.</li>
            <li>I live alone and only need one brush head at a time.&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized grip is nice</li>
            <li>I think the majority of this is due to the more powerful motor (and fresh battery) on this brush since the head is basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much research, this toothbrush was the right one for me.  </li>
            <li>Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  </li>
            <li>Out of the 3 modes (dailyclean, sensitive, whitening), I suspect most would use it for daily clean.  </li>
            <li>But, the \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m lucky if I get 8-10 minutes out of the battery before it needs to be recharged and that normally takes about 18 hours.  </li>
            <li>This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first.</li>
            <li>We are familiar with Oral B, everyone uses in our home, it was a purchase and replacement for an old with batteries used Oral B for my niece.</li>
            <li>Found it to be exactly the same produce but was able to pay a much lower price.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect for me , before I use is only one mode , this is 3 mode and hard censor also, I like it</li>
            <li>This model, my family is very happy with it, it has multiple brush tips, for my kids they like the sensor that let them know when they brush to hard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively quiet, is easy to clean and seems to live up to it&#x27;s billing.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has a vigorous action, and my teeth feel dentist visit clean after I brush.  </li>
            <li>B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] and [[ASIN:B000RSITSK Oral B Precision Clean 3 pack brush head refill]].</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel as clean as a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  </li>
            <li>I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years)</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks of using I noticed my teeth exceptionally whiter.  </li>
            <li>Just what my dentist recommended and the product leaves my teeth feeling super clean; cleaner than regular brushing.</li>
            <li>I love the 30 second quadrant timer (although you really have to pay attention for the pause or you&#x27;ll miss it).  </li>
            <li>But actually Amazon has it here for a good price, and it currently comes with a $20.00 rebate.</li>
            <li>I really like that with the multiple brush heads more than one person can use this brush.</li>
            <li>I primarily use the high settings, although the low setting might be better for children and people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The thirty second timer is nice for doing the &#x27;quadrants&#x27; the right amount of time, and I definitely feel like it is getting the back of my teeth better than the manual brush ever did.</li>
            <li>The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li>It comes with a little case to store the brush heads which is nice, especially when you have more than one person using it.</li>
            <li>The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve been a fan of these types of electric toothbrushes for a long time, and I love this one as well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, so fast!</li>
            <li>The first speed is almost too fast.</li>
            <li>Included in the package is just 1 precision clean brush, which is fairly effective at brushing hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The vibration from the Oral-B unit is very noticeable and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>I love the feature that alerts you every 30 seconds and then at 2 minutes to let you know how long you have been brushing.</li>
            <li>I am happy with its power, its ability to last for several days without being recharged, and it&#x27;s price compared to those in the stores near me.</li>
            <li>Almost seems too fast at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>teeth are cleaner, yes, but I&#x27;m never sure about whether I&#x27;m doing a good job on the gums with this brush, and I&#x27;d appreciate a gentler experience.</li>
            <li>Having used other electric brands, this is by far superior to anything else used.  </li>
            <li>It died after several years of use and I love the new model!</li>
            <li>I drink lots of tea and a decent amount of red wine :)</li>
            <li>As for the price I do feel that it is a bit high, BUT currently Oral-b is offering a generous rebate on this brush and many others.</li>
            <li>Perfect for someone who still has their wisdom teeth because the small, round head fits back there easily!</li>
            <li>Luckily both of these units have a more water tight design and don&#x27;t seem to have this</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it to me since I believe that these small-head electric toothbrushes are the reason why my dental exams go more smoothly than if I was using a plain old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first use of the brush went better than expected.</li>
            <li>, per telecom with Oral-B, the Oral-B Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush has but one action, which should be adequate, and &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; 20,000 pulses per minute.</li>
            <li>The heads last about 4 months and are easily replaced.</li>
            <li>A quick tap of the power button and the toothbrush just switches modes (sensitive and whitening</li>
            <li>Now, I can easily reach the back teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use a Philips Sonicare, but it just vibrates back and forth and my teeth never felt more clean than they did with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My entire family uses these and checkups are easy.  </li>
            <li>Overall Oral-B is a good product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My daughter has had the same one for about 5 years and hers is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I started doing research and got bogged down in how many toothbrushes were on the market and which one to get!!!!</li>
            <li>This certainly delivered.</li>
            <li>My dentist certainly is complementary of my teeth after moving to this style of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smart investment in your oral health.</li>
            <li>Personal preference will determine in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;$96</li>
            <li>Personal preference will determine in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;$96</li>
            <li>and I have a happier smile since I switched to Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li>My third oral B in 12 years and love the new features</li>
            <li>, so far it&#x27;s super fast on all of them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both great for getting behind back teeth, but I think this one did a better job of really getting it clean back</li>
            <li>Loves:  teeth feel clean, does not hurt my gums or wear them down, multi speeds, can easily go for more than 2 min, with eyes closed</li>
            <li>After the 11th brushing, the red charge indicator was blinking, but it worked fine through all 14 brushes.  </li>
            <li>the oral-B. I now look forward to brushing again with my Sonicare and even do the extra specific gum cycles for better oral health!</li>
            <li>We recently returned from the state championship cook-off for pork ribs and as you may know the fine meat particles from the ribs always plant themselves between your choppers.</li>
            <li>I still have 4 of the older brushes (a Costco purchase!)</li>
            <li>your hygienist tells you that you are doing a great,(not good), job after previous visits which involved her reminding me to floss daily, you know that its a day worth writing a review.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the toothbrush does get a little warm after leaving it on the charger.</li>
            <li>I love the light warning when I am brushing to hard as it reminds me to brush correctly.  </li>
            <li>Also love the warning light if you press too hard.  </li>
            <li>Love the flashing light when you are brushing too hard (which i seemed to be doing a lot in the beginning).</li>
            <li>Bright red light when you brush too hard.   </li>
            <li>Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>There were so many features on brushes that it became confusing as to what was important.  </li>
            <li>have had many models of the Oral-b/Braun german electric toothbrushes and this is by far the most practical to use, basically because it has three programs: daily cleaning, whitening and the sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also like the red light if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a week now, but I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are using to much pressure, a red light comes on to let you know.</li>
            <li>Also when the battery is supposedly ready for a charge a red light flashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is accurate or not since the 8850 comes with a stand up case that also holds extra replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and we both really like it.</li>
            <li>Costs way too much at retail price (not docking it in my rating, but this has no business being 80 dollars).    </li>
            <li>My teeth are much cleaner</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t bleed as much.</li>
            <li>Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don&#x27;t even really notice it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist really sings the praises of these types of toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  </li>
            <li>As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over</li>
            <li>Our dentist swears by the Oral B and our whole family uses them.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a real deal.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a real deal.</li>
            <li>Once finished it will stop-and-go some times indicating that the 2 minutes period for the whole mouth has finished.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.    </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the brush.</li>
            <li>That was a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that he was very fastidious.  </li>
            <li>Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the</li>
            <li>depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>practically no assembly required, it&#x27;s ready to go out of the box</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really feel the difference when I brush with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I put too much pressure on his teeth</li>
            <li>I was ready to purchase this together with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It blends in really well with the rest of the handle</li>
            <li>Ok not really</li>
            <li>Also the too much pressure indicator.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really it doesn&#x27;t need all of these speeds.</li>
            <li>Delivery came fast.</li>
            <li>So, I really didn&#x27;t have any question about what brand electric toothbrush I was going to buy.</li>
            <li>No kinder to my teeth and gums than a much cheaper Oral B from the drug store.</li>
            <li>There is a light on the back of the toothbrush</li>
            <li>that comes on when you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I tried my husband&#x27;s Sonicare once and felt my teeth were going to be rattled out of my head because it vibrated so much.</li>
            <li>This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.     </li>
            <li>I like the sensor that tells me if I put too much pressure with the brush</li>
            <li>, I think it works very well</li>
            <li>Solidly built and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>If I use too much pressure (which is not a lot)</li>
            <li>I like the warning produced if you apply too much pressure while brushing and the alert after 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>AND THEY DONT REALLY SHAKE YOUR WHOLE HEAD</li>
            <li>the light now only goes on every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks and feels fairly cheap overall.</li>
            <li>real question is how the brush cleans.</li>
            <li>and it cleans really well.</li>
            <li>And lastly, there&#x27;s a rattling sound where the brush head inserts into the handle</li>
            <li>enjoy the different speeds and the quality of cleaning the teeth is</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle, yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is a quality-built product, and a very compact footprint.  </li>
            <li>I feel there is a lot of research that&#x27;s been done to get real quality brushing each time we use this brush.</li>
            <li>I was finding it much harder to stay on top of staining from coffee, and judging by my scheduled cleanings, plaque too...  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The dentist commented that my gums looked particularly pink and healthy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I purchase it much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say except that it does the job</li>
            <li>After about a month of using this, I can&#x27;t really tell that my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been real.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I could do without the red light flashing in my eyes</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li>Red battery light never comes on.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>The circular motion really cleans the teeth well.  </li>
            <li>I called Oral-B with questions and they were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I contemplated getting the 5000, which has additional settings and Bluetooth, but realized that I really didn&#x27;t need those things.</li>
            <li>The hygenist was at a loss because she really didn&#x27;t have much cleaning or whitening to do on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>you really get that just out of the dentist</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating my review of this product as I&#x27;ve really &amp;#34;wrung</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for trips since I don&#x27;t want to bring the charger along and it spends as much time on the charger as it does being used.</li>
            <li>Now, it has to be charged every 3 days or so, which is VERY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used a toothbrush like this before, only the cheap battery operated electric.  </li>
            <li>I like the rotating action used during cleanings at the dentist&#x27;s office, so I figured it was worth a try.    </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Looks very sleek and charges up well.</li>
            <li>Does one really need this info on their cell phone???</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that this product comes with a charger adapts up to 240v.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of features that I really like.  </li>
            <li>Very portable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my teeth feel much much cleaner than they did when I used a way cheaper quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve never been too much into sharing toothbrushes</li>
            <li>in all, a cheap investment in your dental and physical health.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It performs as advertised and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>the blinking red light never turns off.  </li>
            <li>The storage container that comes attached is removable, which I&#x27;m thankful for because who needs to have all the replacement head-holders (empty most of the time) out for all to see?  </li>
            <li>Gave this to my fiancé for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Appears to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>I am really liking this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>and it is much quieter and kinder to my teeth and head.  </li>
            <li>I charged this one fully, 16+ hours, and it gave me four days of brushing, then the red light came on, and I had to charge it another 16+ hours.  </li>
            <li>Highly recom​mended!</li>
            <li>I really like the floss brushing heads</li>
            <li>These electric tooth brush head work very well.</li>
            <li>Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>However, we have not found this to be a problem as the pulses are very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charger is much slimmer than that of my vitality (the brush holder is detachable.)</li>
            <li>Having the ability to select a speed setting is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleanliness of actual unit is important.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the speed settings and</li>
            <li>I would really say these are both 5 star models in the end.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the speed settings and</li>
            <li>I would really say these are both 5 star models in the end.  </li>
            <li>Brushing with this is basically the only thing she does, so it must be doing a fantastic job</li>
            <li>You have to keep it on the charger the whole time you are not using it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>(haha)</li>
            <li>I would suggest that it you have issues with this toothbrush stopping and lighting the red light</li>
            <li>br /&gt;dentist put her straight.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are better, the head is smaller which is better for smaller mouths and it has a gentler setting which he initially used until getting used to the brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like how well it cleans.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>two features I find very helpful to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it is much quieter and softer than the Phillips SonicCare we were using.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t made use of the different brushing modes, but I&#x27;m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth,</li>
            <li>My dentist (who just so happens to be my favorite medical professional) has been relentlessly hounding me to come over to the electric side.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go back to an old school toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I kind of have is that the battery only lasts one week (</li>
            <li>Initially I thought the pressure warning and multiple cleaning options were overkill, but after using it they are nice features to have.</li>
            <li>So using this brush has forced me to lighten up a bit, which is another good thing.</li>
            <li>And my gums feel extra safe with the sensitive setting, which my other brush didn&#x27;t have, but my teeth still get super clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the design of the brush head that came with this Oral-B toothbrush has made it very hard for me to clean my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li>I sometimes think it would be better if the brushes were larger; but, that would probably result in not being able to clean tough places as well.</li>
            <li>My other electric toothbrushes had a cover and were easier to pack for travel and the most important part felt cleaner in the bathroom with hair and hairspray used daily, with a cover.</li>
            <li>you want to experiment a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it.</li>
            <li>using this toothbrush since august 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.nt a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and is exactly what I was expecting-brand new</li>
            <li>The first one held a charge for two weeks when it was new.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds, which helps you gauge how long you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth, which is a huge positive.</li>
            <li>One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG.</li>
            <li>The brush leaves my teeth feeling nice and fresh, but the storage unit for the brush heads is difficult to keep clean.</li>
            <li>(30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right)</li>
            <li>I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in &#x27;timer&#x27; that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue</li>
            <li>- the old standup version was not easy to clean, so I was pleased to find this one.</li>
            <li>Product is better than I expected!</li>
            <li>This brush was great while it was charged, but it would only hold a charge long enough for three brushings.  </li>
            <li>I generally use the flossing head (not a replacement for real flossing) in the morning to better massage my gums and a regular brush at night.</li>
            <li>I actually had more plaque on my teeth for my teeth cleaning and caused my dental hygentist to spend more time cleaning my teeth than in years past.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with them and this one seemed different than the others from the start.</li>
            <li>Charger is small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  </li>
            <li>The main difference between the two models that was important to us was the 30 second indicator that lets you know to move to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of teeth to clean as described by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>The red light for too much pressure is a feature I can live without</li>
            <li>One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the head that came with the brush which I think is the deep clean.</li>
            <li>The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums.</li>
            <li>At my last dental appointment, my dental hygenist complemented me on how clean my teeth were on this visit.  </li>
            <li>Definitely leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>When you clean your teeth with the Oral-B unit, there is no doubt left that you are cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>it kind of forces you to brush for a whole 2 minutes where I usually would probably brush for a shorter duration.  </li>
            <li>and I have been so pleased with this one in just the first few days I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Not only does the brush clean our teeth</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend making the investment in an electric toothbrush, you get that just-from-the-dentist clean mouth feel all year.</li>
            <li>I have to clean everything thoroughly before putting it back on it&#x27;s stand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, but unless you brush your teeth with the same force used to scrub barnacles off a boat, you don&#x27;t need to pay extra for a light that tells you you&#x27;re scrubbing too hard.</li>
            <li>The 30 second vibration alerts are great, the red light alerts you when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>, the Sonicare is more expensive in initial cost, but when you factor in the VAST difference in electricity used andthe incredible difference in results</li>
            <li>My last trip to the visit resulted in the discovery of two cavities, but since I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in over three years and am less than good about flossing, I&#x27;ll take the two cavities (and the time before I&#x27;d gone another three years before visits but no cavities.</li>
            <li>it also has a red light that flashes upon brushing too hard which is nice.</li>
            <li>The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  </li>
            <li>The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s past the return period, and I can&#x27;t find any kind of warranty info.</li>
            <li>&quot; I actually told him that wasn&#x27;t true...</li>
            <li>Really feel the difference over a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Only gripe is having to toggle through the power button (push 3x) to turn it off, even after a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I had an old Braun electric toothbrush for over 10 years before it started to act funny on me.</li>
            <li>Nice small charger.</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B Pro quit working, but when I went to re-order the exact model, of course it had been phased out.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it will hold true to its standard.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with a better tip holder, but not worth a star.</li>
            <li>This was my first time recharging and after 14 hours it had still not finished, even though the battery was not dead when I plugged it in.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my upper left wisdom tooth is almost fully erupted and I am trying to keep it super clean.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the results as the technology has improved compared to my older model but considering how long the first one last, I was not concerned about making the investment.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action.</li>
            <li>This is the first high powered sonic toothbrush I have used, up to now have always used old school toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are larger and more useful than other products.</li>
            <li>This has some new features that I really like:  </li>
            <li>The brushing too hard feature is pretty much useless but am glad I got this one instead of the higher priced models, this works great.</li>
            <li>When brushing top teeth, it activates very easily (being forced down by gravity already) and that makes the red light go on all the time.</li>
            <li>This new pro 3000 dislodged every nook and cranny of pork residue and left my mouth squeaky clean and sparkly....  </li>
            <li>and I was able to take advantage of the half price offer.  </li>
            <li>I found it for $20 less than many retailers.</li>
            <li>Thus, it would seem, that at half the price, the Pro 1000 is a much better deal.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than my previous brush Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I expect to get many years of use out of it, as I bought it to replace my previous Oral-B which I had used for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>but this one it&#x27;s getting older and even after some accidental drops, keeps looking and working like</li>
            <li>I should start of by saying that I&#x27;ve never used a professional toothbrush before, but I do use the cheap Oral-b CrossAction power brush on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist even commented on the difference since my last cleaning (she thought I actually flossed more, not a chance).  </li>
            <li>Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which</li>
            <li>favorite feature is the 30 second timer that tells you when you move to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>And Amazon had the the lowest price for this particular model.  </li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;ve never gotten around to trying a battery-operated toothbrush, this product will most likely astound you.  </li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;ve never gotten around to trying a battery-operated toothbrush, this product will most likely astound you.  </li>
            <li>But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard</li>
            <li>years older and felt like it was beginning to peter out.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a decent choice of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had been researching this particular oral-b model.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a battery in my older Braun but it would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>I think it is quieter than the older model I had.  </li>
            <li>Prior one was Phillips Sonic Care Healthy White.  </li>
            <li>- 3000 is designed for kids and adults 4 years or older.</li>
            <li>It is lighter weight and slimmer than my older unit.  </li>
            <li>While the Rota-Dent unit is quiet and smooth in operation, the Oral-B unit offers no concession to either.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model and needed a replacement.  </li>
            <li>This replaced an older model.</li>
            <li>always felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning after using the older Oral-Bs</li>
            <li>See the unit will most likely last years and years.</li>
            <li>Went from an older model sonicare to this after some research.  </li>
            <li>It was a replacement for an older toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 2 more electric toothbrushes without liking them enough for various reasons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for two days and with charging, I&#x27;ve only been able to use it twice.</li>
            <li>I purchased the same item in Europe and Asia and got more as well as a variety of replacement brush heads in the package for the same item Oral b 3000.</li>
            <li>I had a rechargable from Braun many years ago until after a second battery replacement finally wore out the handle.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to replace an older model.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is quieter than the older model.  </li>
            <li>She is one of those lucky ones, 2 cavities in her entire life.</li>
            <li>Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes...</li>
            <li>I mostly use the &#x27;normal&#x27; speed, but the &#x27;gentle&#x27; is helpful in some trouble spots.</li>
            <li>I had an original Oral-B that died after a long time</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had heard plenty about the Oral B toothbrushes and this one was highly rated.  </li>
            <li>taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.    </li>
            <li>The Oral-b came highly recommended from my dentist and friend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend the investment.</li>
            <li>I recommed this toothbrush highly.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This in one toothbrush I highly recommend anyone to buy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this model.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended investment.</li>
            <li>Ii would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended (by my dentist too)  </li>
            <li>A high quality product.</li>
            <li>I recall in high school</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>So I will just HIGHLY recommend it to all of them and everyone I know.</li>
            <li>It has 3 modes for brushing (standard, light, alternate standard &amp; light).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The vitality was a decent toothbrush, but I decided to upgrade to something with a little more horsepower.</li>
            <li>I like the Oral B because it has a timer to remind you how long to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>(I have to clean it every day) and the battery has begun to not hold a charge as long.  </li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t fit in the old travel case and the motor is MUCH less powerful.  </li>
            <li>Basically cost a little more than 2 Sonicare elite heads</li>
            <li>I think it makes her feel both a little more grown up</li>
            <li>Depending on how many times the two of us use the unit during charging, it could take a little longer.</li>
            <li>I notice after about a weeks use it seems a little slower, still more than sufficient to brush, and I recharge weekly.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works wonderfully, however there are several small differences I noticed that differ from the packaging and other materials.</li>
            <li>Not a deal breaker but would have thought it would perform a little better than that.</li>
            <li>The brush also has 3 brush settings (daily clean, sensitive and whitening).  </li>
            <li>Just remember to not press with the brush too hard so it can do its job effectively.</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought sooner, but it was hard to talk my wife into spending that kind of money on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>BTW CR rates the 4000 very highly, and this 3000 seems to be nearly identical to it.</li>
            <li>This new 3000 series packaging replaces older [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very juiced up compared to our 4 year old version.</li>
            <li>I really like the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>Plus, it stays much cleaner than my old unit for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Also, I was surprised to find I had been using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Not when there is too much pressure and the red light comes on, rather it will just take a 1/2 second pause from time to time.</li>
            <li>The pulsating action knocks off tartar and food and makes flossing that much easier.</li>
            <li>The head oscillates and pulsates much faster than on the 20 year old one.</li>
            <li>The item was delivered on time and it works very well so far -</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s 6am to 11pm, which is farther apart than my normal brushing schedule.  </li>
            <li>This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  </li>
            <li>The first is \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you&#x27;re doing a normal brushing.</li>
            <li>The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.    </li>
            <li>This appears to be about $22/yr, though I might get a few more months if I keep it on charge all the time.</li>
            <li>I was one of the \\&quot;non-believers\\&quot; in toothbrushes that cost more than a few dollars.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend above the &amp;#34;cheap replaceable battery&amp;#34; version toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been using, but this was totally worth</li>
            <li>I would rather pay full price while supporting a local store for this product so I can return or replace on the same day.</li>
            <li>This is the first toothbrush I have found that really makes a difference in keeping my teeth white between teeth cleanings at the dentist</li>
            <li>This blows any normal brush out of the water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truthfully, they were both worth purchasing for different reasons.</li>
            <li>This results in a good 2 minutes of cleaning when I had been lazily doing about 30-45 seconds of teeth brushing with a standard brush.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m scared to go cuz they always bitch at me about</li>
            <li>The manual says it holds a charge for 7 days under normal 2X a day brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth spending the extra bucks for this model, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It took almost 48 hours on the charger for the green light to stop blinking when I first got it out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li>How does that equate to 7 days of normal (2 brushings per day) use?  </li>
            <li>My teeth are definitely cleaner and the product is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \\&quot;get all up in there\\&quot;, but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful.</li>
            <li>The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Design better than the previous Oral-B model that I had for almost 20 years!</li>
            <li>Its fine and works as you would expect from the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li>Comes with a basic brush head, the pressure sensor is nice to have but not helpful after the first few times since you learn more what is too hard.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, especially with the 50% rebate that was offered.</li>
            <li>I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral B 3000 because it makes brushing my teeth less of chore and cleans them really good leaving my mouth fresh for hours, plus Amazon sold it for $25 less than Walmart...an unbelievable deal!</li>
            <li>Having different settings is very convenient plus the external timer makes it easier to be certain that I&#x27;m spending just the right amount of time on each section.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and my god I have been missing out on clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly, unlike other items that I have purchased on Amazon.com that I have ordered over 4 months ago and never received!  </li>
            <li>and a little light flashes on the toothbrush when you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full name is \\&quot;Professional Care 3000\\&quot; and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument.</li>
            <li>Will be thrilled if this brush last even ½ as long as my last one.</li>
            <li>and I got a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had searched for a price I could live with</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, this is a tool i just can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Basically, this is a tool i just can&#x27;t live without.    </li>
            <li>I started a new routine.  </li>
            <li>This new model remains to be seen, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any sturdier.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any gunk/mold issues, and the pressure and &amp;#34;time for a new zone&amp;#34; indicators work well.</li>
            <li>so I can appreciate the new improvements.</li>
            <li>The new brush can be used for days even without having the charging stand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new toothbrush to replace the one that died.</li>
            <li>Need charging after 2 or 3 days which is not acceptable for a brand new unit.</li>
            <li>so we bought this new version.&lt;br</li>
            <li>new version is a type 3756.</li>
            <li>My new dentist recommended this e-brush</li>
            <li>Mine does not beep every 30 seconds to indicate brushing a new section, it vibrates slower to tell you to change sections.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for something new now.   </li>
            <li>and i wish you could just put a new battery in the item after a year</li>
            <li>The replaceable heads would wobble ever so slighty, so I decide it was time to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>It was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>like I had a new power charger in the box however.  </li>
            <li>Then tried a new replaceable 2AA batteries</li>
            <li>she can&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
            <li>It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.    </li>
            <li>I thought that they light to tell you that you&#x27;re pushing too hard was a gimmick, but it turns out that is useful</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the orange light that tells me when I&#x27;m pushing down too much on my teeth, as my dentist had previously told me I have a problem with that.</li>
            <li>The brush on the new unit moves much faster than the old and our teeth feel even cleaner than they did with the old one</li>
            <li>The new Oral B has a better fast and slow pulse choice that works well for me.</li>
            <li>My wife dropped her previous one and it was an easy decision to replace it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a fan of the circular  brush (which I must say I was weary of) there are several different brush styles available.</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush would not hold a charge for more than a few days after 4 years so it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>(Although for our older neighbors and those with sensitive teeth, you may want to skip it.)  </li>
            <li>(Although for our older neighbors and those with sensitive teeth, you may want to skip it.)  </li>
            <li>(although I was able to find the old case, and with a few modifications, this handle fits</li>
            <li>Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>but it is essential to mantain a good oral hygiene (brush your teeth at least two times per day)</li>
            <li>Base is good, you can keep just the charger without case if you want to save room on your counter top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend ordering the three pack of sensitive heads...</li>
            <li>it cleans well, but is very loud</li>
            <li>The battery on my old one lasted about seven years before it wouldn&#x27;t fully charge up anymore, so I have high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li>have had issues with my teeth being very soft and prone to problems as well as some issues with receding gums.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple product that does exactly what it supposed to.  </li>
            <li>No more lifting off a brush top to find something growing</li>
            <li>I have no idea how I bought this with its LONG charging time to give a weeks worth of brushing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush to replace my 16-year old electric Oral-B brush (holly smokes - yes!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads for oral b are significantly cheaper than other electric toothbrush brands.  </li>
            <li>First, it does not suffer from the gross out cup that the Sonicare E series does.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommended based on my first use...</li>
            <li>however I believe it doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Oh my God this thing is SOOOOO loud!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than our original Oral-B&#x27;s and has a smaller vanity \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; if you leave off the plastic \\&quot;saddlebag\\</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I love the small spinning brush as opposed to the oscillating brush.  </li>
            <li>The spinning brush gets the job done better and gets into small areas.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I should have replaced my old one a year ago!  </li>
            <li>I share it with my boyfriend, and with their little brush extenshion caddy, it is a relatively easy process.</li>
            <li>The smaller head makes it easier to clean my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>They both also light up when actively charging, and dim when charging is complete.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It was always a struggle to get him to clean his teeth properly with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  </li>

            <li>With this electric toothbrush, you would have to spend roughly 20 minutes using a manual toothbrush to get the same amount of clean out of the 2 minutes it takes instead!</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  </li>
            <li>I have had other electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied with them because of their being to rough and believe it or not to much of an \\&quot;echo\\&quot; in my head when using.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand it really offers what it advises and is sooo much better than regular brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush is super strong, and a red LED will indicate if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>New one stutters like the old one.  </li>
            <li>, she knows the right pressure and how long to brush.  </li>
            <li>Using this, I have experienced less mouth pain after brushing, even less than the Ultreo which I thought provided a relatively painless cleaning.</li>
            <li>far as brushing, I find that the Oral-B removes small particles of food between my teeth better than the Sonic.  </li>
            <li>I use it 2-3 times a day per week and battery doesn&#x27;t deminish as quickly the way I expected it would.</li>
            <li>I liked the old model that told you how long you had been brushing, this model gives little zzz&#x27;s after brushing for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Another dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare but it is so much more expensive that I chose to stay with the Oral B which uses the same rotary bush system that a dentist uses to clean teeth!</li>
            <li>higher oscillations, pressure light when pressing too hard and sensitive</li>
            <li>It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  </li>

            <li>Buy one and enjoy for months to come of your like new mouth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li>Buy one and enjoy for months to come of your like new mouth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li>(slight exaggeration, but it is a very powerful brush)</li>
            <li>love it, except for when 30 seconds feels like a long time), and it&#x27;s got a red light for when you&#x27;re pressing too hard (which can damage your gums).</li>
            <li>You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!     </li>
            <li>I have used the battery-only version which runs at half of the speed of the electric rechargeable; it seems to me that the extra speed does a better job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Since these units are built to last for many years (my previous Sonicare lasted 4+ years).  </li>
            <li>Since these units are built to last for many years (my previous Sonicare lasted 4+ years).  </li>
            <li>It gives the brush a quick stutter at 30 second intervals to help you focus attention on individual areas, before moving on.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it&#x27;s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want a super expensive one, so I opted for this \\&quot;middle of the line\\&quot; product, but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>can tell when pushing too hard (can see red light go off through eyelids) and easy to tell when you hit 30 second sections</li>
            <li>If the brush lasts a few years, that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>As I used it and used it more often and started going to the dentist regularly, I clearly was having less problems, especially bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li>At my last dental cleaning in Feb this year, my dentist told me that I had slight gingivitis near my gums and that electric toothbrushes do a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Evidently the new owners have sent quality control straight down the dumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a standard plug, without a large brick.  </li>
            <li>only thing that I&#x27;m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.</li>
            <li>Also these batteries contain Cadmium which has prompted the EU to ban their use except for certain specific applications.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a manual brusher this takes a little getting used to, but after a week you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>and I end up having to hold him down just to keep his teeth clean.</li>
            <li>(The number on the Citibank pre-paid debit card website that is given for customer support simply has a message that says your direct deposit will be processed on a certain date.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly longer than the original</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is when it tells you when you&#x27;re pushing too hard.</li>
            <li>Cons  Battery seems to charge very slow  Not as good at cleaning between teeth compared to Sonicare (with the standard brush head atleast).  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking to spend a little more, I can definitely recommend the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care as a quality purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li>The pressure sensitive light that tells you if you are brushing too hard really works-</li>
            <li>At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though my teeth feel cleaner, my mouth tastes less clean before I rinse.  </li>
            <li>The charger is stand alone and clear all the way around.</li>
            <li>All I really need though is the regular speed (for teeth) and the slower, sensitive speed for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>All I really need though is the regular speed (for teeth) and the slower, sensitive speed for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable.</li>
            <li>,my teeth is clear</li>
            <li>I would steer clear.</li>
            <li>This item has three different speeds, a red pressure sensor light, which will let you know if you are using too much pressure, and comes with a thirty second timer that pauses the brush briefly for each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The battery indicator light only blinks AFTER the battery dies (not very helpful</li>
            <li>Now this has the &#x27;Quad Timer&#x27; - I heard this referenced in all my reading and it wasn&#x27;t 100% clear till I used the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Being that the three modes are a complete joke, I would much rather have to hit the button only once to turn it off.</li>
            <li>When you click on it there is a statement on the page that says \\&quot;The Oral-B 8850, frequently sold through professional dental offices, is the professional version of the Oral-B 3000 handle.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have now been using the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush]] for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare</li>
            <li>But, my teeth feel much cleaner than regular brushing</li>
            <li>Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  </li>
            <li>The brush is much thicker then a standard brush</li>
            <li>its three brushing modes instills a sense of confidence that you are you are getting \\&quot;professional care.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Further, to make sure you are brushing properly, you are reminded at thirty second intervals, for a total of two minutes, to brush another area in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The timer that buzzes at 30 second intervals let&#x27;s me know how much time I should spend on each quadrant of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Has to be taken apart and completely cleaned after every use, otherwise toothpaste-laden water hides inside the brush head and leaks all over the handle section.</li>

            <li>you&#x27;ll get the sensitive (never tried this one)</li>
            <li>Loud humming with surge pulse.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why.</li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer lets you know that the morning/evening ritual is complete.  </li>
            <li>As a toothbrush it does well, the sonic action is noticeable from brushes that do not have it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth &amp;</li>
            <li>this brush doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive areas which hand brushing does.</li>
            <li>It was about 20 years old.</li>
            <li>some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once.</li>
            <li>you can put it on soft mode.</li>
            <li>oh and the charge really does last all week</li>
            <li>Zero complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old Oral-B and wanted to have storage room for additional brush heads</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush works well.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 3 pack of Oral-B&#x27;s Power Sensitive Replacement Heads.</li>
            <li>only real choice I had to make was which model of the Oral-B I was going to buy.</li>
            <li>only real choice I had to make was which model of the Oral-B I was going to buy.</li>
            <li>I have been using a sonic toothbrush for quite some time, so switching to the Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush was a bit of a shock.</li>
            <li>When I saw this had a setting for sensitive teeth, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>Feels like a professional dental cleaning after each brushing.</li>
            <li>B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush, 1 Count]]</li>
            <li>The setup was completely intuitive.  </li>
            <li>Its been six months so far.</li>
            <li>a person with receding gums, my dentist advised me to look into a professional care electric toothbrush to take the place of my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; manuel toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The second one however would no longer hold a charge within a year which really irked me</li>
            <li>So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  </li>
            <li>Though will not hold much of a charge, by keeping it on the charger, it still provides daily brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really loud.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s being charged, the green light flashes indicating that it&#x27;s being charged.  </li>
            <li>However, the green light NEVER stops blinking even after 24 hours and the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and it felt like it would scrub my enamel OFF.</li>
            <li>but I, as an adult, don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>My Oral-B Vitality passed away, and after asking my hygienist for a recommendation for a replacement, she insisted that I avoid the Vitality and upgrade to any of the Oral-B professional series models.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time I use this brush my mouth feels as if it&#x27;s had a professional polishing.</li>
            <li>my old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush no longer works (but old one did work for 4-5 years).  </li>
            <li>No complaints with the first one which I&#x27;d had for a long time</li>
            <li>And sometimes, I wake my husband from his sleep when I brush, because this thing is so loud...</li>
            <li>Enter the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I find myself using the slowest setting (for sensitive)</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my 10 year old Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li>Green charging indicator light is still blinking after overnight charging.</li>
            <li>- Oral-B claims it will naturally whitens teeth in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Replaced my 4-year old Oral-B with this newer unit.  </li>
            <li>if you have sensitive teeth, beware.  </li>
            <li>Seems the battery runs out faster than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>The cons of the Oral-B Professional Care 3000:  Noisier than Sonicare  </li>
            <li>I use it on sensitive setting and  it still cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Would not charge completely even after 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>but I do with no problems so far).  </li>
            <li>but I think its like 8 years old.</li>
            <li>Replacement for our 10 year old Braun that died.</li>
            <li>This replaces an old Oral B rechargeable toothbrush that died after 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping this lasts as long as my first Oral B.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old unit.</li>
            <li>Not quite the sonic action I was looking for,</li>
            <li>This Oral-B 3000 appears to be nearly identical to what is also called the Oral-B Professional Care Advantage.</li>
            <li>but the action of the brush promotes gum/tooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten my adult children hooked on Oral B as well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush until I travel internationally.</li>
            <li>It fits in my old wall mount charger and keeps it off the counter, no clutter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To compare the Sonicare to the oral-B is like equating a GPS navagation system to an old fold up map.</li>
            <li>So, I gave my contact info and asked for a call when a mgr was available only to never get a call back and have my rebate request sent back stating I needed to resubmit it with the UPC code.</li>
            <li>Well for one, you are going to get the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t let it completely discharge periodically.</li>
            <li>When my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, I knew I wanted another one.  </li>
            <li>like it that this Oral-b toothbrush has a sensitive</li>
            <li>I now use my old one for cleaning grout in the shower.</li>
            <li>My dentist has always said to use the soft brushes.</li>
            <li>For nearly 11 years I owned another model Oral-B that would no longer hold a charge</li>
            <li>Well thanks anyway Braun, I&#x27;&#x27;ll go elsewhere for my next electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Seems longer than the old Oral-B I had</li>
            <li>At any rate, I installed the Oral-B sensitive brushes and now have a system that cleans my teeth well without harshness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud compared to my old Oral B but sounds about like all the brushes we have.</li>
            <li>and I have ordered three - the floss action, polisher, and dual brush.</li>
            <li>My twenty year old Oral-B rechargeable was beginning to show signs of its age.</li>
            <li>And obviously it cleans the mouth very well, as any toothbrush of this price</li>
            <li>I have used an electric toothbrush for years and when my old model died I purchased this.</li>
            <li>The battery on our old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush no longer held a charge so we purchased the Oral-B Professional Precision 3000 Rechargeable as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>My old one had reached the point</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again and can&#x27;t wait for it to completely die</li>
            <li>brush head is much easier to reach back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>But this is a feature to tell you when you are applying too much pressure, which is oddly enough, a common mistake by most folks.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare just has the one stand, which is compact, but without the ability to expand to a larger whole brushing area if you want.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is really the only difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is really the only difference.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy and convinient in hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have no problems with it</li>
            <li>I settled on the Oral-B Professional 3000 series.  </li>
            <li>it charged it, and change the head frequently.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a product.  </li>
            <li>, this was replacements for our old Oral B brushes we&#x27;ve been usin for bout 12 years</li>
            <li>So far it has worked well, you do have to recharge as soon as the lights come on</li>
            <li>but it was to sensitive in settings and gave it up but will use it for travel.</li>
            <li>so my dentist wants me to constantly use a rotary brush.</li>
            <li>Old stuff, indeed.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel SO MUCH cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Far inferior to a sonicare in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This purchase ended up going to my 8 year old son.  </li>
            <li>Using floss action head.</li>
            <li>Replaced an old Oral-B Vitality with this brush.</li>
            <li>B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]] which whitens and keeps polished your teeth</li>
            <li>This is particularly useful not only to not harm yourself but also to make brushes heads last longer.</li>
            <li>But I loved my old Braun brush before it finally died after at least ten years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That luxury alone is worth the additional $10-$20 I allegedly saved by buying here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  </li>
            <li>After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable base does not take up too much room, but I love the cover case over the top to protect from germs.</li>
            <li>In fact, the fact that this toothbrush even has multiple &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; or a brief pause every 30 seconds seems pointless as well, but not enough to subtract from the fact this toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth, and is less prone to mold growth than my old sonicare was.</li>
            <li>I put the new unit in the charger and left it for approximately 23 hours without the blinking light ever holding for the required 5 seconds the manual says indicates full charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Oral-B toothbrushes that worked just fine, but this one had an unacceptably short battery life.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush does work well at getting your teeth clean, but you end up with a slimy mess of saliva and toothpaste covering your hand and brush.  </li>
            <li>It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next</li>
            <li>, I wish I had gotten it a long time ago, does a much better job of cleaning your teeth in half the time.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste goo does dribble down the handle and leave a white circle on the counter-top every day, but it&#x27;s easily wiped up.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle for people with small hands.</li>
            <li>The charging unit is a lot smaller than the previous one, which is nice if you have limited counter space in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It could clean in between my teeth, thus leaving little to floss out.  </li>
            <li>One other feature that I didn&#x27;t expect to use was the pressure indicator, but apparently (according to the red light that comes on) I brush too hard most of the time?</li>
            <li>The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not.eak down too quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really miss the little extras that were on the first brush.  </li>
            <li>The red light keeps blinking as though the battery is low, but no matter how long I keep it on the charging unit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite certain it is for tracking purposes so they can then figure out what you spent it on in the desire to see what new spam and unsolicited junk mail they can start sending you.</li>
            <li>Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost.ch bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror</li>
            <li>But I suppose people with dental work might need multiple speeds, so I&#x27;m okay with the slight extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easier to clean a few plaque-prone areas.    </li>
            <li>Its round brush head enables you to surround each tooth for a tooth-by-tooth clean and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as older Oral-b models.  </li>
            <li>(vibrates once for the first switch, twice for the second switch, and 3 times for the third switch).  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and I can say that I&#x27;m never going back to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light -</li>
            <li>It has different speeds than my older one.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace an older electric toothbrush (Braun Excel 3D) and this is a big improvement!  </li>
            <li>The main difference would really be personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one because it has 3 different modes; normal, whitening and sensitive.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a little more expensive than I would have liked, but the functions of the toothbrush definitely make up for that.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve grown up with a lot of tacky looking cheap Japanese electronics that have survived 25+ years before being handed down to me</li>
            <li>but it is a sweet little tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It has three settings, High, Low, and pulse.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I recommend it highly</li>
            <li>Oral-B sells several other brushes, such as pro white (for better polish) and floss action.</li>
            <li>The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \\&quot;off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived.</li>
            <li>I found the pressure to be much harder in comparison,but luckily there are several settings.  </li>
            <li>This also has a red led light that lights up if you are brushing too hard - again, very valuable.</li>
            <li>The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have an LCD screen but it seems to be as powerful as my last more expensive model.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>At a first glance, not much has changed.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that the \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; is sent in the form of a pre-paid Procter &amp; Gamble debit card from Citibank, which comes with absolutely no indication that it is being sent in lieu of the promised rebate or in any way mentions Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>I had always been concerned about electric brushes being complicated and not much of an improvement over their manual cousin, however, my fears were quickly allayed as I found the Oral-b 3000 to be a fast and easy setup.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean it often, because the toothpaste residue dries on it often and makes it unpleasant to look at.</li>
            <li>but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want anything more complicated than this.</li>
            <li>The only feature I don&#x27;t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you&#x27;re using too much pressure when you brush.  </li>
            <li>Never the less the price is right and even if it is an older or discontinued model, if it has the same charateristics as the 3000</li>
            <li>this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  </li>
            <li>The  only drawback was that it takes a very long time to full charge, and it even took a while to have enough charge to use it.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush reaches those hard to reach areas that a manual toothbrush can&#x27;t get to easily.  </li>
            <li>is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren&#x27;t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base</li>
            <li>Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she&#x27;d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  </li>
            <li>new model is a definite step up from the ancient \\&quot;Plak Control Plus\\&quot; model that I had been using.</li>
            <li>BUT-I received 2 new toothbrushes to replace the 1 I sent back.</li>
            <li>None of the phone numbers on the card, the correspondence or on the Citibank pre-paid debit card actually work or if they do, do not allow you to reach a live customer service representative or leave a message.  </li>
            <li>After that I used the unit for 4 days before it required a new charge; 3 days short of its listed time usage.</li>
            <li>I thought that I did enough research to get a new one, and did.  </li>
            <li>When that one was new it went up to ten days.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Totally recommend to anyone considering purchasing a new or replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Purchsed the new brush that was not in current packaging.  </li>
            <li>The major difference is the newer one has 3 settings and a light that supposedly shows when you are brushing too hard (have never seen it and my gums are ultra sensitive.)</li>
            <li>love how this toothbrush indicates if you are brushing too hard!  </li>
            <li>One caveat:  Oral-B keeps changing the product line-up for the e-toothbrushes in ways that makes it harder than unusual to understand what you&#x27;re getting, and the Oral-B website isn&#x27;t as clear as it should be in explaining the line-up</li>
            <li>We went through 2 Oral B Pro brushes, the first set lasted a long time, the second did not</li>
            <li>The second is \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  </li>
            <li>I did this because her old electric toothbrush was too loud and it made me want to run outside and put my head in the snow.</li>
            <li>and the battery quickly drained and we had to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li>The battery should be easily replaceable; not as forced obsolescence.</li>
            <li>The pressure light on this is kind of annoying to me, but it is making me think about pressure.</li>
            <li>There are some gimmicky things that I&#x27;m not the least bit interested in, such as the sensor that determines if you&#x27;re brushing &#x27;too hard,&#x27; but overall this is an excellent product.     </li>
            <li>Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it has some serious power to clean!</li>
            <li>You can choose between them by pressing the only button once, twice or three times being the first one the standard daily cleaning, fi you press twice</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the next higher models do.  </li>
            <li>The last time I got my teeth cleaned the lady said that she could tell by looking at my teeth and gums that I used the Oral-B Professional brushes!</li>
            <li>The brush is very powerful, so it&#x27;s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is very powerful, so it&#x27;s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.    </li>
            <li>Ill have to check back after my next cleaning, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely top of the line (and better be, given how much it costs).&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 Professional Care is a sleek brush with a decent charging base, which is a little smaller than the Ultreo.</li>
            <li>The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used the other brush modes, but I can see how the slower sensitive setting might benefit some users.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with the toothbrush stopping due to to much pressure.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as older models</li>
            <li>I have owned many Braun electric toothbrushes and a few from other brands.</li>
            <li>The brush head is too large, meaning that I can&#x27;t keep my mouth closed around it when brushing my front teeth</li>
            <li>I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I&#x27;m distracted and in a hurry to get to work.</li>
            <li>This brush has changed how I clean my mouth and actually makes me WANT to go brush my teeth everyday.</li>
            <li>Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH.</li>
            <li>I confidently recommend this product; and particularly this model.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>mouth does feel pretty clean after each brushing, but the mess that is created outside is something less desirable.</li>
            <li>I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on</li>
            <li>I also like the light indicator that shows when you are brushing too hard and when it is time to recharge.  </li>
            <li>There is an indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>I like the light that comes on if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model also has a light to indicate if you are pushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>this works fine (the battery my earlier 3000 didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected), but the fact that I&#x27;m replacing it shows my satisfaction with it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend this product high enough.  </li>
            <li>Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The refill heads are available at most drug stores, but tend to be a little expensive.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B makes it easier to brush more consistently due to the fact that you receive a short pulse every 30 seconds to remind you to change the brushing area, and a slightly longer pulse at two minutes when finished.</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>In general, avoid spin type brushes.</li>
            <li>As this order was clearly for an Australian address the units supplied should have been supplied with 240v charge units therefore the units shipped are virtually unusable.</li>
            <li>Brushes last forever if you don&#x27;t mash them past the warning light.</li>
            <li>regular 2) sensitive 3) whitening.  </li>
            <li>figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now.</li>
            <li>A regular flosser, too (although not quite as frequently.)  </li>
            <li>Every 30 seconds the action pulses a bit, telling you to move to the next quarter of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It really feels like a powered toothbrush that was designed 5 yrs ago - not very refined.</li>
            <li>far as comparisons go, the Oral-b 3000 and CrossAction are like night and day, and I literally feel like I&#x27;m finally actually brushing my teeth -</li>
            <li>so apparently there&#x27;s a dental health issue here as well.</li>
            <li>so apparently there&#x27;s a dental health issue here as well.</li>
            <li>I recently received my Oral-B Professional Care 3000 toothbrush</li>
            <li>My old Vitality had a two minute timer, which I often didn&#x27;t make it all the way through, but with the 30 second timer it basically guilts you into doing the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B electric toothbrush finally died after some 10-15 years.  </li>
            <li>so you can barely feel it to turn it off.</li>
            <li>Which was enough to cover the cost of the sensitive replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which was enough to cover the cost of the sensitive replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well, my 10-year old Braun finally died, so I had to replace it.</li>
            <li>The indicator glows red frequently for me.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd Oral-b 3000 professional that I have returned.  </li>
            <li>This makes a noticeable difference, and with extra brush heads my 12 year old is using it also.  </li>
            <li>Do not understand why Oral-B decided to remove a feature that is so vital to anyone who travels internationally.</li>
            <li>The 4000 and 5000 are the same size but way too far in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I like the 30 second intervals and the two minute timer, which was also on my old one.  </li>
            <li>Big improvement over the old Oral B tooth brush I have had say for maybe 50 years?  </li>
            <li>I like the features such as the timer that lets you know when 30 seconds has passed and when the 2 minutes is complete.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]], which oddly enough</li>
            <li>Still like the Sonicare - but gave the two old hand units with several heads to grandkids.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered the Pro-White heads for my toothbrush which I&#x27;ll be reviewing in the near future.</li>
            <li>only negatives are that it blinks a lot (after every use) and it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>My teeth has never been cleaner and the battery last a lot longer than my old one.</li>
            <li>I prefer the sensitive mode, and occasionally use the whiting mode.  </li>
            <li>Recently got this one to replace a really old one I had and</li>
            <li>I should have expected as much given</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush several months ago.</li>
            <li>After using this electric toothbrush for a few weeks, I went for a deep cleaning of my gums (which were recommended at my first visit) and my gums had tightened and the gaps were smaller so much so the dental hygienist couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old ones.  </li>
            <li>I went and bought a regular, old fashioned</li>
            <li>Plus, it has 3 speeds: regular, sensitive, and whitening.</li>
            <li>I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li>and I end up with the middle selection, which I believe is for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare goes for $35 for 2 standard (old models), $25 for 3 compact (newer models) at time of writing.  </li>
            <li>Apparently i&#x27;ve been brushing incorrectly (my dentist said so) and needed to use circular motion.</li>
            <li>Apparently there is a quiz that oral b put out</li>
            <li>No regrets what so ever.</li>
            <li>Poor design in so many ways.</li>
            <li>This kind of brushes tends to fail because of the battery</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for approximately 3 weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li>And it is true that the battery lasts 10 days, not the usual overdeclared figure given by manufacturers of everything that has a battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe I was wrong, but it would be nice to have a travel case along with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric toothbrush because the models I&#x27;ve tried have been too irritating.  </li>
            <li>I got so fed up with the poor performance and dated battery technology that I gave up on this oral-b and bought a Sonicare, even though I had many unused brush heads for the oral-</li>
            <li>All you need to do is hold down the power button for more than a second and it shuts down.  </li>
            <li>Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice to have a dedicated off switch, but its not that big a deal to hold the button down for an extra half second.</li>
            <li>Initially, I liked them because I was lazy and didn&#x27;t brush often enough much less correctly.  </li>
            <li>My vitality&#x27;s battery was getting a little weak also, but I still consider the vitality a good toothbrush for what you pay for</li>
            <li>The price seems high for the unit, however, they are offering a $10.00 gift card for a limited time.</li>
            <li>As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down.</li>
            <li>There are a few other settings that we haven&#x27;t used, because the basic setting was more than serviceable.</li>
            <li>it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  </li>
            <li>My other fairly new Sonic lately does not seem to be lasting more than 1-2 days per charge.</li>
            <li>Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit.</li>
            <li>It has 3 cleaning modes, but I usually stick with the daily clean and the whitening one.</li>
            <li>, if I press too hard, but it&#x27;s a good idea, I didn&#x27;t realize that in some areas, I was brushing too hard before.  </li>
            <li>and I really see no difference other than the size of the head.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other electric toothbrushes, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is working very well for me.</li>
            <li>I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel significantly cleaner with this new brush, especially in the back where it is hard to clean all the way, and also the inside of my front bottom teeth where it&#x27;s hard to sweep back and forth.</li>
            <li>I like the red warning light that comes on when I press too hard.</li>
            <li>Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I feel like the red light comes on at too hard applied pressure.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>it has a red light that lights up if you press too hard-</li>
            <li>but it has a red flashing light close to your eyes if you brush too hard.  </li>
            <li>I like the red light that comes on to warn you that you are pushing too hard.</li>
            <li>Rinse it well and dry it, and it&#x27;ll look like new for seemingly forever.</li>
            <li>My vitality is 2 years old and the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long at all anymore, but it has never died completely.</li>
            <li>After using this Oral-b 3K for a few weeks I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>My old unit is in storage and probably won&#x27;t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to get it removed (because it doesn&#x27;t cause me any pain), but wisdom teeth are harder to scrub in a tiny mouth without much room.</li>
            <li>A light on the board slowly faded and it finally died.  </li>
            <li>It does what previous reviews say on the positive side.  </li>
            <li>The brush head has a round big bump on its back and is much \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; than the normal brush heads that I&#x27;m used to(including all the manual and the Sonicare brush heads</li>
            <li>Other than orange pressure and improved battery/charging indicators, it feels and looks largely the same as predecessors.    </li>
            <li>I doubt I will use anything other than the daily clean mode and it has taken adjustment to have to cycle through the two other modes to turn the brush off.  </li>
            <li>but this is how long it says it will last on the box) while their older models last two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always nice to know if you&#x27;re pressing hard enough to wear down your enamel!</li>
            <li>I would usually turn the brush back on and hit my tongue and a quick once over the gums again.  </li>
            <li>What I also like about this brush is that it lights up if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure, which is very important if you have issues with gum recession (brushing too hard, or not brushing hard enough, can contribute to receding gumlines).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, there is a red indicator light on the back of the brush that lets you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>The red light tells me when I press too hard and the three different speeds covers all types of cleaning requirements.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the red light that comes on telling me I&#x27;m brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>The three controls (fast, less fast, and slow) are a help, and I never use the fast speed, even though the manufacturer claims that&#x27;s &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this one to replace a 3 year old one because I had to charge the old one every other day.</li>
            <li>has 3 different modes; regular, sensitive, and extra whitening.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to this, have flicker vertigo, migraines or seizures</li>
            <li>This is the second Oral-B Professional tooth brush that I have purchased in the last several years.</li>
            <li>While it lacks features such as the external monitor that the 5000 model has, it covers all the bases by offering a basic timer and a sensitive mode,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both, and find the smaller size of the Oral-B heads plus the fact that Oral-B makes an extra soft head gives Oral-B the upper hand for my needs.</li>
            <li>The first few times using it were a bit jarring because it sort of feels like a jackhammer on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Had a few problems withe recharging - first charge took forever, not hours but couple of days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and powerful.</li>
            <li>Also mentioned they could see the first signs of gingivitis, which scared me because I brush my teeth everyday.</li>
            <li>Also, due to the small toothbrush head, you use about half the amount of toothpaste as you would on a normal brush, but with way more efficiency.  </li>
            <li>This was clearly an issue for me because the first time I used this brush, it was telling me I was brushing way too hard to begin with.</li>
            <li>of use&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Value price vs other high end models&lt;</li>
            <li>of use&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Value price vs other high end models&lt;</li>
            <li>This way the brushes dry out completely before being used again.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve now used for 14 two minute cycles on an initial charge of less than 4 hours and it isn&#x27;t even showing the light that it is at 50% or less of charge yet.</li>
            <li>This is pretty minor, not worth taking off a star.</li>
            <li>(my last electric toothbrush lasted barely 6 months, but it was ten years ago...).</li>
            <li>It not only takes up more space on your sink with it attached, it also promotes water/bacteria around the base if you&#x27;re switching heads frequently since the heads most likely won&#x27;t be dried out when you switch them</li>
            <li>It not only takes up more space on your sink with it attached, it also promotes water/bacteria around the base if you&#x27;re switching heads frequently since the heads most likely won&#x27;t be dried out when you switch them</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it repeatedly complained (the red light flashed) because I was brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>even though the brush head looks compact, it isnt as easy to maneuver behind your back teeth.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain.the Oral B are cheaper, but i&#x27;ve yet to see how often they break.</li>

            <li>The third is \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \\&quot;Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two.</li>
            <li>I have to wonder why they stopped using the old system with no light, just a charging indicator, given that they have put such short lived batteries in the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It might be a little intense for kids</li>
            <li>Had other Lower powered ones before, but got this when I needed a new one</li>
            <li>warning when you press too hard is handy, and basically trains you how hard to press.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner, and I always get compliments from my dentist about how little plaque I actually have on my teeth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This toothbrush with its \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums &amp; your teeth, and in turn, your health &amp; well-being!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for the price, it&#x27;s still a great toothbrush that makes your teeth feel well-loved.</li>

            <li> it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> toothbrush works great</li>
            <li> It is a great choice for oral health care.  </li>
            <li> Works great, it&#x27;s not a sonic care, so if you are used to sonic speed, you might not like this.</li>
            <li> The unit works great</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it takes forever to charge, otherwise great toothbrush ---</li>
            <li> I will say that the combination worked great and he managed to greatly improve his gum health in just a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it and thats all that counts.</li>
            <li> This one is great for me -- I prefer the rotating head compared to her vibrating-type.  </li>
            <li> The monitor for time is great and the preasure sensor helps to.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> I consider this item to a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great buy when paired with the polishing brush head</li>
            <li> works great....</li>
            <li> The charging stand is great, don&#x27;t have to plug anything in...</li>
            <li> #34;looks great, keep it up whatever you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> but it feels great on my teeth and does a great job cleaning them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but i am happy i made the switch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is great for both units.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is great for both units.  </li>
            <li> In my case (Russia) I had to look for the lowing adapter and happily found it.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Seems well made and looks attractive.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have our preferences on the heads yet, but they all seem to do a great job.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B since they came out and still happy with it after all these years.</li>
            <li> Obviously a great product but after 70 years using a brush it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> all the time lol.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Both items were great.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels great when done and 2min.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> lol lol</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist - great results.</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>

            <li> It does a GREAT job and is all I</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice.</li>
            <li> Great awesome good quality well made we really enjoy it excellent purchase</li>
            <li> It cleans very effectively and is well made.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li> All-in-all, the Oral-b 3000 is a product with which I think you&#x27;d be quite pleased; but, as I said, it is not, in my opinion, the best electric toothbrush system on the market.</li>
            <li> My gums feel awesome and healthy.      </li>
            <li> Nice job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Power Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> If, however, you are like me and find reasons to delay your visit, the Oral-B might be the best choice as it does a better job at cleaning.</li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> It has a great compact size, while still providing a good handle that feels substantial in your hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, there are a couple of ways to look at this fine product, the best would be that it can greatly improve your health by providing a good oral hygienic product.  </li>
            <li> They do a wonderful job keeping my teeth clean and my gums stimulated!</li>
            <li> and it was easily the best brush I had ever used.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B products are reliable and have great products for a healthy mouth!</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product and more people should buy it</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Braun I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the $20 plug-in Oral-B brush before, which I thought I loved, until I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> and the charge lasts a good week even when using the brush twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Since this Oral-B toothbrush is made by Braun, I felt good about ordering it.</li>
            <li> It met my expectation of a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The build quality seems good to me.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, and brush holder device that comes with it is well designed.</li>
            <li> it cleans good voice  </li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> It lasts good.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to say that I like how this works, the warning light gives you indication if you are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Owned an Oral-b and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The brush unit&#x27;s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn&#x27;t notice a decrease in power.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, perfect.    </li>
            <li> The lower cost of the replacement brush heads and a good sale price also factored into my decision to try out this brush.  </li>
            <li> My gums feel good and I have gum issues.  </li>
            <li> in all, it is a good brush.  </li>
            <li> Replaces one that &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after years of good service.</li>
            <li> * good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go 6 weeks without taking good care of teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day.</li>
            <li> It is for my workmates,and he say it is good</li>
            <li> That may be good for children</li>
            <li> Item shipped as ordered, arrived in good condition and product works as manufacturer suggests.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After checking in with my periodontist, she was delighted at the improvement to my gums and I can see a noticeable difference as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so I was good with the 3000.</li>
            <li> and I could have saved myself from going nuts for a good couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Good selection of brush heads to meet just about any need&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> good thing</li>
            <li> I have used the Spinbrush for years and loved its results.  </li>
            <li> Guess the 40,000 oscillations is about twice as good as the 20,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is lighter and slimmer then the one it replaced, which are good things.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone looking for oral health and a really good tool for brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I get good dental hygiene comments.  </li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted - and a good buy.</li>
            <li> This product is much superior compare to manual or battery operated toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush and loved the way it cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li> My hygienist complimented me on how good my teeth and gums looked.</li>
            <li> Good quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She keeps using it, so it must be working good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just thinner diameter wise.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go in about an</li>
            <li> This was good to know</li>
            <li> The price and product are good.</li>
            <li> The 3 operating modes are all good</li>
            <li> B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that both models are exceptionally good.  </li>
            <li> Both of these models are fairly neat.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Does a really good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good toothbrush that gets compromised by the battery technology Braun is using.</li>
            <li> Got good feedback from my dental office after using the product.  </li>
            <li> The built in timer and pressure indicator light are also excellent features.</li>
            <li> Priced fairly.</li>
            <li> used to be a good unit.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> This gives my teeth an excellent clean.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses the [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] and says it&#x27;s the best brush she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very easy to do the 2 minute cycle, which the dentist should be happy about.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not too much to say here - include a carrying case, and this would be perfect, but as-is its a great buy regardless.</li>
            <li> I always get a good report from the dentist, but this tooth brush is so much better than that!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very bright light,</li>
            <li> Very good brush, light in weight but working well.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush</li>
            <li> I chose the 3000 model, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> She is very glad with it.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is very healthy for your gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush after reading the great reviews on Amazon and am quite pleased with my purchase.    </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this newer model of the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the device.</li>
            <li> All in all, for what my needs are and the price of the toothbrush, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just used the product and was very satisfied, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> works great:-)</li>
            <li> Have used Oral-Bs for years and have always been very pleased.</li>
            <li> This Pro Health model has so many great features, including the quadrant cleaning timer and the pressure sensor.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Nice and bright and reminds me not to brush so forecfully.</li>
            <li> very glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> and I have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because while I think it&#x27;s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s a toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and so does our dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!</li>

            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for even better reviews at the Dentist office!</li>
            <li> and I like this one (the 3000) better!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> My dentist is going to be so pleased!</li>
            <li> so I decided to upgrade and, boy, am I ever glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love Braun Oral B toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li> (I love my coffee!).</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My teeth are glad to have this one!</li>
            <li> They love it and say that it whitens teeth!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree more!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE ORAL-B BRUSH!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> but I am in love!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK,I love it!</li>
            <li> It does a great job, easy to use</li>
            <li> Making the leap from cheap manual toothbrushes to the electric Oral-B 3000 has been a joy.</li>
            <li> I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I must say this is an amazing purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I used it was amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing device.  </li>
            <li> The variety of brushes to choose are great and they fit on any model.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  </li>
            <li> With that said, the circular brush is actually really effective.</li>
            <li> The charging stand is contact-less, which is a nice feature for something meant to be around water.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to see if I could remove surface stains on my own without the office visit hassle.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Handle feels nice in hand.  </li>
            <li> Nice item.</li>
            <li> I can really feel that my tooth r very clean !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the &#x27;timer&#x27; function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits.</li>
            <li> This is also nice, as manyof us tend to hurry through our brushing routine.</li>
            <li> I liked how the timer indicates each thirty seconds</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the difference this toothbrush has made in my teeth and gums is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I just liked the 2 minute auto shut off the soniccare</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor light is handy and my hygienist seemed happy about this feature as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> but I find it&#x27;s nice to use both.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was good, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> really liked my Oral-B Pulsonic but Braun</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they were user replaceable though..</li>
            <li> Would be nice if the product description specified power supply information.</li>
            <li> I am going through the process of printing yet another label and making yet another trip, at my own expense, to drop off the toothbrush sent to me in error.</li>
            <li> We currently own 3 Oral B electric toothbrushes (including the 3000 model).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked them all</li>
            <li> Honestly, I floss after using the brush and there is nothing to floss because it cleans my teeth that thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have plaque build-up issues, and I didn&#x27;t feel that the Sonicare was cleaning my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted an electric toothbrush (not just the spinbrush kind either).  </li>
            <li> Liked everything else and would buy again if it just would hold a charge, but they were sold out.</li>
            <li> (yep, I am that kind of person).</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I feel the Sonicare is a bargain in comparison to the oral-B.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my wife and she liked it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really effectively.</li>
            <li> toothbrush&#x27;s timer feature is also nice, helping you brush all four sections of your mouth for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The buzz every 30 seconds is also a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professiona is as good or better than the Oral-B I had for 8 Years</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own one try it.</li>
            <li> doing!&amp;#34;  Kind of anti climactic if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It has 3 speeds which is nice</li>
            <li> I honestly feel that my teeth are cleaner after brushing compared to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided upon this model and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Oscillating heads tend to be better for gums, vibrating heads are all around good.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice to have something to tell you when you&#x27;ve passed the recommended minimum brushing</li>
            <li> and i really liked it.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush and think it works great, but I charge it a lot more often than I&#x27;d like to admit...</li>
            <li> It also feels like a nice massage on my gums.</li>
            <li> Nice features and performs as designed.  </li>
            <li> good product, also purchased better model and cheaper from Costco.</li>
            <li> You have to buy your own.</li>
            <li> I also own the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and feels great.</li>
            <li> - My teeth feels great and clean though.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and will surely  insure a smile for many years with all your teeth intact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> After using this new one for over 3 weeks, I think it is superb:  </li>
            <li> This new model is awesome - there are two speeds</li>
            <li> Perfect time to switch to a new brush.</li>
            <li> The vibration every 30 seconds makes it easy to know that you are doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to damage the battery if you don&#x27;t manage the discharge/charge cycles correctly.</li>
            <li> I love the better features!</li>
            <li> This is a good product that seems to clean effectively.</li>
            <li> More effective for me than sonic care.</li>
            <li> timer is nice if you want to be sure you&#x27;re brushing the recommended</li>
            <li> suitable for anyone.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful &amp; the brush gives your gums a great massage in addition to digging out any food particles that might remain between your teeth.</li>
            <li> but this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Powerful, does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> I love details so the case to hold the brushes is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the brushing action.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, then the oscillating head will probably be the best choice.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action is excellent.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
            <li> and now that i own the Oral-B 3000 i can say there is an notable upgrade in the cleaning and shining of the teeth.</li>
            <li> The first week after use confirmed that I had made an excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for many, many years and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> the new and latest brush is also great!  </li>
            <li> I love love love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, super easy to bring on a trip in a light bag, stand the charge for a good time, even though it does take some time to charge...</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great toothbrush with some great design improvements.</li>
            <li> And, there are also optional items that are needed because the Oral B DOESN&#x27;T clean between teeth and by itself does not satisfy the need for a good tongue</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results and am recommending it to anyone else who is in the market for an effective, moderately priced electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do an excellent job at cleaning teeth, but there is one major issue with them.  </li>
            <li> The condition is very good and it cleaned my teeh 10 times bettter than the normal tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Oral-B-ie - powerful, inexpensive, nice kit!</li>
            <li> It did not hold a charge from the first time I plugged it in--returned it for a sonicare,which I am happy with</li>
            <li> We loved our original Oral-B&#x27;s and had them for many years until this model was a \\&quot;Gold Box\\&quot; deal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, &amp; healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon).</li>
            <li> My oral hygiene is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Tie (higher price Oral B with more features, great value for Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tie (higher price Oral B with more features, great value for Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is a quick overview of the good and</li>
            <li> nice settings and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the easy availability of replacement brushes and the excellent cleaning action of the brush, we would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Light and Compact, easy to hold with a good grip.    </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and even polished after a brush, the sensation of the brush is actually pleasant and the brush is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-b 3000 electric toothbrush system is very easy to use and does a quite effective job in leaving your teeth feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t think that the pressure detector works in my unit, but I keep a light touch, anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Oral-B brushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love the pressure sensor and the timer.  </li>
            <li> and I love the power</li>
            <li> My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and did a better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am extremely pleased with the quality and performance of this brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> As you can see a lot more pros than cons, will be using this for awhile.</li>
            <li> and I feel better after every brush.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best purchase in quiet a while.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> if anything notable happens I will update this post.  </li>
            <li> I figure that I am like most people when it comes to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> better and stronger spin.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Like I said before I love the brush, but it did take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The pressure indicator light is especially useful for someone like me, who tends to flatten toothbrush heads in a week.</li>
            <li> I brush more often and for longer with the Oral-b.  </li>
            <li> and it sprays water everywhere through the top of the brush head.</li>
            <li> I do for many things, I began researching and reading reviews here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but I can tell you, I love this features.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> The three brushing settings are fun to use, so I brush more thorough now which is good.</li>
            <li> Heaps better than your nonelectric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> (They love it too.)  </li>
            <li> Am looking forward to many years of thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> This means the more brushes you get in (across all of your teeth)</li>
            <li> the better you are cleaning them.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-b brush  for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break.</li>
            <li> I love the pauses that tell me to move on to another section, and</li>
            <li> but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \\&quot;I bet you haven&#x27;t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\\</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for.    </li>
            <li> My teeth feel more polished, but that&#x27;s just about</li>
            <li> But, in the end, healthy teeth and gums are the goal</li>
            <li> + 100% better cleaning when compared to manual brushing.    </li>
            <li> But, in the end, healthy teeth and gums are the goal</li>
            <li> Have used many electric toothbrushes ...</li>
            <li> But after many years of use, it died.  </li>
            <li> Wanted another to replace it, so we ordered the 3000 and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would buy it again after I wear it out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The motion of this model is much more along the lines of what I need from an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I cover my gum line all across the top and bottom teeth then go over my teeth</li>
            <li> That is desined for more plaque removal.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing a interesting things.</li>
            <li> I was out on business travel and combined family travel, was gone for a month, and was no longer able to return the item.</li>
            <li> The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.    </li>
            <li> but I think I prefer it this way because I often spend more than 2 minutes on my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this product, be sure to test it out before the warranty runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time around I didn&#x27;t wish to spend more than the Pro Care 3000 cost.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc.</li>
            <li> The timer is a great idea to keep you from spending too much time in one area of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I still think I like the way the sonic care cleans better</li>
            <li> but I do like this brush more and more.  </li>
            <li> Been using these for many many years.  </li>
            <li> priced better than my DDS doc&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> There is a variety of many brush heads to choose from.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist suggested one of these years ago and my checkups are much better.</li>
            <li> There are better brushes for you gums.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel better already</li>
            <li> AFTER USING THIS ONE, IT WAS OK</li>
            <li> YES THE SONICARE IS BETTER</li>
            <li> ITS NOT A ROTATING CIRCLE HEAD IS BETTER THAN THE ORAL</li>
            <li> Like the rounded top head</li>
            <li> This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious</li>
            <li> the Oral-B 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overpriced, $73.45, now $88.95, Oral-B Pro 3000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush does not have a replaceable battery, so I&#x27;ll have to trash it even though everything else seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> -B rep said that both models have the 2-minute timer with 30-second signals, one of the better features of the Pro 3000.</li>
            <li> and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For longer trips I love the compactness of the charge base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply the best electric toothbrush I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I do think that more than one brush should be included for this price.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 speeds, the adjustments every 30 seconds and the simplicity of the charger.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth the different speeds &amp; controls.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Had I more faith in electric brushes, I would have bought this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays charged for the longest time, and I enjoy storing my toothbrush head in the covered container!</li>
            <li> MY dentist appointments are much better because my brushing is better.</li>
            <li> My gums look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> will  love  it.</li>
            <li> By the way, my triplet grandchildren love to use it when they come over.  </li>
            <li> Not jaded - just a consumer who has learned better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an oral B for more than 15 years and am just now replacing it.</li>
            <li> Been through 3 handles and who knows how many heads.</li>
            <li> but this is even better.</li>
            <li> Just kidding, but the motor on this one has more RPMs and that makes my teeth feel better.  </li>
            <li> &quot; any time soon, I am satisfied with the switch.&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love this one even more.</li>
            <li> Decided to try the Oral-B and found it better.  </li>
            <li> your mouth - Rota-Dent&#x27;s slide switch is better</li>
            <li> bottom line is if you go regularly to your dentist for a cleaning the Rota-Dent is probably the best choice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months now, and I love it because I could tell the difference when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This device also lets you make sure that you brush for the 2-minute time recommended :)</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric brush, I love it</li>
            <li> Returned it found a better deal</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Works better than my sonic care tooth brush</li>
            <li> Works many times better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> In addition, I love the timer-</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and it has worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a great brush that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of use</li>
            <li> Even better than the dentist....</li>
            <li> Guess it works OK, I just feel like I can give more pressure with my hand and a brush.</li>
            <li> 3 months after purchasing, the battery lasts for 36 hours at most.  </li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My gums are staying healthy, post-gingivectomy and with this regimen.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are healthy, but after just one brushing with this toothbrush, they feel noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Great product, i would highly recommend the upgrade!</li>
            <li> The head is perfectly sized to get around all my teeth and all the way to the back of my mouth with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brush cleans much better than Sonicare, since it spins rather than vibrates.</li>
            <li> but this one is better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleaning has more power than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Takes care of your teeth better between six month check ups at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> always a favorite the toothbrush  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t requiring twenty more words is foolish</li>
            <li> It has more power</li>
            <li> I looked at many of the electric toothbrushes, and decided on the Oral B 3000.  </li>
            <li> better yet, I haven&#x27;t noticed any drop off in performance.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Make sure that when you dispose of this unit or batteries you do it at a recycling</li>
            <li> I made sure that there was SOME way I could replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this model.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of electric toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> I used an Interplak for many years and it was okay.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Well designed, no nasty cleanup in any parts.</li>
            <li> All kinda of replacement heads available!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B did a much better job of massaging and cleaning my gums to keep them healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it ...</li>
            <li> love the power ... would recommend....</li>
            <li> The product was received without any damage (great packaging) and fast service.</li>
            <li> the product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Another great plus was that I was able to purchase this item much cheaper from Amazon than from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I missed a better deal.</li>
            <li> Love the holder</li>
            <li> This brush configuration has been popular for years and does a fantastic job as a rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I love the adjustable levels of power.  </li>
            <li> Even better.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> This is a billion times better.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than the Sonicare I had for 10+ years.</li>
            <li> This combination couldn&#x27;t be smoother, nor more efficient.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the descriptions and features the Oral B 3000 has.  </li>
            <li> P&amp;G rebates, like most nowadays, come in the form of a debit style card.</li>
            <li> so I knew I would be pleased with this.</li>
            <li> so I can get a better model.</li>
            <li> wasnt sure about the oral b.....</li>
            <li> Read more on the Oral B site.  </li>
            <li> Many Sonic ones I was looking at did not have this feature.  </li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, with 30 second timers to help me move along from side to side.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have owned many electronic toothbrushes and none compare.</li>
            <li> I love my teeth and want to retain them</li>
            <li> :)  Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also it seems that the oscillating heads are better at cleaning teeth while the sonic vibrating seems to polish and lighten better.  </li>
            <li> There is also a &#x27;whitening&#x27; setting, which polished the tooth more, but is a bit aggressive on gums.  </li>
            <li> Oral B has one of my favorite features, a sensitivity warning.  </li>
            <li> Even replacement heads are more than most manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Even replacement heads are more than most manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a better model</li>
            <li> I had that lasted many years.</li>
            <li> I am glad I chose the 3000.</li>
            <li> This one scrubs more and better.</li>
            <li> so glad I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and my dentist is more than pleased.</li>
            <li> So much better than manually brushing in circles.</li>
            <li> Sure wish there were some way to turn it off.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews and disagree with some.  </li>
            <li> I rind that it is much easier to do a great job of brushing your teeth if you&#x27;re using a power brush like this one.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each use these and love them.  </li>
            <li> It works great, and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> and I would tell you this device is outstanding.</li>
            <li> OK can I have my $50.00 now</li>
            <li> There is hardly a better toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just, okay.  </li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush and will get the replacement heads like the one it comes with.</li>
            <li> Much better than I hoped.</li>
            <li> My guy needs another one and this is the top brand.</li>
            <li> regardless of the brand, electric toothbrushes are worlds better at cleaning teeth than manual brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get into electric toothbrushing without spending a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mostly for the timer.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had come with more brushes to try out.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did</li>
            <li> The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  </li>
            <li> This was a gift, well liked, very powerful.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush except on/off button requires being pushed just right with some finger pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light, holds a long charge and has the power I was looking for;  the price was also great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing clean feeling after you brush.</li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t prepared for the kind of clean a electric brush would bring over a manual.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush, refills are a lil xpensive, but closest thing to a dentist office clean out there.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Light is very easy to see as it lights up.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it to my sister and her husband have gotten one since ive told em my experience.same tooth brush sells for 100$ at walmart so also a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great brush; highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> My first Sonic Care I loved</li>
            <li> I have used some of the cheaper powered brushes and thought they had done an pretty good job at cleaning my teeth and reducing plaque build up.</li>
            <li> After some time searching, I found a pretty good deal on this model elsewhere and ordered.  </li>
            <li> Happy with the new one.</li>
            <li> Great brush  much better than  my five year old oral b</li>
            <li> /&gt;Counter space is important, and surprisingly the Oral B wins.  </li>
            <li> It made picking the 3000 model an easy choice and on top of that, there was a twenty dollar off coupon on it.</li>
            <li> It made picking the 3000 model an easy choice and on top of that, there was a twenty dollar off coupon on it.</li>
            <li> Replaced my older brush - works great and the &amp;#34;Brushing too hard&amp;#34; light is my favorite feature.  </li>
            <li> I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> My gums used to be very sensitive and sometimes bleed from brushing and this has greatly improved my oral health.</li>
            <li> Our dentists sees the positive results in cleanliness and good gum margins.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth more than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I normally do not respond to reviews ,however this machine is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> I like it because I can get replacement brushes for very cheap; even target has cheap replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I have tried this brand new Oral B toothbrush, and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure both brands do just fine for cleaning teeth</li>
            <li> Still working fine after being used 2 times a day since August 2012, much better than non-electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and look whiter than ever!</li>
            <li> Mouth feels tingly clean!</li>
            <li> It certainly can give your gums a good</li>
            <li> Best clean I&#x27;ve ever had outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.    </li>
            <li> It is great much easier to charge and keep clean.</li>
            <li> Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> toothbrush came with a very good standard brush head</li>
            <li> Other than those 2 nuisances, it works flawlessly and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how the Oral-B brush removes the stains and whitens his smile.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really happy with the 3000 Professional.  </li>
            <li> I think the light is more of a gimmick than anything else.  </li>
            <li> Replacement handles are relatively cheap when compared to the set.&lt;br /&gt;+ 100% better cleaning when compared to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that the Braun site is any better as it cannot be accessed with its available links.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> But this Oral B has a sensitive teeth setting and is really great for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied, and my teeth feel super clean now.</li>
            <li> I bought this nearly 2 years ago and still works great.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B handle has a slim profile which is much more comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Poor</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth better than a Rota-Dent leaving them smooth</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is a cool and interesting toothbrush with an electronic face that motivates you to finish brushing until it smiles :)</li>
            <li> a cool product, you ll love it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my old Oral-B since it gave up on me after many many years of good use.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush to replace my old one that died - and this is great.</li>
            <li> Works very  well, good power and holds charge.</li>
            <li> I am not a toothbrush expert but it works really fast and good.</li>
            <li> I really feel good when I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, clean, efficient - just a breeze!</li>
            <li> Amazing price if you buy it at the right times.  </li>
            <li> The 30 sec timing is a great feature that I wouldn&#x27;t have elected to have, but glad it has it!</li>
            <li> Kind of loud but love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li> I like the rotating brush head better than the side to side motion of the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush, had read other reviews that people were having problems with &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; on the power-pack, this isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> The light cannot be turned off and it is very bright and very red.</li>
            <li> they seem to clean better and be easier on the teeth.</li>
            <li> B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head]] or in most stores.</li>
            <li> The circular motion seems to clean teeth better than a vibrating brush.  </li>
            <li> so it is easy to see.  </li>
            <li> so it is easy to see.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use electric brush.</li>
            <li> I do love how clean and polished this leaves my teeth</li>
            <li> and I am glad to have the more powerful model vs the 1000</li>
            <li> THEY CLEAN BETTER</li>
            <li> rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)</li>
            <li> rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call sleek or pretty as opposed to the high-end models that look pretty attractive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts about a week before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> This an easy to operate Oral-B brush.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying it because I wanted a better way to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to manuver.</li>
            <li> So important for a pre-teen that is too old to want help brushing but isn&#x27;t great at it.</li>
            <li> Directions are easy to follow and within two minutes you are done brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> The setup is really easy.</li>
            <li> Charges though an induction circuit (I believe that is what it is called) which makes recharging the batter about as easy as possible&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The feature I appreciate the most in this toothbrush is how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love the speed selection and the clean feeling</li>
            <li> and I love that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t quite so easy to do since this deal combined a Gold Box buy with a factory rebate (one per address).  </li>
            <li> You can use it in the shower and remove and switch the brush head easily.</li>
            <li> Its now easy to brush teeth for that period of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Setup was quite easy, just attach the brush head with one click, charge the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love how clean my mouth feels after each use.</li>
            <li> Powerfull &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My son  gets stains on his teeth easily.  </li>
            <li> and it is better clean for your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Granted, this is a light up function, so you need to be brushing in front of a mirror to really get a good view of it.  </li>
            <li> It was a pain to clean and would require a Q-tip most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush  - love the timer which reminds you to move to the next section of teeth.</li>
            <li> if you want to better clean your teeth you should have this.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a week and the battery is still going strong with no need to recharge.  </li>
            <li> This 3000 works as good as my older Braun</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, I loved my older Oral-B</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit strong armed</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve now had this unit for five years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also very happy with how long one full charge of the battery can last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong, maybe too strong.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s head is smaller and fits easier into the mouth, and it cleans and polishes beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This is my first e brush, and i am loving every bit of it.</li>
            <li> Maybe 4 or 5 years ago I became aware of the Oral-B brand and that they claimed to effectively \\&quot;floss\\&quot; as well.  </li>
            <li> good price to buy, and clean the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> particular model is by far the best one I have purchased so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything is good about the new one except for one thing.  </li>
            <li> She loved the new unit and still has it today after 2 years.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare did its job just fine.</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the noise I was fine with it.</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush it works fine.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush I could feel the difference with the nice smooth feeling that you have when you leave the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I checked the charging stations and they were fine.</li>
            <li> and it is fine.</li>
            <li> The package was fine....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been real.package was fine....</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush it works fine and cleans my teeth well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kept the charge just fine with no dip in power.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a fine job of cleaning  teeth.  </li>
            <li> this model works just fine for us.</li>
            <li> The cleaning it gives me is fine</li>
            <li> I thought I was just fine with my regularl one.  </li>
            <li> AND SHE LIKES IT FINE.</li>
            <li> Have owned cheaper electric toothbrushes which were fine</li>
            <li> Did research and this works just fine.</li>
            <li> super item and service!</li>
            <li> tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good replacement for my old Oral-B (which lasted about 6 years!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to stand up.</li>
            <li> Had an older version that I loved and this one will be easier to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> This brush works very well and has a nice holder (a bit large maybe but still nice).</li>
            <li> I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this</li>
            <li> but there is one huge issue.</li>
            <li> So this is basically a huge step up for me either way</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a huge improvement in the health of her teeth.  </li>
            <li> The stuttering sound is just the handle telling you that 30 seconds have elapsed.</li>
            <li> After a week with this toothbrush I can just say I enjoy every minute.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has some nice features to help you know how much to brush.  </li>
            <li> Dual available at Costco, wish for 2 brush is at a comparable cost</li>
            <li> i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get the light flashing as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish there were a way to make the light come on at a lower pressure.  </li>
            <li> Have owned basic Braun elect.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Red\\&quot; light alerts you to when brushing too firmly.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re able to afford this system, it will deliver cleaner teeth and fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re able to afford this system, it will deliver cleaner teeth and fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> Works well, and without all the extra features I did not want, this level is great.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap version of this brush for about three years and it died.  </li>
            <li> I want it to specifically hit along my gum line and this model&#x27;s round head does that perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The storage area is easy to keep clean too.  </li>
            <li> My teeth just don&#x27;t feel as smooth as when I use the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t depend on the light whatsoever to let me know when it&#x27;s done charging.  </li>
            <li> but advanced.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Holds its charge, easy to clean,</li>
            <li> I think for the cost of this toothbrush, that is a bit cheap</li>
            <li> I had used an Oral-b electric brush before, but it&#x27;s been about 5 years and the one I had used was a relatively cheap brush.</li>
            <li> Equate brush heads that are supposed to fit Oral-B&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is much quieter than the newer Sonicare brush I own.  </li>
            <li> What was important to me was that it was an Oral B</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice feature, but something I really don&#x27;t find the need for.  </li>
            <li> Works great and like the  the 30 second reminder that it gives.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The same applies: Great product, competitive price, convenience.</li>
            <li> I like the warning light that turns on when you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Repeadedly, she told me how much she liked it and how I should get one for myself.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It works and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor light will keep you from over brushing and damaging enamel.</li>
            <li> BTW: even after a month of trickle charge the charging light hasn&#x27;t stopped blinking.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is lightweight, and fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the brushes do the same great job.</li>
            <li> And if it is as reliable as the last one, then kudos to Braun and Oral-B for continuing to make a great product.</li>
            <li> Works well and is great when you&#x27;re going to replace your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an important feature unless you tend to hurry through your brushing.  </li>
            <li> the oscillation feels like it is really cleaning around my teeth and getting in the grooves nicely.  </li>
            <li> the oscillation feels like it is really cleaning around my teeth and getting in the grooves nicely.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great dental aid.</li>
            <li> I had a Professional Care model (equivalent to the newer 1000 or 2000 according to the company) which ran perfectly for many years, until the battery started turning itself on and off in the middle of the night (while unplugged.)    </li>
            <li> Timer works great and, especially at the beginning, helps you to time yourself.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions, enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> The multiple settings are great.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li> It is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It works like a car&#x27;s stop light.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great, my teeth feel cleaner then when I use my standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice if they gave more heads, It gets confusing when trying to find which head is the best, It would of been nice if they gave a sample of 4 different types</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Another good note is that the brush accepts the dual action brush heads which I prefer.     </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, spins faster than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love the indicator light and overall love the brush more than I expected, awesome! .</li>
            <li> I visit my dentist for teeth cleaning every six months, so far, I have had good check-up every time.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better would be a good brush holder.</li>
            <li> The cleaning ability is far superior to any Oral-B I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good ....</li>
            <li> So far, good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Would have loved if they packed the Power Sensitive brush</li>
            <li> This is a good improvement since most people think brushing harder is better (but it is not).</li>
            <li> They are far superior to manual brushes in every regard.  </li>
            <li> They are far superior to manual brushes in every regard.  </li>
            <li> Its good enough for a week or more after you charged battery.</li>
            <li> So far good durability as well</li>
            <li> Liked the old Oral-B model better.  </li>
            <li> The best feature of this model is the red light warning that your are using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and we were happy to be able to exactly replace our old set.</li>
            <li> And even better, they are offering a 50% rebate right now.</li>
            <li> I have had it about a month - no problems so far and leaves a great clean, fresh, feeling.  </li>
            <li> The (detachable) portion of the charging dock that stores extra brush heads is very handy.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice toothbrush and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth &amp; gums, the unit pays for itself handily.</li>
            <li> That is until I used this brush, after just one use my teeth felt as clean and smooth as I just had a cleaning.</li>
            <li> After brushing, my teeth feels smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> After I brush, I always feel like my teeth are clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Had an older slower Oral-B and liked it</li>
            <li> I think they dry best if you run your finger along the brush after rinsing to remove excess water before placing back into their handy charging/holding station.</li>
            <li> This particular model is a nice middle-of-the-road option in terms of features and price.</li>
            <li> I had an older Oral-B, I think it was the 5500 or 5000, which I liked.</li>
            <li> We tried the cheap spin brushes and that was better but now with this his teeth are typically clean on the first try.  </li>
            <li> Live love love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for many years, and every new model seems to get better every time.</li>
            <li> thing is fantastic but be aware you&#x27;ll need some time to get used to it if you&#x27;re a first timer in this kind of electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my first electric toothbrush, and I love using it while my grandkids use theirs.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was love at first vibration.  </li>
            <li> It still had the original battery</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush purchase and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li> (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any decline in my oral hygiene since the switchover, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that I can say I really love.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a Sonic Essence toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The 3000 is slimmer and lighter than my original Triumph.</li>
            <li> I never considered that there could be a significant difference in design philosophy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the unit super easy to use and clean, and my teeth feel incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and you won&#x27;t be either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another significant point I think is in the Philips Sonicare&#x27;s favor, customer service.</li>
            <li> However, I called oral-B and explained the situation and that I still had the required original register receipt that would preclude a fraudulent use of that UPC.</li>
            <li> No regrets, good purchase.</li>
            <li> Because of one significant thing: the battery.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the original Oral-B we used for years.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t have this problem with the original unit.</li>
            <li> This is even better than the first.</li>
            <li> Love the 2 min timer for consistent brushing.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this toothbrush to arrive.  </li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush,and it&#x27;s better than manual brushing,nice experience</li>
            <li> so am happy to pay a little more for Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I really liked my original Oral-B electric toothbrush so purchased this new model.</li>
            <li> That may be true in some instances, but what I didn&#x27;t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it was a wonderful gift and so far she seems to love it.</li>
            <li> very much - teeth feel very clean after using.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel refreshingly clean and the grill just sparkles.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that &#x27;just came from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.    </li>
            <li> You can feel the clean.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how clean they feel.</li>
            <li> If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you&#x27;ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times.</li>
            <li> but this one makes my teeth feel really clean</li>
            <li> After each use you can remove the head and put it away to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B gives me squeaky clean, after-the-dentist-visit clean feeling</li>
            <li> Makes mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel as clean as they do after a cleaning at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not a fan of any electric tooth brushes, but this one is bar far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> your teeth are really clean at the end.  </li>
            <li> MY TEETH WERE GETTING CLEAN</li>
            <li> Lots of power, leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps teeth clean and helps to keep plaque at bay.  </li>
            <li> I feel really clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean faster and feel cleaner when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> After the waterpick, I use the electric brush and then my teeth feel squeekie clean.</li>
            <li> as clean as the Ultreo did,</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This is a great improvement over my earlier brush, well worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> After trying this, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean anymore with a non-electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> clean feeling</li>
            <li> Teeth feels clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> but of course, it did clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my first non-manual toothbrush, so a lot of what I say is probably true of most power brushes these days</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Sonicare made my teeth clean, but also hyper-sensitive.  </li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it you notice the difference in how clean your teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I owned a sonic care toothbrush before purchasing this Oral-B brush, and I liked my moderate priced sonic care better than this product.</li>
            <li> teeth feel really cleaN</li>
            <li> Teeth feels dentist clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist was really pleased and surprised that my teeth and gums were so healthy.</li>
            <li> For an economical price, you can start using a much more powerful toothbrush than manual brushing</li>
            <li> After a week, I have to clean this too.  </li>
            <li> Even my cleaning lady refused to clean this part of the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sparkling clean after using this power brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as they do after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this brush is POWERFUL and does a great job of cleaning and removing stains (big tea drinker).</li>
            <li> So you can clean evenly.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I love the 2-3 speeds and the round bristles do a great job getting between teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean when I use it.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and gums massaged.  </li>
            <li> Brushing with a manual toothbrush does not make teeth feel as clean as Oral-B electric.</li>
            <li> I currently own the Oral-B earlier model and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far so good, she seems to like it, and it does make a noticeable difference in her smile.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our special needs daughter.</li>
            <li> Buy one right away !</li>
            <li> This new 3000 it great and very powerful with being sensitive as well.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feel that I get when I use the Oral-B Professional Clean 3000 toothbrush!</li>
            <li> OK, so seeing that it is made in Germany explained the very high build quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is great work, weakness is 2 minutes after the brush does not automatically stop, and the battery is not very to force.</li>
            <li> This model is a good balance between the higher priced models and the lower priced models, though if you don&#x27;t need a sensitive speed setting, I would recommend the Pro 1000.</li>
            <li> This model is a good balance between the higher priced models and the lower priced models, though if you don&#x27;t need a sensitive speed setting, I would recommend the Pro 1000.</li>
            <li> really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the 30-second timer option more than I&#x27;d anticipated - it&#x27;s nice to have a guide for how long to spend on each &#x27;quadrant&#x27;.</li>
            <li> even bright enough to get your attention in a sunlit room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most will recommend whatever they conveniently have on hand to sell at full retail price while they have you captive in the chair.  </li>
            <li> It seem that they last for around 3-4 years, so for the money, I think they&#x27;re pretty great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that feature, really, and I don&#x27;t see a need for three speeds, since that just means I have to keep pressing the button more times to turn the unit off, as it cycles through its speeds.</li>
            <li> So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  </li>
            <li> I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  </li>
            <li> too late this is just perfect  ...</li>
            <li> This product is a true pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> YES THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE WHEN THEY SAID THIS THING WILL SHAKE YOUR HEAD</li>
            <li> We have used Oral-b toothbrushes for the last 10 years and have loved them.  </li>
            <li> I had a 10 year old Sonicare Phillips e3000 which I liked.  </li>
            <li> very good！I want to buy  one more for  my  mom,because  mom  </li>
            <li> Logging on to pay my balance in full and cancel my credit account.</li>
            <li> Logging on to pay my balance in full and cancel my credit account.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes a good, quiet product.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 30-second timers really helps the kids to better understand the length of time required to get a complete and effective brushing.</li>
            <li> This one takes about 24 hours to get the full charge indicator.</li>
            <li> B0002KHT8Y Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush -]]</li>
            <li> Good for removing plaque and gross stuff.</li>
            <li> Still a whole lot better buying from amazon.</li>
            <li> It feels more powerful and the different modes are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Just really cool features.</li>
            <li> It encourages you to brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Loved it and after several years it would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> thing I really like most about this brush is the timer.</li>
            <li> Leave teeth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> good price, i use it daily.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by a family member who has used it for several years and told me that every time she gets her teeth cleaned at her dentist&#x27;s office they comment on what a good job she does at home.</li>
            <li> Nicely design product for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a mouth full of crowns</li>
            <li> I think the 3000 model is the sweet spot of Oral-B Pro range.</li>
            <li> drawback:  kind of loud</li>
            <li> Much better than my old 1000!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light that goes on when you apply too much pressure is obvious, and a good way to be sure you get that right as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are both very good brushes and clean my teeth and gums much better than the old conventional hand held manual tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it gets my teeth a bit slicker (cleaner) than the new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings she uses her regular toothbrush for quick brushes but at night she spends a good 10 minutes using this.</li>
            <li> Also, the price was right, and Amazon threw in a free pack of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> The opportunity to try out this higher end model was easily decided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its so strong it flings the toothpaste off my toothbrush the first time I use it after it has recharged.</li>
            <li> Even though I leave it in the charger, its not as strong as when i first got it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was a great buy</li>
            <li> Great electronic toothbrush, works quite well and is able to really give a deep clean when compared to a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Downside</li>
            <li> slots for 4 different heads, 3 different cleaning cycles, easily clean, very strong, nice timer feature.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they could devise a way to keep it waterproof after replacing it, but then they couldn&#x27;t sell you new one&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Just received our new Oral-B tooth brush which replaces our old one that is almost 8 years old and still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> We always liked our old Oral-B toothbrush but like the new model better because of the pulses that occur every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and clean afterward.  </li>
            <li> The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and it gets more of the tartar off of my teeth than the older electric toothbrush did.</li>
            <li> It happens so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t disput brushing.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush).</li>
            <li> It charged fairly quickly and stays charged.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush outside of the cheap $10 kind you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> However, my luck I think has run out and I need to start taking better care of my teeth, because I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li> The quality of generic just isn&#x27;t comparable enough to that of the oral b.  Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> looks super</li>
            <li> There are two speeds, but I find the lower speed to be adequate.</li>
            <li> Great product, Fast shipping, Would definitely reccomend to friends and family!!</li>
            <li> it helps ensure I am spending an adequate amount of time brushing.</li>
            <li> but all it is, is a (quickly) rotating brush head.</li>
            <li> The unit seems to be well built, recharges quickly and does a sufficient job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the list, but as I get older I know that I don&#x27;t want any more illnesses.  </li>
            <li> Our third Braun in the last 18 years and the best to date.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, at my last cleaning the dental hygienest says my teeth and gums are looking better and healthier.</li>
            <li> It does not charge all the way and then quickly drops to about 40% charge.</li>
            <li> The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  </li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush and will never go back to standard brushing by hand.  </li>
            <li> Cleans much better than my older Oral-B 3D Excel, which I now use as my portable/vacation toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the charger BTW: it has no metal contacts (some of older power brushes had them) &#x3D;</li>
            <li> It sounds gross, but I love to run my tongue over them because they are so incredibly smooth!</li>
            <li> Luckily I caught it on sale.</li>
            <li> It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> It works great and the rechargeable unit is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes; this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush that performs brushing exactly as my dentist and research tells to do.</li>
            <li> If you are using this brush by yourself, I could see this feature being less great for you since it takes up a lot more counter space than the older models that don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this brushing unit.  </li>
            <li> This one is not near is good as the Sonicaire I had.</li>
            <li> If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information</li>
            <li> Always loved Oral-B. This my third one to own in the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush doesn&#x27;t stay charged to long though</li>
            <li> brush holds a weeks worth of power on a full charge.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a good long time (over a week off the charger) which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> leaves a nice clean feeling and i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I think this Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean</li>
            <li> B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> The pressure sensitive indicator makes sure you brush with just the right amount of pressure!</li>
            <li> Hope to get many years out of this new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  </li>
            <li> The first time I brushed I probably went for a good four minutes before I realized this thing doesn&#x27;t shut itself off after two minutes like the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For how much this toothbrush costs, there should be an easy way to change the battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and cleans my teeth really well.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product that lives up to the hype as it does exactly what the advertiser and manufacturer says it does.</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty good, and lasts me several days before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, after this past weeks use I have been able to greatly reduce the plaque I get in a problem area of my lower jaw (with large chunks literally breaking away from my teeth).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried those drugstore battery operated toothbrushes for a couple of years, and they were fine, but I always felt like I was trying to cram those large brush heads in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have been very surprised and pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised that it works even better.</li>
            <li> It is single speed which is not as good as 2-speed.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to all!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li> but new one works with old charger too, good on them for not changing the charging</li>
            <li> Would have liked it even more if the required charging frequency was less.</li>
            <li> Circular (rather than that up and down one I used to own) seems far superior.</li>
            <li> It was very important to me to have a pressure sensor and sensitive mode on my toothbrush for post-surgical care.</li>
            <li> Dentist clean after my first brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush, I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> Had my first clean bill of health in ages.</li>
            <li> This is a great little grill maintainer.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the higher price, I cannot believe how clean my teeth feel even by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this is there&#x27;s a light that goes off to signal you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> One advantage that the Oral-b 3000 has over the Philips Sonicare is its light that comes on to warn you when you are applying too much pressure when brushing.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shop around because there are huge price differences among different sellers.    </li>
            <li> - Orange pressure indicator does light up if I put too much pressure against my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The card comes with hefty monthly fees from Citibank to boot and a multi-page contract with detailed legal obligations attached to the use of the card.    </li>
            <li> Now to Sonicare, when I went online to gather information I chatted online with a rep who was very accomadating and even offered a 15% discount code after I asked if there were any specials currently available.</li>
            <li> The sensitivity light works very well.</li>
            <li> These fit bill very well.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Its light and very convenient and an improved design.</li>
            <li> It will last a few years, and it is a great help with cleaning the teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> Ii is powerful</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was better than the Sonicare in that regard.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare brush action was definitely more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; and made my teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> action on this is SO much better than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Unless you just enjoy blowing the extra cash, this model is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  </li>
            <li> With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  </li>
            <li> I love how sensitive the power button is.</li>
            <li> The 30 second timer is a nice feature that allows you to spend that amount of brushing time on the four quadrants of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The one negative comment I have is that the package only comes with one brush head, but I suppose that the nice rebate more than fairly offsets the cost of additional heads.</li>
            <li> Unit automatically recharges after each use (after first full charge) for an hour or two, but can be used immediately.</li>
            <li> The OralB Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush is everything and more than you expect from an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to upgrade to this brush, but it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a powerful brush.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.</li>
            <li> This is a nice contrast with my Up &amp; Up toothbrush which, though it claims it&#x27;ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smoother, cleaner, and I even feel like my breath stays fresh for longer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to get my teeth and gums into better shape and so far</li>
            <li> Pulses were described as &amp;#34;in and out&amp;#34; action of the bristles; 20,000 per minute seems more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> I continued using my brush and last week got professional confirmation that this thing was doing a great job!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> This model replaced a cheaper model and it was worth the additional expense.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great buy and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Nice solid, quality feel (time will tell...</li>
            <li> Only received one tooth brush, would have been nice to have received two.</li>
            <li> This mid-range electric brush had both of those, which I found to be rare for toothbrushes in this price range.</li>
            <li> the investment (and in my opinion is the sweet spot between the lower speed models and the higher end models with software features I don&#x27;t need).  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> They liked the 5000 - but said the 3000 is the same except the fancy timer.</li>
            <li> It comes with two heads - with different color bands - and a nice holder for them that is covered.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my teeth almost fun.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and</li>
            <li> Effectively cleans wherever applied, front &amp; back of teeth, between teeth, gum line, even the gums and tongue, without irritation.</li>
            <li> - Compared to my 3-year old Oral-B, there&#x27;s significantly more vibration and strength (the company claims 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillation per minute).  </li>
            <li> It is durable and powerful.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to my next checkup to see if it&#x27;s done as good a job as I believe it&#x27;s doing.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, that&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> This brush gives you the fresh from the dentist feel.  </li>
            <li> The older Oral B it replaced had an easy on/off button to operate</li>
            <li> There are several brush head replacements available, including a floss style, and they appear to be priced better than Sonic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B 3000 was definitely worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This brand by far is my favorite of all the toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li> so far, this one is a great upgrade from the last one.</li>
            <li> oral-B. In short, the Sonicare is light years better than the oral-B in every aspect</li>
            <li> better than my old oral b vitality brush.  </li>
            <li> This model also comes with a nice stand that holds the brush in place as well as provides a place to store extra tooth brush heads</li>
            <li> battery like is kind of low</li>
            <li> We bought a pair of the Oral B Model 3000 Professional Care Braun Toothbrushs at Costco several years ago and they were great.  </li>
            <li> Like this one better than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> brush comes with a nice charging stand with a container for extra brush heads.</li>
            <li> Always happy with them though for current purchase I wish Amazon could state clearly on the product voltage required.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the Sonicare and better so far.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels better, cleaner and my gums have stopped being so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the old one (for five to six years)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days and am very impressed w/ its operation so far.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> But dentists seem to all say that an electric toothbrush is far better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But dentists seem to all say that an electric toothbrush is far better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the upgrade</li>
            <li> Timer is and pressure indicator are quite useful.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the options of the different heads.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; offers Li-Ion and that is way better, no memory effect, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another somewhat useful tip from the company: if you are in a hurry, you can count on a recharge time of one hour for every one minute of brush time needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every dollar...................</li>
            <li> This is a nice middle ground between the entry level Oral-B models and the high-end ones.</li>
            <li> My pros:  seems superior method to regular toothbrush, good handle size in my hand, good brush size in my mouth, holds a good battery charge, base has spots for extra heads for other family members, pressure sensor light works for me, timer is good.    </li>
            <li> brush makes my teeth feel dentist fresh every single day, and has a pretty good charge as well.</li>
            <li> The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I especially like how my teeth feel very clean and smooth after each use.  </li>
            <li> magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to be able to keep the the brush holder separate due to space limitations on the sink top -</li>
            <li> Really cleans teeth better than the older one</li>
            <li> Wish it would already c ome with replacements but other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> So, she became more aware of this and was more careful.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> the price was right.</li>
            <li> and she was right</li>
            <li> Well I was right.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the ones that have bluetooth capabilty, the Oral-B PRO 3000 is just right.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to clean all of that gunk that builds up on it.</li>
            <li> Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.  </li>
            <li> This one really makes a difference in how clean my teeth feel.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it usefull and enjoy it for a long time</li>
            <li> This makes my teeth just as clean and much happier.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and my teeth feels really clean.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, it works very well and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Even with just my first use, my teeth feel so much cleaner!!</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy, we just run it under hot water for a few seconds after brushing, although I suppose if you&#x27;re worried about germs a quick alcohol swab would work even better.  </li>
            <li> like much better than my old one that just vibrated, gets much cleaner love it so far.</li>
            <li> This is a huge upgrade and a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head?</li>
            <li> We feel like it&#x27;s cleaning better than our previous brushes and with the timer feature, we are probably doing a better job.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting my teeth clean when I used my old toothbrush, but nothing compares to the clean feeling I get from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, and it&#x27;s effective enough to skip the extra money for the &#x27;5000&#x27; model.  </li>
            <li> Looks cheap, feels cheap, but that&#x27;s not really that important to me in a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend it to anyone interested in protecting their smile.</li>
            <li> Great brush, removed all the green from my teeth!</li>
            <li> a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It was kind of a strange feeling to have this thing buzzing in my mouth, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li> very much and just stick to the standard brush mode, but it is very easy to access the mode you want.</li>
            <li> More effective cleaning overall, particular between teeth (professional cleaning brush that came with unit)    </li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little more money for more features</li>
            <li> While the brush head is a little bit smaller than the spin brush it works great!  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing toothbrush with ultra long battery life!</li>
            <li> let us send out a new unit to you, free of charge.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> New Oral B works fantastic</li>
            <li> I have a much older model Oral-B and while it still works, this new Oral-B works MUCH MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I use the new one that is more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; at night and the older model in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing product that makes my teeth feel dentist-chair clean every time I use it, and appears to clean as well as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush for several weeks now and comparing it to a battery-operated toothbrush, it is significantly more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I swear by my battery toothbrushes for at least 10-15 years now and can attest that it is both economically and professionally a great buy,</li>
            <li> Not as easy to operate as my old one.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very close and definitely adequate.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  </li>
            <li> Something else worth considering: I&#x27;m trying to not line China&#x27;s pockets any more than necessary, and the Oral-B is made in Germany by Braun.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and makes your teeth feel like you just had them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> just rec&#x27;d toothbrush nice fast service and starting to charge as i write .  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a quick review not a critique, really?</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as easy as the $5 spin brush (by far)</li>
            <li> but I only ever use the most powerful one.  </li>
            <li> The 30 second interval buzzes are very helpful to clean your teeth in quadrants, and for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush as a replacement to my previous Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> gave this two stars instead of one because it still seems to clean as well as the older versions.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that a tiny head could do such a great job.</li>
            <li> I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you&#x27;re not trying to, just when you&#x27;re normally brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One for the left top portion, right top portion, left bottom portion, and right bottom portion of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about the red warning light the unit emits when too much pressure is applied to the brush head, but the light has helped me to reduce the pressure I use to scrub the grill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think I prefer this to the SonicCare models I&#x27;ve used in the past, mostly because I have a lot of crowns, and most of my mouth concerns have more to do with healthy gums rather than my few remaining teeth at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are significantly whiter, while my mouth is much fresher throughout the day, which was a real issue with the</li>
            <li> This is good but the speed is a little faster than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a month now, clean very teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to store, doesn&#x27;t up much space, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I prefer more distinct toggle switch with 4 positions (off, daily clean, sensitive, and polish).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Stays charged pretty well.</li>
            <li> Pros  Cleans the surfaces really well, the motor is powerful.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is okay; I use it once a day and regular toothbrushes twice a day.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how effective the extra whitening feature is but the sensitive option is great to have for me.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and cleans my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  </li>
            <li> a funny side note.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Braun/Oral-b brush I&#x27;ve had with all this features</li>
            <li> B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] for better whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] for better whitening results.    </li>
            <li> First and foremost, it&#x27;s made in Germany which speaks volumes for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> The reason I give this low rating is because I don&#x27;t think its any better than the Oral-B Pro Care 2000</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as our first one.</li>
            <li> I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> To turn it off you have to hit the button three times (if you are using the first mode).</li>
            <li> Everything as described, I would never be able to go back to manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and is kinder to the ears than a Sonic.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could be better is placement of the on/off button.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> , first thing when I wake up and during brushing.  </li>
            <li> Better, but not significantly better, than most battery-operated</li>
            <li> - Better, but not significantly better, than most battery-operated toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> What I like most is the 30 second timer for doing each quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has given me a noticable difference in my teeth and gums and does exactly what it says it will do in just a matter of weeks.  </li>
            <li> first thing I did when I received this toothbrush was replace the head.</li>
            <li> I use the electric toothbrush similar to how most people use floss.</li>
            <li> Much better than the S-200&#x27;s traditional style toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the different speed setting and that it also has a storage place for the brushes.</li>
            <li> My first two were more basic model Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li> I do like more basic models...</li>
            <li> First, there are 3 speeds.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  </li>
            <li> It is the same model my wife has been using for years and we are both pleased with it.</li>
            <li> , I ORDERED THIS ONE FIRST</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> First things first, I did not purchase this item here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> From first use I was hooked.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know where to find the replacement heads for this exact model?</li>
            <li> so I can only imagine what the results would be after using a more aggressive tip.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an electric toothbrush as my dentist recommed that I do.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it lets you know to move onto the next section in your mouth for brushing.</li>
            <li> But it is better than the Sonicare for cleaning the back sides of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> overall I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought 3000 series and instantly noted that it was of much better quality than the Vitality.  </li>
            <li> Because of that I wasn&#x27;t able to use it until the next day.</li>
            <li> My first time with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> First things first.  </li>
            <li> I think the rotation feature is what really makes an electronic toothbrush worth having.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using various Sonciare models for many years, I decided to try this Oral-B.</li>
            <li> either unless you don&#x27;t have a mirror over you sink or don&#x27;t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!  </li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth and gums much better than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Our first electric toothbrush was a Oral B, and it lasted over five years with two people using it.</li>
            <li> Oral B 3000 definitely has a lot more horsepower.</li>
            <li> So it actually took up more room as separates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this oral B that actually works better.</li>
            <li> However, the toothbrush consistently needs 24+ hours of charge to give just 14 two minute uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, hoping to get her to brush her teeth more.</li>
            <li> I personally get much better cleaning result with the sonicare</li>
            <li> The item arrived within a week and was exactly as described in the description.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes many different toothbrush heads for the thing, find one you like.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and needed; plus it was about 30 bucks cheaper than it was in Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Considering the massive price difference we went with the 3000 series and are glad we did.  </li>
            <li> Love the 30 second timer feature, reminds me of where I&#x27;m at in my brush.</li>
            <li> I love that I only have to charge it about 1 a month.</li>
            <li> works great - a replacement for a ten plus year old Oral B toothbrush (battery stopped charging on old unit)</li>
            <li> First one lasted for years....</li>
            <li> This one is much more quiet and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> When I first received this brush I thought &amp;#34;this thing is just too powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The pressure indicator light seems too sensitive and flashes even when I&#x27;m just gliding the brush over my teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> Glad to be back with Oral B</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first oral-b.</li>
            <li> In essence they are holding your money hostage with regards to exactly how they will allow you to spend it.</li>
            <li> love the 30 second quadrant timing feature.  </li>
            <li> Like others, I did a lot of reading on buying my first elec toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet been able to test this toothbrush&#x27;s charge since it is advertised to last 7 days, but hope to take it traveling soon.</li>
            <li> But the Oral B is currently $20 higher.  </li>
            <li> But the Oral B is currently $20 higher.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s even better than the last Oral-B</li>
            <li> I prefer the slower setting, but my husband likes the higher one.  </li>
            <li> I think the extra functions in the 5000 are nothing more than gimmicks.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I like what it does, but it is very noisy!</li>
            <li> More expensive models have more bells and whistles and cost even more, well into a $100+ range, but this one does everything you might want from a toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner now!  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after the Philips Sonicare Healthy White electric toothbrush stopping taking a charge after about two years.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can rinse the entire handle with no damage.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the sound is a bit loud when I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it feels and looks like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Gave this one a try, it has been great to say the least.</li>
            <li> She protested a bit a first because of the motion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more quiet</li>
            <li> The first electric brush we owned had a smoother feel.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and buy this unit rather than the 5000 - the features are just enough!</li>
            <li> charge stays good for a  few days.</li>
            <li> If your partner uses the other - they are really easy to switch out - and it cleans easily.</li>
            <li> It also blinks at you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is a nice feature and reminder to go easy on yourself.</li>
            <li> I live alone and only need one brush head at a time.&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized grip is nice</li>
            <li> I think the majority of this is due to the more powerful motor (and fresh battery) on this brush since the head is basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much research, this toothbrush was the right one for me.  </li>
            <li> Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  </li>
            <li> Out of the 3 modes (dailyclean, sensitive, whitening), I suspect most would use it for daily clean.  </li>
            <li> But, the \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m lucky if I get 8-10 minutes out of the battery before it needs to be recharged and that normally takes about 18 hours.  </li>
            <li> This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first.</li>
            <li> We are familiar with Oral B, everyone uses in our home, it was a purchase and replacement for an old with batteries used Oral B for my niece.</li>
            <li> Found it to be exactly the same produce but was able to pay a much lower price.</li>
            <li> This one is perfect for me , before I use is only one mode , this is 3 mode and hard censor also, I like it</li>
            <li> This model, my family is very happy with it, it has multiple brush tips, for my kids they like the sensor that let them know when they brush to hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively quiet, is easy to clean and seems to live up to it&#x27;s billing.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has a vigorous action, and my teeth feel dentist visit clean after I brush.  </li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] and [[ASIN:B000RSITSK Oral B Precision Clean 3 pack brush head refill]].</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel as clean as a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  </li>
            <li> I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years)</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of using I noticed my teeth exceptionally whiter.  </li>
            <li> Just what my dentist recommended and the product leaves my teeth feeling super clean; cleaner than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I love the 30 second quadrant timer (although you really have to pay attention for the pause or you&#x27;ll miss it).  </li>
            <li> But actually Amazon has it here for a good price, and it currently comes with a $20.00 rebate.</li>
            <li> I really like that with the multiple brush heads more than one person can use this brush.</li>
            <li> I primarily use the high settings, although the low setting might be better for children and people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The thirty second timer is nice for doing the &#x27;quadrants&#x27; the right amount of time, and I definitely feel like it is getting the back of my teeth better than the manual brush ever did.</li>
            <li> The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt!</li>
            <li> It comes with a little case to store the brush heads which is nice, especially when you have more than one person using it.</li>
            <li> The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve been a fan of these types of electric toothbrushes for a long time, and I love this one as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, so fast!</li>
            <li> The first speed is almost too fast.</li>
            <li> Included in the package is just 1 precision clean brush, which is fairly effective at brushing hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The vibration from the Oral-B unit is very noticeable and the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> I love the feature that alerts you every 30 seconds and then at 2 minutes to let you know how long you have been brushing.</li>
            <li> I am happy with its power, its ability to last for several days without being recharged, and it&#x27;s price compared to those in the stores near me.</li>
            <li> Almost seems too fast at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> teeth are cleaner, yes, but I&#x27;m never sure about whether I&#x27;m doing a good job on the gums with this brush, and I&#x27;d appreciate a gentler experience.</li>
            <li> Having used other electric brands, this is by far superior to anything else used.  </li>
            <li> It died after several years of use and I love the new model!</li>
            <li> I drink lots of tea and a decent amount of red wine :)</li>
            <li> As for the price I do feel that it is a bit high, BUT currently Oral-b is offering a generous rebate on this brush and many others.</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone who still has their wisdom teeth because the small, round head fits back there easily!</li>
            <li> Luckily both of these units have a more water tight design and don&#x27;t seem to have this</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it to me since I believe that these small-head electric toothbrushes are the reason why my dental exams go more smoothly than if I was using a plain old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My first use of the brush went better than expected.</li>
            <li> , per telecom with Oral-B, the Oral-B Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush has but one action, which should be adequate, and &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; 20,000 pulses per minute.</li>
            <li> The heads last about 4 months and are easily replaced.</li>
            <li> A quick tap of the power button and the toothbrush just switches modes (sensitive and whitening</li>
            <li> Now, I can easily reach the back teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use a Philips Sonicare, but it just vibrates back and forth and my teeth never felt more clean than they did with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My entire family uses these and checkups are easy.  </li>
            <li> Overall Oral-B is a good product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had the same one for about 5 years and hers is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I started doing research and got bogged down in how many toothbrushes were on the market and which one to get!!!!</li>
            <li> This certainly delivered.</li>
            <li> My dentist certainly is complementary of my teeth after moving to this style of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smart investment in your oral health.</li>
            <li> Personal preference will determine in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;$96</li>
            <li> Personal preference will determine in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;$96</li>
            <li> and I have a happier smile since I switched to Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> My third oral B in 12 years and love the new features</li>
            <li> , so far it&#x27;s super fast on all of them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both great for getting behind back teeth, but I think this one did a better job of really getting it clean back</li>
            <li> Loves:  teeth feel clean, does not hurt my gums or wear them down, multi speeds, can easily go for more than 2 min, with eyes closed</li>
            <li> After the 11th brushing, the red charge indicator was blinking, but it worked fine through all 14 brushes.  </li>
            <li> the oral-B. I now look forward to brushing again with my Sonicare and even do the extra specific gum cycles for better oral health!</li>
            <li> We recently returned from the state championship cook-off for pork ribs and as you may know the fine meat particles from the ribs always plant themselves between your choppers.</li>
            <li> I still have 4 of the older brushes (a Costco purchase!)</li>
            <li> your hygienist tells you that you are doing a great,(not good), job after previous visits which involved her reminding me to floss daily, you know that its a day worth writing a review.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the toothbrush does get a little warm after leaving it on the charger.</li>
            <li> I love the light warning when I am brushing to hard as it reminds me to brush correctly.  </li>
            <li> Also love the warning light if you press too hard.  </li>
            <li> Love the flashing light when you are brushing too hard (which i seemed to be doing a lot in the beginning).</li>
            <li> Bright red light when you brush too hard.   </li>
            <li> Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> There were so many features on brushes that it became confusing as to what was important.  </li>
            <li> have had many models of the Oral-b/Braun german electric toothbrushes and this is by far the most practical to use, basically because it has three programs: daily cleaning, whitening and the sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also like the red light if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week now, but I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are using to much pressure, a red light comes on to let you know.</li>
            <li> Also when the battery is supposedly ready for a charge a red light flashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is accurate or not since the 8850 comes with a stand up case that also holds extra replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and we both really like it.</li>
            <li> Costs way too much at retail price (not docking it in my rating, but this has no business being 80 dollars).    </li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t bleed as much.</li>
            <li> Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don&#x27;t even really notice it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist really sings the praises of these types of toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  </li>
            <li> As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over</li>
            <li> Our dentist swears by the Oral B and our whole family uses them.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a real deal.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a real deal.</li>
            <li> Once finished it will stop-and-go some times indicating that the 2 minutes period for the whole mouth has finished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.    </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the brush.</li>
            <li> That was a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that he was very fastidious.  </li>
            <li> Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the</li>
            <li> depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> practically no assembly required, it&#x27;s ready to go out of the box</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really feel the difference when I brush with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I put too much pressure on his teeth</li>
            <li> I was ready to purchase this together with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It blends in really well with the rest of the handle</li>
            <li> Ok not really</li>
            <li> Also the too much pressure indicator.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really it doesn&#x27;t need all of these speeds.</li>
            <li> Delivery came fast.</li>
            <li> So, I really didn&#x27;t have any question about what brand electric toothbrush I was going to buy.</li>
            <li> No kinder to my teeth and gums than a much cheaper Oral B from the drug store.</li>
            <li> There is a light on the back of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> that comes on when you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I tried my husband&#x27;s Sonicare once and felt my teeth were going to be rattled out of my head because it vibrated so much.</li>
            <li> This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.     </li>
            <li> I like the sensor that tells me if I put too much pressure with the brush</li>
            <li> , I think it works very well</li>
            <li> Solidly built and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> If I use too much pressure (which is not a lot)</li>
            <li> I like the warning produced if you apply too much pressure while brushing and the alert after 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> AND THEY DONT REALLY SHAKE YOUR WHOLE HEAD</li>
            <li> the light now only goes on every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks and feels fairly cheap overall.</li>
            <li> real question is how the brush cleans.</li>
            <li> and it cleans really well.</li>
            <li> And lastly, there&#x27;s a rattling sound where the brush head inserts into the handle</li>
            <li> enjoy the different speeds and the quality of cleaning the teeth is</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle, yet gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a quality-built product, and a very compact footprint.  </li>
            <li> I feel there is a lot of research that&#x27;s been done to get real quality brushing each time we use this brush.</li>
            <li> I was finding it much harder to stay on top of staining from coffee, and judging by my scheduled cleanings, plaque too...  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The dentist commented that my gums looked particularly pink and healthy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I purchase it much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say except that it does the job</li>
            <li> After about a month of using this, I can&#x27;t really tell that my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been real.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I could do without the red light flashing in my eyes</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li> Red battery light never comes on.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The circular motion really cleans the teeth well.  </li>
            <li> I called Oral-B with questions and they were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I contemplated getting the 5000, which has additional settings and Bluetooth, but realized that I really didn&#x27;t need those things.</li>
            <li> The hygenist was at a loss because she really didn&#x27;t have much cleaning or whitening to do on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> you really get that just out of the dentist</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review of this product as I&#x27;ve really &amp;#34;wrung</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for trips since I don&#x27;t want to bring the charger along and it spends as much time on the charger as it does being used.</li>
            <li> Now, it has to be charged every 3 days or so, which is VERY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a toothbrush like this before, only the cheap battery operated electric.  </li>
            <li> I like the rotating action used during cleanings at the dentist&#x27;s office, so I figured it was worth a try.    </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Looks very sleek and charges up well.</li>
            <li> Does one really need this info on their cell phone???</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that this product comes with a charger adapts up to 240v.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of features that I really like.  </li>
            <li> Very portable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my teeth feel much much cleaner than they did when I used a way cheaper quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never been too much into sharing toothbrushes</li>
            <li> in all, a cheap investment in your dental and physical health.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It performs as advertised and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> the blinking red light never turns off.  </li>
            <li> The storage container that comes attached is removable, which I&#x27;m thankful for because who needs to have all the replacement head-holders (empty most of the time) out for all to see?  </li>
            <li> Gave this to my fiancé for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Appears to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> I am really liking this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> and it is much quieter and kinder to my teeth and head.  </li>
            <li> I charged this one fully, 16+ hours, and it gave me four days of brushing, then the red light came on, and I had to charge it another 16+ hours.  </li>
            <li> Highly recom​mended!</li>
            <li> I really like the floss brushing heads</li>
            <li> These electric tooth brush head work very well.</li>
            <li> Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> However, we have not found this to be a problem as the pulses are very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger is much slimmer than that of my vitality (the brush holder is detachable.)</li>
            <li> Having the ability to select a speed setting is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleanliness of actual unit is important.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the speed settings and</li>
            <li> I would really say these are both 5 star models in the end.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the speed settings and</li>
            <li> I would really say these are both 5 star models in the end.  </li>
            <li> Brushing with this is basically the only thing she does, so it must be doing a fantastic job</li>
            <li> You have to keep it on the charger the whole time you are not using it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> (haha)</li>
            <li> I would suggest that it you have issues with this toothbrush stopping and lighting the red light</li>
            <li> br /&gt;dentist put her straight.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are better, the head is smaller which is better for smaller mouths and it has a gentler setting which he initially used until getting used to the brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> two features I find very helpful to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it is much quieter and softer than the Phillips SonicCare we were using.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made use of the different brushing modes, but I&#x27;m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth,</li>
            <li> My dentist (who just so happens to be my favorite medical professional) has been relentlessly hounding me to come over to the electric side.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go back to an old school toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I kind of have is that the battery only lasts one week (</li>
            <li> Initially I thought the pressure warning and multiple cleaning options were overkill, but after using it they are nice features to have.</li>
            <li> So using this brush has forced me to lighten up a bit, which is another good thing.</li>
            <li> And my gums feel extra safe with the sensitive setting, which my other brush didn&#x27;t have, but my teeth still get super clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the design of the brush head that came with this Oral-B toothbrush has made it very hard for me to clean my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> I sometimes think it would be better if the brushes were larger; but, that would probably result in not being able to clean tough places as well.</li>
            <li> My other electric toothbrushes had a cover and were easier to pack for travel and the most important part felt cleaner in the bathroom with hair and hairspray used daily, with a cover.</li>
            <li> you want to experiment a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it.</li>
            <li> using this toothbrush since august 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.nt a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and is exactly what I was expecting-brand new</li>
            <li> The first one held a charge for two weeks when it was new.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds, which helps you gauge how long you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth, which is a huge positive.</li>
            <li> One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG.</li>
            <li> The brush leaves my teeth feeling nice and fresh, but the storage unit for the brush heads is difficult to keep clean.</li>
            <li> (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right)</li>
            <li> I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in &#x27;timer&#x27; that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue</li>
            <li> - the old standup version was not easy to clean, so I was pleased to find this one.</li>
            <li> Product is better than I expected!</li>
            <li> This brush was great while it was charged, but it would only hold a charge long enough for three brushings.  </li>
            <li> I generally use the flossing head (not a replacement for real flossing) in the morning to better massage my gums and a regular brush at night.</li>
            <li> I actually had more plaque on my teeth for my teeth cleaning and caused my dental hygentist to spend more time cleaning my teeth than in years past.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m familiar with them and this one seemed different than the others from the start.</li>
            <li> Charger is small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  </li>
            <li> The main difference between the two models that was important to us was the 30 second indicator that lets you know to move to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of teeth to clean as described by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> The red light for too much pressure is a feature I can live without</li>
            <li> One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the head that came with the brush which I think is the deep clean.</li>
            <li> The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums.</li>
            <li> At my last dental appointment, my dental hygenist complemented me on how clean my teeth were on this visit.  </li>
            <li> Definitely leaves a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> When you clean your teeth with the Oral-B unit, there is no doubt left that you are cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> it kind of forces you to brush for a whole 2 minutes where I usually would probably brush for a shorter duration.  </li>
            <li> and I have been so pleased with this one in just the first few days I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Not only does the brush clean our teeth</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend making the investment in an electric toothbrush, you get that just-from-the-dentist clean mouth feel all year.</li>
            <li> I have to clean everything thoroughly before putting it back on it&#x27;s stand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, but unless you brush your teeth with the same force used to scrub barnacles off a boat, you don&#x27;t need to pay extra for a light that tells you you&#x27;re scrubbing too hard.</li>
            <li> The 30 second vibration alerts are great, the red light alerts you when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> , the Sonicare is more expensive in initial cost, but when you factor in the VAST difference in electricity used andthe incredible difference in results</li>
            <li> My last trip to the visit resulted in the discovery of two cavities, but since I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in over three years and am less than good about flossing, I&#x27;ll take the two cavities (and the time before I&#x27;d gone another three years before visits but no cavities.</li>
            <li> it also has a red light that flashes upon brushing too hard which is nice.</li>
            <li> The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  </li>
            <li> The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s past the return period, and I can&#x27;t find any kind of warranty info.</li>
            <li> &quot; I actually told him that wasn&#x27;t true...</li>
            <li> Really feel the difference over a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Only gripe is having to toggle through the power button (push 3x) to turn it off, even after a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun electric toothbrush for over 10 years before it started to act funny on me.</li>
            <li> Nice small charger.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B Pro quit working, but when I went to re-order the exact model, of course it had been phased out.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will hold true to its standard.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a better tip holder, but not worth a star.</li>
            <li> This was my first time recharging and after 14 hours it had still not finished, even though the battery was not dead when I plugged it in.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my upper left wisdom tooth is almost fully erupted and I am trying to keep it super clean.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results as the technology has improved compared to my older model but considering how long the first one last, I was not concerned about making the investment.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action.</li>
            <li> This is the first high powered sonic toothbrush I have used, up to now have always used old school toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are larger and more useful than other products.</li>
            <li> This has some new features that I really like:  </li>
            <li> The brushing too hard feature is pretty much useless but am glad I got this one instead of the higher priced models, this works great.</li>
            <li> When brushing top teeth, it activates very easily (being forced down by gravity already) and that makes the red light go on all the time.</li>
            <li> This new pro 3000 dislodged every nook and cranny of pork residue and left my mouth squeaky clean and sparkly....  </li>
            <li> and I was able to take advantage of the half price offer.  </li>
            <li> I found it for $20 less than many retailers.</li>
            <li> Thus, it would seem, that at half the price, the Pro 1000 is a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than my previous brush Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I expect to get many years of use out of it, as I bought it to replace my previous Oral-B which I had used for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> but this one it&#x27;s getting older and even after some accidental drops, keeps looking and working like</li>
            <li> I should start of by saying that I&#x27;ve never used a professional toothbrush before, but I do use the cheap Oral-b CrossAction power brush on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist even commented on the difference since my last cleaning (she thought I actually flossed more, not a chance).  </li>
            <li> Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which</li>
            <li> favorite feature is the 30 second timer that tells you when you move to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> And Amazon had the the lowest price for this particular model.  </li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;ve never gotten around to trying a battery-operated toothbrush, this product will most likely astound you.  </li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;ve never gotten around to trying a battery-operated toothbrush, this product will most likely astound you.  </li>
            <li> But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard</li>
            <li> years older and felt like it was beginning to peter out.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a decent choice of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had been researching this particular oral-b model.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a battery in my older Braun but it would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I think it is quieter than the older model I had.  </li>
            <li> Prior one was Phillips Sonic Care Healthy White.  </li>
            <li> - 3000 is designed for kids and adults 4 years or older.</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight and slimmer than my older unit.  </li>
            <li> While the Rota-Dent unit is quiet and smooth in operation, the Oral-B unit offers no concession to either.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model and needed a replacement.  </li>
            <li> This replaced an older model.</li>
            <li> always felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning after using the older Oral-Bs</li>
            <li> See the unit will most likely last years and years.</li>
            <li> Went from an older model sonicare to this after some research.  </li>
            <li> It was a replacement for an older toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 2 more electric toothbrushes without liking them enough for various reasons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for two days and with charging, I&#x27;ve only been able to use it twice.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same item in Europe and Asia and got more as well as a variety of replacement brush heads in the package for the same item Oral b 3000.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargable from Braun many years ago until after a second battery replacement finally wore out the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an older model.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is quieter than the older model.  </li>
            <li> She is one of those lucky ones, 2 cavities in her entire life.</li>
            <li> Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes...</li>
            <li> I mostly use the &#x27;normal&#x27; speed, but the &#x27;gentle&#x27; is helpful in some trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I had an original Oral-B that died after a long time</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had heard plenty about the Oral B toothbrushes and this one was highly rated.  </li>
            <li> taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.    </li>
            <li> The Oral-b came highly recommended from my dentist and friend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend the investment.</li>
            <li> I recommed this toothbrush highly.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This in one toothbrush I highly recommend anyone to buy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this model.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended investment.</li>
            <li> Ii would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended (by my dentist too)  </li>
            <li> A high quality product.</li>
            <li> I recall in high school</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> So I will just HIGHLY recommend it to all of them and everyone I know.</li>
            <li> It has 3 modes for brushing (standard, light, alternate standard &amp; light).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The vitality was a decent toothbrush, but I decided to upgrade to something with a little more horsepower.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B because it has a timer to remind you how long to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> (I have to clean it every day) and the battery has begun to not hold a charge as long.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t fit in the old travel case and the motor is MUCH less powerful.  </li>
            <li> Basically cost a little more than 2 Sonicare elite heads</li>
            <li> I think it makes her feel both a little more grown up</li>
            <li> Depending on how many times the two of us use the unit during charging, it could take a little longer.</li>
            <li> I notice after about a weeks use it seems a little slower, still more than sufficient to brush, and I recharge weekly.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works wonderfully, however there are several small differences I noticed that differ from the packaging and other materials.</li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker but would have thought it would perform a little better than that.</li>
            <li> The brush also has 3 brush settings (daily clean, sensitive and whitening).  </li>
            <li> Just remember to not press with the brush too hard so it can do its job effectively.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought sooner, but it was hard to talk my wife into spending that kind of money on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> BTW CR rates the 4000 very highly, and this 3000 seems to be nearly identical to it.</li>
            <li> This new 3000 series packaging replaces older [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very juiced up compared to our 4 year old version.</li>
            <li> I really like the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> Plus, it stays much cleaner than my old unit for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was surprised to find I had been using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Not when there is too much pressure and the red light comes on, rather it will just take a 1/2 second pause from time to time.</li>
            <li> The pulsating action knocks off tartar and food and makes flossing that much easier.</li>
            <li> The head oscillates and pulsates much faster than on the 20 year old one.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered on time and it works very well so far -</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 6am to 11pm, which is farther apart than my normal brushing schedule.  </li>
            <li> This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  </li>
            <li> The first is \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you&#x27;re doing a normal brushing.</li>
            <li> The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.    </li>
            <li> This appears to be about $22/yr, though I might get a few more months if I keep it on charge all the time.</li>
            <li> I was one of the \\&quot;non-believers\\&quot; in toothbrushes that cost more than a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend above the &amp;#34;cheap replaceable battery&amp;#34; version toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been using, but this was totally worth</li>
            <li> I would rather pay full price while supporting a local store for this product so I can return or replace on the same day.</li>
            <li> This is the first toothbrush I have found that really makes a difference in keeping my teeth white between teeth cleanings at the dentist</li>
            <li> This blows any normal brush out of the water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truthfully, they were both worth purchasing for different reasons.</li>
            <li> This results in a good 2 minutes of cleaning when I had been lazily doing about 30-45 seconds of teeth brushing with a standard brush.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m scared to go cuz they always bitch at me about</li>
            <li> The manual says it holds a charge for 7 days under normal 2X a day brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth spending the extra bucks for this model, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It took almost 48 hours on the charger for the green light to stop blinking when I first got it out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> How does that equate to 7 days of normal (2 brushings per day) use?  </li>
            <li> My teeth are definitely cleaner and the product is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \\&quot;get all up in there\\&quot;, but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful.</li>
            <li> The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Design better than the previous Oral-B model that I had for almost 20 years!</li>
            <li> Its fine and works as you would expect from the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Comes with a basic brush head, the pressure sensor is nice to have but not helpful after the first few times since you learn more what is too hard.  </li>
            <li> The price was right, especially with the 50% rebate that was offered.</li>
            <li> I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B 3000 because it makes brushing my teeth less of chore and cleans them really good leaving my mouth fresh for hours, plus Amazon sold it for $25 less than Walmart...an unbelievable deal!</li>
            <li> Having different settings is very convenient plus the external timer makes it easier to be certain that I&#x27;m spending just the right amount of time on each section.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and my god I have been missing out on clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly, unlike other items that I have purchased on Amazon.com that I have ordered over 4 months ago and never received!  </li>
            <li> and a little light flashes on the toothbrush when you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full name is \\&quot;Professional Care 3000\\&quot; and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument.</li>
            <li> Will be thrilled if this brush last even ½ as long as my last one.</li>
            <li> and I got a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had searched for a price I could live with</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, this is a tool i just can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Basically, this is a tool i just can&#x27;t live without.    </li>
            <li> I started a new routine.  </li>
            <li> This new model remains to be seen, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any sturdier.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any gunk/mold issues, and the pressure and &amp;#34;time for a new zone&amp;#34; indicators work well.</li>
            <li> so I can appreciate the new improvements.</li>
            <li> The new brush can be used for days even without having the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new toothbrush to replace the one that died.</li>
            <li> Need charging after 2 or 3 days which is not acceptable for a brand new unit.</li>
            <li> so we bought this new version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> new version is a type 3756.</li>
            <li> My new dentist recommended this e-brush</li>
            <li> Mine does not beep every 30 seconds to indicate brushing a new section, it vibrates slower to tell you to change sections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for something new now.   </li>
            <li> and i wish you could just put a new battery in the item after a year</li>
            <li> The replaceable heads would wobble ever so slighty, so I decide it was time to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> It was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> like I had a new power charger in the box however.  </li>
            <li> Then tried a new replaceable 2AA batteries</li>
            <li> she can&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
            <li> It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.    </li>
            <li> I thought that they light to tell you that you&#x27;re pushing too hard was a gimmick, but it turns out that is useful</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the orange light that tells me when I&#x27;m pushing down too much on my teeth, as my dentist had previously told me I have a problem with that.</li>
            <li> The brush on the new unit moves much faster than the old and our teeth feel even cleaner than they did with the old one</li>
            <li> The new Oral B has a better fast and slow pulse choice that works well for me.</li>
            <li> My wife dropped her previous one and it was an easy decision to replace it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a fan of the circular  brush (which I must say I was weary of) there are several different brush styles available.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush would not hold a charge for more than a few days after 4 years so it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li> (Although for our older neighbors and those with sensitive teeth, you may want to skip it.)  </li>
            <li> (Although for our older neighbors and those with sensitive teeth, you may want to skip it.)  </li>
            <li> (although I was able to find the old case, and with a few modifications, this handle fits</li>
            <li> Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> but it is essential to mantain a good oral hygiene (brush your teeth at least two times per day)</li>
            <li> Base is good, you can keep just the charger without case if you want to save room on your counter top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend ordering the three pack of sensitive heads...</li>
            <li> it cleans well, but is very loud</li>
            <li> The battery on my old one lasted about seven years before it wouldn&#x27;t fully charge up anymore, so I have high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li> have had issues with my teeth being very soft and prone to problems as well as some issues with receding gums.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product that does exactly what it supposed to.  </li>
            <li> No more lifting off a brush top to find something growing</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I bought this with its LONG charging time to give a weeks worth of brushing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace my 16-year old electric Oral-B brush (holly smokes - yes!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for oral b are significantly cheaper than other electric toothbrush brands.  </li>
            <li> First, it does not suffer from the gross out cup that the Sonicare E series does.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommended based on my first use...</li>
            <li> however I believe it doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Oh my God this thing is SOOOOO loud!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than our original Oral-B&#x27;s and has a smaller vanity \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; if you leave off the plastic \\&quot;saddlebag\\</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I love the small spinning brush as opposed to the oscillating brush.  </li>
            <li> The spinning brush gets the job done better and gets into small areas.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I should have replaced my old one a year ago!  </li>
            <li> I share it with my boyfriend, and with their little brush extenshion caddy, it is a relatively easy process.</li>
            <li> The smaller head makes it easier to clean my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> They both also light up when actively charging, and dim when charging is complete.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They both also light up when actively charging, and dim when charging is complete.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was always a struggle to get him to clean his teeth properly with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  </li>
            <li> With this electric toothbrush, you would have to spend roughly 20 minutes using a manual toothbrush to get the same amount of clean out of the 2 minutes it takes instead!</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  </li>
            <li> I have had other electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied with them because of their being to rough and believe it or not to much of an \\&quot;echo\\&quot; in my head when using.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand it really offers what it advises and is sooo much better than regular brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush is super strong, and a red LED will indicate if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> New one stutters like the old one.  </li>
            <li> , she knows the right pressure and how long to brush.  </li>
            <li> Using this, I have experienced less mouth pain after brushing, even less than the Ultreo which I thought provided a relatively painless cleaning.</li>
            <li> far as brushing, I find that the Oral-B removes small particles of food between my teeth better than the Sonic.  </li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a day per week and battery doesn&#x27;t deminish as quickly the way I expected it would.</li>
            <li> I liked the old model that told you how long you had been brushing, this model gives little zzz&#x27;s after brushing for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Another dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare but it is so much more expensive that I chose to stay with the Oral B which uses the same rotary bush system that a dentist uses to clean teeth!</li>
            <li> higher oscillations, pressure light when pressing too hard and sensitive</li>
            <li> It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  </li>
            <li> It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  </li>
            <li> Buy one and enjoy for months to come of your like new mouth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li> Buy one and enjoy for months to come of your like new mouth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li> (slight exaggeration, but it is a very powerful brush)</li>
            <li> love it, except for when 30 seconds feels like a long time), and it&#x27;s got a red light for when you&#x27;re pressing too hard (which can damage your gums).</li>
            <li> You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!     </li>
            <li> I have used the battery-only version which runs at half of the speed of the electric rechargeable; it seems to me that the extra speed does a better job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Since these units are built to last for many years (my previous Sonicare lasted 4+ years).  </li>
            <li> Since these units are built to last for many years (my previous Sonicare lasted 4+ years).  </li>
            <li> It gives the brush a quick stutter at 30 second intervals to help you focus attention on individual areas, before moving on.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it&#x27;s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a super expensive one, so I opted for this \\&quot;middle of the line\\&quot; product, but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> can tell when pushing too hard (can see red light go off through eyelids) and easy to tell when you hit 30 second sections</li>
            <li> If the brush lasts a few years, that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> As I used it and used it more often and started going to the dentist regularly, I clearly was having less problems, especially bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li> At my last dental cleaning in Feb this year, my dentist told me that I had slight gingivitis near my gums and that electric toothbrushes do a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Evidently the new owners have sent quality control straight down the dumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a standard plug, without a large brick.  </li>
            <li> only thing that I&#x27;m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space.</li>
            <li> Also these batteries contain Cadmium which has prompted the EU to ban their use except for certain specific applications.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a manual brusher this takes a little getting used to, but after a week you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> and I end up having to hold him down just to keep his teeth clean.</li>
            <li> (The number on the Citibank pre-paid debit card website that is given for customer support simply has a message that says your direct deposit will be processed on a certain date.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly longer than the original</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is when it tells you when you&#x27;re pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Cons  Battery seems to charge very slow  Not as good at cleaning between teeth compared to Sonicare (with the standard brush head atleast).  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking to spend a little more, I can definitely recommend the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care as a quality purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> The pressure sensitive light that tells you if you are brushing too hard really works-</li>
            <li> At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though my teeth feel cleaner, my mouth tastes less clean before I rinse.  </li>
            <li> The charger is stand alone and clear all the way around.</li>
            <li> All I really need though is the regular speed (for teeth) and the slower, sensitive speed for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> All I really need though is the regular speed (for teeth) and the slower, sensitive speed for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable.</li>
            <li> ,my teeth is clear</li>
            <li> I would steer clear.</li>
            <li> This item has three different speeds, a red pressure sensor light, which will let you know if you are using too much pressure, and comes with a thirty second timer that pauses the brush briefly for each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The battery indicator light only blinks AFTER the battery dies (not very helpful</li>
            <li> Now this has the &#x27;Quad Timer&#x27; - I heard this referenced in all my reading and it wasn&#x27;t 100% clear till I used the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Being that the three modes are a complete joke, I would much rather have to hit the button only once to turn it off.</li>
            <li> When you click on it there is a statement on the page that says \\&quot;The Oral-B 8850, frequently sold through professional dental offices, is the professional version of the Oral-B 3000 handle.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have now been using the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush]] for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare</li>
            <li> But, my teeth feel much cleaner than regular brushing</li>
            <li> Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  </li>
            <li> The brush is much thicker then a standard brush</li>
            <li> its three brushing modes instills a sense of confidence that you are you are getting \\&quot;professional care.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Further, to make sure you are brushing properly, you are reminded at thirty second intervals, for a total of two minutes, to brush another area in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The timer that buzzes at 30 second intervals let&#x27;s me know how much time I should spend on each quadrant of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Has to be taken apart and completely cleaned after every use, otherwise toothpaste-laden water hides inside the brush head and leaks all over the handle section.</li>

            <li> My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why.</li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer lets you know that the morning/evening ritual is complete.  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive teeth &amp;</li>
            <li> this brush doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive areas which hand brushing does.</li>

            <li> some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once.</li>
            <li> you can put it on soft mode.</li>

            <li> a person with receding gums, my dentist advised me to look into a professional care electric toothbrush to take the place of my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; manuel toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The second one however would no longer hold a charge within a year which really irked me</li>
            <li> So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  </li>
            <li> Though will not hold much of a charge, by keeping it on the charger, it still provides daily brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really loud.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s being charged, the green light flashes indicating that it&#x27;s being charged.  </li>
            <li> However, the green light NEVER stops blinking even after 24 hours and the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and it felt like it would scrub my enamel OFF.</li>
            <li> but I, as an adult, don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B Vitality passed away, and after asking my hygienist for a recommendation for a replacement, she insisted that I avoid the Vitality and upgrade to any of the Oral-B professional series models.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I use this brush my mouth feels as if it&#x27;s had a professional polishing.</li>
            <li> my old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush no longer works (but old one did work for 4-5 years).  </li>
            <li> No complaints with the first one which I&#x27;d had for a long time</li>
            <li> And sometimes, I wake my husband from his sleep when I brush, because this thing is so loud...</li>
            <li> Enter the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I find myself using the slowest setting (for sensitive)</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my 10 year old Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li> Green charging indicator light is still blinking after overnight charging.</li>
            <li> - Oral-B claims it will naturally whitens teeth in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Replaced my 4-year old Oral-B with this newer unit.  </li>
            <li> if you have sensitive teeth, beware.  </li>
            <li> Seems the battery runs out faster than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> The cons of the Oral-B Professional Care 3000:  Noisier than Sonicare  </li>
            <li> I use it on sensitive setting and  it still cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Would not charge completely even after 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> but I do with no problems so far).  </li>
            <li> but I think its like 8 years old.</li>
            <li> Replacement for our 10 year old Braun that died.</li>
            <li> This replaces an old Oral B rechargeable toothbrush that died after 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this lasts as long as my first Oral B.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old unit.</li>
            <li> Not quite the sonic action I was looking for,</li>
            <li> This Oral-B 3000 appears to be nearly identical to what is also called the Oral-B Professional Care Advantage.</li>
            <li> but the action of the brush promotes gum/tooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten my adult children hooked on Oral B as well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush until I travel internationally.</li>
            <li> It fits in my old wall mount charger and keeps it off the counter, no clutter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare the Sonicare to the oral-B is like equating a GPS navagation system to an old fold up map.</li>
            <li> So, I gave my contact info and asked for a call when a mgr was available only to never get a call back and have my rebate request sent back stating I needed to resubmit it with the UPC code.</li>
            <li> Well for one, you are going to get the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t let it completely discharge periodically.</li>
            <li> When my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, I knew I wanted another one.  </li>
            <li> like it that this Oral-b toothbrush has a sensitive</li>
            <li> I now use my old one for cleaning grout in the shower.</li>
            <li> My dentist has always said to use the soft brushes.</li>
            <li> For nearly 11 years I owned another model Oral-B that would no longer hold a charge</li>
            <li> Well thanks anyway Braun, I&#x27;&#x27;ll go elsewhere for my next electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Seems longer than the old Oral-B I had</li>
            <li> At any rate, I installed the Oral-B sensitive brushes and now have a system that cleans my teeth well without harshness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud compared to my old Oral B but sounds about like all the brushes we have.</li>
            <li> and I have ordered three - the floss action, polisher, and dual brush.</li>
            <li> My twenty year old Oral-B rechargeable was beginning to show signs of its age.</li>
            <li> And obviously it cleans the mouth very well, as any toothbrush of this price</li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush for years and when my old model died I purchased this.</li>
            <li> The battery on our old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush no longer held a charge so we purchased the Oral-B Professional Precision 3000 Rechargeable as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> My old one had reached the point</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again and can&#x27;t wait for it to completely die</li>
            <li> brush head is much easier to reach back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> But this is a feature to tell you when you are applying too much pressure, which is oddly enough, a common mistake by most folks.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare just has the one stand, which is compact, but without the ability to expand to a larger whole brushing area if you want.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is really the only difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is really the only difference.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy and convinient in hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have no problems with it</li>
            <li> I settled on the Oral-B Professional 3000 series.  </li>
            <li> it charged it, and change the head frequently.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a product.  </li>
            <li> , this was replacements for our old Oral B brushes we&#x27;ve been usin for bout 12 years</li>
            <li> So far it has worked well, you do have to recharge as soon as the lights come on</li>
            <li> but it was to sensitive in settings and gave it up but will use it for travel.</li>
            <li> so my dentist wants me to constantly use a rotary brush.</li>
            <li> Old stuff, indeed.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel SO MUCH cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Far inferior to a sonicare in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This purchase ended up going to my 8 year old son.  </li>
            <li> Using floss action head.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Oral-B Vitality with this brush.</li>
            <li> B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]] which whitens and keeps polished your teeth</li>
            <li> This is particularly useful not only to not harm yourself but also to make brushes heads last longer.</li>
            <li> But I loved my old Braun brush before it finally died after at least ten years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That luxury alone is worth the additional $10-$20 I allegedly saved by buying here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  </li>
            <li> After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable base does not take up too much room, but I love the cover case over the top to protect from germs.</li>
            <li> In fact, the fact that this toothbrush even has multiple &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; or a brief pause every 30 seconds seems pointless as well, but not enough to subtract from the fact this toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth, and is less prone to mold growth than my old sonicare was.</li>
            <li> I put the new unit in the charger and left it for approximately 23 hours without the blinking light ever holding for the required 5 seconds the manual says indicates full charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Oral-B toothbrushes that worked just fine, but this one had an unacceptably short battery life.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush does work well at getting your teeth clean, but you end up with a slimy mess of saliva and toothpaste covering your hand and brush.  </li>
            <li> It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next</li>
            <li> , I wish I had gotten it a long time ago, does a much better job of cleaning your teeth in half the time.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste goo does dribble down the handle and leave a white circle on the counter-top every day, but it&#x27;s easily wiped up.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle for people with small hands.</li>
            <li> The charging unit is a lot smaller than the previous one, which is nice if you have limited counter space in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It could clean in between my teeth, thus leaving little to floss out.  </li>
            <li> One other feature that I didn&#x27;t expect to use was the pressure indicator, but apparently (according to the red light that comes on) I brush too hard most of the time?</li>
            <li> The storage tray is dishwasher-safe, the charging stand is not.eak down too quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really miss the little extras that were on the first brush.  </li>
            <li> The red light keeps blinking as though the battery is low, but no matter how long I keep it on the charging unit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite certain it is for tracking purposes so they can then figure out what you spent it on in the desire to see what new spam and unsolicited junk mail they can start sending you.</li>
            <li> Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost.ch bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror</li>
            <li> But I suppose people with dental work might need multiple speeds, so I&#x27;m okay with the slight extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easier to clean a few plaque-prone areas.    </li>
            <li> Its round brush head enables you to surround each tooth for a tooth-by-tooth clean and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as older Oral-b models.  </li>
            <li> (vibrates once for the first switch, twice for the second switch, and 3 times for the third switch).  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and I can say that I&#x27;m never going back to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light -</li>
            <li> It has different speeds than my older one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an older electric toothbrush (Braun Excel 3D) and this is a big improvement!  </li>
            <li> The main difference would really be personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one because it has 3 different modes; normal, whitening and sensitive.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a little more expensive than I would have liked, but the functions of the toothbrush definitely make up for that.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve grown up with a lot of tacky looking cheap Japanese electronics that have survived 25+ years before being handed down to me</li>
            <li> but it is a sweet little tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It has three settings, High, Low, and pulse.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Oral-B sells several other brushes, such as pro white (for better polish) and floss action.</li>
            <li> The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \\&quot;off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived.</li>
            <li> I found the pressure to be much harder in comparison,but luckily there are several settings.  </li>
            <li> This also has a red led light that lights up if you are brushing too hard - again, very valuable.</li>
            <li> The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have an LCD screen but it seems to be as powerful as my last more expensive model.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> At a first glance, not much has changed.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; is sent in the form of a pre-paid Procter &amp; Gamble debit card from Citibank, which comes with absolutely no indication that it is being sent in lieu of the promised rebate or in any way mentions Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I had always been concerned about electric brushes being complicated and not much of an improvement over their manual cousin, however, my fears were quickly allayed as I found the Oral-b 3000 to be a fast and easy setup.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you clean it often, because the toothpaste residue dries on it often and makes it unpleasant to look at.</li>
            <li> but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want anything more complicated than this.</li>
            <li> The only feature I don&#x27;t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you&#x27;re using too much pressure when you brush.  </li>
            <li> Never the less the price is right and even if it is an older or discontinued model, if it has the same charateristics as the 3000</li>
            <li> this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  </li>
            <li> The  only drawback was that it takes a very long time to full charge, and it even took a while to have enough charge to use it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush reaches those hard to reach areas that a manual toothbrush can&#x27;t get to easily.  </li>
            <li> is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren&#x27;t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base</li>
            <li> Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she&#x27;d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  </li>
            <li> new model is a definite step up from the ancient \\&quot;Plak Control Plus\\&quot; model that I had been using.</li>
            <li> BUT-I received 2 new toothbrushes to replace the 1 I sent back.</li>
            <li> None of the phone numbers on the card, the correspondence or on the Citibank pre-paid debit card actually work or if they do, do not allow you to reach a live customer service representative or leave a message.  </li>
            <li> After that I used the unit for 4 days before it required a new charge; 3 days short of its listed time usage.</li>
            <li> I thought that I did enough research to get a new one, and did.  </li>
            <li> When that one was new it went up to ten days.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Totally recommend to anyone considering purchasing a new or replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Purchsed the new brush that was not in current packaging.  </li>
            <li> The major difference is the newer one has 3 settings and a light that supposedly shows when you are brushing too hard (have never seen it and my gums are ultra sensitive.)</li>
            <li> love how this toothbrush indicates if you are brushing too hard!  </li>
            <li> One caveat:  Oral-B keeps changing the product line-up for the e-toothbrushes in ways that makes it harder than unusual to understand what you&#x27;re getting, and the Oral-B website isn&#x27;t as clear as it should be in explaining the line-up</li>
            <li> We went through 2 Oral B Pro brushes, the first set lasted a long time, the second did not</li>
            <li> The second is \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  </li>
            <li> I did this because her old electric toothbrush was too loud and it made me want to run outside and put my head in the snow.</li>
            <li> and the battery quickly drained and we had to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> The battery should be easily replaceable; not as forced obsolescence.</li>
            <li> The pressure light on this is kind of annoying to me, but it is making me think about pressure.</li>
            <li> There are some gimmicky things that I&#x27;m not the least bit interested in, such as the sensor that determines if you&#x27;re brushing &#x27;too hard,&#x27; but overall this is an excellent product.     </li>
            <li> Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it has some serious power to clean!</li>
            <li> You can choose between them by pressing the only button once, twice or three times being the first one the standard daily cleaning, fi you press twice</li>

            <li> At first I was concerned with the group of vendors Scamazon associated with due to faulty products...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the next higher models do.  </li>
            <li> The last time I got my teeth cleaned the lady said that she could tell by looking at my teeth and gums that I used the Oral-B Professional brushes!</li>
            <li> The brush is very powerful, so it&#x27;s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is very powerful, so it&#x27;s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.    </li>
            <li> Ill have to check back after my next cleaning, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely top of the line (and better be, given how much it costs).&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 Professional Care is a sleek brush with a decent charging base, which is a little smaller than the Ultreo.</li>
            <li> The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used the other brush modes, but I can see how the slower sensitive setting might benefit some users.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with the toothbrush stopping due to to much pressure.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as older models</li>
            <li> I have owned many Braun electric toothbrushes and a few from other brands.</li>
            <li> The brush head is too large, meaning that I can&#x27;t keep my mouth closed around it when brushing my front teeth</li>
            <li> I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I&#x27;m distracted and in a hurry to get to work.</li>
            <li> This brush has changed how I clean my mouth and actually makes me WANT to go brush my teeth everyday.</li>
            <li> Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH.</li>
            <li> I confidently recommend this product; and particularly this model.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> mouth does feel pretty clean after each brushing, but the mess that is created outside is something less desirable.</li>
            <li> I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on</li>
            <li> I also like the light indicator that shows when you are brushing too hard and when it is time to recharge.  </li>
            <li> There is an indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I like the light that comes on if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model also has a light to indicate if you are pushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> this works fine (the battery my earlier 3000 didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected), but the fact that I&#x27;m replacing it shows my satisfaction with it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend this product high enough.  </li>
            <li> Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The refill heads are available at most drug stores, but tend to be a little expensive.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B makes it easier to brush more consistently due to the fact that you receive a short pulse every 30 seconds to remind you to change the brushing area, and a slightly longer pulse at two minutes when finished.</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> In general, avoid spin type brushes.</li>
            <li> As this order was clearly for an Australian address the units supplied should have been supplied with 240v charge units therefore the units shipped are virtually unusable.</li>

            <li> figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now.</li>
            <li> A regular flosser, too (although not quite as frequently.)  </li>
            <li> Every 30 seconds the action pulses a bit, telling you to move to the next quarter of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It really feels like a powered toothbrush that was designed 5 yrs ago - not very refined.</li>
            <li> far as comparisons go, the Oral-b 3000 and CrossAction are like night and day, and I literally feel like I&#x27;m finally actually brushing my teeth -</li>
            <li> so apparently there&#x27;s a dental health issue here as well.</li>
            <li> so apparently there&#x27;s a dental health issue here as well.</li>
            <li> I recently received my Oral-B Professional Care 3000 toothbrush</li>
            <li> My old Vitality had a two minute timer, which I often didn&#x27;t make it all the way through, but with the 30 second timer it basically guilts you into doing the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B electric toothbrush finally died after some 10-15 years.  </li>
            <li> so you can barely feel it to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Which was enough to cover the cost of the sensitive replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which was enough to cover the cost of the sensitive replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well, my 10-year old Braun finally died, so I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> The indicator glows red frequently for me.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Oral-b 3000 professional that I have returned.  </li>
            <li> This makes a noticeable difference, and with extra brush heads my 12 year old is using it also.  </li>
            <li> Do not understand why Oral-B decided to remove a feature that is so vital to anyone who travels internationally.</li>
            <li> The 4000 and 5000 are the same size but way too far in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I like the 30 second intervals and the two minute timer, which was also on my old one.  </li>
            <li> Big improvement over the old Oral B tooth brush I have had say for maybe 50 years?  </li>
            <li> I like the features such as the timer that lets you know when 30 seconds has passed and when the 2 minutes is complete.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]], which oddly enough</li>
            <li> Still like the Sonicare - but gave the two old hand units with several heads to grandkids.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the Pro-White heads for my toothbrush which I&#x27;ll be reviewing in the near future.</li>
            <li> only negatives are that it blinks a lot (after every use) and it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> My teeth has never been cleaner and the battery last a lot longer than my old one.</li>
            <li> I prefer the sensitive mode, and occasionally use the whiting mode.  </li>
            <li> Recently got this one to replace a really old one I had and</li>
            <li> I should have expected as much given</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush several months ago.</li>
            <li> After using this electric toothbrush for a few weeks, I went for a deep cleaning of my gums (which were recommended at my first visit) and my gums had tightened and the gaps were smaller so much so the dental hygienist couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old ones.  </li>
            <li> I went and bought a regular, old fashioned</li>
            <li> Plus, it has 3 speeds: regular, sensitive, and whitening.</li>
            <li> I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li> and I end up with the middle selection, which I believe is for sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare goes for $35 for 2 standard (old models), $25 for 3 compact (newer models) at time of writing.  </li>
            <li> Apparently i&#x27;ve been brushing incorrectly (my dentist said so) and needed to use circular motion.</li>
            <li> Apparently there is a quiz that oral b put out</li>
            <li> No regrets what so ever.</li>
            <li> Poor design in so many ways.</li>
            <li> This kind of brushes tends to fail because of the battery</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for approximately 3 weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li> And it is true that the battery lasts 10 days, not the usual overdeclared figure given by manufacturers of everything that has a battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe I was wrong, but it would be nice to have a travel case along with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric toothbrush because the models I&#x27;ve tried have been too irritating.  </li>
            <li> I got so fed up with the poor performance and dated battery technology that I gave up on this oral-b and bought a Sonicare, even though I had many unused brush heads for the oral-</li>
            <li> All you need to do is hold down the power button for more than a second and it shuts down.  </li>
            <li> Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice to have a dedicated off switch, but its not that big a deal to hold the button down for an extra half second.</li>
            <li> Initially, I liked them because I was lazy and didn&#x27;t brush often enough much less correctly.  </li>
            <li> My vitality&#x27;s battery was getting a little weak also, but I still consider the vitality a good toothbrush for what you pay for</li>
            <li> The price seems high for the unit, however, they are offering a $10.00 gift card for a limited time.</li>
            <li> As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down.</li>
            <li> There are a few other settings that we haven&#x27;t used, because the basic setting was more than serviceable.</li>
            <li> it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  </li>
            <li> My other fairly new Sonic lately does not seem to be lasting more than 1-2 days per charge.</li>
            <li> Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit.</li>
            <li> It has 3 cleaning modes, but I usually stick with the daily clean and the whitening one.</li>
            <li> , if I press too hard, but it&#x27;s a good idea, I didn&#x27;t realize that in some areas, I was brushing too hard before.  </li>
            <li> and I really see no difference other than the size of the head.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other electric toothbrushes, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel significantly cleaner with this new brush, especially in the back where it is hard to clean all the way, and also the inside of my front bottom teeth where it&#x27;s hard to sweep back and forth.</li>
            <li> I like the red warning light that comes on when I press too hard.</li>
            <li> Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I feel like the red light comes on at too hard applied pressure.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> it has a red light that lights up if you press too hard-</li>
            <li> but it has a red flashing light close to your eyes if you brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> I like the red light that comes on to warn you that you are pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Rinse it well and dry it, and it&#x27;ll look like new for seemingly forever.</li>
            <li> My vitality is 2 years old and the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long at all anymore, but it has never died completely.</li>
            <li> After using this Oral-b 3K for a few weeks I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> My old unit is in storage and probably won&#x27;t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to get it removed (because it doesn&#x27;t cause me any pain), but wisdom teeth are harder to scrub in a tiny mouth without much room.</li>
            <li> A light on the board slowly faded and it finally died.  </li>
            <li> It does what previous reviews say on the positive side.  </li>
            <li> The brush head has a round big bump on its back and is much \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; than the normal brush heads that I&#x27;m used to(including all the manual and the Sonicare brush heads</li>
            <li> Other than orange pressure and improved battery/charging indicators, it feels and looks largely the same as predecessors.    </li>
            <li> I doubt I will use anything other than the daily clean mode and it has taken adjustment to have to cycle through the two other modes to turn the brush off.  </li>
            <li> but this is how long it says it will last on the box) while their older models last two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always nice to know if you&#x27;re pressing hard enough to wear down your enamel!</li>
            <li> I would usually turn the brush back on and hit my tongue and a quick once over the gums again.  </li>
            <li> What I also like about this brush is that it lights up if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure, which is very important if you have issues with gum recession (brushing too hard, or not brushing hard enough, can contribute to receding gumlines).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, there is a red indicator light on the back of the brush that lets you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The red light tells me when I press too hard and the three different speeds covers all types of cleaning requirements.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the red light that comes on telling me I&#x27;m brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The three controls (fast, less fast, and slow) are a help, and I never use the fast speed, even though the manufacturer claims that&#x27;s &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this one to replace a 3 year old one because I had to charge the old one every other day.</li>
            <li> has 3 different modes; regular, sensitive, and extra whitening.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to this, have flicker vertigo, migraines or seizures</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B Professional tooth brush that I have purchased in the last several years.</li>
            <li> While it lacks features such as the external monitor that the 5000 model has, it covers all the bases by offering a basic timer and a sensitive mode,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both, and find the smaller size of the Oral-B heads plus the fact that Oral-B makes an extra soft head gives Oral-B the upper hand for my needs.</li>
            <li> The first few times using it were a bit jarring because it sort of feels like a jackhammer on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Had a few problems withe recharging - first charge took forever, not hours but couple of days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and powerful.</li>
            <li> Also mentioned they could see the first signs of gingivitis, which scared me because I brush my teeth everyday.</li>
            <li> Also, due to the small toothbrush head, you use about half the amount of toothpaste as you would on a normal brush, but with way more efficiency.  </li>
            <li> This was clearly an issue for me because the first time I used this brush, it was telling me I was brushing way too hard to begin with.</li>
            <li> of use&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Value price vs other high end models&lt;</li>
            <li> of use&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Value price vs other high end models&lt;</li>
            <li> This way the brushes dry out completely before being used again.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve now used for 14 two minute cycles on an initial charge of less than 4 hours and it isn&#x27;t even showing the light that it is at 50% or less of charge yet.</li>
            <li> This is pretty minor, not worth taking off a star.</li>
            <li> (my last electric toothbrush lasted barely 6 months, but it was ten years ago...).</li>
            <li> It not only takes up more space on your sink with it attached, it also promotes water/bacteria around the base if you&#x27;re switching heads frequently since the heads most likely won&#x27;t be dried out when you switch them</li>
            <li> It not only takes up more space on your sink with it attached, it also promotes water/bacteria around the base if you&#x27;re switching heads frequently since the heads most likely won&#x27;t be dried out when you switch them</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it repeatedly complained (the red light flashed) because I was brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> even though the brush head looks compact, it isnt as easy to maneuver behind your back teeth.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain.the Oral B are cheaper, but i&#x27;ve yet to see how often they break.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain.</li>
            <li> The third is \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \\&quot;Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder why they stopped using the old system with no light, just a charging indicator, given that they have put such short lived batteries in the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It might be a little intense for kids</li>
            <li> Had other Lower powered ones before, but got this when I needed a new one</li>
            <li> warning when you press too hard is handy, and basically trains you how hard to press.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner, and I always get compliments from my dentist about how little plaque I actually have on my teeth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the new model not much had changed, or at least nothing I noticed on first glance.  </li>
            <li> This item has a powerful motor 3 different speed settings ,also a red light will come on if you are pressing down to hard !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works ok but the battery life seems pretty bad - I had a Philips that would last about 2 weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not missing this feature from other more expensive brushes from Oral-b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> charger base separates from the extra brush holder so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter and is sleek, clean and modern looking while saving counter space.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is a pain to clean, meaning I usually have to artfully display it behind other things when guests visit so they do not think I use a crusty brush to get my teeth clean on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not major issues for me, but just enough that next time I&#x27;ll probably go back to Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> So, it takes over 45 minutes charge per 1 minute of use, which with the technology available today is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the size of the brush, this uses significantly less toothpaste than a normal brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud that I find it&#x27;s necessary to walk to the other side of the house at night to avoid waking up my flatmate.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old brushes too hard and not long enough so with the pressure light that comes on if you push too hard and the 30 second notice</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you&#x27;re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The second setting for slower rotating is still very fast and hard on the gum area.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not sure about is how much power it actually takes to charge it for 17 hours.  </li>
            <li> I had lots of replacement head brushes from my old Braun Oral B.  Was tempted by other ultrasonic models, but went for this $80+ machine</li>
            <li> /&gt;After each use, it may be prudent to allow the brush lie flat over the sink to drain for an hour before putting it back on its stand to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few cleanings have been really rough, but I finally seem to be adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> Had this for awhile, but starting to notice that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore, sometimes barely runs long enough to finish the job.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in my first review, it takes a long time to charge, usually about 18 hours for mine.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this and replaced after a few years.  </li>
            <li> Also mine will not stay green for a steady 5 seconds to say it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> My last sonic brand brush died a slow and peaceful death</li>
            <li> The handle is entirely sealed, so toothpaste does not drip down into areas of the handle that then become hard to clean.    </li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences</li>
            <li> It is just high tech enough and designed well enough to edge out my sonicares of the past.</li>
            <li> The charger is actually a small oval unit that separates from the brush tray if you don&#x27;t have room for the whole thing.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I never really liked the idea of an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;regular, softer, whitening&amp;#34; speed variances seem to work, not sure how much.  </li>
            <li> Charge last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> but I am not completely sold on the 30 second quadrant timer.  </li>
            <li> I see no reason that this brush won&#x27;t last as long as its predecessor.</li>
            <li> The cheaper model did not last long and the power was not sufficient to do a correct job.</li>
            <li> Overall, those are minor things.  </li>
            <li> This was not apparent from the description.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use as long as it last.</li>
            <li> but I can assure you it will meet and perhaps exceed your expectations and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how long it&#x27;s left on the charger.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the battery would last a bit longer and didn&#x27;t take so long to charge.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting battery</li>
            <li> sounds like a long time to brush but flies by; the hesitation modes tell you when to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with this product, which we bought through Amazon less than 6 months ago, is the brush heads are designed in such a way that germs can enter the plastic column through two points (the oval-shaped hole below the bristles and the bottom of the column) and it is extremely difficult to clean it out.</li>
            <li> I narrowed it down to the Oral-B Professional Care 3000.</li>
            <li> My old brush slowed down when it needed charging but this one gave no indication that it was running out of charge.</li>
            <li> see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to return this model because I don&#x27;t trust the battery to last very long</li>
            <li> course there are quality brushes out there that cost less than the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care.</li>
            <li> with less than a year of use the bottom of the toothbrush [where the toothbrush sits on the charger] completely came off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to durability so far since only been using a few weeks...</li>
            <li> I buy the \\&quot;extra sensitive\\&quot; heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I&#x27;m not \\&quot;paying attention\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase but not unhappy enough to bother returning it.  </li>
            <li> My only other gripe is that it gets messy -- I thought I was a pretty clean brusher, and I&#x27;m sure this is a problem for most toothbrushes (electric or not), but this one seems to get particularly dirty looking due to the dark material used, and gunky at the base.  </li>
            <li> I switched to normal brushing about a year ago when my last oral-b gave up the ghost after several years of hard work.  </li>
            <li> I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000%</li>
            <li> Even though the other models had an \\&quot;indicator\\&quot; (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn&#x27;t really enough to get my attention</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit more expensive than the other models</li>
            <li> Just a little bit on the loud side.</li>
            <li> A little bit early to judge their reliability (battery, etc).</li>
            <li> In my older model the holder was attached and it was nearly impossible to keep clean and felt like a mold</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous, as the old model took just 8 hours, even when it was getting old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of the &#x27;whitening&#x27; mode, particularly because just switching to the electric toothbrush made a bit of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and I find I can&#x27;t tolerate the intensity of that mode very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to get teeth cleaner and much easier to reach into the hard to brush areas.</li>
            <li> I wanted at least as much in my replacement.  </li>
            <li> This was so vague that I asked to speak with a manager and was told that one wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> Likely about a year for a family--just a rough</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m curious to see if my dentist notices anything different!</li>
            <li> The minor thing that I don&#x27;t need is the stand accessory which has the holders for additional brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I do this a long, long time ago?  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have waited this long to get one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> As Amazon are a world wide organization I assumed if an order for an electrical unit for Australia it would have been supplied for the specific voltage requirements for that country.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> It has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> I should have been using a power tooth brush long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Instead it does a long \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; to let you know two minutes is up.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> One does not realize just how long 30 seconds is unless there is a timer.  </li>
            <li> We especially like the tip with the polishing center.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that the recommended two minutes is too long anymore.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I lived this long without it.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this one as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush holder is strange sitting on the side</li>
            <li> ; How long was this to take: about 10 days.</li>
            <li> is the charging time, it does take quite awhile to charge this brush, longer than 12 hours which does seem strange.</li>
            <li> Long term durability is still up in the air.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and basically everything I expected.</li>
            <li> They assured me that this will not &#x27;condition&#x27; the battery to accept only a partial charge.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to switch from manual to electric.  </li>
            <li> I like the new design of the base charger as it is much easier to clean than the previous version.</li>
            <li> 3000 is much less expensive and has 3 settings (which is honestly 2 more than I need).  </li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t think the extra part of the brushhead storage is needed, you can only use the charging portion to take up less space.      </li>
            <li> I have to spit out quite a bit less, and obviously a tube of toothpaste will last quite a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> was half back from the amazon price ... about $35 back as I recall!!</li>
            <li> We had this same toothbrush system previously but the charger and brush holder got lost in our recent move!  </li>
            <li> Anything less seems to only last for 6 or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not like the Sonic and doesn&#x27;t tolerate much pressure at all - making it difficult in tight spots as it just stops if it thinks there is too much pressure being applied when it isn&#x27;t always about the pressure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a SOnicare for the past 8 yrs or so and didn&#x27;t want to spend the $$$ for a new version with the pressure sensor</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the longevity of the new models, but I trust both brands in that respect.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure of the longevity of the new models, but I trust both brands in that respect.  </li>
            <li> only differences were minor (computer thing with the 5000 and some other gadget with the 4000 and maybe a setting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light indicator if you are brushing to hard, so you know if you are brushing to hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was jarring at first, even on the sensitive setting but nowhere near as bad as my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch.</li>
            <li> One for daily and the other one for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to divide your teeth in four and brush each quarter for 30 seconds, then the brush will stop for a fraction of a second and then start again just to tell you to switch to the other quarter.</li>
            <li> System doesn&#x27;t address other needs such the need for dental floss and a tongue scraper, which would add to the cost of your investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - System doesn&#x27;t address other needs such the need for dental floss and a tongue scraper, which would add to the cost of your investment.      </li>
            <li> Woo, that&#x27;s really long time !</li>
            <li> Not different than other products out there</li>
            <li> Some reviewers for other toothbrushes have said that their mouth feels the same as it does after the dentist, but this toothbrush isn&#x27;t *</li>
            <li> After having less-than-fun gum surgery due to recession, my periodontist and dentist finally convinced me to purchase an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the quality or quality control of the Sonicare had dropped significantly.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a number of years since I used anything other than a regular toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> My last toothbrush (sonic care) quit abruptly after a year or two.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> also has a low battery indicator which my other one didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads definitely leave my teeth cleaner than other brands i used.  </li>
            <li> I only plug them in once every other week or so.  </li>
            <li> I only plug them in once every other week or so.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t use the different settings (not sure that they make a difference), so I could have bought the less expensive version, but would recommend this toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li> Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  </li>
            <li> You can use it at 3 different settings - a routine, sensitive, or hard cleaning, depending on what you like.  </li>
            <li> I was against purchasing electric toothbrushes for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Battery life is very long</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the motor is to loud.</li>
            <li> you read much, you see where poor dental health is thought to be related to a number of illnesses.  </li>
            <li> rather then have to waste an entire unit when the battery runs low...  </li>
            <li> can not live without it.</li>
            <li> The first one has started to slow down</li>
            <li> I find it significantly easier to actually brush my teeth with this on those nights when I am tired and lazy</li>
            <li> design makes it so difficult to turn, swivel or adjust the angle of the brush head inside the mouth without hitting hard on the bottom/upper teeth, especially when I try to clean the teeth in the deep back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Experience teaches that you get about the 700-1000 cycles you would expect on a rechargeable battery as a single user.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a single aspect of this product that I do not like.</li>
            <li> *Single button control.</li>
            <li> - Brushing mode is triggered by a single button.</li>
            <li> The description of the product warns about the limited battery capacity.</li>
            <li> it experiences is part of a 2-minute timer, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying to have your toothbrush stop-start-stop-start (albeit extremely quickly)</li>
            <li> Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint about this toothbrush is that there is only one on/off button which cycles through the different modes.</li>
            <li> It is also completely waterproof, as I use mine in the shower (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to do that</li>
            <li> While extremely confused at first, I found I was happier.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road).</li>
            <li> This can be simply avoided by wiping the toothbrush&#x27;s handle down after every use.</li>
            <li> down side is that only ONE tooth brush head is supplied.  </li>
            <li> So I let the brush run down to low batter and then re-charged.  </li>
            <li> If I had the chance to trade it for the next model down (the Oral-B 1000)</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that the power button takes lot of pressure to shut off and slows down during the process before shutting off.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected the red light that is supposed to come on when you brush to hard was broken when I opened the box</li>
            <li> I use to be a no mess tooth brusher - no more.  </li>
            <li> Using a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; toothbrush just feels so wrong after using this one for a few months; my teeth definitely don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-b toothbrush worked for 3 or 4 years and the battery finally quit.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon 2 months ago for about $30.00 less than what my local retailer was selling it for.</li>
            <li> I actually got this for less than the big W word sold the 1000 for and a lot less than what they wanted for the 3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems that my mouth felt cleaner and fresher when I brushed with a manual toothbrush, but this one works none the less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a year and a half and have to charge it every fourth use.  </li>
            <li> The pro 3000 is fine except that the on off button is so small that its difficult to find and also to stop without going through several hits to turn off.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the model to get since all of the models that are more expensive than this have features that seem extremely pointless to me.  </li>
            <li> Beware that this product is 110v only , not the usual universal 100- 240v.</li>
            <li> The three modes are just a slight variation in speed and is overall a joke.</li>
            <li> instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the button to start it is harder to push than on the Oral-B Professional Care 7500 I had in 2006, but I suppose that is due to the additional cleaning modes on the brush.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that you have to clean the base that it stands on if you put it back on that after using, because the extra water drips and creates a ring around the bottom</li>
            <li> Only down side is that there is so much action going on, it&#x27;s hard to keep all of the toothpaste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> , the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> , the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> Buy  the less expensive one without the flashing light for pressure.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and apparently I have been brushing a little too hard for a while with other brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and selected the 3000 due to the size of the base.  </li>
            <li> For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic &#x27;Up &amp; Up&#x27; model I was using before.</li>
            <li> The instructions suggest brushing 1/4 of the teeth at a time and the brush stutters a little every 30 seconds so that all four quadrants get cleaned equally.  </li>
            <li> After the two minutes is up I now spend a little extra time on my \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> A little glimpse at the (short) manual</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it would charge a little faster.</li>
            <li> After using a manual toothbrush my entire life, this brush takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> The companies are too big and care to little about the people that buy their products or how they inconvenience them.</li>
            <li> You brush one quadrant until brush does a little studder then move to next one.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have any slippage with the hard plastic handle on my old Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comparatively, however, I prefer the Philips Sonicare for the following reasons: (1) its sonic action requires you to apply almost no pressure and virtually no pysical brush movement; and (2) its rectangular, longer-bristled brush head allows you to clean areas that the Oral-b&#x27;s round head can&#x27;t get to as well.</li>
            <li> If you resort to always leaving the charge base on (which is natural to do, just uses a little more house electricity), you might get two years&#x27; use out of a handle.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d ever push hard enough to actually turn it on in use.    </li>
            <li> Second, it actually lights up when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Works very well my only complaint is that it is hard to feel the on/off button to shut off when done brushing.</li>
            <li> Hope that&#x27;s not too nasty -- the product is great</li>
            <li> Replaces an Oral-B that was at least 10 years old.</li>
            <li> That meant I&#x27;d have to get a professional dentist office cleaning at least three-four times per year.  </li>
            <li> This replaced my old one which lasted at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> So at least now I know when I&#x27;ve brushed my son&#x27;s teeth enough.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Oral-B toothbrush user, and this model definitely improves upon the past models I have used.</li>
            <li> Only confusing part is the programs are accessed by pressing the on-off switch and doesn&#x27;t automatically turn off after 2 minutes so you need to tell the 30 second interval notification from the 2 minute notification</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an Oral-B that is at least 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of brush heads on the market and coupons seem bountiful.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only been using it since February (for 3 months) and the battery is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> It is what I expected</li>
            <li> While I can appreciate the timer &amp;#34;pulse&amp;#34; (the S-200 also had it), I&#x27;ve never really followed it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have separate sinks, but even so, I don&#x27;t like sink clutter of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 1000 model</li>
            <li> My wife and I have separate sinks, but even so, I don&#x27;t like sink clutter of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 1000 model</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time deciding which electric toothbrush to get..</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.  </li>
            <li> This bill will be paid off then the credit line will be closed.</li>
            <li> The brush head has holes in it so with my mouth fully closed, the dang toothpaste dribbles out.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth with my eyes closed (why I don&#x27;t know,</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s not very sanitary.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Oral-B, I like the round shape toothbrush</li>
            <li> Absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> The rebate form makes absolutely no mention that the rebate will be in the form of a fee-based pre-paid debit card from P&amp;G and Citibank, so when I received the card I was concerned that some identity theft had occurred.  </li>
            <li> battery life is only a few days.....</li>
            <li> and I like the smaller, round heads on the oral B.</li>
            <li> I was extremely careful to fully charge and discharge the battery each cycle to prevent a loss of charging capability.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model which we had for a few years but the batteries gave up.</li>
            <li> These were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> But the problem which alway confused me is that it takes too much time (almost 20 hours)for charging.</li>
            <li> I never actually got one until a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Just what we expected.</li>
            <li> My professionals told me I had been missing places with a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I called customer service a few weeks back regarding my charging issues and they initiated a warranty maintenance request.  </li>
            <li> Even then, after a few days, the holder of the brushes builds a green (or blue or white depending on your paste) pool.  </li>
            <li> But this is not really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush, have recommended to couple of friends already.</li>
            <li> Will see how the next few check-ups go.</li>
            <li> The charging base is nice; does not have electrical contacts to wear out.  </li>
            <li> Another nice thing about these Oral-B&#x27;s is that they hold a charge for quite a while so you can take it on a trip without having to carry the base charging unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an earlier generation of a less expensive version of this brush for many years, one with a single speed, not rechargeable, needed battery replacements periodically (very hard to load).</li>
            <li> and I can actually notice my teeth getting slightly whiter!</li>
            <li> I guess it is true that once you get an electric toothbrush, it is impossible to go back.</li>
            <li> Because you have to maneuver the brush all around, it is impossible to keep you mouth shut while you brush, and this does not create the kind of foam which usually stays in your mouth while you brush.  </li>
            <li> People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away.</li>
            <li> you are investing in a model for the long haul, I think the Oral B might have the edge, though slightly.  </li>
            <li> you are investing in a model for the long haul, I think the Oral B might have the edge, though slightly.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no context to compare how this is against other electric</li>
            <li> I have never really used the \\&quot;whitening mode,\\&quot; which as other reviewers have said is just basically pulsing the power.</li>
            <li> Big problem - in order to shut it off, you have to locate the hard to find little toggle switch then press it 3 TIMES (to Fast, to Slow to Off).</li>
            <li> Easy to view, and impossible to miss...</li>
            <li> Then there is a long stutter to let you know that you&#x27;ve brushed for at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the toothbrush is how long it takes to charge it.</li>
            <li> It is lighter and little smaller than my previous two Oral B. Thought of buying the PRO 5000</li>
            <li> a slight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist&#x27;s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either.</li>
            <li> The switchable heads makes sharing the base brush very easy, and the case holds up to 4 heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The much faster speed is extremely noticeable and feels very weird on my slightly sensitive front teeth, but I hope this is just another adjustment.</li>
            <li> Also, super loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> This lack of battery life and glacially slow recharging speed is completely unacceptable and I have not had this problem with any of my previous Oral-B brushes a brand I have been using for 20 years.</li>
            <li> (this is nice because I usually brush for slightly over two minutes and having to turn the brush back on was annoying).</li>
            <li> My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease)</li>
            <li> I feel they are both on par with each other.</li>
            <li> I feel they are both on par with each other.</li>
            <li> It notifies you every 30 seconds and has a separates notification after 2 minutes have passed, but unlike other toothbrushes it does not turn off after two minutes and instead starts over again</li>
            <li> While it has no screen like other models, I don&#x27;t want to fix a battery eater anywhere in my bathroom</li>
            <li> that any other that I have owned.</li>
            <li> I researched other electric toothbrushes and discovered Oral-B had the highest rating from Consumer Reports and users as well.  </li>
            <li> I also like how small the head is; I can reach places on my back teeth that were inaccessible before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife and I both like the Pro Care 3000  and can recommend it to other prospective buyers.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was showing its age in other ways.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> We have received the two units ordered ID 002-0914831-8195467,2 Professional Care OralB 3000 Toothbrush units, An Australian order, this has caused disappointment as both charge units are for 110v power supply, Australian power is 240v</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want you to believe it&#x27;s lasted that long with heavy use!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other toothbrush would not charge and did not function at all, probably because it had not been charged yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering any electronics online again and see no benefit in my Amazon credit account due to that fact.</li>
            <li> it cycles through 3 other settings until &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; is reached.</li>
            <li> are the other modes).    </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> compare to competing products (Sonicare or other Oral-B models) as I have not tried them.</li>
            <li> me and my wife switched from a ordinary tooth brush to the oral b 3000 and it has improved our overall mouth from stains being removed that could never be done with a manual tooth brush to healthier gums..</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Generic brushheads do not fit!</li>
            <li> not sure why those brush heads always seemed so big to me.)</li>
            <li> This helps because I have tendonitis and other wrist issues...relieves my hands from bending and twisting.  </li>
            <li> It felt uncomfortable at first.  </li>
            <li> I like the improvements they have made over the other oral B I had.  </li>
            <li> I would not use any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I will look at other brands and models when it comes time to replace (which is looking like it&#x27;s going to be sooner than I would have hoped).</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other modes out</li>
            <li> This small change in the way I take care of my teeth made a big difference in my twice-yearly dental visits.</li>
            <li> Deducted 1 star due to the voltage issue.  </li>
            <li> but I had to buy a transformer due to the voltage difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cheaper toothbrushes and they just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other electric toothbrushes compare, but I would suggest an electric toothbrush for anyone.</li>
            <li> I did my homework on the other electric toothbrush out there and on the battery operated ones.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews and they did help.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is possible to brush properly with a manual toothbrush, it seems that vast majority of people brush wrongly when using it, using side-to-side motion.</li>
            <li> it with the dentist in which I had to have work done other than two a year cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> my whife broke the wrist and i bought it to her to brush easier with the other hand.</li>
            <li> I have used other Oral B/Braun electric toothbrushes over the years and had no problems.  </li>
            <li> prefer the Oral-B to the Sonicare mainly due to the brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I would even disassemble and air dry the unit periodically with little result.  </li>
            <li> I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every 30 seconds the toothbrush motor revs up and then down a little telling you that you&#x27;ve brushed that area for the required 30 seconds and you can move onto the other quadrants of your mouth (a little brochure that comes w/</li>
            <li> The light blinks so much that it is very annoying.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel polished, they&#x27;re not more sensitive than usual</li>
            <li> I am sending the 2nd broken toothbrush back, waiting another 6 days for the shipping process, and anticipating another faulty product arriving.</li>
            <li> I spent less time at the dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2 major problems with these oral-B&#x27;s is the ridiculous amount of charging time it requires per minute of use and it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the Sonicare in cleaning.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that you have to cycle through all 3 speeds to turn it off or hold the button down very firmly, a nuisance when the brush is spewing toothepaste if you take it out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little rough on my teeth</li>
            <li> No real complaints, just wish it would charge up a little faster.</li>
            <li> but charging takes forever and the battery dies a little bit faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I saved about half compared to other stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation.</li>
            <li> brush has a pressure indicator, push too hard and the red indicator will glow.</li>
            <li> System has several settings and it alsolets you know if you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> Part of it was that the implant crown wasn&#x27;t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I am a hard brusher, so I appreciate having the \\&quot;too hard brushing\\&quot; warning on the handle, and I like how the vibration briefly changes every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch to a different section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> and then I purchased a different toothbrush that was TOO HARD.</li>
            <li> It will flash red if you push to hard and has a built in timer.</li>
            <li> It was REALLY hard to reach my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush does stop when I press too hard, which is a big part of why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t like the fact that the brush heads don&#x27;t come with individual hard plastic covers like the sonicare ones do.</li>
            <li> so I could monitor how hard I brushed.</li>
            <li> The lights tell you how hard to push so you can brush properly.  </li>
            <li> I have always found the extra gadgets are hardly used and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> In use, however, the small round tip doesn&#x27;t hold toothpaste especially well.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it needs a cover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after it has run for 2 minutes it does not shut off automatically.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I find is the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> Had to charge it for 24 hours, which would be my only complaint, because I was looking forward to using it -</li>
            <li> The charge last about one week, and it takes at least 12 hours to charge the brush.</li>
            <li> Since neither complaint was a total deal breaker (and because we had thrown away all the packaging and paperwork) we kept it.</li>
            <li> But for various reasons, I decided lately to try the Oral-B</li>
            <li> The big negative for this one is the price</li>
            <li> so each section gets its equal time and gets you to at least 2 mins of brush time.</li>
            <li> so was skeptical when it came to spending so much for this brush.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that bothers me more than seeing gunk building up around the charging base.</li>
            <li> And indeed I&#x27;m better about flossing now and plan to go to the dentist every six months because even though it was just two cavities, I hate dentists and fillings and don&#x27;t want to go through that again).</li>
            <li> More annoying than anything</li>
            <li> with improved charging base design, which lies flat, easier to clean, and sturdier to boot.</li>
            <li> But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like having to hold it down to stop the brush from moving.  </li>
            <li> Their quality is going down the tubes.</li>
            <li> you press the button twice and it slows down -</li>
            <li> The sytem seems to have settled down now.  </li>
            <li> thing that took me a while to figure out is that you can hold the button down to power it off rather than having to cycle through all the settings.</li>
            <li> and if you wipe it down after every use then no problems.</li>
            <li> When the 2 minute cycle is over, you feel as if the unit is going to shut down.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this brush is perfection!</li>
            <li> So i purchased this toothbrush and i will tell you it works extremely well!  </li>
            <li> i mean, i only have had it for 2 months as of this writing...</li>
            <li> It was fine, but the gunk buildup was terrible and it started acting strange with the timing of the cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In particular, there is no way to store the unused extra cord in the base, as used to be possible.  </li>
            <li> but at this point the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge past a single brushing.</li>
            <li> If you brush too hard it might be for you, if the light doesn&#x27;t drive you crazy,</li>
            <li> Previous to receiving the Oral-b 3000 I had been using the [[ASIN:B000ZLWNOA Oral-B CrossAction Electric Toothbrush]] for quite sometime.  </li>
            <li> My previous toothbrush was a Sonicare Essence E5300.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the replacement of one i previously had.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910.</li>
            <li> It was slight, but noticeable to me.  </li>
            <li> It was slight, but noticeable to me.  </li>
            <li> used a previous version for 2 years and cannot believe i didn&#x27;t upgrade within that time.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because there is less stuff floating around in there</li>
            <li> It feels &amp; sounds like a Crest spinbrush that you buy for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> It charges fully in less than</li>
            <li> i had still unused from my previous one.</li>
            <li> The head rotates faster than my previous brushes.</li>
            <li> I got the toothbrush for $20 less and one of the brush heads for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has an indicator for when to charge the unit and lasts about a week and a half (your mileage may vary).</li>
            <li> The three items collectively cost me less than $20 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> than typical battery-operated toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It brushes as well as the Oral B brush which we previously owned.</li>
            <li> However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I needed to replace my previous O-B brush.</li>
            <li> less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> previous oral-b came with a travel case for the handle and two tips.</li>
            <li> Given that this brush costs slightly less than the Ultreo did, and Oral-b is a name that&#x27;s not going to \\&quot;go under\\</li>
            <li> Upon using it, it lacks the power of one I previously owned, is LOUD and rattles, does not brush as well and still suffers from the gross out factor of the Sonicare E series</li>
            <li> We had the Triumph 9000 model before this and it would charge in less than 12 hours even when the battery was at end of life.</li>
            <li> I did use the previous version of this</li>
            <li> Bought this when previous Oral-B electric toothbrush was still operative, but could no longer find replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> I typically keep it fully charged</li>
            <li> Less damage to the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I owned an Oral-B power toothbrush previously.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brush over previous electric brushes I had over the years.</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight than my previous oral B. A</li>
            <li> I previously owned an Oral B electric Tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> These brushes die out after about a year and half of use...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel even cleaner than previously.</li>
            <li> I bought the Precision 3000 when my previous Oral-B died after about six years.</li>
            <li> just a slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;*Tie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically go about a month or so between heads.  </li>
            <li> One hour of charging will produce half a minute of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like the slower setting and don&#x27;t need the stronger one, I would suggest getting the 1000 model, which we also have and it is less $.</li>
            <li> I got about 8+ years of use out of my previous rechargeable Oral B&#x27;s before they no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Using this indicator, I have not experienced the brush slowing down due to low charge as I have in previous models.</li>
            <li> vibrate too hard, gum hurts when using too long..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Evidently I&#x27;ve been brushing too hard for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable base is also able to be broken down to a smaller size for travel.</li>
            <li> NOT cool.  </li>
            <li> The mode switch is a source of frustration, though if you hold it down firmly, it will shut off.</li>
            <li> I spent the past 3 years with a sonicare toothbrush but the unit died on me, and I wanted to get something a little cheaper this time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve flossed religiously, and brushed like crazy to make that plaque go away, and it never really does!  </li>
            <li> I never knew I was occasionally pressing too hard with my electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> should add that the new charging base is much less convenient than the old design.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago</li>
            <li> If you like the flexibility of 3 speeds and a charging base that can be easily taken apart</li>
            <li> If you like the flexibility of 3 speeds and a charging base that can be easily taken apart</li>
            <li> I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well.</li>
            <li> In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy and bulky compared to the previous version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are not clean as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> Love the small base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wary of electronic toothbrushes since my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about buying an oral B toothbrush until I realized it was still a braun product.</li>
            <li> also appreciate the little house for the toothbrush heads that you snap the charger into.</li>
            <li> My mouth was a little sore</li>
            <li> little stand provides a way to let four brushes air-dry while also being protected from dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I had to get 2 gum grafts (no fun!).  </li>
            <li> Then came this little beauty, the Oral-b 3000.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to as I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush since I was a child.</li>
            <li> but it took a little getting used to .</li>
            <li> When you hear other reviewers saying how this brush feels like going to the dentist everyday to get your teeth cleaned, they are not lying!</li>
            <li> I got this just for a change from my sonic brush as my gums get a little sore at times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to learn to brush a little lighter than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> This is my fist, so I have little to compare it to except my wife&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing for little kids (and us adults)</li>
            <li> :  my only con so far is that I don&#x27;t like how the base charger cord is long...</li>
            <li> if I can use my old base with my new brush (and vice-versa)</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with this and my prior Oral-B is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to feel the On/Off button.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointing factor is having only 1 brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to charge it every two days, so I wouldn&#x27;t have the annoying flashing green light lighting up the bathroom all night.  </li>
            <li> stand in line and wait to have the attendant punch in the information on the card manually(very inconvenient).</li>
            <li> I have a dental cleaning in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I like the round head.</li>
            <li> If you are brushing the way you are suppose to, which means not &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; at all but just holding it there to let the bristles get between the teeth, then round is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery arrived dead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral b for a few months now and just have 2 observations.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to stay under $75 so that eliminated quite a few.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smoother, and it is not as harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few months without any hitches.</li>
            <li> So maintaining them is not cheap.</li>
            <li> It also allows multiple people to use the same toothbrush base since the house holds 4 different brush heads.</li>
            <li> So he ends up crying</li>
            <li> It lasted up until a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The round head allows me to control the areas of my brushing.</li>
            <li> few problems I&#x27;ve learned to work with</li>
            <li> I figured I should step up my home cleaning to make up for missing a routine cleaning or two.     </li>
            <li> We had a model that was a few (4?)</li>
            <li> A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing.</li>
            <li> The round brush gets into every space in my mouth.</li>
            <li> But now the brush head has worn out completely and I am unable to find the correct brush head replacement.</li>
            <li> brush head is round</li>
            <li> My gums adjusted after a few days to the additional stimulation.  </li>
            <li> I do have trouble with the button switch.  </li>
            <li> That feature (meant to alert you when it&#x27;s time to brush a different quadrant of your mouth) is somewhat irritating as it feels like the batteries have run out momentarily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> Instead you have to push the start/stop button a few times to get the unit to turn off.</li>
            <li> This model does not fit my needs as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help remove plaque buildup that I was missing by manual brushing.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks of using the 3000, my teeth are noticably whiter.</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable ....</li>
            <li> but the few times I&#x27;ve had it off the charger for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oral B toothbrushes for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get used to this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I got this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the round brush gets into between the teeth and removes the plaque like my sonic.</li>
            <li> It will just blink green continuously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few Oral-B electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Had a sonicare for a few years.</li>
            <li> Few weeks now</li>
            <li> round head&lt;br /&gt;Speed</li>
            <li> round head&lt;br /&gt;Speed</li>
            <li> One friend over used this product and had trouble until&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> not really huge problem.  </li>
            <li> Green light kept blinking,  which was annoying.  </li>
            <li> Messy, messy, messy.  </li>
            <li> Just to test it out, I bore down so hard on the brush that the motor bogged down</li>
            <li> My base for my old Oral-B was rated for 1.9W, new one is 0.9W, not sure if that means it charges slower or</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it arrived as it had an American plug which meant I had to buy an adapter as I live in Australia.</li>
            <li> and I notice that I have considerably less plaque surrounding my teeth!</li>
            <li> Even worse, the performance suffers a significant drop off with each use as the battery dissipates charge.</li>
            <li> And the prices isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as what I expected for decent electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Having been an Oral B consumer for several years, are a bit disappointed with this unit because of the loudness and what feels like drag when the 30 second timer &amp;#34;stutters&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Thought spending this much on a toothbrush seemed excessive but after the cheaper model was so disappointing, I reluctantly made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> However, the scooped base collects water and gets icky very quickly</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist told me I needed, as I have a tendency to over-brush and press down too hard.  </li>
            <li> and it pauses if you push down too hard, so</li>
            <li> I lien the sensor that let&#x27;s you know when you&#x27;re pushing down too hard.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this after my last dentist appointment (in which I had 2 cavities) because I was tired of paying the outrageous out of pocket costs that come with fillings and figured I could start by upgrading to a more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No more LCD screen window that wasted battery power in standby mode.</li>
            <li> I like the round head brush, easier to use and brush all my teeth, since my mouth is small.  </li>
            <li> It barely makes it five days without a charge which makes it useless to travel with.</li>
            <li> Disappointing  fortunately used old base I had.</li>
            <li> &amp; they were beginning to slow down a lil.</li>
            <li> Since the head on this brush is a small and round it really gets into those hard to reach places (where moving back and forth is almost impossible) and it just whisks things away!</li>
            <li> Also, it stops frequently for a second or two, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to use for tight areas.</li>
            <li> So the use it will be less expensive in the long run.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to pack when going on vacation..</li>
            <li> The little sucker has a lot of power beware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for technology as you can see in my review history, but technology has very little reason to be involved with my teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for technology as you can see in my review history, but technology has very little reason to be involved with my teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> and when I did go for a clean-up the dentist asked me what I was doing because he said there was very little cleaning</li>
            <li> One thing, it does take a little bit of adjustment on your gums when switching from manual to a powered toothbrush, so I&#x27;d start out slow with the Vitality, then work your way up to this beauty.</li>
            <li> The charging unit itself is small and takes up very little space if you don&#x27;t use the multi-brush head holder.  </li>
            <li> I like that they have a small colored band on the bottom to help distinguish my brush head from his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night.</li>
            <li> I used to think electric toothbrushes were for lazy people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to manage 17 hours to charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral-B tooth brush in the past</li>
            <li> I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> I started with a small list the toothbrush had to have or</li>
            <li> I started with a small list the toothbrush had to have or</li>
            <li> I discovered what I have been missing!</li>
            <li> and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than</li>
            <li> When turned on there was a faint hum in the handle but nothing further.  </li>
            <li> And they are not cheap!</li>
            <li> ILL KEEP IT SHORT....</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whitening function, though.</li>
            <li> Spend this small amount of money to save yourself at the Dentist.</li>
            <li> the Oral-B)&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; mode though.</li>
            <li> for the not so positive:&lt;br /&gt;1) Might be a bit bulky for someone with a small mouth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the battery falls well short of its advertised 10 day life.  </li>
            <li> I used battery operated toothbrushes in the past since they were inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush holds a charge well, usually needing a charge once a week (a charge does take 12 hours though).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this after having tried a SonicCare in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> Reaches the areas that I usually don&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even with only two days use, it hadn&#x27;t finished recharging when I went to bed, after 13 + hours on the charger.  </li>
            <li> Still not entirely sure why these devices have not moved on to using lithium poly</li>
            <li> I never knew it existed until my Sonicare failed FOR THE THIRD TIME in 6 years.</li>
            <li> Finally after months of feeling sorry for myself as my gums receded</li>
            <li> , I know the battery is dead when it stops brushing halfway through the cycle...!)</li>
            <li> I say try this one for about a month each time you brush your teeth, and then just randomly use a generic toothbrush one time...</li>
            <li> While it was on, it seemed a little loose compared to the firm base that the toothbrush actually goes onto.  </li>
            <li> The brush is slightly expensive than the conventional tooth brush or other electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I have used a SonicCare toothbrush but really hated that ultrasonic vibration that you can feel right down to your bones.  </li>
            <li> During the 2 minutes of brushing, my saliva slowly drips from my mouth down the brush onto my hands creating a sloppy mess.  </li>
            <li> The brush only comes with one brush head, which is a little disappointing.     </li>
            <li> However, we found the same product cheaper at Costco, which is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the on/off button is difficult to use without taking the toothbrush out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll blame my ignorance on the fact that I am not a morning person, and therefore will not read a manual in the morning, and usually brush my teeth before I climb in bed too late and blurry-eyed.  </li>
            <li> It was annoying at first</li>
            <li> It comes with 1 brush head, plug-in charging base, brush holder for several brushes which you can opt not to use if you have limited space and a manual.</li>
            <li> he said that he enjoys the sensor on it to let him know if he is pushing to hard.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested an electronic toothbrush because I was brushing too hard and could damage my gums.  </li>
            <li> Sensor notifies you if press too hard.</li>
            <li> Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Built into the 3000 is a \\&quot;Hard Brushing Alert\\&quot; which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that the LED is, \\&quot;Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The instructions say that the LED is, \\&quot;Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so it is hard to miss no matter</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve learned where I am pushing too hard and can adjust the pressure</li>
            <li> It lights up when pressing too hard on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I brush too hard.</li>
            <li> pressure sensor never worked on my model, which is a shame because I do believe I brush hard.</li>
            <li> IT DOES VIBRATE THAT HARD...</li>
            <li> /&gt;They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing.</li>
            <li> cleans hard to reach places</li>
            <li> I like the sensor that is on the handle that let&#x27;s you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> It is hard to push.</li>
            <li> I like the warning when brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell when to replace the heads.  </li>
            <li> I like the feature where the brush will hesitate if you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> The quadrant system for brushing teeth and the shut off if pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> Not that brushing your teeth is a hard job, but this thing tells you when to change sides in your mouth and lets you know if you are brushing your teeth to hard.</li>
            <li> This thing has a timer on it, and lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Reminds me not to brush my gums too hard.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said that it was hard to notice the pulses.  </li>
            <li> I learnt this the hard way.</li>
            <li> I was probably brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I brush and floss at least once a day,</li>
            <li> But I just leave it charging at least overnight</li>
            <li> Or at least this review.  </li>
            <li> I complained to Phillips Sonic people and got no satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it had come with at least one additional brush head.</li>
            <li> I plan to use both at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I still use my manual toothbrush at least once a week, but this is now my go to tool.</li>
            <li> That will be a negative for some</li>
            <li> negative</li>
            <li> The brush has been a bit of a disappointment mostly related to its battery life.  </li>
            <li> I like that you can keep it plugged in without damaging the battery (at least that&#x27;s what it says).  </li>
            <li> After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  </li>
            <li> The design of the base is much improved on.</li>
            <li> much as I like the storage area that comes with this model, it&#x27;s not staying hooked onto my charger&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> I hope this prevents the yucky toothpaste buildup on the handle (if you&#x27;ve used these electric brushes you know what I mean...)</li>
            <li> No more fighting for us!</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a toothbrush after all.</li>
            <li> My last one failed after 10 years : not complaining !&lt;</li>
            <li> (seriously how hard is it to change the model so it doesn&#x27;t get all your saliva/toothpaste/tartar stuck inside?).  </li>
            <li> my dentist telling me I was brushing too hard and its not good for your gums.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old Oral B plaque remover with his one, and I have not ben disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to the new 3000 model, which has an annoying warning when you are supposed to be done with each arch.</li>
            <li> Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> Seriously, what have I been doing all my life??</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon.com was 40 dollars less expensive than retail stores</li>
            <li> The heads (brushes) are easier to install and less expensive to buy.  </li>
            <li> It appears to have a bigger base, but you can take the round portion off and just use that on the counter.  </li>
            <li> This unit failed less than three months after we bought it.  </li>
            <li> When i use the Oral B&#x27;s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i&#x27;m brushing, the sonicares do not do this.</li>
            <li> bad it only comes with ONE brush!</li>
            <li> 1 bad experience has left me scarred</li>
            <li> When I bought the oral-B thay had a 50% rebate, which is why I made the poor decision to go with the oral-B instead of the Sonicare to begin with, but, the brush I gave to my mom had the UPC code which I didn&#x27;t notice until it was gone in the trash and too late to send in.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s only a small, portable base, I would recommend this Pro 3000 model.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s only a small, portable base, I would recommend this Pro 3000 model.</li>
            <li> Battery life is terrible, it&#x27;s loud, the design causes the brush head to drip down the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, after three weeks of using this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve noticed hardly any plaque in that problem-area!  </li>
            <li> I find the picture illustrations in the User Guide hard to understand!</li>
            <li> (Hardly any plaque!)  </li>
            <li> My lack of brushing and flossing and regular dental cleanings had me worried that something bad was going to happen because of my poor dental hygene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This newly designed base may slow down yucky mildew developing on the bottom of the base, but I suspect mildews will still develop around the brush mount.    </li>
            <li> Although, it&#x27;s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work.</li>
            <li> re-charging seemed very slow.  </li>
            <li> The charger is very slow.</li>
            <li> just a little awkward to turn off after use.</li>
            <li> have several little cavities for nasty post-brush toothpaste to get stuck in.</li>
            <li> You know that area behind your front bottom teeth?  </li>
            <li> Also ordered it at Walgreens when the base price was already low, so it was a steal.</li>
            <li> Maybe make a model with a simpler base for those of us that don&#x27;t need the extra storage?</li>
            <li> This brush has a slim handle and simple base.</li>
            <li> come with a big charging base -</li>
            <li> come with a big charging base -</li>
            <li> My husband gets annoyed that the toothbrush does not automatically shut off like his does</li>
            <li> I know, I&#x27;m behind the times.</li>
            <li> The product is what was broken.</li>
            <li> The 1000 and 3000 are the same size base but the 3000 had the perks I wanted (</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re a bit tired to always buy batteries.</li>

            <li> plus, i paid approximately $89, and</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to buy a water pik to compensate for this toothbrush&#x27;s poor design and function.</li>
            <li> I thought that was an unnecessary item as I was reading the description.  </li>
            <li> The bigger base of the Oral B is for holding spare brush heads.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Compact charging stand with optional larger base incl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the small stand alone base, as it takes up less space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, Ultreo went under and replacement brush heads are now in dwindling supplies from third-party vendors, at ridiculous costs.</li>
            <li> The older Sonicare brushes had a terrible design where mold would form under the brush head area in the cavity where the magnet is.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely disappointing and frustrating, to say the least.</li>
            <li> It seems a little bit noisy, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was truly sad when the poor ol&#x27; guy bit the dust.</li>
            <li> Item comes with a small stand alone base, with a removable larger base that holds an additional four brush heads.  </li>
            <li> some of my teeth were too close together to get that stupid little cord in between them.  </li>
            <li> There is one quirk that happens while using it that is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.do</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
            <li> I was really sad to replace my braun electric toothbrush of 14 years after the motor went out.</li>
            <li> $100 is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> $100 is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> #34;who doesn&#x27;t do that?&amp;#34;, but if you look at the reviews there&#x27;s quite a few complaints about the charger base gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The speeds and articulating feature seem wrong.</li>
            <li> However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s not too expensive, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Sorry I did not purchase sooner.</li>
            <li> discontinued the model and brush heads became scarce and prohibitively expensive</li>
            <li> I got some message from Scamazon saying they are sorry for the inconvenience, yadda yadda yadda, they take every precaution to ensure the products are not damaged in shipping.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I blind people with my pearly whites.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems to take forever to charge.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is difficult to use while the brush is still in</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any model from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> In fact, the oral-B is one of the worst buys I have made in many years, if not the worst.</li>
            <li> #34;we&#x27;re sorry this has happened</li>
            <li> Quite expensive though.</li>
            <li> but I my research found that all electric toothbrushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t disclose what was wrong - looked</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for one when the battery failed to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I could be wrong</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve left it attached to the toothbrush base as the holder is the square-ish shape attached to an oval ring that the toothbrush base fits into.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I hadn&#x27;t ever spent the money on the oral-B to begin with and saddled my mom with a pathetic brush.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how weak the battery became after a year.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from bleeding gums/sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> so I started cutting wires connecting the battery.  </li>
            <li> Battery life stinks.  </li>
            <li> After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can&#x27;t see because it&#x27;s inside the column.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you will think you are crazy.    </li>
            <li> So, after I learned to shut it off, I kept thinking the stupid button was broken.  </li>
            <li> Dirty water / spit accumulate inside the brush</li>
            <li> However, in contrast to the one it replaced, it did not come with a travel case, which I was not expecting--most disappointing, since we travel a lot.</li>
            <li> Instead of housing the brushes in a stand behind the base it is a separate piece.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this toothbrush I had my annual dental check-up and the hygienist who cleaned my teeth was unable to find any plaque or tartar at or below my gum line!</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Also, it very difficult to get hold of you.  </li>
            <li> All the tooth paste settles in handle and the button to turn on/off is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> It has the power to scrub thru the worst of scum, film and food particles.</li>
            <li> and it was impossible to charge the toothbrush or use it.</li>
            <li> It was noisy but I&#x27;m still assuming that was from it being a bad one.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the toothbrush head options.</li>
            <li> since i want to save counter space i did not use the wider base just the charger.</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s a bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> The base can hold 4 brushes.    </li>

            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to manuel!! Great toothbrush, super easy to bring on a trip in a light bag, stand the charge for a good time, even though it does take some time to charge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it only comes with ONE brush! I would have liked to have a &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works great. Ii is powerful so I use the slower setting.</li>
            <li> I think mine arrived defective so I had to return it. It was noisy but I&#x27;m still assuming that was from it being a bad one. I&#x27;d say if you get yours and it&#x27;s quiet, it will be great. Seller was great and returned item.</li>
            <li> Used 3 times and now it&#x27;s no longer charging!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush.  I had an older version of this and replaced after a few years.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Best clean I&#x27;ve ever had outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays charged pretty well. Experience teaches that you get about the 700-1000 cycles you would expect on a rechargeable battery as a single user. If you resort to always leaving the charge base on (which is natural to do, just uses a little more house electricity), you might get two years&#x27; use out of a handle. Likely about a year for a family--just a rough guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t think that the pressure detector works in my unit, but I keep a light touch, anyway. The stuttering sound is just the handle telling you that 30 seconds have elapsed. I don&#x27;t like that feature, really, and I don&#x27;t see a need for three speeds, since that just means I have to keep pressing the button more times to turn the unit off, as it cycles through its speeds. But I suppose people with dental work might need multiple speeds, so I&#x27;m okay with the slight extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend ordering the three pack of sensitive heads...they seem to clean better and be easier on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Dang good tooth brush thank you!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Braun I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!  I highly recommend this brush.  I&#x27;ve had the $20 plug-in Oral-B brush before, which I thought I loved, until I tried this one.  This is worth the higher price, I cannot believe how clean my teeth feel even by the end of the day.  Also, due to the small toothbrush head, you use about half the amount of toothpaste as you would on a normal brush, but with way more efficiency.  What I also like about this brush is that it lights up if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure, which is very important if you have issues with gum recession (brushing too hard, or not brushing hard enough, can contribute to receding gumlines).</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Oral-B brushes for many years.  This is a great little grill maintainer.  Not really crazy about the red warning light the unit emits when too much pressure is applied to the brush head, but the light has helped me to reduce the pressure I use to scrub the grill.  This brush head has 3 modes.  My teeth feel refreshingly clean and the grill just sparkles.  Uses the standard Oral-B brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works great at cleaning.  My mouth feels fresh and clean afterward.  I love the pressure sensor and the timer.  Just what the dentist told me I needed, as I have a tendency to over-brush and press down too hard.  The battery holds a charge quite well.  I only have to recharge mine once a week.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to be unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I like the red warning light that comes on when I press too hard.</li>
            <li> Live love love it. Had other Lower powered ones before, but got this when I needed a new one and I love the power</li>
            <li> great feel great price</li>
            <li> I love love love this toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ve noticed a vast improvement in my teeth.  You know that area behind your front bottom teeth?  You know, the area where you get tons of plaque build-up?  I HATE that spot!  I&#x27;ve flossed religiously, and brushed like crazy to make that plaque go away, and it never really does!  Well, after three weeks of using this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve noticed hardly any plaque in that problem-area!  My husband is so impressed that we purchased extra brushheads for him to try it out and he&#x27;s sold as well.      There are three brushing options.  1) regular 2) sensitive 3) whitening.  I tend to always brush on the third level of Whitening.  I really like the light up indicator telling you that you are pressing too hard.  Also, there is a timer that vibrates when you should move to the next quadrant of your mouth.    The stand and charger are also a nice perk.  The stand comes with 4 compartments to store the brushheads, as well as the charger stand.  But if you don&#x27;t think the extra part of the brushhead storage is needed, you can only use the charging portion to take up less space.      Overall, this is a fanastic toothbrush by Oral B.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone NOT seeing improvement by using this brush.</li>
            <li> Previous to receiving the Oral-b 3000 I had been using the [[ASIN:B000ZLWNOA Oral-B CrossAction Electric Toothbrush]] for quite sometime.  It was inexpensive and did a better job than a manual brush. The opportunity to try out this higher end model was easily decided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening and charging the brush, I decided to buy some extra brush heads so that my boyfriend and I could both use it. The covered case that attaches to the charging stand allows for up to 4 additional brush heads to be stored.  They can either be purchased here on Amazon: [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head]] or in most stores. I like that they have a small colored band on the bottom to help distinguish my brush head from his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have now been using the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush]] for about 3 weeks and we both really like it. We feel like it&#x27;s cleaning better than our previous brushes and with the timer feature, we are probably doing a better job. It gives the brush a quick stutter at 30 second intervals to help you focus attention on individual areas, before moving on.  Then there is a long stutter to let you know that you&#x27;ve brushed for at least 2 minutes. One other feature that I didn&#x27;t expect to use was the pressure indicator, but apparently (according to the red light that comes on) I brush too hard most of the time? So using this brush has forced me to lighten up a bit, which is another good thing. Clean up is easy, we just run it under hot water for a few seconds after brushing, although I suppose if you&#x27;re worried about germs a quick alcohol swab would work even better.  Then the brush head is removed in placed in the storage case until next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely pleased with the quality and performance of this brush.  As for the price I do feel that it is a bit high, BUT currently Oral-b is offering a generous rebate on this brush and many others. My advice is to take advantage of it and when that is factored in, the brush is almost a bargain.t is factored in, the brush is almost a bargain.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I purchased it on the advice of my Dentist and I was able to take advantage of the half price offer.  I like the smaller head on the brush and the charge lasts a good week even when using the brush twice a day.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! Since you can buy additional heads my husband and I share it. They are color coded so you know the difference. The holder holds up to 4 brush heads. It&#x27;s an amazing clean feeling after you brush. And even better, they are offering a 50% rebate right now. Check the oral b website.</li>
            <li> Got this toothbrush recently during the Oral-b 50% off rebate promotion. Also ordered it at Walgreens when the base price was already low, so it was a steal. Basically cost a little more than 2 Sonicare elite heads and I got a brand new toothbrush. My previous toothbrush was a Sonicare Essence E5300. Would give this a 3.5 rating if Amazon had those but 3 was too low so I rounded up.     I guess I&#x27;ll do the rest with Pros and Cons.    Pros  Cleans the surfaces really well, the motor is powerful. Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was better than the Sonicare in that regard.  Replacement heads are a lot cheaper than Sonicare.  Amazing price if you buy it at the right times.  Bright red light when you brush too hard.   30 second notifications and 2 minute notifications.  Light and Compact, easy to hold with a good grip.    Cons  Battery seems to charge very slow  Not as good at cleaning between teeth compared to Sonicare (with the standard brush head atleast).  Doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as older Oral-b models.  Costs way too much at retail price (not docking it in my rating, but this has no business being 80 dollars).    As you can see a lot more pros than cons, will be using this for awhile.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot. w&#x27;ve had various of these toothbrushes. all very good. it does all it says it does. great investment. since i want to save counter space i did not use the wider base just the charger. it is convenient though to have some extra storage space if i want</li>
            <li> Since this Oral-B toothbrush is made by Braun, I felt good about ordering it. In use, however, the small round tip doesn&#x27;t hold toothpaste especially well. I thought there might be an optional, larger brush, but have not found one. This toothbrush is okay; I use it once a day and regular toothbrushes twice a day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the replacement of one i previously had.  This one is not near is good as the Sonicaire I had.</li>
            <li> i have been using this toothbrush for a couple weeks now and i have to say that i have no complaints. has 3 different modes; regular, sensitive, and extra whitening. Im not sure how effective the extra whitening feature is but the sensitive option is great to have for me. it also has a red light that flashes upon brushing too hard which is nice. leaves a nice clean feeling and i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift the person loves it... he said that he enjoys the sensor on it to let him know if he is pushing to hard. he feels \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; after use</li>
            <li> After a week with this toothbrush I can just say I enjoy every minute.  It&#x27;s a simple product that does exactly what it supposed to.  My teeth are much cleaner and I feel better after every brush.  Let&#x27;s just hope it will last (my last electric toothbrush lasted barely 6 months, but it was ten years ago...).</li>
            <li> It met my expectation of a good toothbrush.  It is powerful and cleans my teeth very well.  It could clean in between my teeth, thus leaving little to floss out.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best purchase in quiet a while. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long.</li>
            <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I would finally rate the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush now. I have been using this unit for three months and feel I can accurately rate my experience with using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have previously used Phillips Sonicare Flex Care R910. This electric toothbrush was great. I have nothing bad to say about Sonicare. My only gripe was the replacements are a bit on the pricy side. Moving on, I decided to replace the Sonicare (gave to my wife) with the Oral-B 3000. My reasoning was the dentist recommended this brush due to my on-going fight with periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was like most of you, obsessive about reviewing a product before I buy in hopes of making sure I am getting the best product while keeping finances in line. Specifically, the dentist said, he has recommended this toothbrush because of the small head and the functionality of the sensitive setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an owner of both, I find them similar in a sense, that they are both out (the toothbrushes of course) to perform the same job. The Sonicare did its job just fine. However, the Sonicare seemed to be a little harder on my gums (even on the sensitive setting), so hence the switch. Furthermore, Sonicare is a great toothbrush, I think when it comes down to preference, and it&#x27;s more or less the same with a few personal caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the Oral-B. This brush has performed great. The small head actually makes cleaning my teeth easier (remember my periodontal disease) so I don&#x27;t bleed as much. The sensitive setting works just the like Sonicare and I really see no difference other than the size of the head. Plus, the replacement brushes are much less expensive which was an easy sell for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth brush is prone to developing gunk on the inside of the brush (if you had/have one you know what I mean). I find this very easy to clean out with a Q-tip. Although, it&#x27;s tough to get into all the nook and crannies, I seem to make it work. Plus, I always rinse the brush afterwards with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life appears to be great. I usually charge it every 9-10 days which great compared to my Sonicare of 5-6 days. The vibration and strength is great the company claims (40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute). The actual brushing is triggered by a single button which has 4 settings: daily clean, sensitive, polish, and \\&quot;off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush also has a pressure indicator that lights up orange when you appear to be pressing too hard while brushing which is a big help for me in my situation. The build quality seems good to me. I have dropped this toothbrush three times over the span of three months and the electric toothbrush survived without any visual damage or cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging does take quite some time until it is fully charged. However, if you are like me, I brush three times a day, and usually place the unit on its charge at night. Therefore, the brush has hours of charging before its next use. One minor gripe is as opposed to the Sonicare, the vibrations are REALLY STRONG. This may be a positive to some, but it does tend to vibrate your head at first. Which I must admit, was a slight burden when I first started using this unit. Once you use this toothbrush for quite some time, you get used to the vibrations and now I don&#x27;t even really notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I like this toothbrush. I gave it four stars because while I think it&#x27;s great, there is nothing that says WOW, this is the best product ever I have ever had; let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s a toothbrush right? Plus, I feel time will tell if this is a five star product (which I intend to review later down the road). Both the Oral-B and the Sonicare, have their difference. But for me what it comes down to is what my dentist recommends based on my prognosis of periodontal disease. I do recommend this product, and I hope that most enjoy it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, Ido NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.do NOT feel Phillips Sonicare is a bad toothbrush. I feel they are both on par with each other. You can&#x27;t go wrong either way.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I like it much better than the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush.  The circular motion seems to clean teeth better than a vibrating brush.  Cleaning teeth manually can vibrate a brush, but one can&#x27;t mimic the circular motion of the brush.</li>
            <li> I think this Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision is a great product.</li>
            <li> this works fine (the battery my earlier 3000 didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected), but the fact that I&#x27;m replacing it shows my satisfaction with it.  One caveat:  Oral-B keeps changing the product line-up for the e-toothbrushes in ways that makes it harder than unusual to understand what you&#x27;re getting, and the Oral-B website isn&#x27;t as clear as it should be in explaining the line-up</li>
            <li> Gifts for my kids. The wife and I have used for several years and would never go back to hand brushing.  Our dentists sees the positive results in cleanliness and good gum margins.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months now.... I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the first high powered sonic toothbrush I have used, up to now have always used old school toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve been meaning to get one and finally got around to it.  My dentist really sings the praises of these types of toothbrushes.    After using this Oral-b 3K for a few weeks I really like it so far.  The first few times using it were a bit jarring because it sort of feels like a jackhammer on my teeth.  But, my teeth feel much cleaner than regular brushing and it&#x27;s easier to clean a few plaque-prone areas.    My pros:  seems superior method to regular toothbrush, good handle size in my hand, good brush size in my mouth, holds a good battery charge, base has spots for extra heads for other family members, pressure sensor light works for me, timer is good.    My cons:  my only con so far is that I don&#x27;t like how the base charger cord is long...this sits on my bathroom vanity so has unsightly cord bunched...would like shorter cord or hide it in the base somehow.    I can&#x27;t speak to durability so far since only been using a few weeks...if anything notable happens I will update this post.  I have a dental cleaning in a few weeks so I&#x27;m curious to see if my dentist notices anything different!</li>
            <li> I figure that I am like most people when it comes to my teeth.  I brush and floss at least once a day, maybe two if I have time.  Fortunately, I have won the genetic lottery when it comes to teeth, so mine have remained healthy despite my relaxed approach to dental care.  At 34, I figured that my teeth were as white as they could get without professional bleaching, and there was no way I was going to layout that much money just to get a shade or two brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this little machine came to live at my house and it has opened up a whole new world of dental hygiene to me.  For instance, I found out that adequate tooth brushing need not take that much time.  If you read the manual - I know, everyone hates to do it, but sometimes it is full of really useful information - you find out that the brush tells you how to time your brushing.  It says that if you think of your mouth as quadrants - upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right - then you spend 30 seconds cleaning each of those quadrants at least twice per day, then you are good to go.  So after a quick floss, all I need is two minutes to clean my teeth?  Yes, and further, the brush signals you to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick reminder, after you put the toothpaste on your brush, press it to your teeth before turning it on, otherwise you get to spend some time cleaning toothpaste off the bathroom mirror, walls, and perhaps ceiling.  One press of the power button puts the brush in the daily clean mode.  Two presses takes you to the sensitive mode and three gets you to the whitening mode.  I went straight to whitening because I figured that would let me see if there was really any difference.  As recommended, I immediately picked a quadrant and gently moved over the entire area - front, bottom, back, and gumline.  After just a bit, the brush did a slow turn or two, signaling me that it was time to change quadrants.  Once I changed to the next quadrant, I tried pressing hard to see the indicator light.  The light was much bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.  I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tackling all four quadrants, the brush gave a slightly more emphatic slow turn or two in order to let me know that my two minutes was over.  I rinsed, and looked in the mirror.  To my surprise, I could already see a change in my teeth.  It was slight, but noticeable to me.  After using it for a couple of more weeks, I am pleased to say that I have achieved brighter teeth than I thought possible and without the need for expensive, professional brightening.  Since the based offers a case where you can store up to four brush heads, it is something the whole family can use, so I think it is well worth the cost.ch bigger than expected and is on the back side of the handle, the part facing the mirror so it is easy to see.

            <li> I love the better features! Def. better and stronger spin. Feels like it&#x27;s removing the stains!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a previous version for 2 years and cannot believe i didn&#x27;t upgrade within that time. I finally had to wait when my electric toothbrush would last for 30 seconds even though i had it charged for over 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Once you go electric like this you will never go back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if they gave more heads, It gets confusing when trying to find which head is the best, It would of been nice if they gave a sample of 4 different types</li>
            <li> Ill have to check back after my next cleaning, but so far so good. I like the round head. If you are brushing the way you are suppose to, which means not &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; at all but just holding it there to let the bristles get between the teeth, then round is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice to have a dedicated off switch, but its not that big a deal to hold the button down for an extra half second.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and a great dental tool. I have used the brush type before,  but I feel I get teeth cleaner with this rounded one.</li>
            <li> My dentist had been telling me for years to get an electric toothbrush and I finally did. It was kind of a strange feeling to have this thing buzzing in my mouth, but I&#x27;m used to it now and I love it. I had searched for a price I could live with and I found it on Amazon. All the retail outlets were much more expensive. Like I said before I love the brush, but it did take some getting used to. The brush is much thicker then a standard brush and I felt it, but I&#x27;m now used to it. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from bleeding gums/sensitive gums. It has helped a lot.

            <li> The Oral-b 3000 electric toothbrush system is very easy to use and does a quite effective job in leaving your teeth feeling and looking clean. Its round brush head enables you to surround each tooth for a tooth-by-tooth clean and its three brushing modes instills a sense of confidence that you are you are getting \\&quot;professional care.\\&quot; Further, to make sure you are brushing properly, you are reminded at thirty second intervals, for a total of two minutes, to brush another area in your mouth. Comparatively, however, I prefer the Philips Sonicare for the following reasons: (1) its sonic action requires you to apply almost no pressure and virtually no pysical brush movement; and (2) its rectangular, longer-bristled brush head allows you to clean areas that the Oral-b&#x27;s round head can&#x27;t get to as well. One advantage that the Oral-b 3000 has over the Philips Sonicare is its light that comes on to warn you when you are applying too much pressure when brushing. All-in-all, the Oral-b 3000 is a product with which I think you&#x27;d be quite pleased; but, as I said, it is not, in my opinion, the best electric toothbrush system on the market.</li>
            <li> I used to think electric toothbrushes were for lazy people.  That may be true in some instances, but what I didn&#x27;t realize until I tried this toothbrush was that most people probably love their electric toothbrushes because they work so much better than a traditional toothbrush.  I&#x27;m tickled that every time I use this toothbrush I get that &#x27;just came from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling.    I love pretty much all of the features on this brush - the different brushing speeds, and the built-in &#x27;timer&#x27; that alerts you to brush a different area of your mouth.  I don&#x27;t think they could have made cleaning your teeth much simpler!  I love how easy it is to take the brush off the base and put it back on when you&#x27;re done, and the little covered storage area to store extra brush heads.  I was very pleased to find Target-brand brush-heads that can be used with this brush, I purchased five heads for the price of 3 of the brand-name ones.    The only feature I don&#x27;t really find necessary (for me at least) is the red light indicator that flashes if you&#x27;re using too much pressure when you brush.  I tried it just to see what it does, and you have to push REALLY hard with the brush against your teeth for the light to come on, I can&#x27;t imagine most people normally brush that hard.  So for me this was not a necessary option, it&#x27;s just there though and doesn&#x27;t interfere with the use of the brush in any way.    I only wish I had discovered the ease and pleasure of having such clean teeth earlier - I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Our dentist swears by the Oral B and our whole family uses them.  The pressure indicator light is especially useful for someone like me, who tends to flatten toothbrush heads in a week.</li>
            <li> The pressure warning doesn&#x27;t go off until you use enough pressure to remove paint. Other than that, it works very well. I like the 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li> I have always used a manual toothbrush in the past and this was my first experience with an electric.  I had always been concerned about electric brushes being complicated and not much of an improvement over their manual cousin, however, my fears were quickly allayed as I found the Oral-b 3000 to be a fast and easy setup.  I also wasn&#x27;t prepared for the kind of clean a electric brush would bring over a manual.  My teeth feel much cleaner and I even find myself looking forward to brushing now.  I brush more often and for longer with the Oral-b.  I recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use electric brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing! There isn&#x27;t a single aspect of this product that I do not like. It is not too noisy. It notifies you every 30 seconds and has a separates notification after 2 minutes have passed, but unlike other toothbrushes it does not turn off after two minutes and instead starts over again (this is nice because I usually brush for slightly over two minutes and having to turn the brush back on was annoying). If you&#x27;re not a fan of the circular  brush (which I must say I was weary of) there are several different brush styles available. With that said, the circular brush is actually really effective.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and so does our dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> This review is based on a sample provided through the Amazon Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a regular tooth brusher.  Twice a day for two minutes each.  A regular flosser, too (although not quite as frequently.)  With one week of use, my teeth feel cleaner than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size of the brush, this uses significantly less toothpaste than a normal brush.  I have to spit out quite a bit less, and obviously a tube of toothpaste will last quite a bit longer.  Even though my teeth feel cleaner, my mouth tastes less clean before I rinse.  I think it&#x27;s because there is less stuff floating around in there while I&#x27;m brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some nice features to help you know how much to brush.  Every 30 seconds the action pulses a bit, telling you to move to the next quarter of your mouth.  At the end of the fourth quarter, you get a longer pulse.  Basically it&#x27;s helping you to brush each part of the mouth evenly for a total of two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery arrived dead.  The instructions say it takes 17 hours to charge.  I know it wasn&#x27;t finished charging after 12 hours.  I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to manage 17 hours to charge.  That&#x27;s 6am to 11pm, which is farther apart than my normal brushing schedule.  The battery is meant to last for a week of brushing (twice a day for 2 minutes - total 14 brushings or 28 minutes.)  After the 11th brushing, the red charge indicator was blinking, but it worked fine through all 14 brushes.  The charging stand is contact-less, which is a nice feature for something meant to be around water.  It also has a standard plug, without a large brick.  The stand itself is also quite compact, and comes with a larger case which can hold multiple brush heads.  The only thing I&#x27;m not sure about is how much power it actually takes to charge it for 17 hours.  There&#x27;s no obvious mention of power use on the charger.  Just as a comparison, my electric razor lasts 2 weeks (still 14 uses) but charges in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet looked at my local stores for replacement brushes, but Amazon seems to have quite a selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a great product.  And with the current mail in rebate Amazon is offering, it&#x27;s a real deal.I haven&#x27;t yet looked at my local stores for replacement brushes, but Amazon seems to have quite a selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a great product.

            <li> Making the leap from cheap manual toothbrushes to the electric Oral-B 3000 has been a joy. The timer that buzzes at 30 second intervals let&#x27;s me know how much time I should spend on each quadrant of my mouth. I haven&#x27;t really used the other brush modes, but I can see how the slower sensitive setting might benefit some users. Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for years, and decided to give this one a try when my last sonicare finally died.  I&#x27;m sure both brands do just fine for cleaning teeth so no complaints for either in that department.  I&#x27;ve used the Oral b for a few months now and just have 2 observations.  They&#x27;re not major issues for me, but just enough that next time I&#x27;ll probably go back to Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Sonicare brush action was definitely more &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; and made my teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Oral b has this hole just under the brush that dribbles so its been messier to use.&lt;br /&gt;On a funny side note.  When the sonicare died, it would start running and I couldn&#x27;t shut it off.  I took out the insides and threw it in the trash.  Middle of the night it starts running again in the trash.  Couldn&#x27;t remove the battery so I started cutting wires connecting the battery.  Startled me when it started running again!  I took out some pliers and broke the circuit board.  A light on the board slowly faded and it finally died.  Just like the Terminator movie!</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested an electronic toothbrush because I was brushing too hard and could damage my gums.  I started doing research and got bogged down in how many toothbrushes were on the market and which one to get!!!! I decided to stick with a trusted brand (Oral B or Sonicare). There were so many features on brushes that it became confusing as to what was important.  I  looked at price since the price range was from 29-199. I wanted to stay under $75 so that eliminated quite a few. I also wanted a toothbrush with the 30,000 stokes and one that timed each section in each quadrant of my mouth. Here is a quick overview of the good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Teeth felt like I left the dentist after using. Sensor notifies you if press too hard. Vibration after 30 seconds to move to the next quadrant of mouth. Tray included has room for 4 brush heads (comes with 1). There is a wide variety of brush heads on the market and coupons seem bountiful. There are several modes with different intensities/modes. Charge last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I wished it turned off automatically after 2 minutes. It might be a little intense for kids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral-B tooth brush in the past so I knew that I would like it. But this price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Replaces an Oral-B that was at least 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric toothbrushes; this is the best by far.  My teeth feel cleaner and even polished after a brush, the sensation of the brush is actually pleasant and the brush is easy to keep clean.  No more lifting off a brush top to find something growing underneath- you pull off the brush and rinse after every use.</li>
            <li> it cleans well, but is very loud</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a SOnicare for the past 8 yrs or so and didn&#x27;t want to spend the $$$ for a new version with the pressure sensor so I bought this one.  It feels &amp; sounds like a Crest spinbrush that you buy for a lot less.  The brushhead sticks out a bit in the back so even though the brush head looks compact, it isnt as easy to maneuver behind your back teeth.  It really feels like a powered toothbrush that was designed 5 yrs ago - not very refined.</li>
            <li> Poor design in so many ways. The brush head is too large, meaning that I can&#x27;t keep my mouth closed around it when brushing my front teeth and it sprays water everywhere through the top of the brush head. Has to be taken apart and completely cleaned after every use, otherwise toothpaste-laden water hides inside the brush head and leaks all over the handle section. Terrible design.</li>
            <li> I used the Sonicare for about 3 years.  It was fine, but the gunk buildup was terrible and it started acting strange with the timing of the cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I do for many things, I began researching and reading reviews here on Amazon.  I was torn between this one and the 2 more expensive models [[ASIN:B004O76DEC Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable, White/Silver]] and the [[ASIN:B004O7B4YG Oral-B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care Rechargeable, White/Silver]].&lt;br /&gt;The only differences were minor (computer thing with the 5000 and some other gadget with the 4000 and maybe a setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 is much less expensive and has 3 settings (which is honestly 2 more than I need).  It charges fully in less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action on this is SO much better than the Sonicare. My teeth feel smoother, and it is not as harsh.  The circular motion can be felt as I go over each tooth and my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, and brush holder device that comes with it is well designed. It seems to be very easy to do the 2 minute cycle, which the dentist should be happy about. My orthodontist recommended this to our family and hopefully it will help for future check-ups. If you&#x27;re a manual brusher this takes a little getting used to, but after a week you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I drink lots of tea and a decent amount of red wine :) That meant I&#x27;d have to get a professional dentist office cleaning at least three-four times per year.  I bought this toothbrush to see if I could remove surface stains on my own without the office visit hassle.    In only one week, it has done WONDERS.  I love this toothbrush, and it&#x27;s effective enough to skip the extra money for the &#x27;5000&#x27; model.  Unless you just enjoy blowing the extra cash, this model is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> it cleans good voice  is  loud  and i like it !</li>
            <li> Hi everybody,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is fantastic but be aware you&#x27;ll need some time to get used to it if you&#x27;re a first timer in this kind of electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many models of the Oral-b/Braun german electric toothbrushes and this is by far the most practical to use, basically because it has three programs: daily cleaning, whitening and the sensitive. You can choose between them by pressing the only button once, twice or three times being the first one the standard daily cleaning, fi you press twice you&#x27;ll get the sensitive (never tried this one) and if you press it three times you&#x27;ll get the whitening mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush came with a very good standard brush head but i fitted with a whitening toothbrush head i had still unused from my previous one. I can say that I like to use it with both brushes. One for daily and the other one for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature it has is that it tells you when to switch the part of your mouth you&#x27;re brushing. You have to divide your teeth in four and brush each quarter for 30 seconds, then the brush will stop for a fraction of a second and then start again just to tell you to switch to the other quarter. Once finished it will stop-and-go some times indicating that the 2 minutes period for the whole mouth has finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a pressure indicator, push too hard and the red indicator will glow. This is particularly useful not only to not harm yourself but also to make brushes heads last longer. This is the first Braun/Oral-b brush I&#x27;ve had with all this features but I can tell you, I love this features. While it has no screen like other models, I don&#x27;t want to fix a battery eater anywhere in my bathroom so I&#x27;m not missing this feature from other more expensive brushes from Oral-b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is after moths of daily use. This kind of brushes tends to fail because of the battery but this one it&#x27;s getting older and even after some accidental drops, keeps looking and working like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to experiment a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it. Buy one and enjoy for months to come of your like new mouth feeling everyday. I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is a tool i just can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the [[ASIN:B0037LKO46 Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Toothpaste, Radiant Mint 5.8 oz (164 g)]] with the [[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] for better whitening results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this toothbrush since august 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.nt a higher level of cleanliness and whiling to adapt to this new way to achieve it, just do it.

            <li> Love this toothbrush! Teeth feel like they just had a dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it&#x27;s made in Germany which speaks volumes for the quality of the product.  It is wonderful.  I think I&#x27;ve forgotten how to use a regular toothbrush, although I have always used Oral-B/Braun for my teeth.  You can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-b toothbrush worked for 3 or 4 years and the battery finally quit.  It was a basic rechargeable model with a 2 minute timer.  I wanted at least as much in my replacement.  I decided to spend a little more money for more features and I&#x27;m really happy with the 3000 Professional.  I like the fact that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another area of you teeth.  The pressure sensor works but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d ever push hard enough to actually turn it on in use.    The minor thing that I don&#x27;t need is the stand accessory which has the holders for additional brush heads.  This could probably be useful for a family that shares a toothbrush and simply swaps heads.  I knew what I was ordering though and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars.  Maybe make a model with a simpler base for those of us that don&#x27;t need the extra storage?</li>
            <li> This will a short review. This toothbrush is excellent and gets my teeth cleaner that any other that I have owned. The head rotates faster than my previous brushes. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the brush. The reason I give this low rating is because I don&#x27;t think its any better than the Oral-B Pro Care 2000 Dual available at Costco, wish for 2 brush is at a comparable cost</li>
            <li> We went through 2 Oral B Pro brushes, the first set lasted a long time, the second did not and the battery quickly drained and we had to charge it everyday. Bought this one as it&#x27;s on sale. It is lighter and little smaller than my previous two Oral B. Thought of buying the PRO 5000 but since we do not need the fancy stuff, we decided to go with this one. So far so good. Just a little bit on the loud side. The three brushing settings are fun to use, so I brush more thorough now which is good. I hope it lasts as our first one.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. You can feel the clean. Heaps better than your nonelectric toothbrushes. Does not come with case. Come with charger and a stand that holds extra heads. But this stand is not condusive for travel. And trust me. I travel.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is great work, weakness is 2 minutes after the brush does not automatically stop, and the battery is not very to force.</li>
            <li> This is great.  We love it.  Looking forward to dental check up and cleaning to see if it has made a difference.  Feels like it has.</li>
            <li> I am a nut when it comes to dental care.  I have had more than my share of dental issues, so I really try eliminate issues before they come up.  I floss daily and have used a Sonicare electric brush for close to 15 years.  It was recommended to me by a dentist who needed 3 separate appointments, at about an hour each, to clean my teeth.  That was a bit much for me.  And my teeth weren&#x27;t that bad, it&#x27;s just that he was very fastidious.  I have had stellar 6 month check ups since I have used the Sonicare.  The hygenists always marvel at how quickly they can be done with my cleaning because of my preventative maintenance.  And I ALWAYS swish my mouth out with water after eating or drinking anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, when I got the chance to try this Oral-b, of course I was up for the challenge.  When I first started using the Sonicare, that was pretty much the only one in its category.  Now we have the two, and it seems that people really like one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the Oral-b for a week, I can tell you that I am definitely a Sonicare person.  Here is the breakdown of my experience:&lt;br /&gt;Oral-b pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Handle feels nice in hand.  It has a silicone/rubbery grip that is ergononimic&lt;br /&gt;*Pressure indicator good for hard-brushers.  Brushing too hard is bad for your teeth, it can wear away at your gums and enamel.&lt;br /&gt;Oral-b cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Way too noisy.  I felt like there was a small jackhammer in my mouth.  Not a relaxing experience, I felt too stressed with all of the noise, lights, and buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;*The depth of the brush head was too much for my mouth.  Going around the teeth from front to back was almost impossible, because the brush head plus thickness of what attaches the brush head to the handle is a lot thicker than a Sonicare brush head.&lt;br /&gt;*It does not stop after 2 minutes of brushing.  I am used to the way the Sonicare handle stops working after you&#x27;ve hit the 2 minute mark.  With the Sonicare if I want to keep brushing after the 2 minutes, I just press the button again.  With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.  Next bullet point.&lt;br /&gt;*Loud humming with surge pulse.  This is Oral-b&#x27;s answer to Sonicare&#x27;s quadrant pacer, where it nudges you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Well with all of the loud vibration going on in the first place, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if that was a hard pressure indicator, surge pulse, or if I pushed the button again while brushing or what!&lt;br /&gt;*Single button control. It made it kind of difficult to control what I wanted to do since the one button controls the power, daily clean mode, sensitive mode and polish mode.  Again, with all of the vibrating going on, it was hard to tell what mode I was on, and I just gave up on that.&lt;br /&gt;*Cleanliness?  I didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were any cleaner than they already were when I used my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still believe that liking the Oral-b or Sonicare is a matter of personal preference.  Cost analysis-wise, the Oral-b might be a little more less expensive to buy and get replacement brushes.  But I prefer the Sonicare.With the Oral-b, I was always wondering if I could stop or not, because I couldn&#x27;t keep track of how many times the loud humming of the surge pulse had gone off.

            <li> I should start of by saying that I&#x27;ve never used a professional toothbrush before, but I do use the cheap Oral-b CrossAction power brush on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as comparisons go, the Oral-b 3000 and CrossAction are like night and day, and I literally feel like I&#x27;m finally actually brushing my teeth - that&#x27;s how clean they feel. My dentist has been telling me to invest in a professional brush for years, and I can see why. Here are just some of the things I love about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- practically no assembly required, it&#x27;s ready to go out of the box&lt;br /&gt;- comes with a deck for the charger and slots for 4 heads. Storing the head keeps it cleaner, and you can use this brush for the entire family - just get different color heads and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;- all you have to do is move the brush around, no pressure needed. In fact, if you press to hard, the red light around the handle starts flashing and the brush slows itself down.&lt;br /&gt;- the brush has 3 cycles - regular, whitening, and sensitive - all you have to do is just lightly press the power button to switch between cycles&lt;br /&gt;- I love how sensitive the power button is. With CrossAction, I had to jam the button to get the brush going. With the 3000, you literally just tap it.&lt;br /&gt;- the brush takes about 17 hours to charge fully, and last for a week. However, I just keep it on the charger all the time since you can&#x27;t overcharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I&#x27;m not ecstatic about is the lengthy cord for the charger - I wish it was retractable since not everyone has a large sink/counter space. Other than that, this brush is perfection!</li>
            <li> I have been an Oral-B electric toothbrush user for the last 15 years. I have written Amazon reviews for Oral-B products dating back to 2002. I have had very few dental issues in this time although, in fairness, I must also report that I began daily flossing during this time as well, and that may be just as important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model is a definite step up from the ancient \\&quot;Plak Control Plus\\&quot; model that I had been using. It&#x27;s full name is \\&quot;Professional Care 3000\\&quot; and it definitely feels and sounds like a  professional dental instrument. The head oscillates at a much higher rate than my old one. Please note that this is not an ultrasonic toothbrush. Cleaning is accomplished here purely by mechanical brushing action. The small, rotating brush head and slender handle allow you to get at and clean each surface of each tooth very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 offers three modes of operation which are available by successive presses of the on/off button. The first is \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; which is what you are most likely to use on a regular basis. The second is \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; which reduces the head speed for sensitive areas or for those with sensitive teeth. The third is \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; which is an odd repetitive increase/decrease of speed for \\&quot;Exceptional whitening for occasional or everyday use.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that come with the 3000 recommend that you brush for 2 minutes - no less and no more. To assist you with this, once you turn the brush on it will pulse twice every 30 seconds. If you use each interval to clean one quadrant of your mouth, you&#x27;ll be done in the recommended 2 minutes at which time the brush will pulse 4 times. To turn the brush off from any mode, just press and hold the on/off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built into the 3000 is a \\&quot;Hard Brushing Alert\\&quot; which is an LED on the handle that lights up if you are pressing too hard. Brushing is most effective when the brush is pressed lightly against the teeth. Pressing too hard not only is less effective but will cause your brush heads to break down too quickly. The instructions say that the LED is, \\&quot;Helping protect your teeth and gums from hard brushing,\\&quot; so apparently there&#x27;s a dental health issue here as well. The brush is very powerful, so it&#x27;s not difficult to see how too much pressure would be destructive to the surfaces of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a charging stand and covered storage tray that can accommodate 4 brush heads.

            <li> Easy to handle for people with small hands. great feeling during and after brushing. it meets and exceeds our expectaions</li>
            <li> We have had a braun toothbrush in our home for 15 years.  I heard that Oral-B was doing a 50% rebate promotion so I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I chose the 3000 model, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The toothbrush has a vigorous action, and my teeth feel dentist visit clean after I brush.  The 30 second timer is a nice feature that allows you to spend that amount of brushing time on the four quadrants of the mouth. The 2 minute timer lets you know that the morning/evening ritual is complete.  The storage lid hides the brush heads when not in use, and is a feature that my wife appreciates.  The one negative comment I have is that the package only comes with one brush head, but I suppose that the nice rebate more than fairly offsets the cost of additional heads.</li>
            <li> Battery life stinks.  I have no idea how I bought this with its LONG charging time to give a weeks worth of brushing.  As a toothbrush it does well, the sonic action is noticeable from brushes that do not have it.</li>
            <li> Always loved Oral-B. This my third one to own in the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> My son,who has had braces for 2 years, uses this toothbrush. This type of toothbrush was recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist. He has been using it for a couple of months now and at his last orthodontist appointment a big difference was noticed, especially around the gumline. 5 stars! Cleans very well!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised and I love it.  Amazon shipped immediately, not the 6-8 weeks others promised, and the Oral-b company got my 50% rebate to me within 14 days. Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Had an older slower Oral-B and liked it so I ordered this one. Really cleans teeth better than the older one but it is noisy. Once I got used to the noise I was fine with it. Love the way it cleans!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new toothbrush.  It is my first electric toothbrush, and I love using it while my grandkids use theirs.  (They love it too.)  The charge lasts well, I also like that it automa-tically recharges as needed.</li>
            <li> I recently received my Oral-B Professional Care 3000 toothbrush and I think it is great!. I have a much older model Oral-B and while it still works, this new Oral-B works MUCH MUCH better. My teeth feel cleaner and it gets more of the tartar off of my teeth than the older electric toothbrush did. I find that my teeth feel cleaner all through the day. I don&#x27;t feel any plaque build-up as I did before. Also, the toothbrush handle is longer and easier to hold onto. I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning teeth. Storage unit holds 4 brushes. I leave it plugged in. Unit automatically recharges after each use (after first full charge) for an hour or two, but can be used immediately. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months without any hitches. Happy purchase.</li>
            <li> The OralB Professional Care 3000 electric toothbrush is everything and more than you expect from an electric toothbrush.  I have always used electric toothbrushes but this one makes my teeth feel really clean..gets in between the teeth and around the gums.  My dental hygenist even commented on the difference since my last cleaning (she thought I actually flossed more, not a chance).  My only complaint is that it needs a cover. My other electric toothbrushes had a cover and were easier to pack for travel and the most important part felt cleaner in the bathroom with hair and hairspray used daily, with a cover.</li>
            <li> This replaced my old one which lasted at least 20 years. I have sensitive teeth &amp; this brush doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive areas which hand brushing does.Am looking forward to many years of thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush that performs brushing exactly as my dentist and research tells to do. It is not about the force you put into brushing but actually the number of strokes performed that polish plaque off of teeth with the toothpaste. This means the more brushes you get in (across all of your teeth) the better you are cleaning them. With this electric toothbrush, you would have to spend roughly 20 minutes using a manual toothbrush to get the same amount of clean out of the 2 minutes it takes instead!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement brush. I have used the Oral-b brush  for many years. This is a wonderful product and will surely  insure a smile for many years with all your teeth intact.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would have liked it even more if the required charging frequency was less.</li>
            <li> I was really sad to replace my braun electric toothbrush of 14 years after the motor went out. I was a little concerned about buying an oral B toothbrush until I realized it was still a braun product. This toothbrush is excellent. I really feel the difference when I brush with an electric toothbrush. My teeth feel so much cleaner, and I always get compliments from my dentist about how little plaque I actually have on my teeth. This is a must have in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I just replaced an oral-b toothbrush that lasted 4 years. My old toothbrush would not hold a charge for more than a few days after 4 years so it was time to replace it. This has been a great replacement.</li>
            <li> I love it. Had one before, but it quit working. It was about 20 years old. It lasts good. Does a great job on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Sonicare Flexcare sonic electric toothbrushes the last 3 years and they break about once a year. After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up. Unfortunately i cannot tell you if they will last a long time since i just got mine about a week ago but i can tell you the difference between the two brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you&#x27;re not trying to, just when you&#x27;re normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you&#x27;re doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B&#x27;s i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i&#x27;m brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy ine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They&#x27;re a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, but i&#x27;ve yet to see how often they break. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They&#x27;re both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you&#x27;re going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b, because if it breaks since it will be less money down the drain.the Oral B are cheaper, but i&#x27;ve yet to see how often they break.

            <li> I love my Oral B 3000 because it makes brushing my teeth less of chore and cleans them really good leaving my mouth fresh for hours, plus Amazon sold it for $25 less than Walmart...an unbelievable deal!</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to this toothbrush from the Oral-B Vitality. The battery on my old one lasted about seven years before it wouldn&#x27;t fully charge up anymore, so I have high hopes for this one. The first time I used it, it repeatedly complained (the red light flashed) because I was brushing too hard. It lights up your entire mouth so it is hard to miss no matter which way you are holding the brush. Since then I&#x27;ve learned where I am pushing too hard and can adjust the pressure so I don&#x27;t get the light flashing as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general my teeth feel significantly cleaner with this new brush, especially in the back where it is hard to clean all the way, and also the inside of my front bottom teeth where it&#x27;s hard to sweep back and forth. I think the majority of this is due to the more powerful motor (and fresh battery) on this brush since the head is basically the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is the 30 second timer that tells you when you move to the next quadrant of your mouth. My old Vitality had a two minute timer, which I often didn&#x27;t make it all the way through, but with the 30 second timer it basically guilts you into doing the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the little house for the toothbrush heads that you snap the charger into. After each use you can remove the head and put it away to keep it clean. I hope this prevents the yucky toothpaste buildup on the handle (if you&#x27;ve used these electric brushes you know what I mean...) It also allows multiple people to use the same toothbrush base since the house holds 4 different brush heads. If you are using this brush by yourself, I could see this feature being less great for you since it takes up a lot more counter space than the older models that don&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this toothbrush is that there is only one on/off button which cycles through the different modes. To turn it off you have to hit the button three times (if you are using the first mode). This is pretty minor, not worth taking off a star.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B electric toothbrush finally died after some 10-15 years.  I researched other electric toothbrushes and discovered Oral-B had the highest rating from Consumer Reports and users as well.  And Amazon had the the lowest price for this particular model.  After using this new one for over 3 weeks, I think it is superb:  I love the pauses that tell me to move on to another section, and the new and latest brush is also great!  I still have 4 of the older brushes (a Costco purchase!) unopened.  I use the new one that is more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; at night and the older model in the morning.  This way the brushes dry out completely before being used again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush a week. I&#x27;m using the head that came with the brush which I think is the deep clean. It&#x27;s doing a great job. When I floss, I find fewer particles of food than before. I was using a manual toothbrush for about a year, and I can feel that my teeth are cleaner using the power toothbrush. I like the Oral B because it has a timer to remind you how long to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it and use it twice a day!!! Everything as described, I would never be able to go back to manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> More effective for me than sonic care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Oral-B toothbrushes that worked just fine, but this one had an unacceptably short battery life.  We&#x27;ve only been using it since February (for 3 months) and the battery is completely dead.  It won&#x27;t even turn on.  And it&#x27;s past the return period, and I can&#x27;t find any kind of warranty info.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth after meals is a dreaded time between me and my son. He hates it! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I put too much pressure on his teeth and I wouldn&#x27;t know because he doesn&#x27;t talk yet. So he ends up crying and I end up having to hold him down just to keep his teeth clean. I&#x27;ve had it with this routine, so I went online and researched on Oral-B electric toothbrushes. They have this nifty tool that asks you questions and suggests a brush or brushes based on your choices. I narrowed it down to the Oral-B Professional Care 3000. I was ready to purchase this together with the [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] and [[ASIN:B000RSITSK Oral B Precision Clean 3 pack brush head refill]]. I was waiting to see if Amazon will include this in their Cyber Week sale, and they did! I got the toothbrush for $20 less and one of the brush heads for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son and I have been using this for over a week now, and we haven&#x27;t been happier. No more fighting for us! He actually enjoys brush time now. What&#x27;s great about this is there&#x27;s a light that goes off to signal you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. It also pulses every 30 seconds and at the two-minute mark. So at least now I know when I&#x27;ve brushed my son&#x27;s teeth enough. A really great buy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I&#x27;d bought it for one of my granddaughter. She is very glad with it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. I moved on to it after my Triumph battery would no longer hold a charge. This brush has a slim handle and simple base. It still indicates 30 second/2 minute intervals. It lights up when pressing too hard on the teeth. It uses the same brush heads as before. It has an indicator for when to charge the unit and lasts about a week and a half (your mileage may vary). Using this indicator, I have not experienced the brush slowing down due to low charge as I have in previous models. My only knock on the brush is that it has three speed selections, but no on/off. You have to cycle through all three speeds to get to stop the brush from spinning.</li>
            <li> I have been very surprised and pleased with this product.  Having finally given up on scrubbers, I finally took my dentists advice and bought this and a sonic toothbrush.  I like the three setting and gentleness of this one and the thorough job it does.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and is kinder to the ears than a Sonic.  I feel like the red light comes on at too hard applied pressure.  I wish there were a way to make the light come on at a lower pressure.  I think the light is more of a gimmick than anything else.  Gets the job done though.</li>
            <li> good price to buy, and clean the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does an excellent job. I like the way it lets you know it&#x27;s time to move to another part of you mouth so that you do all teeth equally. The only thing that could be better is placement of the on/off button. It blends in really well with the rest of the handle so you can barely feel it to turn it off.</li>
            <li> I had 17 cavities, this tooth brush literally made them all go away in 2 weeks! Ok not really but it is a sweet little tooth brush. I love that it&#x27;s so simplified but has important features which is what makes a great product great!  It letting you know when to brush the other part of your mouth is fantastic, the fact that it comes with the other modes is great such as if you want to brush your tongue you can put it on soft mode. The charger you see in the picture can actually come apart so you are left with a tiny stand if you want instead of the big face. The back light telling you when you brush too hard is another great feature, you never have to worry about your dentist saying \\&quot;you&#x27;re brushing your teeth too hard\\&quot; which can be very bad for you. Finally the cost. You think about how much this tooth brush actually does for you compared to a standard tooth brush, it simply pays for itself right away!     I went to the dentist recently, had my teeth deep cleaned which is different from a normal cleaning. My mouth was a little sore but what was the most amazing thing is when the dentist said \\&quot;I bet you haven&#x27;t had your teeth feel smooth like that in a while\\&quot; I actually told him that wasn&#x27;t true...I realized then that this tooth brush really is amazing. My teeth feel the same as going to a dentist (plus I floss twice a day), every day..what more can you ask for.    Lastly, compared to other brands and cheaper models from this brand... this to me cleans more precisely than the other top brand which I used for years prior to this and for the cheaper electric tooth brushes... you get what you pay for period. People my age find this expensive, but the investment again is just a win-win that pays for itself right away. Did I mention is also really does help whiten teeth with the special head? yeah that&#x27;s awesome also!     ...oh and the charge really does last all week</li>
            <li> Wish I had started using a water pic years ago&lt;br /&gt;never too late this is just perfect  ...now that I am&lt;br /&gt;using braces</li>
            <li> As a Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH) I recommend Sonicare by Phillips.  I treat alot of gum disease and the Sonicare is a great way to prevent and/or manage the disease. In general, avoid spin type brushes.</li>
            <li> Have owned basic Braun elect. brushes in the past. This is the fanciest model I have owned. Has 3 speeds and battery indicators. Very happy with product and great price w/ 50% rebate.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Much better than my old 1000!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well! Zero complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as older models</li>
            <li> I am a long time Oral-B toothbrush user, and this model definitely improves upon the past models I have used. The pressure sensitive light that tells you if you are brushing too hard really works- almost too well. I am always told I brush to ahrd and this toothbrush proved that. The light blinks so much that it is very annoying. However, I am hoping it trains me to brush softer.    The design of the base is much improved on. Instead of housing the brushes in a stand behind the base it is a separate piece. The charger is stand alone and clear all the way around. It is much easier to clean all of that gunk that builds up on it. If they could make a toothbrush to eliminate that build up it would instantly get 5 stars from me.    Another good note is that the brush accepts the dual action brush heads which I prefer.     The brush only comes with one brush head, which is a little disappointing.     Overall this is a great toothbrush with some great design improvements. If you brush too hard it might be for you, if the light doesn&#x27;t drive you crazy,</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric, rotating or sonic toothbrush (whatever name they go by) in years.  I&#x27;ve used a waterpic and regular brush for a while now. The Oral-B gives me squeaky clean, after-the-dentist-visit clean feeling teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warning when you press too hard is handy, and basically trains you how hard to press.  No complaints there.  The charger cuts off after a set amount of time,so you are not constantly charging the brush. It also pulses to let you know when to move to the next group of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 and not 5 stars? It only includes one brush head and the batteries are not replaceable. If the brush lasts a few years, that&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ll know in a couple of hundred weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, it&#x27;s a definite buy.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1FM9P0U6X9MVT]]* Observations and Performance&lt;br /&gt;** Pro&#x27;s and Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;*** Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are a couple of ways to look at this fine product, the best would be that it can greatly improve your health by providing a good oral hygienic product.  The opposite being that it&#x27;s not exemplary in its performance when compared to alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to a manual brush, this product is like a burst of sunlight through cloudy skies.  But, when you consider that at its regular price of $100, it&#x27;s performance doesn&#x27;t justify the price when compared to the quality of battery-operated toothbrushes that sell for under $10.  And, there are also optional items that are needed because the Oral B DOESN&#x27;T clean between teeth and by itself does not satisfy the need for a good tongue scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush for several weeks now and comparing it to a battery-operated toothbrush, it is significantly more powerful.  I swear by my battery toothbrushes for at least 10-15 years now and can attest that it is both economically and professionally a great buy, Braun&#x27;s silence notwithstanding.  In the years since dropping the manual toothbrush, I&#x27;ve also taken up the habit of flossing daily and using the tongue scraper, first thing when I wake up and during brushing.  The three items collectively cost me less than $20 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, it may be prudent to allow the brush lie flat over the sink to drain for an hour before putting it back on its stand to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed, even in the weeks I&#x27;ve been using Oral B, is that if you&#x27;re a regular coffee-drinker, NO electric toothbrush (battery or wall-mount) will reduce the effects of coffee stain on one&#x27;s teeth.  My teeth feel more polished, but that&#x27;s just about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;+ Stronger motor than typical battery-operated toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;+ Cautionary \\&quot;Red\\&quot; light alerts you to when brushing too firmly.&lt;br /&gt;+ Replacement handles are relatively cheap when compared to the set.&lt;br /&gt;+ 100% better cleaning when compared to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Price.  $100 is way too expensive.

But, in the end, healthy teeth and gums are the goal and if you&#x27;re able to afford this system, it will deliver cleaner teeth and fresh breath.

            <li> Have used many electric toothbrushes ... this is the BEST! Incredible speed. What I like most is the 30 second timer for doing each quarter of your mouth. Also the too much pressure indicator. Wonderful machine! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A year now and its perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a week ago.  I had never used an electric toothbrush.  I bought it because of the current 50% rebate offered by Oral B.  I have been very pleased with how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was rather dubious about using an electric toothbrush. I always thought they were an unnecessary expense that didn&#x27;t really do too much for you in the scheme of things.  I had heard plenty about the Oral B toothbrushes and this one was highly rated.  I am very happy to say that I like how this works, the warning light gives you indication if you are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had issues with my teeth being very soft and prone to problems as well as some issues with receding gums. This toothbrush has given me a noticable difference in my teeth and gums and does exactly what it says it will do in just a matter of weeks.  I am very happy with the results and am recommending it to anyone else who is in the market for an effective, moderately priced electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refill heads are available at most drug stores, but tend to be a little expensive. I would recommend buying them here on Amazon to get the best pricing.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that seems to clean effectively. My only criticism is that you have to cycle through all 3 speeds to turn it off or hold the button down very firmly, a nuisance when the brush is spewing toothepaste if you take it out of your mouth. Really it doesn&#x27;t need all of these speeds.</li>
            <li> Delivery came fast. Wish it would already c ome with replacements but other than that a good product. My Teeth were whiter after the 3rd use. Makes mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> After much research, this toothbrush was the right one for me.  I was looking to replace my old Oral-B and wanted to have storage room for additional brush heads - the old standup version was not easy to clean, so I was pleased to find this one. The price was right, especially with the 50% rebate that was offered.</li>
            <li> System has several settings and it alsolets you know if you are brushing too hard.  Only confusing part is the programs are accessed by pressing the on-off switch and doesn&#x27;t automatically turn off after 2 minutes so you need to tell the 30 second interval notification from the 2 minute notification</li>
            <li> Owned an Oral-b and loved it.  But after many years of use, it died.  Wanted another to replace it, so we ordered the 3000 and LOVE it.  It&#x27;s head is smaller and fits easier into the mouth, and it cleans and polishes beautifully.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Was a gift  - well received.  Just what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s choppers.  She loves it.  She had some problems with gums and was starting to get gum disease.  This cleared everything up in 6 months.  She swears by it.</li>
            <li> Nice item. Works well, and without all the extra features I did not want, this level is great.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush works well.  It would be even nicer if it was not as noisy.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap version of this brush for about three years and it died.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this brush, but it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I swear I can see my teeth getting cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.  It is a powerful brush.  I love it and would buy it again after I wear it out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a reasonable price.  I have used the battery-only version which runs at half of the speed of the electric rechargeable; it seems to me that the extra speed does a better job of cleaning.  The battery lasts for a week or so before recharging is needed and seems to be replaceable though I have no idea of the cost.  Another dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare but it is so much more expensive that I chose to stay with the Oral B which uses the same rotary bush system that a dentist uses to clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush about a month. It&#x27;s relatively quiet, is easy to clean and seems to live up to it&#x27;s billing. I&#x27;m hoping for even better reviews at the Dentist office!</li>
            <li> It is what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery</li>
            <li> I recently posted a review of an Oral-B S-200. I don&#x27;t even think I was posting Amazon reviews back when I bought it on Amazon in 2007. It lasted up until a few weeks ago. So, I really didn&#x27;t have any question about what brand electric toothbrush I was going to buy. Eight years of daily service is enough to make me forget my analytical ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to understand that I was very happy to receive this. I used the S-200 for 8 years, 2 times a day, without skipping a day. That is until the S-200 stopped charging. I still only missed one day of using an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did when I received this toothbrush was replace the head. I have very sensitive gums. I bought the 3 pack of Oral-B&#x27;s Power Sensitive Replacement Heads. My first use of the brush went better than expected. The motion of this model is much more along the lines of what I need from an electric toothbrush. The round head allows me to control the areas of my brushing. I do still brush my teeth with a regular brush 2-3 times a day. I use the electric toothbrush similar to how most people use floss. I want it to specifically hit along my gum line and this model&#x27;s round head does that perfectly. Much better than the S-200&#x27;s traditional style toothbrush head. While I can appreciate the timer &amp;#34;pulse&amp;#34; (the S-200 also had it), I&#x27;ve never really followed it. I cover my gum line all across the top and bottom teeth then go over my teeth once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few problems I&#x27;ve learned to work with: We have three electric toothbrushes in our household. There&#x27;s nothing that bothers me more than seeing gunk building up around the charging base. This can be simply avoided by wiping the toothbrush&#x27;s handle down after every use. I know it sounds simple and you might be thinking &amp;#34;who doesn&#x27;t do that?&amp;#34;, but if you look at the reviews there&#x27;s quite a few complaints about the charger base gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like the storage area that comes with this model, it&#x27;s not staying hooked onto my charger&#x27;s base. I keep it in the cabinet above the sink. It not only takes up more space on your sink with it attached, it also promotes water/bacteria around the base if you&#x27;re switching heads frequently since the heads most likely won&#x27;t be dried out when you switch them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real choice I had to make was which model of the Oral-B I was going to buy. I started with a small list the toothbrush had to have or didn&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth - I don&#x27;t even use bluetooth on my phone or computer. I didn&#x27;t look into what the bluetooth function does, but did know I don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;More than one speed - As said above, I use this specifically for my gum line. All I really need though is the regular speed (for teeth) and the slower, sensitive speed for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come with a big charging base - My wife and I have separate sinks, but even so, I don&#x27;t like sink clutter of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro 1000 model didn&#x27;t have the separate speed settings so I removed it. The Pro 5000 model has bluetooth and the word &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; in front of toothbrush. I&#x27;m all for technology as you can see in my review history, but technology has very little reason to be involved with my teeth cleaning. It made picking the 3000 model an easy choice and on top of that, there was a twenty dollar off coupon on it. Which was enough to cover the cost of the sensitive replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I haven&#x27;t mentioned is this model also comes with a &amp;#34;pulse&amp;#34; speed setting. I tried it. Didn&#x27;t care for it. So it does have three speeds. This model is a good balance between the higher priced models and the lower priced models, though if you don&#x27;t need a sensitive speed setting, I would recommend the Pro 1000. If you like the flexibility of 3 speeds and a charging base that can be easily taken apart so it&#x27;s only a small, portable base, I would recommend this Pro 3000 model. Here&#x27;s hoping for another 8 years of daily use.&#x27;s not staying hooked onto my charger&#x27;s base. I keep it in the cabinet above the sink.

            <li> I bought the Oral B toothbrush this year. I was extremely happy when I opened the box and found a 50% rebate coupon inside. I applied for it and received it in about 4 weeks. There is one quirk that happens while using it that is a little annoying. It turns off and on radpidly about every 45 seconds. It happens so quickly that it doesn&#x27;t disput brushing. Just annoying. It has a feature of three speeds which is very nice. when first turned on it is a regular speed, when the button is pressed again it goes to a slower speed designed for sensitive, when the button is pressed the third time it is a combination of regular and slow speed alternating radidly between the two. That is desined for more plaque removal. The problem is you have to go throuogh all three speeds to shut it off each use. Othe tan that it&#x27;s a great brush. I&#x27;d buy it again. R.L.B.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> No kinder to my teeth and gums than a much cheaper Oral B from the drug store.</li>
            <li> I have been using a sonic toothbrush for quite some time, so switching to the Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush was a bit of a shock. Once I got over feeling like I was brushing my teeth with a swirling brillo pad (a sonic toothbrush head doesn&#x27;t rotate, it just kinda vibrates). I discovered what I have been missing! I brush too hard. There is a light on the back of the toothbrush (so you can see it in a mirror) that comes on when you apply too much pressure. The next thing I discovered was how clean my teeth felt! The Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush does a fantastic job of removing plaque between teeth (better than a sonic brush). My mouth is cleaner, my breath fresher, my teeth brighter and I have a happier smile since I switched to Oral-B Professional Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 days ago , and after I use it ! I can really feel that my tooth r very clean !!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it&#x27;s needs 17HRS to recharge!!!!!!!! Woo, that&#x27;s really long time !</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush! I have both the 3000 and 5000 and I like this one (the 3000) better!  It vibrates different amount of times between switching quadrants when you brush (vibrates once for the first switch, twice for the second switch, and 3 times for the third switch).  The 5000 will beep instead, which is a bit annoying.  The 3000 is the same as the 5000 with just that it vibrates instead of beeping.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, but unless you brush your teeth with the same force used to scrub barnacles off a boat, you don&#x27;t need to pay extra for a light that tells you you&#x27;re scrubbing too hard.</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes brushing a interesting things.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush broke after 1 week. I was out on business travel and combined family travel, was gone for a month, and was no longer able to return the item. The toothbrush will not turn on. I have tried everything; charging, unplugging, removing tooth brush head, re-insterting… bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet it is a great toothbrush when it works!</li>
            <li> I must say this is an amazing purchase.  While I thought I was doing a great job  with my manual toothbrush, this puts me to shame.  Why didn&#x27;t I do this a long, long time ago?  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The main problem with this product, which we bought through Amazon less than 6 months ago, is the brush heads are designed in such a way that germs can enter the plastic column through two points (the oval-shaped hole below the bristles and the bottom of the column) and it is extremely difficult to clean it out. After a few days there is a buildup of absolutely disgusting film which you can&#x27;t see because it&#x27;s inside the column. It grows and goes right back in your mouth the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions included in the package for cleaning -- wash the brush head gently under warm water -- is laughable. I also looked on the Oral B website support section for help and it was absolutely useless -- the only thing Oral B wants you to do is buy new brushheads which cost 25 cents to manufacture at a 4000% markup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried jetting water into the holes which can loosen some of the gunk, but the best way to clean it is to drop the brush heads in boiling water and let it sit there for about a minute, then run cool water over them and jet out the gunk, and then let them dry before reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> &lt;&lt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a month or so, and recently realized... my teeth have ACTUALLY GOTTEN NOTICEABLY WHITER. The action on this brush is much more powerful than my previous generic electric toothbrush. I sorta noticed a slight whitening of my teeth after a few weeks, but was uncertain until my girlfriend commented as well. Regular brushing with this toothbrush and a decent toothpaste ACTUALLY WHITENS TEETH. I stand by this toothbrush as a high-quality product. It is well worth the money if you, like me, take pride in your smile and make dental/gum hygeine a priority.&gt;&gt;    I have 5 dental implants, so taking care of my oral hygiene is a high priority for me.    At a recent visit to my dentist I was told I had receeding gums around one of my implants. The problem? Part of it was that the implant crown wasn&#x27;t seated properly, and part of it was that I was brushing too hard. The dentist told me to stop using my normal toothbrush and switch to an electric model as this would help reduce the irritation to my gums.    I went to Target and bought their generic &#x27;Up &amp; Up&#x27; brand electric toothbrush. This was actually really nice (for the price) and did reduce the stress on my gums. However, when the Oral-b 3000 came out on Amazon Vine, I knew I had to order &amp; review it.    The Oral-b 3000 does NOT disappoint. For one, the aesthetic is a little nicer than the generic &#x27;Up &amp; Up&#x27; model I was using before. Second, it actually lights up when you&#x27;re brushing too hard. I thought this was a gimmick at first, but have actually had the thing light up on me a few times during brushing -- typically in the mornings, when I&#x27;m distracted and in a hurry to get to work. It definitely helps you keep tabs on your brushing habits, which is good, since brushing too hard can be stressful on your gums and teeth.    Another nice feature is the &#x27;timer&#x27; function -- the toothbrush pulses at 30-second intervals to help you monitor your brushing habits. This is also nice, as manyof us tend to hurry through our brushing routine. The 30-second pulses help you time your brushing and develop better habits.    The charger is small and easy to pack and is an induction charger, meaning there are no exposed electrodes or wires, which is good for use in the bathroom. The brush unit&#x27;s battery is good too -- I used my brush for four days without charging and didn&#x27;t notice a decrease in power. This is a nice contrast with my Up &amp; Up toothbrush which, though it claims it&#x27;ll work for a week without charging, definitely runs slower after a couple days without a charge.    I&#x27;ve been using this unit faithfully and am enjoying it so far. My old unit is in storage and probably won&#x27;t come back out -- this unit definitely blows it away in all areas. I haven&#x27;t made use of the different brushing modes, but I&#x27;m sure some, wishing to focus on whitening, or worried about their sensitive teeth, will appreciate these.    All in all the brush unit, brush head, and charger included in this package are all great and I can say with certainty that they are equivalent to, if not better than, the competing brands/brushes. The price tag is considerable, but when you consider the true value of maintaining healthy teeth &amp; gums, the unit pays for itself handily. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wary of electronic toothbrushes since my teeth are very sensitive. I tried my husband&#x27;s Sonicare once and felt my teeth were going to be rattled out of my head because it vibrated so much. When I saw this had a setting for sensitive teeth, I figured I would give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! My teeth have never been cleaner, nor my gums so pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was jarring at first, even on the sensitive setting but nowhere near as bad as my husband&#x27;s. I liked how the timer indicates each thirty seconds so I can move on to the next quadrant, and then when two minutes have passed (since that is the dentist-recommended amount of time.) My husband gets annoyed that the toothbrush does not automatically shut off like his does but I think I prefer it this way because I often spend more than 2 minutes on my teeth. I also like how small the head is; I can reach places on my back teeth that were inaccessible before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor never worked on my model, which is a shame because I do believe I brush hard. Just to test it out, I bore down so hard on the brush that the motor bogged down but still the sensor did not come on which led me to believe it&#x27;s a malfunction. Hopefully I am in the minority. If you purchase this product, be sure to test it out before the warranty runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. My teeth feel polished, they&#x27;re not more sensitive than usual and I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric toothbrush. No more LCD screen window that wasted battery power in standby mode. Feels like a professional dental cleaning after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush stopped working within 30 days. After two weeks the tip in the daily mode stopped vibrating. When turned on there was a faint hum in the handle but nothing further.  It had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Love the different speed setting and that it also has a storage place for the brushes.</li>
            <li> Battery works for 1 min!</li>
            <li> My wife and I owned an earlier, more expensive Oral B electric toothbrush for several years.  It had a digital timer and a battery life indicator in the handle.  I purchased it at the dentist&#x27;s office but that was several years ago. This time around I didn&#x27;t wish to spend more than the Pro Care 3000 cost. It is a very good buy for the money.  It brushes as well as the Oral B brush which we previously owned. I don&#x27;t really miss the little extras that were on the first brush.  My wife and I both like the Pro Care 3000  and can recommend it to other prospective buyers.  Henry in Lancaster, PA</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush it works fine. Big problem - in order to shut it off, you have to locate the hard to find little toggle switch then press it 3 TIMES (to Fast, to Slow to Off). It&#x27;s a pain. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for that reason alone. Trust me - you will be cursing it.[[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush, 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was love at first vibration.  My dentist (who just so happens to be my favorite medical professional) has been relentlessly hounding me to come over to the electric side.  Every six months she&#x27;d ask,\\&quot;Didja gettit yet??\\&quot;  and I would sheepishly reply that I still couldn&#x27;t fathom the $80+ toothbrush. Of course, upon examination of my rear molars she&#x27;d wax philosophical about those who properly brush for the full two minutes, and follow the listerine-floss-brush system every single day.  Finally, I gave in.  Mostly because I lost my dental insuranc. I figured I should step up my home cleaning to make up for missing a routine cleaning or two.     Now for the technical:   The setup was completely intuitive.  It came with a multi-page english/spanish instruction booklet, which being human, I did not read.   It has three modes of cleaning, I really only use the one.  Every 30 seconds it makes a little pulsation, which allows you to time how long you clean each toothy-hemisphere.  (30 seconds, lower right; 30 seconds, upper right) This helps to ensure you are meeting that all important 2 minute brushing standard.     Really though, once I got used to the novelty of not having to grind my brush along my gumline, it just felt right.  Like lying on the couch with the dog and the boyfriend.  Comfortable, perfect.    I swear my teeth are cleaner looking.  I don&#x27;t swing with that whitening paste, it ruins your enamel. I think this brush makes the difference. My gums feel awesome and healthy.      Seriously, what have I been doing all my life??</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my boyfriend, and he loves it!. Its been six months so far. Still works great.</li>
            <li> Product is better than I expected! Teeth feel as clean as they do after a cleaning at the dentist office. The timer is a great idea to keep you from spending too much time in one area of your mouth. Amazon had the best pricing for this device. I found it for $20 less than many retailers.</li>
            <li> Works well, my 10-year old Braun finally died, so I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used Spinbrush types for years (the ones you find at the drug store for about $20), and I&#x27;ll never go back to the &amp;#34;disposables&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> Had I known how wonderful this toothbrush was going to be....I wouldn&#x27;t have waited this long to get one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with receding gums, my dentist advised me to look into a professional care electric toothbrush to take the place of my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; manuel toothbrush.  I can honestly say that the difference this toothbrush has made in my teeth and gums is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this toothbrush indicates if you are brushing too hard!  My teeth feel smoother, cleaner, and I even feel like my breath stays fresh for longer.  Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend this product high enough.  What a difference.  Now maybe I won&#x27;t be so nervous to go to the dentist!</li>
            <li> The Oral-b came highly recommended from my dentist and friend.  And it has proven to be just what they all said.  Makes my teeth feel as clean as a professional cleaning.  Yes, I would also recommend this to anyone who is looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Oral-B-ie - powerful, inexpensive, nice kit!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This is my third electric toothbrush.  My first two were more basic model Sonic Care.  My first Sonic Care I loved and it lasted a long time.  The second one however would no longer hold a charge within a year which really irked me so I decided to try Oral B.  The lower cost of the replacement brush heads and a good sale price also factored into my decision to try out this brush.  I initially ordered the 1000 model but chose this one for its stronger motor.  It has taken some getting used to the rotary brush style.  I still think I like the way the sonic care cleans better but I do like this brush more and more.  I do like more basic models...I doubt I will use anything other than the daily clean mode and it has taken adjustment to have to cycle through the two other modes to turn the brush off.  Its a pain compared to one touch on and one touch off.  But after a week of use I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.  I like the sensor that tells me if I put too much pressure with the brush but I am not completely sold on the 30 second quadrant timer.  I think I just liked the 2 minute auto shut off the soniccare had but again that might just take some getting used to.  I have been using for about a week and the battery is still going strong with no need to recharge.  We will see how that changes over time.  I do love how clean and polished this leaves my teeth, I think it works very well and I am glad to have the more powerful model vs the 1000 but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want anything more complicated than this.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter loves this, she uses it every night. In the mornings she uses her regular toothbrush for quick brushes but at night she spends a good 10 minutes using this. I think it makes her feel both a little more grown up but also she likes taking care of her teeth. Could not be happier with it.</li>
            <li> No cavities since I started using these-12 years ago.</li>
            <li> Been using these for many many years.  Had to replace battery won&#x27;t hold charge - no dental problems for years since I started using.</li>
            <li> Solidly built and comfortable to hold.  Very juiced up compared to our 4 year old version. The charger is actually a small oval unit that separates from the brush tray if you don&#x27;t have room for the whole thing. This brush saves you time and money at the dentist.</li>
            <li> priced better than my DDS doc&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush doesn&#x27;t stay charged to long though</li>
            <li> This product is very healthy for your gums and teeth.  The brushes are larger and more useful than other products.</li>
            <li> This is my first e brush, and i am loving every bit of it. cant go back to manual anymore! Amazon does a great job shipping and everything!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son for his birthday. He thought it was a joke, then loved it !!!!</li>
            <li> It is single speed which is not as good as 2-speed. If I use too much pressure (which is not a lot) it will lag.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better. Wanted this brand as I had a lot of replacement brushes. And they are not cheap!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush.  I never used one before.  This thing is great.  Really feel the difference over a normal toothbrush.  The charging base is nice; does not have electrical contacts to wear out.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not a fan of any electric tooth brushes, but this one is bar far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth have been cleaned by the dentist! This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and I can say that I&#x27;m never going back to a regular toothbrush.  My gums feel good and I have gum issues.  I bought this brush to get my teeth and gums into better shape and so far, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> This is a great rechargeable toothbrush!  There is a variety of many brush heads to choose from.  My dental hygienist suggested one of these years ago and my checkups are much better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this tooth brush. 3-selections for brushing-sounds good-until each time you have to go through all 3 modes to shut the thing off. The speeds and articulating feature seem wrong. If I were cleaning or polishing metal it would be great. But teeth and gums.... * It has a light indicator if you are brushing to hard, so you know if you are brushing to hard.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for a few different reasons. First, there are 3 speeds.  While I only use the middle speed 90% of the time, it is good to have the softer/harder speeds when you need them.  Also, this toothbrush is easy to use with its straight forward design.  My last toothbrush had a tiny LED screen built into the brush that displayed battery life.  However, after about a year, this screen shorted out and became useless. The unit eventually just gave out and I had to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of the red indicator light that blinks when you are brushing too hard. I wish I actually had this feature years ago because I was brushing too hard and scrubbed away much of my enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the charge time is pretty long to reach a full charge and is a good brush for your teeth, not necessarily for your gums.  There are better brushes for you gums.  However, if I could give half stars, I would give this unit a 4.5/5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B was also running a promo at the time; if you buy an qualifying unit, you can receive an 50% mail in rebate.  So I bought this brush for around $80 on Amazon, but got about $40 back thanks to this rebate.  So for $40, this is a great brush.  This is a good idea for Oral-B because I am sure they make all their money for the highly overpriced brushheads; which is my other complaint.  But the higher price for the brushheads seems pretty standard no matter which unit/brand you buy. I also like that it takes up a small amount of space on my countertop; I wish the power cord was detachable for easier storage though - not a big deal however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good brush.  It is a straightforward unit that has just the right amount of features without paying an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This product is a true pleasure to use. It leaves your teeth feeling very clean. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We had a model that was a few (4?) years older and felt like it was beginning to peter out.  This new model is awesome - there are two speeds and it pauses if you push down too hard, so your teeth are really clean at the end.  The storage area is easy to keep clean too.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I needed to replace my previous O-B brush. It is the same model my wife has been using for years and we are both pleased with it. I like the warning produced if you apply too much pressure while brushing and the alert after 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> Best brushing experience ever. Just started using it and it doesn&#x27;t compare to a regular brush. Buy one right away !</li>
            <li> My teeth feel better already</li>
            <li> I had to get a gum scaling done and when i returned for a follow-up several weeks later, I had already started to develop some plaque on my teeth.  I was told by the periodontist that i should use an electric toothbrush.  So i purchased this toothbrush and i will tell you it works extremely well!  I have no plaque on any of my teeth, especially the inside of my lower fronts.  If you have a problem with plaque don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this..it works!  Update:11/2016 - Yes, this works great but there is one huge issue. It states that you can keep the brush on the charger permanently but this will prevent the battery from holding a charge over time. Please keep this in mind. Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li> very good.I like it,my teeth is clear</li>
            <li> This gives my teeth an excellent clean.  It has different speeds depending on your needs.  Not different than other products out there but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Very happy  with this brush. Replaces one that &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after years of good service.</li>
            <li> ILL KEEP IT SHORT....I WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THIS AND SONICARE AND SAW THE UPS AND DOWNS...BOTTOM LINE, I ORDERED THIS ONE FIRST BECAUSE I FIGURED THIS HAD THE ROTATING HEAD JUST LIKE THE DENTISTS HAVE..YES THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE WHEN THEY SAID THIS THING WILL SHAKE YOUR HEAD IT DOES VIBRATE THAT HARD...AFTER USING THIS ONE, IT WAS OK BUT FOR SOME REASON I DIDNT FEEL LIKE MY TEETH WERE GETTING CLEAN, I STILL FELT LIKE I HAD A FUNKY MOUTH LOL...ANYWAY I TURNED THIS IN AND GOT THE SONICARE...YES THE SONICARE IS BETTER SO I GUESS THEYRE STYLE EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT A ROTATING CIRCLE HEAD IS BETTER THAN THE ORAL B&#x27;S...THEY CLEAN BETTER AND THEY DONT REALLY SHAKE YOUR WHOLE HEAD WHILE BRUSHING SO SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE AND GET THE SONICARE LINE...THERE YOU GO.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this unit to replace an earlier version that was showing its age after 14 years.  It still had the original battery but it was showing its age in other ways.  The brush on the new unit moves much faster than the old and our teeth feel even cleaner than they did with the old one and that didn&#x27;t feel bad at all.  The instructions suggest brushing 1/4 of the teeth at a time and the brush stutters a little every 30 seconds so that all four quadrants get cleaned equally.  I see no reason that this brush won&#x27;t last as long as its predecessor.</li>
            <li> The 30 sec timing is a great feature that I wouldn&#x27;t have elected to have, but glad it has it!</li>
            <li> Works very well! Like the rounded top head</li>
            <li> I researched different \\&quot;middle of the road price-wise\\&quot; electronic toothbrushes, and I ended up choosing this toothbrush. After researching different nearby stores, Amazon was almost $20 cheaper in price!! I&#x27;ve used the brush a few times already, and I really do feel like my teeth are smoother and cleaner than when using a manual toothbrush.  I am a hard brusher, so I appreciate having the \\&quot;too hard brushing\\&quot; warning on the handle, and I like how the vibration briefly changes every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch to a different section of your mouth. I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> This one is perfect for me , before I use is only one mode , this is 3 mode and hard censor also, I like it</li>
            <li> Update: Oct 2017. Though will not hold much of a charge, by keeping it on the charger, it still provides daily brushing. Monthly cost is dropping, but purchase price has also dropped about 20% at this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update of Jan 8, 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When purchased in 2011, Oral-B and Sonicare seem the brushes of choice, and my research gave Oral-B a slight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B 3000 has three modes; from a physicist&#x27;s perspective, there seems no significant difference, and I doubt that any objective research could find any either. The mode switch is a source of frustration, though if you hold it down firmly, it will shut off. As for their differences, the second mode is slightly, but hardly significantly, slower, and the third mode apparently moves from the first to the second in an unending cycle of speeding up and slowing down. This seems more of a sales gimmick than demonstrably efficacious functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no significant difference between the 1000 and the 3000 except that the 3000 is more frustrating to use because of the toggle switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, would definitely prefer the Oral-B 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overpriced, $73.45, now $88.95, Oral-B Pro 3000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush does not have a replaceable battery, so I&#x27;ll have to trash it even though everything else seems to work OK. This appears to be about $22/yr, though I might get a few more months if I keep it on charge all the time. Per Oral-B, its life is 3-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, per telecom with Oral-B, the Oral-B Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush has but one action, which should be adequate, and &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; 20,000 pulses per minute. The Oral-B 3000 is claimed to have 40,000 pulses per minute. Pulses were described as &amp;#34;in and out&amp;#34; action of the bristles; 20,000 per minute seems more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B rep said that both models have the 2-minute timer with 30-second signals, one of the better features of the Pro 3000. Thus, it would seem, that at half the price, the Pro 1000 is a much better deal.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush purchase and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this product. I can feel the difference when I go back to my regular toothbrush! My teeth just don&#x27;t feel as smooth as when I use the Oral-B. I share it with my boyfriend, and with their little brush extenshion caddy, it is a relatively easy process. Just make sure you clean it often, because the toothpaste residue dries on it often and makes it unpleasant to look at. But either way, great product! Gentle but effective. I also enjoy the orange light that tells me when I&#x27;m pushing down too much on my teeth, as my dentist had previously told me I have a problem with that.</li>
            <li> First things first, I did not purchase this item here on Amazon. I got it on sale at my local Costco for a steal back in December. I decided I would actually wait to do a review until I had used the unit for a while. The first week after use confirmed that I had made an excellent purchase! I continued using my brush and last week got professional confirmation that this thing was doing a great job!&lt;br /&gt;When your hygienist tells you that you are doing a great,(not good), job after previous visits which involved her reminding me to floss daily, you know that its a day worth writing a review. I wholeheartedly recommend the brush!!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time deciding which electric toothbrush to get.. I didn&#x27;t want a super expensive one, so I opted for this \\&quot;middle of the line\\&quot; product, but it is amazing. The rechargeable base does not take up too much room, but I love the cover case over the top to protect from germs. It charged fairly quickly and stays charged. The bottom of the toothbrush does get a little warm after leaving it on the charger.</li>
            <li> what an improvement over a manual toothbrush, great investment!!</li>
            <li> I have read the research and know, firsthand, the benefits of an electric toothbrush over a manual toothbrush. I prefer the oral-b / braun non-sonic over the sonic models. I am a big fan of this style of toothbrush &amp; have owned them for almost two decades. I have owned 5 different models of oral b electric toothbrushes, in that time, (they are very durable and have lasted me many years) and this one is my favorite. The main reason I like it over all the others (from the $20 model to the wireless $200 model/pack) is that this one has a \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; which illuminates when you put too much pressure on your gums. Before using this toothbrush, I was a vigorous brusher, it just felt good to \\&quot;get all up in there\\&quot;, but often, that is unnecessary and can even be harmful. I buy the \\&quot;extra sensitive\\&quot; heads/tips to mediate this, but I still tended to brush harder than needed, especially when I&#x27;m not \\&quot;paying attention\\&quot;. Even though the other models had an \\&quot;indicator\\&quot; (different vibration or noise or icon), it wasn&#x27;t really enough to get my attention so I didn&#x27;t reduce the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this model, I was annoyed by the light - it&#x27;s *really* bright, especially in a darker bathroom or shower stall. (I have a cool LED color-change light in my bathroom). But, the \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; was able to get my attention when i brushed too hard and after a week or so, I was brushing with a more healthy pressure and the light now only goes on every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say gum recession cannot be reversed and my hygienist told me that it is often caused by hard brushing. This toothbrush with its \\&quot;brake light\\&quot; feature, can be a great tool to help you save your gums &amp; your teeth, and in turn, your health &amp; well-being!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: if you like good oral care, clean teeth, &amp; healthy gums, check out the oral breeze (here on amazon). I use the shower breeze model and have had consistently better reports from my hygienist since using this model of toothbrush and the shower breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)ower breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews to inform me of great products and help me make informed buying decisions, I hope this review helped you in the same manner :)</li>
            <li> vibrate too hard, gum hurts when using too long..</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! Lots of power, leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush outside of the cheap $10 kind you find at the grocery store. I know, I&#x27;m behind the times. So this is basically a huge step up for me either way and I have absolutely no context to compare how this is against other electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing sounds like it&#x27;s powered by chainsaws. It&#x27;s really loud. It&#x27;s so loud that I find it&#x27;s necessary to walk to the other side of the house at night to avoid waking up my flatmate. It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call sleek or pretty as opposed to the high-end models that look pretty attractive. It looks and feels fairly cheap overall. However, I&#x27;ve grown up with a lot of tacky looking cheap Japanese electronics that have survived 25+ years before being handed down to me (We may have an issue with holding onto things around my family) so I will reserve judgement on this front. Looks cheap, feels cheap, but that&#x27;s not really that important to me in a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real question is how the brush cleans. I have sensitive gums and teeth. The first few cleanings have been really rough, but I finally seem to be adjusting to it. My mouth feels cleaner than it ever has except for after dentist appointments. Some reviewers for other toothbrushes have said that their mouth feels the same as it does after the dentist, but this toothbrush isn&#x27;t *that* good. However, for the price, it&#x27;s still a great toothbrush that makes your teeth feel well-loved. And that&#x27;s what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the best toothbrush ever, but it&#x27;s at a good price point and it cleans really well. If that&#x27;s what you want, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out if the stutter it experiences is part of a 2-minute timer, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying to have your toothbrush stop-start-stop-start (albeit extremely quickly) while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth. Still, it&#x27;s not too expensive, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very good unit. Have been using it for five months now and notice the difference between it and regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase but not unhappy enough to bother returning it.  Problems:  When it&#x27;s being charged, the green light flashes indicating that it&#x27;s being charged.  However, the green light NEVER stops blinking even after 24 hours and the battery is fully charged.  So, I can&#x27;t depend on the light whatsoever to let me know when it&#x27;s done charging.  But I just leave it charging at least overnight and it&#x27;s fully charged, so not really huge problem.  Other than that, the On/Off button has to be fiddled with to turn it off.  It doesn&#x27;t turn off after just pressing the Off button, I have to press it 2-4 times before it turns off.  And lastly, there&#x27;s a rattling sound where the brush head inserts into the handle that&#x27;s a bit annoying.  I called the company and they said I could send it to there repair facility, but it would take 6 weeks before I&#x27;d get it back.  I don&#x27;t want to go 6 weeks without taking good care of teeth so I&#x27;m just putting up with these nuisances until it wears out, and then I&#x27;ll try another brand and/or model.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> But I loved my old Braun brush before it finally died after at least ten years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smaller brush head of the Braun, I can reach my back molars with ease.&lt;br /&gt;The brush holds a weeks worth of power on a full charge. Great when traveling so I don&#x27;t have to pack the charger also. For longer trips I love the compactness of the charge base.&lt;br /&gt;The charger base separates from the extra brush holder so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter and is sleek, clean and modern looking while saving counter space. I live alone and only need one brush head at a time.&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized grip is nice but I didn&#x27;t have any slippage with the hard plastic handle on my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Evidently I&#x27;ve been brushing too hard for a long time.  The indicator glows red frequently for me.</li>
            <li> Simply the best electric toothbrush I have ever purchased. I like the every 30 second vibration to know where I am at for time I find it helps me to brush longer. The pressure sensor light is handy and my hygienist seemed happy about this feature as well. Cleans well.</li>
            <li> best than philips sonycare</li>
            <li> Still working fine after being used 2 times a day since August 2012, much better than non-electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I really like the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> I was one of the \\&quot;non-believers\\&quot; in toothbrushes that cost more than a few dollars.  I mean, it&#x27;s a toothbrush after all. WRONG. Once you&#x27;ve used a top quality toothbrush such as this, you&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first time with this type of product, I was a little leary of using it - mainly because I have super sensitive gums/teeth.  Always have.  Even a non-motion regular soft toothbrush was often too hard.  However, I went ahead and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than 1 minute, I learned about the 3 settings and realized that #2 was for me.  I put on the toothpaste and away I went.  The best thing is the size of the rotating head: it&#x27;s about the size of a tooth.  Gee: what a novel idea! As a result, I could keep it on my teeth, versus some of it on my teeth, and some of it on my gums (like a typical rectangular toothbrush).  This allowed me to work on my teeth while moving towards my gums.  In less than a few days, I could see a noticable difference in my teeth: the shine, the way they feel, and how my gums are no longer swollen after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the greatest results for me was being able to reach all the way around my back teeth. This was something I could NEVER do with a regular toothbrush.  I also have some very deep pockets in my gums that have a tendency to hurt and bleed. However, I found that if I rinsed with a bit of warm salt water first, then used this toothbrush to gently work in these areas, they actually firmed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably one of the best personal items I have ever had.  Oral-b is a reliable brand and this is in keeping with the brand recognition.  I think for anyone who wants to start out on a new hygiene routine or take their current routine to a higher level, you have to try this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use, gives you a systematic way to improve your brushing, and does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing...and SMILE for the camera! ;)</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush after reading the great reviews on Amazon and am quite pleased with my purchase.    This toothbrush replaces a 12-year-old Sonicare. I was truly sad when the poor ol&#x27; guy bit the dust. After a week without an electric toothbrush I realized I needed to get another and researched Sonicare vs. OralB/Braun. I was impressed with the reviews and went ahead about bought the 3000 series since I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles with the 4000 &amp; 5000 series. It also helped that there was promotion with a 50% rebate of the purchase price. I also picked up some extra precision clean replacement brushes from a wonderful Amazon seller with killer prices.    A few days after I ordered I went for my six month dental visit which included the requisite polishing. Three days later my new OralB Professional Series 3000 arrived. From first use I was hooked. It does an incredible job. I&#x27;m almost two weeks out from that cleaning and my teeth feel as good as they did from that day. I believe this brush does a much better job than my old Sonicare. My teeth feel cleaner. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that big of a difference.    The only thing I don&#x27;t like (not enough to rate it lower) is that it doesn&#x27;t shutoff automatically. Seems to me after the two minute brushing cycle it should automatically itself off but it doesn&#x27;t. Turning it off manually is no big deal but auto-shutoff would be nice feature.</li>
            <li> I guess it is true that once you get an electric toothbrush, it is impossible to go back. The round brush gets into every space in my mouth. The vibration every 30 seconds makes it easy to know that you are doing a good job. My dentist is going to be so pleased!</li>
            <li> Great brush &amp; a great price.</li>
            <li> We have received the two units ordered ID 002-0914831-8195467,2 Professional Care OralB 3000 Toothbrush units, An Australian order, this has caused disappointment as both charge units are for 110v power supply, Australian power is 240v therefore the supplied charge units are not usable. As this order was clearly for an Australian address the units supplied should have been supplied with 240v charge units therefore the units shipped are virtually unusable. This was not noticable until the packaging is damaged to obtain the units as the packaging does not specify the voltage requirements of the charge unit. Cannot find any reference to voltage requirements on the information supplied for the unit on the Amazon web site. Not that the Braun site is any better as it cannot be accessed with its available links. As Amazon are a world wide organization I assumed if an order for an electrical unit for Australia it would have been supplied for the specific voltage requirements for that country.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive teeth. I had an original Oral-B that died after a long time and then I purchased a different toothbrush that was TOO HARD. I have sensitive teeth and it felt like it would scrub my enamel OFF. But this Oral B has a sensitive teeth setting and is really great for my teeth. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist, works great.</li>
            <li> This brush noticeably whitened bmy teeth within a week of using it. I even got multiple comments with people even asking if I had whitened my teeth. But now the brush head has worn out completely and I am unable to find the correct brush head replacement. Does anyone know where to find the replacement heads for this exact model?</li>
            <li> It is for my workmates,and he say it is good</li>
            <li> Very good product. Easy to use and does a good job.</li>
            <li> cleans hard to reach places</li>
            <li> Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s nice and light, holds a long charge and has the power I was looking for;  the price was also great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric brush before.  The three controls (fast, less fast, and slow) are a help, and I never use the fast speed, even though the manufacturer claims that&#x27;s &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are cleaner, yes, but I&#x27;m never sure about whether I&#x27;m doing a good job on the gums with this brush, and I&#x27;d appreciate a gentler experience.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this newer model of the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the different speeds and the quality of cleaning the teeth is&lt;br /&gt;superior to anythings I can do manually.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding electric toothbrush. I have had it over 6 months and no problems. Easy to use and lasts about a week before needing a recharge. Heads are a cinch to change and last about 6 months before showing signs of needing replacement. I like it much better than my previous brush Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, well liked, very powerful.</li>
            <li> I have used some of the cheaper powered brushes and thought they had done an pretty good job at cleaning my teeth and reducing plaque build up. That is until I used this brush, after just one use my teeth felt as clean and smooth as I just had a cleaning. I am still using the basic tip that came with the brush so I can only imagine what the results would be after using a more aggressive tip. Well worth the money and I would highly recommend the investment.</li>
            <li> We have used Oral-b toothbrushes for the last 10 years and have loved them.  This is the 2nd Oral-b 3000 professional that I have returned.  There is a motor problem with this unit, which tells me it will not last like the others have.  I&#x27;m going to try another model.</li>
            <li> I replaced the Oral-B toothbrush that I purchased close to 10 years ago with the Oral-B 3000.  I have been pleased with the results as the technology has improved compared to my older model but considering how long the first one last, I was not concerned about making the investment.  I like the sensor that is on the handle that let&#x27;s you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an electric toothbrush as my dentist recommed that I do. Sorry I did not purchase sooner. It definitely cleans between the teeth and I did see my plaque being removed. It does a great job, easy to use and I love the way it lets you know to move onto the next section in your mouth for brushing. I recommed this toothbrush highly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It is well built and reliable. Should have gotten it a long time ago.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I had a 10 year old Sonicare Phillips e3000 which I liked.  (Note I went some 9 years not using it so I don&#x27;t want you to believe it&#x27;s lasted that long with heavy use!)&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would buy an Oral-B since it appeared to be different.  I use the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; mode.  It&#x27;s still a little rough on my teeth and it&#x27;s louder but I find it&#x27;s nice to use both.  It certainly can give your gums a good massage.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is round which I don&#x27;t care for compared with the standard shape of the Sonicare.  But it is better than the Sonicare for cleaning the back sides of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Can someone answer this question: after a year or so the batteries will wear out.  Are they replaceable, or must you buy another brush?  If you can replace them, how do you do it?  I find the picture illustrations in the User Guide hard to understand!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected the red light that is supposed to come on when you brush to hard was broken when I opened the box</li>
            <li> this is the second oral-b for myself. love it. can not live without it.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, spins faster than my old Oral B.  Comes with a basic brush head, the pressure sensor is nice to have but not helpful after the first few times since you learn more what is too hard.  Base is good, you can keep just the charger without case if you want to save room on your counter top.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace my 16-year old electric Oral-B brush (holly smokes - yes! - I had an electrical appliance that worked for !!!16!!! years with daily use!). this is an amazing brush!!! it&#x27;s gentle, yet gets the job done. looove it! should have gotten it 6 years ago!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this over the Rotadent. I found the pressure to be much harder in comparison,but luckily there are several settings.  It holds a charge for a good long time (over a week off the charger) which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Using the Braun Oral B electric toothbrush makes me feel as if I am taking A+ care of my teeth and gums.  My gums adjusted after a few days to the additional stimulation.  My teeth look whiter, and my gums feel healthier.  I do think that more than one brush should be included for this price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Delivers all of the features and performance it advertises.</li>
            <li> overall I am pleased with this product.  I do have trouble with the button switch.  It is hard to push.</li>
            <li> a gift to friend,good!</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush works well. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the 30 second timer that vibrates indicating to the user it is time to move to the next quadrant of the mouth. That may be good for children but I, as an adult, don&#x27;t like it. The manufacturer provides no way to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Like its features:  Multiple-speeds especially.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old Oral B plaque remover with his one, and I have not ben disappointed.  I love the 3 speeds, the adjustments every 30 seconds and the simplicity of the charger. Plus, it stays much cleaner than my old unit for some reason.  Also, the price was right, and Amazon threw in a free pack of replacement brushes. All in all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is a quality-built product, and a very compact footprint.  I expect to get many years of use out of it, as I bought it to replace my previous Oral-B which I had used for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B Vitality passed away, and after asking my hygienist for a recommendation for a replacement, she insisted that I avoid the Vitality and upgrade to any of the Oral-B professional series models.  I bought 3000 series and instantly noted that it was of much better quality than the Vitality.  The brush is super strong, and a red LED will indicate if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. Another bonus is that Oral-B redesigned the charging base, making it much easier to clean than previous generations.  My only real complaint is that the brush will indicate when 30 seconds has passed by stopping, then restarting suddenly. That feature (meant to alert you when it&#x27;s time to brush a different quadrant of your mouth) is somewhat irritating as it feels like the batteries have run out momentarily. I would prefer a chime or LED indicator.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a decent choice of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This model replaced a cheaper model and it was worth the additional expense.  The cheaper model did not last long and the power was not sufficient to do a correct job.</li>
            <li> The brush is slightly expensive than the conventional tooth brush or other electric tooth brushes. I feel there is a lot of research that&#x27;s been done to get real quality brushing each time we use this brush.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for my old Oral-B (which lasted about 6 years!)</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush. After 6 months is holding its charge well. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Dentist clean after my first brush.  I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.  Only gripe is having to toggle through the power button (push 3x) to turn it off, even after a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This an easy to operate Oral-B brush.  It does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth the different speeds &amp; controls.</li>
            <li> The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date. The packaging was good, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Item shipped as ordered, arrived in good condition and product works as manufacturer suggests.  This is a great electric toothbrush does a great cleaning and stimulates gums. Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> We had an Oral B for 10 years. Replaced it with this unit. So far so good. One still needs to use floss and use mouth wash.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works as advertised. My only complaint is that after it has run for 2 minutes it does not shut off automatically. Instead you have to push the start/stop button a few times to get the unit to turn off.</li>
            <li> I had lots of replacement head brushes from my old Braun Oral B.  Was tempted by other ultrasonic models, but went for this $80+ machine and I love it.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again in a heartbeat. Had I more faith in electric brushes, I would have bought this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and worth every penny</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying it because I wanted a better way to clean my teeth. This certainly delivered. Well worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;4 slots for 4 different heads, 3 different cleaning cycles, easily clean, very strong, nice timer feature.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years. I&#x27;m very satisfied, and my teeth feel super clean now.</li>
            <li> I have had other electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied with them because of their being to rough and believe it or not to much of an \\&quot;echo\\&quot; in my head when using.  The first time I used this toothbrush I could feel the difference with the nice smooth feeling that you have when you leave the dentist.  This did not bother my gums at all and it has three settings that you can choose from to satisfy your needs and the noise is almost nil. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I switched to normal brushing about a year ago when my last oral-b gave up the ghost after several years of hard work.  I was finding it much harder to stay on top of staining from coffee, and judging by my scheduled cleanings, plaque too...  So, now I&#x27;m back to Oral-B.  I&#x27;ve been using a floss-action tip with great results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;the timer is nice if you want to be sure you&#x27;re brushing the recommended amount.&lt;br /&gt;The light that goes on when you apply too much pressure is obvious, and a good way to be sure you get that right as well.&lt;br /&gt;The little stand provides a way to let four brushes air-dry while also being protected from dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;the three speed settings don&#x27;t do anything for me personally&lt;br /&gt;my previous oral-b came with a travel case for the handle and two tips. I wish this one did too (although I was able to find the old case, and with a few modifications, this handle fits fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too much to say here - include a carrying case, and this would be perfect, but as-is its a great buy regardless.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun electric toothbrush for over 10 years before it started to act funny on me. This one I believe is the same model (now owned by Oral B?) but advanced. It&#x27;s got a 30-second interval timer so you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth (love it, except for when 30 seconds feels like a long time), and it&#x27;s got a red light for when you&#x27;re pressing too hard (which can damage your gums). I never knew I was occasionally pressing too hard with my electric toothbrush! Anyway, I&#x27;ve been a fan of these types of electric toothbrushes for a long time, and I love this one as well. Nice small charger. Removeable (replaceable?) battery come recycling time (they have to be recycled separate from the casing). Nice solid, quality feel (time will tell...my last one lasted over a decade). Definitely worth it to me since I believe that these small-head electric toothbrushes are the reason why my dental exams go more smoothly than if I was using a plain old toothbrush. My last trip to the visit resulted in the discovery of two cavities, but since I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in over three years and am less than good about flossing, I&#x27;ll take the two cavities (and the time before I&#x27;d gone another three years before visits but no cavities. In fact, the hygienist said, &amp;#34;Whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep it up&amp;#34;. However, my luck I think has run out and I need to start taking better care of my teeth, because I&#x27;m getting older. And indeed I&#x27;m better about flossing now and plan to go to the dentist every six months because even though it was just two cavities, I hate dentists and fillings and don&#x27;t want to go through that again). So, yeah. Very good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, so fast! I have tried this brand new Oral B toothbrush, and LOVE it!! I will definitely choose here next time. I think it is worth more than 5 stars! Highly recommend! Nice job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Power Toothbrush! It stays charged for the longest time, and I enjoy storing my toothbrush head in the covered container! The best cleaning ever!</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace the Oral-B I had for 14 years before the battery quit.  Only negative thing I find is the on/off button.  Not as easy to operate as my old one.  Don&#x27;t like having to hold it down to stop the brush from moving.  Will be thrilled if this brush last even ½ as long as my last one.</li>
            <li> Works great. Got a great deal from Amazon with a $20 discount</li>
            <li> Only received one tooth brush, would have been nice to have received two.</li>
            <li> A great electric toothbrush.  Keeps teeth clean and helps to keep plaque at bay.  It has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> I should have been using a power tooth brush long time ago.  MY dentist appointments are much better because my brushing is better.</li>
            <li> After having less-than-fun gum surgery due to recession, my periodontist and dentist finally convinced me to purchase an electric toothbrush. In their words &amp;#34;Sonicare and Oral-B perform the same depending on what you are looking for&amp;#34;. It was very important to me to have a pressure sensor and sensitive mode on my toothbrush for post-surgical care. This mid-range electric brush had both of those, which I found to be rare for toothbrushes in this price range. I was unable to find a Sonicare that contained a pressure sensor without spending more than $150 at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush makes my teeth feel dentist fresh every single day, and has a pretty good charge as well. The heads last about 4 months and are easily replaced. I think they dry best if you run your finger along the brush after rinsing to remove excess water before placing back into their handy charging/holding station. The switchable heads makes sharing the base brush very easy, and the case holds up to 4 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After checking in with my periodontist, she was delighted at the improvement to my gums and I can see a noticeable difference as well. My gums look and feel healthy. My teeth are clean and look whiter than ever!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend above the &amp;#34;cheap replaceable battery&amp;#34; version toothbrushes I&#x27;ve been using, but this was totally worth the investment (and in my opinion is the sweet spot between the lower speed models and the higher end models with software features I don&#x27;t need).  This makes a noticeable difference, and with extra brush heads my 12 year old is using it also.  Great device, great engineering.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have never been happier with a toothbrush in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked my Oral-B Pulsonic but Braun discontinued the model and brush heads became scarce and prohibitively expensive so I decided to upgrade and, boy, am I ever glad I did! After a month of using this toothbrush I had my annual dental check-up and the hygienist who cleaned my teeth was unable to find any plaque or tartar at or below my gum line! The dentist commented that my gums looked particularly pink and healthy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use this brush my mouth feels as if it&#x27;s had a professional polishing.</li>
            <li> Really great toothbrush.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a good electric toothbrush.  I sometimes think it would be better if the brushes were larger; but, that would probably result in not being able to clean tough places as well.</li>
            <li> The brush leaves my teeth feeling nice and fresh, but the storage unit for the brush heads is difficult to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Arrived before the date I was expecting it.  Had to charge it for 24 hours, which would be my only complaint, because I was looking forward to using it - my old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush no longer works (but old one did work for 4-5 years).  Happy with the new one.</li>
            <li> Circular (rather than that up and down one I used to own) seems far superior.</li>
            <li> very good！I want to buy  one more for  my  mom,because  mom  day  is  coming  ,I  hope  she  will  love  it.</li>
            <li> I really liked my original Oral-B electric toothbrush so purchased this new model. Very surprised that it works even better. I like the rotating brush head better than the side to side motion of the original.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because he was told that he has a gum problem and the dentist recommended it. They have same brand at their office but I purchase it much cheaper at Amazon. It is helping a lot and he does not have any dental problem now.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush when I found it on sale at Amazon.  I had been researching this particular oral-b model.  At my last dental appointment, my dental hygenist complemented me on how clean my teeth were on this visit.  (Hardly any plaque!)  This in one toothbrush I highly recommend anyone to buy.  By the way, my triplet grandchildren love to use it when they come over.  (I have separate brush heads for each of them to use.)</li>
            <li> My last one failed after 10 years : not complaining !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is bit flasher than last one (I guess after 10 years it would be..) but new one works with old charger too, good on them for not changing the charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I get another 10 years!</li>
            <li> I replaced a battery in my older Braun but it would not hold a charge. This 3000 works as good as my older Braun that I did not want to part with. The brushing too hard feature is pretty much useless but am glad I got this one instead of the higher priced models, this works great. Just hope this battery last 5 yrs. Would be nice if they were user replaceable though..</li>
            <li> Does not have a universal power supply. Do not understand why Oral-B decided to remove a feature that is so vital to anyone who travels internationally. Would be nice if the product description specified power supply information.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say except that it does the job well. I feel really clean after brushing. Not sure about the whitening function, though. After about a month of using this, I can&#x27;t really tell that my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered two toothbrushes. I received both on time. One worked as intended. The other toothbrush would not charge and did not function at all, probably because it had not been charged yet. I checked the charging stations and they were fine. It was the toothbrush itself which did not work. No problem, things happen. I returned the toothbrush and ordered a replacement. The replacement arrived today. Same thing. Charging station works but the toothbrush will not charge. I checked the charging station with the functioning Oral B I have and it is fine. The toothbrush itself is the issue. If I would have picked up a $12 spin brush then I would have saved $57, had the product immediately, not had to worry with charging stations, and would not be sitting here feeling ripped off. I am sending the 2nd broken toothbrush back, waiting another 6 days for the shipping process, and anticipating another faulty product arriving. This is extremely disappointing and frustrating, to say the least. I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering any electronics online again and see no benefit in my Amazon credit account due to that fact. This bill will be paid off then the credit line will be closed. Not jaded - just a consumer who has learned better. I would rather pay full price while supporting a local store for this product so I can return or replace on the same day. That luxury alone is worth the additional $10-$20 I allegedly saved by buying here. ***Update*** Received another replacement... this one works. BUT-I received 2 new toothbrushes to replace the 1 I sent back. I am going through the process of printing yet another label and making yet another trip, at my own expense, to drop off the toothbrush sent to me in error. I got some message from Scamazon saying they are sorry for the inconvenience, yadda yadda yadda, they take every precaution to ensure the products are not damaged in shipping. My reply to that is - the packages arrived in superb condition. The product is what was broken. The package was fine.... well until now. Now I have 2 products and am returning 1 as I KNOW I would be charged for the extra toothbrush if I don&#x27;t address their error in a timely fashion. Logging on to pay my balance in full and cancel my credit account. At first I was concerned with the group of vendors Scamazon associated with due to faulty products... now I have lost faith in their shipping. I&#x27;m done with Scamazon. It&#x27;s been real.package was fine.... well until now. Now I have 2 products and am returning 1 as I KNOW I would be charged for the extra toothbrush if I don&#x27;t address their error in a timely fashion.

            <li> Works very  well, good power and holds charge. Easy to manuver. just a little awkward to turn off after use.</li>
            <li> Works great. The pressure sensor feature is helpful. All in all, great in quality and price.</li>
            <li> My dentist certainly is complementary of my teeth after moving to this style of toothbrush. My last one lasted 10 years before it died. That&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love Braun Oral B toothbrushes!  Having used other electric brands, this is by far superior to anything else used.  I HATE dentists!  1 bad experience has left me scarred so I don&#x27;t go to the dentist as often as I should because it is traumatic.  This toothbrush reaches those hard to reach areas that a manual toothbrush can&#x27;t get to easily.  Within a few weeks of using I noticed my teeth exceptionally whiter.  This is also a great brush for kids.  My 11 year old brushes too hard and not long enough so with the pressure light that comes on if you push too hard and the 30 second notice, she knows the right pressure and how long to brush.  Within a week I noticed a huge improvement in the health of her teeth.  So important for a pre-teen that is too old to want help brushing but isn&#x27;t great at it. The replacement heads for oral b are significantly cheaper than other electric toothbrush brands.  There are a lot of generic heads sold on Amazon that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  The quality of generic just isn&#x27;t comparable enough to that of the oral b.  Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> Spend this small amount of money to save yourself at the Dentist. An affordable way to care for your teeth. Oral B makes a good, quiet product. I&#x27;ve had an oral B for more than 15 years and am just now replacing it. actually retiring it to the camper!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for 10 years. Been through 3 handles and who knows how many heads. This Precision 3000 is quite a change. Seems to clean faster and feel cleaner when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Quiet&lt;br /&gt;2) Cleans Great&lt;br /&gt;3) Pressure Sensor&lt;br /&gt;4) Heads last longer than sonicare (to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery charge does not last a week (not a big deal)&lt;br /&gt;2) Moving parts (I keep thinking the heads will fall apart)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Glad I changed over to this Oral-B 3000. It is just high tech enough and designed well enough to edge out my sonicares of the past. Their quality is going down the tubes. Not a review about them. Hope to get many years out of this new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second toothbrush in this line of toothbrushes.  No complaints with the first one which I&#x27;d had for a long time but this is even better. I use the 2 minute monitor signals with 4 signals (one for each quadrant) within the 2 minutes.  I think it is quieter than the older model I had.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel really clean. I like the warning when brushing too hard. it has four timers to remind you to move the brush around the mouth and brush equally on all sides of the mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the Oral B that my Dentist and Periodontist recommended.  They liked the 5000 - but said the 3000 is the same except the fancy timer. I have a 30 minute routine and use my iphone as a timer anyway - so I was good with the 3000. It comes with two heads - with different color bands - and a nice holder for them that is covered. If your partner uses the other - they are really easy to switch out - and it cleans easily. I like the rotating head as apposed to the vibrating head of the panasonic I had.- they have 2 speeds - you press the button twice and it slows down - it has a red light that lights up if you press too hard- If you have periodontal issues - this is a must have.</li>
            <li> Loves:  teeth feel clean, does not hurt my gums or wear them down, multi speeds, can easily go for more than 2 min, with eyes closed can tell when pushing too hard (can see red light go off through eyelids) and easy to tell when you hit 30 second sections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hates: Can&#x27;t keep the toothpaste in my mouth.  The brush head has holes in it so with my mouth fully closed, the dang toothpaste dribbles out.  I use to be a no mess tooth brusher - no more.  Does not come with travel case.  I bought a tooth brush head protector online via the oral b web site as I couldn&#x27;t see it sold anywhere else.  It was cheap and worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second electric tooth brush I have used in the last 3 years.  Prior one was Phillips Sonic Care Healthy White.  I stopped using that as it kept breaking one way or another and it wore away my gum line so I had to get 2 gum grafts (no fun!).  I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and selected the 3000 due to the size of the base.  The 4000 and 5000 are the same size but way too far in my opinion.  The 1000 and 3000 are the same size base but the 3000 had the perks I wanted (higher oscillations, pressure light when pressing too hard and sensitive mode).&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and wish I bought sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this nearly 2 years ago and still works great.  Holds its charge, easy to clean, nice settings and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a mail in rebate when we bought it was was half back from the amazon price ... about $35 back as I recall!! There was no mention of that on the amazon listing but made for a nice surprise!!</li>
            <li> My teeth are sparkling white. Sometimes, I blind people with my pearly whites. And sometimes, I wake my husband from his sleep when I brush, because this thing is so loud...it literally knocks the nasty out of my mouth!</li>
            <li> We have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for years.  We currently own 3 Oral B electric toothbrushes (including the 3000 model).  The 30-second timers really helps the kids to better understand the length of time required to get a complete and effective brushing.</li>
            <li> This model does not fit my needs as well. The second setting for slower rotating is still very fast and hard on the gum area. I liked the old model that told you how long you had been brushing, this model gives little zzz&#x27;s after brushing for 30 seconds. Overall Oral-B is a good product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feel that I get when I use the Oral-B Professional Clean 3000 toothbrush! I thought I was getting my teeth clean when I used my old toothbrush, but nothing compares to the clean feeling I get from this toothbrush. It is wonderful. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really great. Everything came like it should and there was no problems with it breaking or anything like that. The  only drawback was that it takes a very long time to full charge, and it even took a while to have enough charge to use it. Because of that I wasn&#x27;t able to use it until the next day. Other than that it was a great buy</li>
            <li> My first time with an electric toothbrush. It was recommended by my hygienist, because of the constant plaque buildup when I go for cleaning. This electric toothbrush sold me on its use from day 1. After the waterpick, I use the electric brush and then my teeth feel squeekie clean. I leave my charger plugged in all the time. No problem according to the manufacturer. Directions are easy to follow and within two minutes you are done brushing your teeth. Can&#x27;t wait to see the hygienist.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B Pro quit working, but when I went to re-order the exact model, of course it had been phased out.  The Pro 3000, is comparable to what I had before.  I like the 30 second intervals and the two minute timer, which was also on my old one.  I could do without the red light flashing in my eyes, if I press too hard, but it&#x27;s a good idea, I didn&#x27;t realize that in some areas, I was brushing too hard before.  I like Oral-B products and my dentist recommends them.</li>
            <li> Very good Oral-B toothbrush. It is reasonably priced also. suitable for anyone. I recommend it to those who want to buy electric brush.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over the old Oral B tooth brush I have had say for maybe 50 years?  Just kidding, but the motor on this one has more RPMs and that makes my teeth feel better.  Also, I was surprised to find I had been using too much pressure.  I brush my teeth with my eyes closed (why I don&#x27;t know, but I do) and a little light flashes on the toothbrush when you apply too much pressure.  Woke me up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that only ONE tooth brush head is supplied.  I think for the cost of this toothbrush, that is a bit cheap - otherwise I would have giving it 5 *****.</li>
            <li> Excellent in both quality of product and delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my Oral-B Triumph that I&#x27;ve had since around 2008 (battery started going). This thing is garbage compared to that. No battery level indicator (just a red flash when its low). No ability to turn it off with one press..it cycles through 3 other settings until &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; is reached. I now use it as my travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the quality and function is superb. My only disappointing factor is having only 1 brush.</li>
            <li> I had been using the [[ASIN:B000V4O1UA Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush]] for a couple years now, and it was easily the best brush I had ever used. Sadly, Ultreo went under and replacement brush heads are now in dwindling supplies from third-party vendors, at ridiculous costs. Perfect time to switch to a new brush. Enter the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care Electric Toothbrush. I had used an Oral-b electric brush before, but it&#x27;s been about 5 years and the one I had used was a relatively cheap brush. This one is definitely top of the line (and better be, given how much it costs).&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 Professional Care is a sleek brush with a decent charging base, which is a little smaller than the Ultreo. After a couple weeks of regular use, I have to say it doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling -quite- as clean as the Ultreo did, but it&#x27;s very close and definitely adequate. I haven&#x27;t noticed any decline in my oral hygiene since the switchover, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening. The one big advantage this brush has over the Ultreo is the pressure indicator. I have sensitive teeth, and apparently I have been brushing a little too hard for a while with other brushes. Using this, I have experienced less mouth pain after brushing, even less than the Ultreo which I thought provided a relatively painless cleaning. Great feature! Given that this brush costs slightly less than the Ultreo did, and Oral-b is a name that&#x27;s not going to \\&quot;go under\\&quot; any time soon, I am satisfied with the switch.&lt;br /&gt;Of course there are quality brushes out there that cost less than the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care. My wife uses the [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] and says it&#x27;s the best brush she&#x27;s ever used. But if you&#x27;re looking to spend a little more, I can definitely recommend the Oral-b 3000 Professional Care as a quality purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used a SonicCare toothbrush but really hated that ultrasonic vibration that you can feel right down to your bones.  I am happy to say this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t do that.  Out of the 3 modes (dailyclean, sensitive, whitening), I suspect most would use it for daily clean.  This toothbrush is far superior to regular brushing.  Your teeth feel so clean afterwards.  I recommend using this product fully and then trying the FlossAction head.  The flossaction just seems to massage my gums and clean a notch better!  Also, each head has bristles with indicators but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell when to replace the heads.  Just replace them every 6-8 weeks.  Also, the unit cleans so much better with the battery full rather than low.  I know some keep it in the charger when not in use, but I prefer to charge it once weekly.</li>
            <li> New one stutters like the old one.  Equate brush heads that are supposed to fit Oral-B&#x27;s don&#x27;t.  Red battery light never comes on.</li>
            <li> First things first.  Read the manual.  Or at least this review.  Otherwise you will think you are crazy.    The obvious comparison here is the Sonicare which I am quite versed in.  I owned a Sonicare for years until its inevitable demise two months ago.  I went to purchase the same/similar model here on Amazon: [[ASIN:B000AMRIIK Philips Sonicare Essence HX5752 Power Toothbrush]] . Upon receiving the new model not much had changed, or at least nothing I noticed on first glance.  Upon using it, it lacks the power of one I previously owned, is LOUD and rattles, does not brush as well and still suffers from the gross out factor of the Sonicare E series (seriously how hard is it to change the model so it doesn&#x27;t get all your saliva/toothpaste/tartar stuck inside?).  Unfortunately, the quality or quality control of the Sonicare had dropped significantly.    Then came this little beauty, the Oral-b 3000.  First, it does not suffer from the gross out cup that the Sonicare E series does.  Score one!  The toothbrush head is easier to put on than the twist on/twist off Sonicare.  Score two! It includes the mandatory (to me) 30 second \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; that reminds you to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth. Tie!  It is much quieter than the newer Sonicare brush I own.  Score three!  Is lighter than the Sonicare.  Score four! And most importantly, it gets my teeth a bit slicker (cleaner) than the new Sonicare.  We have a winner!    However, in my cockiness (or the fact that I felt that I had enough experience with a simple electric toothbrush that I didn&#x27;t need to read a manual) the Oral-b made me go nuts.  The first time I brushed I probably went for a good four minutes before I realized this thing doesn&#x27;t shut itself off after two minutes like the Sonicare.  Instead it does a long \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; to let you know two minutes is up.  While extremely confused at first, I found I was happier.  I started a new routine.  After the two minutes is up I now spend a little extra time on my \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot;  You know, where the hygienist is always scraping away.  So, after I learned to shut it off, I kept thinking the stupid button was broken.  I would hit the power button and the toothbrush kept going.  Hit it again... still going.  Third time was a charm.  A little glimpse at the (short) manual and I could have saved myself from going nuts for a good couple weeks.  All you need to do is hold down the power button for more than a second and it shuts down.  A quick tap of the power button and the toothbrush just switches modes (sensitive and whitening are the other modes).    I&#x27;ll blame my ignorance on the fact that I am not a morning person, and therefore will not read a manual in the morning, and usually brush my teeth before I climb in bed too late and blurry-eyed.  Neither of which are the fault of Oral-b.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for approximately 3 weeks and love it.  My teeth feel so much cleaner.  I like the features such as the timer that lets you know when 30 seconds has passed and when the 2 minutes is complete.  I also like the light indicator that shows when you are brushing too hard and when it is time to recharge.  It is simple to use and simple to set up.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years.  The only negative is the on/off button is difficult to use without taking the toothbrush out of your mouth. It causes splatter from the head rotation.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that I can say I really love. It makes brushing my teeth almost fun. The motor is powerful &amp; the brush gives your gums a great massage in addition to digging out any food particles that might remain between your teeth. This is the first toothbrush I have found that really makes a difference in keeping my teeth white between teeth cleanings at the dentist (I love my coffee!). Get it.</li>
            <li> It cleans and whitens teeth and gums beautifully. The only complaint is that the motor is to loud.</li>
            <li> Works well. Just what my dentist recommended and the product leaves my teeth feeling super clean; cleaner than regular brushing. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Like the 3 settings. Only downside is it&#x27;s a bit loud. Makes this rattling noise if liquid gets in the neck of the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> We are familiar with Oral B, everyone uses in our home, it was a purchase and replacement for an old with batteries used Oral B for my niece. We&#x27;re a bit tired to always buy batteries.</li>
            <li> I really like this product does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li> The first speed is almost too fast. It often feels as if the bristles are bouncing around off my teeth and gums instead of cleaning them. I find myself using the slowest setting (for sensitive) so it gets deeper between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Oral B Electric Toothbrush.  I have tried other brands but I like the Oral B the best.  The circular motion really cleans the teeth well.  After brushing, my teeth feels smooth and clean.  It helps to keep the plaque away.  It feels very similar to when the dentist cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great awesome good quality well made we really enjoy it excellent purchase looks super we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my 10 year old Oral-B brush. Wow! I should have replaced it years ago.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B Pro 3000 does everything I need it to do. My only wish is that it would charge a little faster. We had the Triumph 9000 model before this and it would charge in less than 12 hours even when the battery was at end of life. This one takes about 24 hours to get the full charge indicator. Depending on how many times the two of us use the unit during charging, it could take a little longer. No real complaints, just wish it would charge up a little faster. Definitely worth the money and the price was right. We had the Triumph for about six years and our dentist always gave our teeth rave reviews compared to when we just had manual, non-powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a Sonic Essence toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t like it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not very sanitary.  Dirty water / spit accumulate inside the brush (this doesn&#x27;t happen with the Oral-B)&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is thick and heavy.  The Oral-B handle has a slim profile which is much more comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Poor customer service.  I complained to Phillips Sonic people and got no satisfaction.  I called Oral-B with questions and they were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as brushing, I find that the Oral-B removes small particles of food between my teeth better than the Sonic.  The brush also has 3 brush settings (daily clean, sensitive and whitening).  The Oral-B also comes with a holder for additional brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the device. It stays charged, multiple speeds. Effectively cleans wherever applied, front &amp; back of teeth, between teeth, gum line, even the gums and tongue, without irritation. I had an earlier generation of a less expensive version of this brush for many years, one with a single speed, not rechargeable, needed battery replacements periodically (very hard to load). This is a great improvement over my earlier brush, well worth the additional cost. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great brush great quality great price! Love the indicator light and overall love the brush more than I expected, awesome! .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a number of years since I used anything other than a regular toothbrush.    This one really makes a difference in how clean my teeth feel.     There are some gimmicky things that I&#x27;m not the least bit interested in, such as the sensor that determines if you&#x27;re brushing &#x27;too hard,&#x27; but overall this is an excellent product.     I do wish it had come with at least one additional brush head. Still, I went ahead and ordered a package of four to have the replacements on hand. Make sure you shop around because there are huge price differences among different sellers.    I plan to continue using this product, though it will not replace my toothbrush. I plan to use both at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrush for over 10 years. At a first glance, not much has changed. Other than orange pressure and improved battery/charging indicators, it feels and looks largely the same as predecessors.    This new 3000 series packaging replaces older [[ASIN:B0002KHT8Y Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush -]] with improved charging base design, which lies flat, easier to clean, and sturdier to boot. This newly designed base may slow down yucky mildew developing on the bottom of the base, but I suspect mildews will still develop around the brush mount.    My wife has [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]], which oddly enough, costs about the same.    My findings after using it for 2 weeks:    - The battery needed charging after 10 days. Pretty impressive. Unfortunately, it seems to take forever to charge. Green charging indicator light is still blinking after overnight charging. I solely miss 5000&#x27;s battery life indicator.  - Oral-B claims it will naturally whitens teeth in 3 weeks. I drink coffee daily and I have a week to go, and my teeth aren&#x27;t any whiter.  - My teeth feels great and clean though.  - Compared to my 3-year old Oral-B, there&#x27;s significantly more vibration and strength (the company claims 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillation per minute).  - Brushing mode is triggered by a single button. I prefer more distinct toggle switch with 4 positions (off, daily clean, sensitive, and polish).  - 5000 has a \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; mode that is rated to remove up to 99.7% of the plaque (compared to 3000&#x27;s \\&quot;daily clean\\&quot; mode that can remove up to 97%).  - Orange pressure indicator does light up if I put too much pressure against my teeth. But the indicator isn&#x27;t always obvious. I would prefer audio feedback or 5000&#x27;s separate wireless indicator unit.  - The build quality seems have degraded over the years. My last Oral-B died after 9 months, needing a battery replacement. Ever since then, it just felt clunkier. This new model remains to be seen, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any sturdier. Thankfully, included is 2-year warranty.  - 3000 is designed for kids and adults 4 years or older. Just for some kicks, I have tried it briefly on my 21 week son. It&#x27;s too big and he didn&#x27;t like it at all.    Included in the package is just 1 precision clean brush, which is fairly effective at brushing hard to reach places. Oral-B sells several other brushes, such as pro white (for better polish) and floss action. The base can hold 4 brushes.    In the end, 3000 is a great brush, as great as its predecessors were. But it is expensive, about the same as 5000 that has additional brush cleaning mode and better indicators (with wireless unit to boot).</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves a clean feeling. A little bit early to judge their reliability (battery, etc). My last toothbrush (sonic care) quit abruptly after a year or two.</li>
            <li> It is durable and powerful.  I am still using it since the purchase,</li>
            <li> Got this on sale and with a rebate. This blows any normal brush out of the water. My dentist noticed the difference on the next visit. It will flash red if you push to hard and has a built in timer. It has different options for power and speed as well.</li>
            <li> Product works as indicated. I was disappointed in how weak the battery became after a year. I followed the instructions, indicating for the handset to not stay on the base continually but at this point the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge past a single brushing.</li>
            <li> After trying this, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean anymore with a non-electric toothbrushes. And it is true that the battery lasts 10 days, not the usual overdeclared figure given by manufacturers of everything that has a battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t compare to competing products (Sonicare or other Oral-B models) as I have not tried them.</li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for about a decade now and will never go back to a manual toothbrush. It&#x27;s done wonders for my gums and leaves me feeling like I just left the dentist after every brushing. I bought the Oral B Pro 3000 after my Oral B Triumph died after 10 years of use. The 3000 doesn&#x27;t have the screen or different settings my Triumph had, but I never used them anyways. What was important to me was that it was an Oral B and it pulsed at 30 seconds to let me know when to move on to the next quadrant. I prefer the Oral B over the Sonicare because of the Braun motor (which lasted 10 years in my Triumph) and the lower cost in the replacement brush heads (it adds up over the years). I contemplated getting the 5000, which has additional settings and Bluetooth, but realized that I really didn&#x27;t need those things. The 3000 is slimmer and lighter than my original Triumph. It comes with a little case to store the brush heads which is nice, especially when you have more than one person using it. The only downside is that it does not come with a travel case as my Triumph had. When I purchased my 3000, there was a $20 instant coupon which made me jump at the offer. All in all, for what my needs are and the price of the toothbrush, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Replaced my 4-year old Oral-B with this newer unit.  I love it.  It is lighter weight and slimmer than my older unit.  While it doesn&#x27;t have the digital display, who cares, the digital display was &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This unit packs the power, so if you have sensitive teeth, beware.  It has three settings, High, Low, and pulse.  I primarily use the high settings, although the low setting might be better for children and people with sensitive teeth.  I personally don&#x27;t see the benefit of the pulse setting.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I loved my older Oral-B and I love this one even more.</li>
            <li> Good for removing plaque and gross stuff. Works well. Came on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, refills are a lil xpensive, but closest thing to a dentist office clean out there.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing toothbrush with ultra long battery life!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Have used Sonicare for many, many years and was very pleased.  Decided to try the Oral-B and found it better.  Seems to get teeth cleaner and much easier to reach into the hard to brush areas. Had a few problems withe recharging - first charge took forever, not hours but couple of days.  Follow on re-charging seemed very slow.  So I let the brush run down to low batter and then re-charged.  The sytem seems to have settled down now.  Still like the Sonicare - but gave the two old hand units with several heads to grandkids.  Win all around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun oral B for about 25 years. I&#x27;ve liked them all but this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> great product! have been using it for a month now, clean very teeth very well. but charging takes forever and the battery dies a little bit faster than I expected. That&#x27;s the only downside I would say.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought the product would come with a travel case for it, but it didn&#x27;t. maybe I was wrong, but it would be nice to have a travel case along with it.</li>
            <li> Seems like we are always charging it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help remove plaque buildup that I was missing by manual brushing. I purchased this on Amazon 2 months ago for about $30.00 less than what my local retailer was selling it for. Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. This works great! It took a little getting used to as I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush since I was a child. I like the feature where the brush will hesitate if you are pressing too hard. I&#x27;m a bit strong armed so I know I was doing that alot with my manual toothbrush. The 3 different cleaning modes are a plus too. I usually use the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; mode though. The setup is really easy. The charging base can be used stand alone or you can keep the extra brush storage attached to it. The charge lasts a long time. I use it 2-3 times a day per week and battery doesn&#x27;t deminish as quickly the way I expected it would. I recently had a dental check up and passed with flying colors. The hygenist was at a loss because she really didn&#x27;t have much cleaning or whitening to do on my teeth. I still use my manual toothbrush at least once a week, but this is now my go to tool. Love it! If it ever breaks or dies, I would buy another in a heartbeat. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> does was it says on the tin</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was purchased to replace a Rota-Dent unit.  I never considered that there could be a significant difference in design philosophy.  While the Rota-Dent unit is quiet and smooth in operation, the Oral-B unit offers no concession to either.  When you clean your teeth with the Oral-B unit, there is no doubt left that you are cleaning your teeth.  The vibration from the Oral-B unit is very noticeable and the first time I tried it I thought I was in the dentist office getting my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;First the positive:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Oral-B is well constructed&lt;br /&gt;2) Cleans teeth better than a Rota-Dent leaving them smooth&lt;br /&gt;3) Charges though an induction circuit (I believe that is what it is called) which makes recharging the batter about as easy as possible&lt;br /&gt;4) Good selection of brush heads to meet just about any need&lt;br /&gt;Now for the not so positive:&lt;br /&gt;1) Might be a bit bulky for someone with a small mouth&lt;br /&gt;2) The vibration takes some time to get accustomed to&lt;br /&gt;3) The on/off button is difficult to use while the brush is still in your mouth - Rota-Dent&#x27;s slide switch is better&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is if you go regularly to your dentist for a cleaning the Rota-Dent is probably the best choice.  If, however, you are like me and find reasons to delay your visit, the Oral-B might be the best choice as it does a better job at cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a very great toothbrush, considering I still had a battery powered toothbrush before hand. This toothbrush is a little more expensive than I would have liked, but the functions of the toothbrush definitely make up for that. It has 3 cleaning modes, but I usually stick with the daily clean and the whitening one. The toothbrush vibrates every 30 seconds, which helps you gauge how long you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth, which is a huge positive. The toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean. My only complaint about the toothbrush is how long it takes to charge it. If you plug it in overnight, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem however. Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months now, and I love it because I could tell the difference when I go to the dentist. The dentist and I notice that I have considerably less plaque surrounding my teeth! This device also lets you make sure that you brush for the 2-minute time recommended :)</li>
            <li> me and my wife switched from a ordinary tooth brush to the oral b 3000 and it has improved our overall mouth from stains being removed that could never be done with a manual tooth brush to healthier gums.. you really get that just out of the dentist clean feeling everytime.. charge stays good for a  few days. no cons that we&#x27;ve found yet and we have been using it the last 2months. highly recommend it to my sister and her husband have gotten one since ive told em my experience.same tooth brush sells for 100$ at walmart so also a great deal.</li>
            <li> Seems the battery runs out faster than my old Oral B.  Other than that I really like it.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric brush, I love it</li>
            <li> Returned it found a better deal</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great</li>
            <li> This brush was great while it was charged, but it would only hold a charge long enough for three brushings.  It is supposed to run for about 7 days on one charge.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush for everyday use.  I have had it about a month - no problems so far and leaves a great clean, fresh, feeling.  I love the feature that alerts you every 30 seconds and then at 2 minutes to let you know how long you have been brushing.</li>
            <li> Works better than my sonic care tooth brush but it took a little getting used to . Great price</li>
            <li> The feature I appreciate the most in this toothbrush is how easy it is to clean. The handle is entirely sealed, so toothpaste does not drip down into areas of the handle that then become hard to clean.    There are two speeds, but I find the lower speed to be adequate. After just a few weeks of using the 3000, my teeth are noticably whiter. Whitening was not my reason for buying the 3000, so having whiter teeth is a very pleasant surprise.    I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B electric toothbrush is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. Works many times better than a manual brush. Teeth are whiter after just a couple of weeks using this product. I just ordered the Pro-White heads for my toothbrush which I&#x27;ll be reviewing in the near future. Great product, Fast shipping, Would definitely reccomend to friends and family!!</li>
            <li> Very good for me &amp; my wife.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product! I have had it for about a month now and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. My teeth and gums feel cleaner and healthier already! Honestly, I floss after using the brush and there is nothing to floss because it cleans my teeth that thoroughly. In addition, I love the timer- it helps ensure I am spending an adequate amount of time brushing. Battery life is great.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and it has worked great. As others have written in their reviews, it takes a loooooong time to charge. That will be a negative for some but as I use this strictly at home it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative I do have it the things seems to just &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; from time to time. Not when there is too much pressure and the red light comes on, rather it will just take a 1/2 second pause from time to time. More annoying than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great brush that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of use I&#x27;m updating my review of this product as I&#x27;ve really &amp;#34;wrung it out&amp;#34;. The brush works great so no complaints on that front, but there are two negatives that would cause me not to purchase this toothbrush again . As mentioned in my first review, it takes a long time to charge, usually about 18 hours for mine. Then it only lasts 2-3 days of brushing. It doesn&#x27;t work for trips since I don&#x27;t want to bring the charger along and it spends as much time on the charger as it does being used.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and got it yesterday afternoon... Even with just my first use, my teeth feel so much cleaner!! Even better than the dentist.... I am really happy I got this. Before I was hesitant about buying one and dropping a bunch of money on an &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush, but it does make a difference.  Especially with the timer.. it kind of forces you to brush for a whole 2 minutes where I usually would probably brush for a shorter duration.  Overall, I would recommended based on my first use... Hopefully it will hold true to its standard.  And the prices isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as what I expected for decent electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> OEM&lt;br /&gt;Braun oral-B.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B Electric toothbrush over 10 years. I visit my dentist for teeth cleaning every six months, so far, I have had good check-up every time.  Spending 2-3 minutes everyday with this toothbrush really helped my dental hygiene.  This is my third Oral-B, I like the round shape toothbrush, I find it is easier than the regular shape to move around in my month.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well and has a nice holder (a bit large maybe but still nice). I think the rotation feature is what really makes an electronic toothbrush worth having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are that it blinks a lot (after every use) and it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> Guess it works OK, I just feel like I can give more pressure with my hand and a brush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Just a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended that we both use an electric toothbrush so I ordered this one as it had a multi-head holder.  I like that it tells you when to move on to the next area.  One does not realize just how long 30 seconds is unless there is a timer.  It has several modes and you can use it with multiple different types of heads depending upon your needs.</li>
            <li> I had an older model and needed a replacement.  Like the different speeds and the system to store the brush heads.  Only one brush head comes with the system.  Generic brushheads do not fit!</li>
            <li> Yeah!  Great product!  Best model you can buy.  My teeth has never been cleaner and the battery last a lot longer than my old one.</li>
            <li> Does the job but takes forever to charge</li>
            <li> No need to buy this price  unit. Buy  the less expensive one without the flashing light for pressure. I have always found the extra gadgets are hardly used and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush it works fine and cleans my teeth well.  Unfortunately the battery falls well short of its advertised 10 day life.  3 months after purchasing, the battery lasts for 36 hours at most.  I would steer clear.</li>
            <li> Just used the product and was very satisfied, just as advertised. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B toothbrushes.  They do an excellent job at cleaning teeth, but there is one major issue with them.  The battery is NOT replaceable.  I&#x27;ve had this one for about 1 1/2 years, and it&#x27;s already having issues holding a charge.  Now, it has to be charged every 3 days or so, which is VERY annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For how much this toothbrush costs, there should be an easy way to change the battery.</li>
            <li> Powerful, does a great job.  Easy to use.  Heavy and bulky compared to the previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for 10 days or so but takes FOREVER to recharge.  I don&#x27;t keep it in the charger all the time and when it needs a charge, it takes 18-24 hours to fully charge.</li>
            <li> like much better than my old one that just vibrated, gets much cleaner love it so far.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a number of days now. Teeth feels clean. Manual brushing doesn&#x27;t match the way electric toothbrushes clean.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been great if they had an auto-voltage 110-240v with cycle 50-60Hz. I plugged it but good thing I took a look at the base. It was a 110. Amazon should put that in the description. Just to highlight that it&#x27;s not auto-voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s worth the buy. Still a whole lot better buying from amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a toothbrush like this before, only the cheap battery operated electric.  This gets my teeth feeling cleaner than ever.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go back to an old school toothbrush again.  Thinking of buying a second for the wife so we don&#x27;t have to swap tips all the time.  I wish it came with a better tip holder, but not worth a star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be brief: I bought an Oral-B on the advice of my dentist after having to undergo a gingivectomy--a procedure I would never like to repeat (though it wasn&#x27;t _that_ bad.) I opted for the 3000 as it seemed to offer the best balance between features and price. Something else worth considering: I&#x27;m trying to not line China&#x27;s pockets any more than necessary, and the Oral-B is made in Germany by Braun. I doubt there&#x27;s a US-made alternative.  I&#x27;ve found the unit super easy to use and clean, and my teeth feel incredibly clean. I haven&#x27;t had any gunk/mold issues, and the pressure and &amp;#34;time for a new zone&amp;#34; indicators work well. I&#x27;m really looking forward to my next checkup to see if it&#x27;s done as good a job as I believe it&#x27;s doing.  August 2015 Update: I&#x27;ve now had this unit for five years, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Absolutely no issues. Rinse it well and dry it, and it&#x27;ll look like new for seemingly forever. I generally use the flossing head (not a replacement for real flossing) in the morning to better massage my gums and a regular brush at night. Brushes last forever if you don&#x27;t mash them past the warning light. My gums are staying healthy, post-gingivectomy and with this regimen.</li>
            <li> After using various Sonciare models for many years, I decided to try this Oral-B. I have plaque build-up issues, and I didn&#x27;t feel that the Sonicare was cleaning my teeth effectively. I like the rotating action used during cleanings at the dentist&#x27;s office, so I figured it was worth a try.    The cons of the Oral-B Professional Care 3000:  Noisier than Sonicare  Bulkier brush head  \\&quot;Rougher\\&quot; brushing experience  Does not automatically turn off after 2 minutes    The Pros:  Since the brush doesn&#x27;t turn off after 2 minutes, I actually brush longer  More effective cleaning overall, particular between teeth (professional cleaning brush that came with unit)    Now that I&#x27;m accustomed to the cons, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> works great:-) I use it on sensitive setting and  it still cleans teeth well. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Dentist has recommended electric toothbrush for years so I finally bought this one ... love it!!!  Mouth feels tingly clean!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to store, doesn&#x27;t up much space, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; is sent in the form of a pre-paid Procter &amp; Gamble debit card from Citibank, which comes with absolutely no indication that it is being sent in lieu of the promised rebate or in any way mentions Oral-B.  The card comes with hefty monthly fees from Citibank to boot and a multi-page contract with detailed legal obligations attached to the use of the card.    The rebate form makes absolutely no mention that the rebate will be in the form of a fee-based pre-paid debit card from P&amp;G and Citibank, so when I received the card I was concerned that some identity theft had occurred.  None of the phone numbers on the card, the correspondence or on the Citibank pre-paid debit card actually work or if they do, do not allow you to reach a live customer service representative or leave a message.  (The number on the Citibank pre-paid debit card website that is given for customer support simply has a message that says your direct deposit will be processed on a certain date.)  That made it seem more likely that something illegal was afoot.    It took several days and several emails to both companies to figure out why this card (which says nothing about Oral-B) was sent.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted an electric toothbrush (not just the spinbrush kind either).  I couldn&#x27;t believe the deal I got on here!  I saved about half compared to other stores in my area.  If you have sensitive teeth I would highly recommend this model.  Oral-B also makes the 1000 series model.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this I am sure, however I believe it doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive mode (meaning the motor goes slower than the normal mode).  I myself have sensitive teeth and definitely have to have the sensitive mode.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a dramatic difference in how clean my mouth feels!  The only downfall is that about once a week you do have to charge the battery (which does take about 17 hours).  Honestly, that&#x27;s not a big deal.  The other thing is there is kind of an annoying tray that comes with it.  It has room for additional brush heads.  It&#x27;s a nice feature, but something I really don&#x27;t find the need for.  Overall, those are minor things.  I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a cleaner mouth and also another positive is it really does help remove surface stains.</li>
            <li> Would not charge completely even after 24 hours.  Green light kept blinking,  which was annoying.  Sent it back.  Liked everything else and would buy again if it just would hold a charge, but they were sold out.</li>
            <li> Been disappointed with this item.... had been using Sonicare but dentist recommended this toothbrush because of the smaller head and ease of getting in crevices and around my permanent retainer.  Having to go through all 3 settings to turn it on/off is annoying.  It&#x27;s definitely not like the Sonic and doesn&#x27;t tolerate much pressure at all - making it difficult in tight spots as it just stops if it thinks there is too much pressure being applied when it isn&#x27;t always about the pressure.  Gonna stick with Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The best Oral-B toothbrush.  And the just the best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are healthy, but after just one brushing with this toothbrush, they feel noticeably cleaner.  The pulsating action knocks off tartar and food and makes flossing that much easier.</li>
            <li> Works great and like the  the 30 second reminder that it gives.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I have used the Spinbrush for years and loved its results.  I always get a good report from the dentist, but this tooth brush is so much better than that!  This brush gives you the fresh from the dentist feel.  While the brush head is a little bit smaller than the spin brush it works great!  There is an indicator light that tells you when you are brushing too hard.  I have read some other reviews comparing this to the next model up and one of the  major differences is that the charging station and the tooth brush have the indicator light but as long as you brush in front of the mirror you can see the light on the toothbrush and if you aren&#x27;t brushing in front of the mirror you wouldnt see the light on the base either unless you don&#x27;t have a mirror over you sink or don&#x27;t have your toothbrush at your sink, neither of which makes much sense!  Great product, i would highly recommend the upgrade!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried those drugstore battery operated toothbrushes for a couple of years, and they were fine, but I always felt like I was trying to cram those large brush heads in my mouth.  It was REALLY hard to reach my back teeth.  (I&#x27;m a medium sized woman, so not sure why those brush heads always seemed so big to me.) But this is a great toothbrush!  The head is perfectly sized to get around all my teeth and all the way to the back of my mouth with no problems.  The stick part is slim too, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m cramming in something too big.  I love the 30 second quadrant timer (although you really have to pay attention for the pause or you&#x27;ll miss it).  It is also completely waterproof, as I use mine in the shower (not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to do that but I do with no problems so far).  And it has some serious power to clean! I notice after about a weeks use it seems a little slower, still more than sufficient to brush, and I recharge weekly.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I did use the previous version of this so I can appreciate the new improvements. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it usefull and enjoy it for a long time</li>
            <li> Defective-had to return it--maybe it was just the one I happened to get-who knows? It did not hold a charge from the first time I plugged it in--returned it for a sonicare,which I am happy with</li>
            <li> Works great! Its my second one. The first one has started to slow down but I think its like 8 years old. The only thing that would make it better would be a good brush holder. Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Oh my God this thing is SOOOOO loud! I had a Sonicare before and am going back to it.</li>
            <li> This is excellent. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable ....battery life is only a few days.....wish I would have bought a different brand.....</li>
            <li> I like this better than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It is easy to use and makes your teeth feel like you just had them professionally cleaned. This is the brand and type that was recommended to us by our dentist. You can buy multiple head types depending on what type of head you want.</li>
            <li> I switched from an ultrasonic electric toothbrush (I won&#x27;t name names) and I have been so pleased with this one in just the first few days I&#x27;ve used it. The twirling head does all the work for you so I&#x27;m not tempted to brush back and forth (so bad for my gums!) when I&#x27;m in a hurry. And my gums feel extra safe with the sensitive setting, which my other brush didn&#x27;t have, but my teeth still get super clean. It&#x27;s like I get a cleaning from the dentist every time I brush--without the nails-on-chalkboard feeling that the combination of the plastic-y brush head and gritty toothpaste at the dentist&#x27;s office does. Thank you, Oral-B!</li>
            <li> This replaced an older model. I am happy with its power, its ability to last for several days without being recharged, and it&#x27;s price compared to those in the stores near me.</li>
            <li> The battery should be easily replaceable; not as forced obsolescence.</li>
            <li> This item has a powerful motor 3 different speed settings ,also a red light will come on if you are pressing down to hard !!! i think thats a good thing!! Thank you..</li>
            <li> works great teeth are noticeably cleaner whiter</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B toothbrush.  I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for well over 20 years and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Replacement for our 10 year old Braun that died.</li>
            <li> This helps because I have tendonitis and other wrist issues...relieves my hands from bending and twisting.  The only thing I do not like is it shuts off at the very back teeth.  Also, took me a couple weeks to get use to the vibrating on the gums.  It felt uncomfortable at first.  I&#x27;m use to it now.</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from my old Sonicare.  Bought this version because it came with the toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> Have now used the Oral B Precision 3000 for over a month. This replaces an old Oral B rechargeable toothbrush that died after 10 yrs. The new Oral B has a better fast and slow pulse choice that works well for me. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts as long as my first Oral B.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best I have owned. The brush cleans much better than Sonicare, since it spins rather than vibrates. Highly recommended investment.</li>
            <li> Have used Oral-Bs for years and have always been very pleased. Until now. I had just bought a 1000 and decided to have one brush for the morning and one at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 had a coupon and I thought why not. I actually got this for less than the big W word sold the 1000 for and a lot less than what they wanted for the 3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it was amazing. The cleaning ability is far superior to any Oral-B I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning after using the older Oral-Bs but this one is better. Guess the 40,000 oscillations is about twice as good as the 20,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy.</li>
            <li> My hygenist recommended this and she was right, I can feel the difference on my teeth.  I am a tea drinker and it keeps the stains in check in my 60 year-old mouth.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one that lasted over five years before dying. I like the new design of the base charger as it is much easier to clean than the previous version.</li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth and gums much better than regular brushing. I love it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are glad to have this one!</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush except on/off button requires being pushed just right with some finger pressure. The older Oral B it replaced had an easy on/off button to operate</li>
            <li> just rec&#x27;d toothbrush nice fast service and starting to charge as i write .  wold not be without any of oral b products</li>
            <li> This is my second electric toothebrush. My last oral B lasted 10 years. I like the improvements they have made over the other oral B I had.  It has three brushing functions all on one button. I prefer the sensitive mode, and occasionally use the whiting mode.  My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  I like the light that comes on if you are brushing too hard. It also buzzes after each 30 seconds to change quantrants you are brushing and buzzes 3 times at the end of 2 minutes. The charging unit is a lot smaller than the previous one, which is nice if you have limited counter space in your bathroom.  The charge last about one week, and it takes at least 12 hours to charge the brush. Overall I am very satisfied with this brushing unit.  Ii would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the speed selection and the clean feeling I get from using this toothbrush!  Recommend it to anyone interested in protecting their smile.</li>
            <li> The brush is lighter and slimmer then the one it replaced, which are good things. However, in contrast to the one it replaced, it did not come with a travel case, which I was not expecting--most disappointing, since we travel a lot. This was not apparent from the description.</li>
            <li> Our first electric toothbrush was a Oral B, and it lasted over five years with two people using it. When it finally died we tried a different brand. It didn&#x27;t last as long and we didn&#x27;t like the brush heads, so I bought another Oral B. It&#x27;s noisy and doesn&#x27;t shut off after two minutes. Since neither complaint was a total deal breaker (and because we had thrown away all the packaging and paperwork) we kept it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t remember getting this item through you, but we use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use an electric toothbrush because the models I&#x27;ve tried have been too irritating.  This one is not.  My daughter recommended it.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of weeks with no gum irritation.  So far so good ....</li>
            <li> I like this replacement for my Oral-B. It has different speeds than my older one.</li>
            <li> So far, good.  It does what previous reviews say on the positive side.  I&#x27;ll use as long as it last.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly, unlike other items that I have purchased on Amazon.com that I have ordered over 4 months ago and never received!  I like the Oral-B electric toothbrush very much - teeth feel very clean after using.</li>
            <li> Great !  I have been using Oral-B for 20 years</li>
            <li> i was about to buy this when i learned there is no cover for the brush, when not in use!&lt;br /&gt;and i&#x27;d be keeping it in the bathroom?!?!&lt;br /&gt;that seems disgusting or maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m used to the competitor, whose brush comes with a cover when not in use...&lt;br /&gt;thanks but i&#x27;ll buy the competitor&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old unit. He likes it. Looks very sleek and charges up well. So far, so good. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Great product! Shiny teeth!  My second Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  I would not use any other toothbrush.  Its so strong it flings the toothpaste off my toothbrush the first time I use it after it has recharged.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an Oral-B that is at least 10 years old.  This has some new features that I really like:  The quadrant system for brushing teeth and the shut off if pressing too hard.  We are very happy with this model.  I don&#x27;t need a brush that is a &amp;#34;Smart Toothbrush&amp;#34;.  Does one really need this info on their cell phone???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sonic.... I got it cause I thought it would be like the Philips Sonicare brush my sister has... but all it is, is a (quickly) rotating brush head. Not quite the sonic action I was looking for, but of course, it did clean my teeth. Returning :( Also, super loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Bought this when previous Oral-B electric toothbrush was still operative, but could no longer find replacement brushes.  Expect to use this toothbrush for several years.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B 3000 appears to be nearly identical to what is also called the Oral-B Professional Care Advantage. Costco has them as a double pack for membership holders. But actually Amazon has it here for a good price, and it currently comes with a $20.00 rebate. I am very happy with the purchase so far. It&#x27;s cleaning has more power than I was expecting. There are several brush head replacements available, including a floss style, and they appear to be priced better than Sonic&#x27;s.  My other fairly new Sonic lately does not seem to be lasting more than 1-2 days per charge. I am hoping and expecting this will actually hold a charge 7 days, as P&amp;G says it will. BTW CR rates the 4000 very highly, and this 3000 seems to be nearly identical to it. Recommended....and I have been a Sonic user for 12 years.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is my brand for an Electric Toothbrush. I have used this brand for many years, and every new model seems to get better every time. This model, my family is very happy with it, it has multiple brush tips, for my kids they like the sensor that let them know when they brush to hard. We especially like the tip with the polishing center. Even though these tips do not come with this model it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using braun electric toothbrushes for over a decade. I purchased my Oral 3000 to replace my Oral B vitality. The vitality was a decent toothbrush, but I decided to upgrade to something with a little more horsepower. My vitality&#x27;s battery was getting a little weak also, but I still consider the vitality a good toothbrush for what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B 3000 definitely has a lot more horsepower. My teeth feel just like they do after each visit to my dental hygienist and I love that clean feeling. The Oral B 3000 was definitely worth the money I paid for it. Do your teeth and gums a favor and purchase this toothbrush. I was not disappointed and you won&#x27;t be either. Thanks again Amazon. This toothbrush rocks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an older electric toothbrush (Braun Excel 3D) and this is a big improvement!  The brush holder is smaller and you can easily remove it from the toothbrush base to clean it.  In my older model the holder was attached and it was nearly impossible to keep clean and felt like a mold magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to be able to keep the the brush holder separate due to space limitations on the sink top - but I&#x27;ve left it attached to the toothbrush base as the holder is the square-ish shape attached to an oval ring that the toothbrush base fits into.  So it actually took up more room as separates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works great and I&#x27;m getting used to the using the 30 second \\&quot;notifications\\&quot; during the 2 minute brush cycle to move the brush to different parts of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Just received our new Oral-B tooth brush which replaces our old one that is almost 8 years old and still works perfectly. With the easy availability of replacement brushes and the excellent cleaning action of the brush, we would not use anything else. Not only does the brush clean our teeth well but the action of the brush promotes gum/tooth health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for oral health and a really good tool for brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> After reading consumer reports, having used Oral-B&#x27;s Vitality brush, and read the product comparisons on Oral-B&#x27;s website, I got two of these, one for me and one for my wife.  It is an amazing product that makes my teeth feel dentist-chair clean every time I use it, and appears to clean as well as the more expensive ones.  The initial charge on the battery has lasted well over a week.</li>
            <li> This is my first non-manual toothbrush, so a lot of what I say is probably true of most power brushes these days but here we go. I find it significantly easier to actually brush my teeth with this on those nights when I am tired and lazy (yep, I am that kind of person). The thirty second timer is nice for doing the &#x27;quadrants&#x27; the right amount of time, and I definitely feel like it is getting the back of my teeth better than the manual brush ever did. I have never really used the \\&quot;whitening mode,\\&quot; which as other reviewers have said is just basically pulsing the power. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the extra brush heads that you can get for this, but might in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B tooth brush.  I replaced my last one after ten years.  Oral B has been my choice of brush for years.  I even have a battery operated one in my travel bag.  The new brush can be used for days even without having the charging stand.  I&#x27;ve gotten my adult children hooked on Oral B as well.  It is a great choice for oral health care.  Takes care of your teeth better between six month check ups at the dentist.  Of course, you must remember to floss  before brushing for great dental check ups!</li>
            <li> always a favorite the toothbrush  isn&#x27;t requiring twenty more words is foolish it&#x27;s a quick review not a critique, really?</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush until I travel internationally. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that this product comes with a charger adapts up to 240v. Now I am planning another international travel.. Don&#x27;t make me switch to Philips T_T</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product well over a year.  I get good dental hygiene comments.  I have no reason to change at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new toothbrush to replace the one that died. I found this oral B that actually works better. It has more power and I like the smaller, round heads on the oral B. It fits in my old wall mount charger and keeps it off the counter, no clutter. That was a good plus!</li>
            <li> I looked at many of the electric toothbrushes, and decided on the Oral B 3000.  It has a lot of features that I really like.  You can use it at 3 different settings - a routine, sensitive, or hard cleaning, depending on what you like.  It came with a storage place for the brush heads, too.  It is just what I wanted - and a good buy.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> This brand by far is my favorite of all the toothbrushes out there. Recently got this one to replace a really old one I had and so far, this one is a great upgrade from the last one. I love details so the case to hold the brushes is a nice touch. My last one did not have that option. It feels more powerful and the different modes are also a nice touch. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any model from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> A perfect gift for my family!</li>
            <li> Rotating vs vibrating electric brushes are a personal preference. I prefer a rotating brush. It gets under the gum line and in between spaces. This brush is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this oral-B in a twin pack from Costco almost a year ago and had I not given one to my mother as a gift I would have returned it/them. In fact, if my mother had not taken it with her the next day for her annual trip out of Arizona for the summer, I would have requested she give it back and I would have returned them an gotten her a different gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 major problems with these oral-B&#x27;s is the ridiculous amount of charging time it requires per minute of use and it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the Sonicare in cleaning. I was extremely careful to fully charge and discharge the battery each cycle to prevent a loss of charging capability. However, the toothbrush consistently needs 24+ hours of charge to give just 14 two minute uses. Even worse, the performance suffers a significant drop off with each use as the battery dissipates charge. So, it takes over 45 minutes charge per 1 minute of use, which with the technology available today is ridiculous! I got so fed up with the poor performance and dated battery technology that I gave up on this oral-b and bought a Sonicare, even though I had many unused brush heads for the oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare the Sonicare to the oral-B is like equating a GPS navagation system to an old fold up map. The Sonicare I bought has a lithium ion battery (the newest model even has a lithium polymer battery!) that I&#x27;ve now used for 14 two minute cycles on an initial charge of less than 4 hours and it isn&#x27;t even showing the light that it is at 50% or less of charge yet. I fully expect it to last the 42 brushes it is estimated per charge, and better yet, I haven&#x27;t noticed any drop off in performance. I should have expected as much given the oral-B&#x27;s required minimum initial charge is 17 hours vs. 2 hours for the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, after this past weeks use I have been able to greatly reduce the plaque I get in a problem area of my lower jaw (with large chunks literally breaking away from my teeth). My teeth are significantly whiter, while my mouth is much fresher throughout the day, which was a real issue with the oral-B. In short, the Sonicare is light years better than the oral-B in every aspect and I&#x27;m so grateful I made the decision to switch. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t ever spent the money on the oral-B to begin with and saddled my mom with a pathetic brush. Now my guilt is telling me that I need to get the Sonicare for my mom so she can also throw out the poor performing, energy hogging oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another significant point I think is in the Philips Sonicare&#x27;s favor, customer service. When I bought the oral-B thay had a 50% rebate, which is why I made the poor decision to go with the oral-B instead of the Sonicare to begin with, but, the brush I gave to my mom had the UPC code which I didn&#x27;t notice until it was gone in the trash and too late to send in. However, I called oral-B and explained the situation and that I still had the required original register receipt that would preclude a fraudulent use of that UPC. All they would say is send in the form and the receipt with an explanation and they would give it consideration. This was so vague that I asked to speak with a manager and was told that one wasn&#x27;t available. So, I gave my contact info and asked for a call when a mgr was available only to never get a call back and have my rebate request sent back stating I needed to resubmit it with the UPC code. That told me they never bothered to read the letter I had enclosed or simply didn&#x27;t care. Now to Sonicare, when I went online to gather information I chatted online with a rep who was very accomadating and even offered a 15% discount code after I asked if there were any specials currently available. Also Philips offered an extra 6 months extension of their warranty if you register it online, which increases the warranty to 2.5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the Sonicare is more expensive in initial cost, but when you factor in the VAST difference in electricity used andthe incredible difference in results I can honestly say I feel the Sonicare is a bargain in comparison to the oral-B. In fact, the oral-B is one of the worst buys I have made in many years, if not the worst. Please, do yourself a favor and if you opt for an electric brush over manual get the Sonicare and if your only option is oral-B stay with the manual brush as I found myself skipping a midday brushing or post meal brushing knowing it was going to take over 1.5 hours a charging for every use of the oral-B. I now look forward to brushing again with my Sonicare and even do the extra specific gum cycles for better oral health!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I bought this to replace my Oral-B 3-D which is no longer made.  This Pro Health model has so many great features, including the quadrant cleaning timer and the pressure sensor.  The rechargeable base is also able to be broken down to a smaller size for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush, had read other reviews that people were having problems with &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; on the power-pack, this isn&#x27;t a problem. this thing works great!</li>
            <li> Works great, it&#x27;s not a sonic care, so if you are used to sonic speed, you might not like this. I like it because I can get replacement brushes for very cheap; even target has cheap replacement brushes. No regrets, good purchase.</li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush. i like was to brush so my teeth can sparkle with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts 5 days. Easy to use. Very portable. Easy to clean. The pressure sensor works well to retrain brushing habits.</li>
            <li> When you hear other reviewers saying how this brush feels like going to the dentist everyday to get your teeth cleaned, they are not lying! This toothbrush is the bomb! I decided to get this after my last dentist appointment (in which I had 2 cavities) because I was tired of paying the outrageous out of pocket costs that come with fillings and figured I could start by upgrading to a more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my teeth feel much much cleaner than they did when I used a way cheaper quality electric toothbrush. I am using the precision brush head (which is just the standard one that comes in the box) and I can actually notice my teeth getting slightly whiter! If the standard brush attachment does that, I can only imagine how well the whitening/polishing attachment will do! I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dentist appointment so that I can redeem myself.</li>
            <li> We had this same toothbrush system previously but the charger and brush holder got lost in our recent move!  The item arrived quickly and we were happy to be able to exactly replace our old set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and powerful. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> every brushing feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist for a cleaning.  wish that I would have purchased it sooner!</li>
            <li> love&lt;br /&gt; the speed and cleaning. My mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> Great brush  much better than  my five year old oral b</li>
            <li> See our review regarding the Oral-B brushes.  The same applies: Great product, competitive price, convenience.</li>
            <li> The unit works great and I have no concerns about the mechanical performance of it. This replaced a &amp;#34;spin brush&amp;#34; that you can pick up for about five bucks in the store. Yes it outperforms that toothbrush but at 10 times the price, it should!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the three stars? Because of one significant thing: the battery. On my cheapo brush I could replace the battery. On this model you can&#x27;t. This is planned obsolescence, something I hate. See the unit will most likely last years and years. Oral-B realizes that so they build the unit in a fashion that: 1. You can&#x27;t get into the unit to replace the battery and 2. They use Ni-Cad batteries. Double whammy. I use Eneloop batteries in just about all of my applications. They don&#x27;t have the drawbacks of Ni-Cad. The unit is designed to sit on the charger all the time. Well for one, you are going to get the &amp;#34;memory effect&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t let it completely discharge periodically. Also these batteries contain Cadmium which has prompted the EU to ban their use except for certain specific applications.  Make sure that when you dispose of this unit or batteries you do it at a recycling center!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought it I made sure that there was SOME way I could replace the batteries. It isn&#x27;t as easy as the $5 spin brush (by far) but it CAN be done. Google it and you&#x27;ll find out the method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B could do it the same way as the cheapo models - using o-rings and the like but for profit they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why the three-star rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, hoping to get her to brush her teeth more. So far so good, she seems to like it, and it does make a noticeable difference in her smile.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and works perfectly.  Has three settings but I only ever use the most powerful one.  I suppose I could use the gentler setting if I had any issues.  I typically keep it fully charged but the few times I&#x27;ve had it off the charger for a few days it&#x27;s kept the charge just fine with no dip in power.  I like the warning light that turns on when you&#x27;re pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that took me a while to figure out is that you can hold the button down to power it off rather than having to cycle through all the settings.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush does stop when I press too hard, which is a big part of why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oral B toothbrushes for a few years.  When my old one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, I knew I wanted another one.  Tried buying a cheaper model without any features and was disappointed.  Thought spending this much on a toothbrush seemed excessive but after the cheaper model was so disappointing, I reluctantly made the purchase.  I am so pleased with this model.  Having different settings is very convenient plus the external timer makes it easier to be certain that I&#x27;m spending just the right amount of time on each section.  I don&#x27;t feel that the recommended two minutes is too long anymore.  Would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like convenience and efficiency of OralB 3000. I used battery operated toothbrushes in the past since they were inexpensive. This product is much superior compare to manual or battery operated toothbrushes. The price at Amazon.com was 40 dollars less expensive than retail stores</li>
            <li> I switched from a Sonicare basic model brush to Oral-b 3000/8850 after the battery of the sonicare died after 5+ years of use.&lt;br /&gt;I like it that this Oral-b toothbrush has a sensitive mode.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very happy with how long one full charge of the battery can last.&lt;br /&gt;However the design of the brush head that came with this Oral-B toothbrush has made it very hard for me to clean my teeth effectively. The brush head has a round big bump on its back and is much \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; than the normal brush heads that I&#x27;m used to(including all the manual and the Sonicare brush heads I&#x27;ve used).&lt;br /&gt;This design makes it so difficult to turn, swivel or adjust the angle of the brush head inside the mouth without hitting hard on the bottom/upper teeth, especially when I try to clean the teeth in the deep back of the mouth. And I often get choked when trying to turn the brush head because it&#x27;s just too big. I personally get much better cleaning result with the sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the brush heads don&#x27;t come with individual hard plastic covers like the sonicare ones do.</li>
            <li> I got this just for a change from my sonic brush as my gums get a little sore at times.  Don&#x27;t bother with this at all, get the sonic brush!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrush several months ago. After using a manual toothbrush my entire life, this brush takes a little getting used to. It seems that my mouth felt cleaner and fresher when I brushed with a manual toothbrush, but this one works none the less. This Oral-B makes it easier to brush more consistently due to the fact that you receive a short pulse every 30 seconds to remind you to change the brushing area, and a slightly longer pulse at two minutes when finished. The sensitivity light works very well. I&#x27;ve learned to learn to brush a little lighter than I&#x27;m used to but that&#x27;s probably a good thing. The unit seems to be well built, recharges quickly and does a sufficient job. Overall this is a nice toothbrush and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend making the investment in an electric toothbrush, you get that just-from-the-dentist clean mouth feel all year. :) This particular model is a nice middle-of-the-road option in terms of features and price. I appreciate the 30-second timer option more than I&#x27;d anticipated - it&#x27;s nice to have a guide for how long to spend on each &#x27;quadrant&#x27;. I mostly use the &#x27;normal&#x27; speed, but the &#x27;gentle&#x27; is helpful in some trouble spots. I&#x27;m skeptical of the &#x27;whitening&#x27; mode, particularly because just switching to the electric toothbrush made a bit of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and I find I can&#x27;t tolerate the intensity of that mode very well. The (detachable) portion of the charging dock that stores extra brush heads is very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of electric toothbrushes for many years.  Initially, I liked them because I was lazy and didn&#x27;t brush often enough much less correctly.  I used an Interplak for many years and it was okay.  Maybe 4 or 5 years ago I became aware of the Oral-B brand and that they claimed to effectively \\&quot;floss\\&quot; as well.  I never got the hang of flossing and some of my teeth were too close together to get that stupid little cord in between them.  My lack of brushing and flossing and regular dental cleanings had me worried that something bad was going to happen because of my poor dental hygene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read much, you see where poor dental health is thought to be related to a number of illnesses.  I don&#x27;t remember the list, but as I get older I know that I don&#x27;t want any more illnesses.  So, I purchased an Oral-B several years ago.  I liked it very much.  Whether or not it actually did anything, it felt stimulating to have it roam around in my mouth.  As I used it and used it more often and started going to the dentist regularly, I clearly was having less problems, especially bleeding gums.  I purchased one for my wife and she liked it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my wife sometimes \\&quot;overdoes\\&quot; things.  On one trip to the dentist, they told her that she was brushing \\&quot;too hard\\&quot; and was wearing the enamel off her teeth.  So, she became more aware of this and was more careful.  We loved our original Oral-B&#x27;s and had them for many years until this model was a \\&quot;Gold Box\\&quot; deal.  I could only buy one and I did so and gave it to my wife because it has a \\&quot;brushing too hard\\&quot; alert.  It&#x27;s smaller than our original Oral-B&#x27;s and has a smaller vanity \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; if you leave off the plastic \\&quot;saddlebag\\&quot; that comes with it and it&#x27;s lighter.  We&#x27;ve never been too much into sharing toothbrushes so I never used her \\&quot;new\\&quot; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeadedly, she told me how much she liked it and how I should get one for myself.  This wasn&#x27;t quite so easy to do since this deal combined a Gold Box buy with a factory rebate (one per address).  After some time searching, I found a pretty good deal on this model elsewhere and ordered.  I do like it.  It has some extra functions that I haven&#x27;t used yet.  My biggest complaint with this and my prior Oral-B is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to feel the On/Off button.  So, while you&#x27;re trying to turn it off, it&#x27;s shaking water and toothpaste all over your face and vanity.  But, my dental visits continue to improve and I have gone from a \\&quot;4 per year\\&quot; cleaning cycle to a \\&quot;2 per year\\&quot; cleaning cycle even though I still refuse to floss.  Another nice thing about these Oral-B&#x27;s is that they hold a charge for quite a while so you can take it on a trip without having to carry the base charging unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a cheap investment in your dental and physical health.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the next higher models do.  Maybe they connect to the internet or play music while your brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush and loved the way it cleaned my teeth but it has a red flashing light close to your eyes if you brush too hard.  If you are sensitive to this, have flicker vertigo, migraines or seizures I would not recommend buying this model.  The light cannot be turned off and it is very bright and very red.</li>
            <li> The item arrived within a week and was exactly as described in the description. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Well designed, no nasty cleanup in any parts.</li>
            <li> I was against purchasing electric toothbrushes for a very very long time. At my last dental cleaning in Feb this year, my dentist told me that I had slight gingivitis near my gums and that electric toothbrushes do a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth. In addition to this brush, I floss, rinse with a fluoride non-alcohol mouthwash, and hope that I won&#x27;t have ANY issues at my next cleaning!</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a week and I already feel a difference!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Changed my life. Works really effectively. Would highly recommend to all!!! All kinda of replacement heads available! My girlfriend things it&#x27;s hard to use for tight areas.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush!  better than my old oral b vitality brush.  handle is narrower so it&#x27;s easier to use and hold.  also has a low battery indicator which my other one didn&#x27;t have.  best toothbrush i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> What is there to say?  It is an electric toothbrush.  It works.  Oral-B makes many different toothbrush heads for the thing, find one you like.  Highly recommended (by my dentist too)  I now use my old one for cleaning grout in the shower.</li>
            <li> so far so good. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I lived this long without it.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model which we had for a few years but the batteries gave up. This works well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and needed; plus it was about 30 bucks cheaper than it was in Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B Professional tooth brush that I have purchased in the last several years. They are both very good brushes and clean my teeth and gums much better than the old conventional hand held manual tooth brushes. The last time I got my teeth cleaned the lady said that she could tell by looking at my teeth and gums that I used the Oral-B Professional brushes! They do a wonderful job keeping my teeth clean and my gums stimulated!</li>
            <li> it takes forever to charge, otherwise great toothbrush --- i mean, i only have had it for 2 months as of this writing...</li>
            <li> We got this with the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser to address gum issues.  I will say that the combination worked great and he managed to greatly improve his gum health in just a couple of months.  However, the scooped base collects water and gets icky very quickly (I have to clean it every day) and the battery has begun to not hold a charge as long.  He&#x27;s only had it for over a year.  I will look at other brands and models when it comes time to replace (which is looking like it&#x27;s going to be sooner than I would have hoped).</li>
            <li> Product was as described, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I received the Oral-B 3000 series electric toothbrush around Christmas time in 2012.  After 3 months I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The tooth brush holds a charge well, usually needing a charge once a week (a charge does take 12 hours though).  This model also comes with a nice stand that holds the brush in place as well as provides a place to store extra tooth brush heads (This allows you to share the brush with someone else by simply swapping the heads out, the heads have a colored ring so you can tell them apart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush&#x27;s timer feature is also nice, helping you brush all four sections of your mouth for 30 seconds.  I have not tried the other modes out very much and just stick to the standard brush mode, but it is very easy to access the mode you want.</li>
            <li> I have the 5000 series Oral-B and bought the 3000 series for my wife after comparing the two models.  If you are trying to figure out which of the Oral-Bs provides the best value I would recommend the 3000 series.  The main difference between the two models that was important to us was the 30 second indicator that lets you know to move to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of teeth to clean as described by Oral-B.  With the 5000 series you&#x27;re looking at a separate LCD monitor to know when to move.  With the 3000 series the toothbrush itself shakes after 30 seconds to let you know to move on.  Considering the massive price difference we went with the 3000 series and are glad we did.  The 3000 series stalk is also thinner and smaller so it is easier to handle.  When my 5000 series dies I will replace it with a 3000 series.</li>
            <li> Got these for a present for a close friend! They love it and say that it whitens teeth! Go figure! Maybe I&#x27;ll get myself one!</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever, I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to an actual regular tooth brush. Not that brushing your teeth is a hard job, but this thing tells you when to change sides in your mouth and lets you know if you are brushing your teeth to hard. Just really cool features. After I brush, I always feel like my teeth are clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone who would like to keep his teeth!  It is an amazing device.  My teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I&#x27;ve probably purchased 10 different electric toothbrushes over the last 15 years. This is by far the best. I will keep buying this one as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a couple of weeks. Love the 30 second timer feature, reminds me of where I&#x27;m at in my brush. It also blinks at you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is a nice feature and reminder to go easy on yourself.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a battery powered toothbrush and this one met the specs I was given. It performs as advertised and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic electric toothbrush.  I love that I only have to charge it about 1 a month.</li>
            <li> The unit I received will not charge.  The red light keeps blinking as though the battery is low, but no matter how long I keep it on the charging unit the blinking red light never turns off.  I tried leaving it plugged in overnight, as well as changing electric outets, but nothing has worked.  Since the 30-day return window for Amazon has expired, I will be returning the product to Oral-B for a replacement.</li>
            <li> The condition is very good and it cleaned my teeh 10 times bettter than the normal tooth brushes. It is a very good choice to protect my teeth.</li>
            <li> It brushes fantastically. The 30 second vibration alerts are great, the red light alerts you when you are brushing too hard. It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to stand up. You can use it in the shower and remove and switch the brush head easily.</li>
            <li> Need charging after 2 or 3 days which is not acceptable for a brand new unit.</li>
            <li> I bought to use with the electric toothbrush. My dentist has always said to use the soft brushes. Less damage to the teeth and gums. These fit bill very well.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush. I replaced another Oral B electric toothbrush that I had for years. My hygienist complimented me on how good my teeth and gums looked. I spent less time at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having tried a SonicCare in the past. It is comparable in some ways, and not in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Sonic Care made my teeth feel cleaner. (You know, that &amp;#34;just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling -- I didn&#x27;t get that from this Oral-B.)&lt;br /&gt;* This Oral-B did a much better job of massaging and cleaning my gums to keep them healthy.&lt;br /&gt;* They&#x27;re both great for getting behind back teeth, but I think this one did a better job of really getting it clean back there.&lt;br /&gt;* The 30 second interval buzzes are very helpful to clean your teeth in quadrants, and for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;* The pressure indicator was helpful. It&#x27;s always nice to know if you&#x27;re pressing hard enough to wear down your enamel! Easy to view, and impossible to miss... it&#x27;s a very bright light, even bright enough to get your attention in a sunlit room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I prefer this to the SonicCare models I&#x27;ve used in the past, mostly because I have a lot of crowns, and most of my mouth concerns have more to do with healthy gums rather than my few remaining teeth at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, they were both worth purchasing for different reasons. So here&#x27;s what I do: My husband has a SonicCare, and I use this one. I have a brush head for his SonicCare, and got him a brush head for my Oral-B. Perfect dental health all around!</li>
            <li> My family has been using this brand of product for over 5 years and there are various models available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this brand of electric toothbrush is of very good quality providing you choose the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist for 2 years and when I did go for a clean-up the dentist asked me what I was doing because he said there was very little cleaning needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is by far the best one I have purchased so far.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit more expensive than the other models but I can assure you it will meet and perhaps exceed your expectations and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I confidently recommend this product; and particularly this model.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Sonicare made my teeth clean, but also hyper-sensitive.  This makes my teeth just as clean and much happier.  :o)</li>
            <li> works great - a replacement for a ten plus year old Oral B toothbrush (battery stopped charging on old unit)</li>
            <li> I like the product. It works and is easy to clean. Toothpaste goo does dribble down the handle and leave a white circle on the counter-top every day, but it&#x27;s easily wiped up.</li>
            <li> love it ... A little hard to pack when going on vacation.. The toothbrush holder is strange sitting on the side however I do like the fact that it does snap off ... love the power ... would recommend....</li>
            <li> This small change in the way I take care of my teeth made a big difference in my twice-yearly dental visits. After using this electric toothbrush for a few weeks, I went for a deep cleaning of my gums (which were recommended at my first visit) and my gums had tightened and the gaps were smaller so much so the dental hygienist couldn&#x27;t believe it. The product was received without any damage (great packaging) and fast service. Best value and great investment.</li>
            <li> Our third Braun in the last 18 years and the best to date.  The pressure sensor light will keep you from over brushing and damaging enamel.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
            <li> battery like is kind of low</li>
            <li> We bought a pair of the Oral B Model 3000 Professional Care Braun Toothbrushs at Costco several years ago and they were great.  They were Type 3728 and they were a navy blue and sky blue color scheme, with a silver on/off button.  They&#x27;d go about 18 days on a charge. They came with a travel case that stored one handle and two brush heads so it was convnient to travel with.  Then they started only going about 7 days on a charge so we bought this new version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new version is a type 3756. It is white with with a royal blue front and a white on/off button.  It only will go thru 4 brushings before needing recharging.  It&#x27;s slightly longer than the original so it won&#x27;t fit in the old travel case and the motor is MUCH less powerful.  I called Braun to see if they were defective and basically was told this is how they work.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old ones.  These were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get a sonicare toothbrush because my gums bleed a lot when I get cleanings.  Also mentioned they could see the first signs of gingivitis, which scared me because I brush my teeth everyday. I looked and did a lot of research online and came across the Oral-B electric toothbrush which is cheaper than the sonicare, but seemed to do just as well in the reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t agree more! This toothbrush works so well! My gums no longer bleed AT ALL! This thing has a timer on it, and lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. What a difference this has made. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> Does it work for 220 volts too?</li>
            <li> Good quality electric toothbrush. Like this one better than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am not a toothbrush expert but it works really fast and good. I am happy with it and thats all that counts.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and is exactly what I was expecting-brand new</li>
            <li> My new dentist recommended this e-brush, I wish I had gotten it a long time ago, does a much better job of cleaning your teeth in half the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these before and they work well.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> First one lasted for years....I believe in this product so I now have my second one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife for her birthday. I did this because her old electric toothbrush was too loud and it made me want to run outside and put my head in the snow. This one is much more quiet and doesn&#x27;t bother me. She keeps using it, so it must be working good.</li>
            <li> I owned an Oral-B power toothbrush previously. It died after several years of use and I love the new model! It makes my mouth feel cleaner than before. Using a power toothbrush has controlled my peridontal gum problem for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush meets all of the criteria I need in a product.  My last Oral B lasted 20 tears.  I look forward to a similar experience this time.</li>
            <li> the product is outstanding.  However, it was over $35 and i was charged shipping anyway.  plus, i paid approximately $89, and a week later i see the price has dropped to $74.  NOT cool.  Also, it very difficult to get hold of you.  this has been my only outlet and i don&#x27;t know if it will ever be read.  In my rating, it is not concerning the product, it is about the charge of shipping and the price dropping drastically only a week later.  I fee cheated.</li>
            <li> For nearly 11 years I owned another model Oral-B that would no longer hold a charge so i bought this one to replace it. I put the new unit in the charger and left it for approximately 23 hours without the blinking light ever holding for the required 5 seconds the manual says indicates full charge. After that I used the unit for 4 days before it required a new charge; 3 days short of its listed time usage. I called customer service 2 weeks after purchasing and was told that I would have to send the unit in, at my expense of course, to be evaluated; NOT &amp;#34;we&#x27;re sorry this has happened let us send out a new unit to you, free of charge.&amp;#34; How long was this to take: about 10 days. Well thanks anyway Braun, I&#x27;&#x27;ll go elsewhere for my next electric toothbrush. BTW: even after a month of trickle charge the charging light hasn&#x27;t stopped blinking.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the original Oral-B we used for years.  Everything is good about the new one except for one thing.  The brush stops for a second or two sometimes while brushing even though it is fully charged.  It seems that at some point of pressure agaist your teeth, the motor becomes overpowered and interrupts the brushing process.  We didn&#x27;t have this problem with the original unit.</li>
            <li> This is my fist, so I have little to compare it to except my wife&#x27;s.  This one is great for me -- I prefer the rotating head compared to her vibrating-type.  The storage container that comes attached is removable, which I&#x27;m thankful for because who needs to have all the replacement head-holders (empty most of the time) out for all to see?  While it was on, it seemed a little loose compared to the firm base that the toothbrush actually goes onto.  My only other gripe is that it gets messy -- I thought I was a pretty clean brusher, and I&#x27;m sure this is a problem for most toothbrushes (electric or not), but this one seems to get particularly dirty looking due to the dark material used, and gunky at the base.  Hope that&#x27;s not too nasty -- the product is great, I just need to wipe it before replacing.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one I would recommend it. The monitor for time is great and the preasure sensor helps to. Great buy.</li>
            <li> A definite upgrade from manual brushing</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get used to this but once you get the hang of it you notice the difference in how clean your teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I had an older Oral-B, I think it was the 5500 or 5000, which I liked. I had it for 12 years. When it no longer would charge I wanted to replace it with the same thing. I couldn&#x27;t find one so I purchased the 3000. This is even better than the first. It has excellent features.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my fiancé for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the features of this electric toothbrush over another brand a friend recommended.  The heads (brushes) are easier to install and less expensive to buy.  So the use it will be less expensive in the long run.  Better yet, at my last cleaning the dental hygienest says my teeth and gums are looking better and healthier.</li>
            <li> This would have been a five star rating if the product held a charge.  I&#x27;ve had this about a year and a half and have to charge it every fourth use.  It stops running before the &amp;#34;charge light&amp;#34; flashes so there&#x27;s no warning.  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> Great product,  and very happy with it.  Toothbrush is lightweight, and fits comfortably in your hand.  My dentist recommended this model for me.  This item has three different speeds, a red pressure sensor light, which will let you know if you are using too much pressure, and comes with a thirty second timer that pauses the brush briefly for each quadrant of your mouth.  You also have the option of using six different brush heads.  Appears to be very well made.  Item comes with a small stand alone base, with a removable larger base that holds an additional four brush heads.  I use the small stand alone base, as it takes up less space on the counter.  Another great plus was that I was able to purchase this item much cheaper from Amazon than from my dentist.  I prefer this brush over previous electric brushes I had over the years. The brush heads definitely leave my teeth cleaner than other brands i used.  I consider this item to a great buy.</li>
            <li> Had an Oral B before and when it died replaced it with this one. The red light for too much pressure is a feature I can live without but it is a reliable toothbrush</li>
            <li> The disadvantage is that noise, pushing prompted some impact brushing comfort</li>
            <li> Excellent electric brush. Quite expensive though. The biggest downside is the time it takes to recharge the battery: around 1 day. On the other hand it really offers what it advises and is sooo much better than regular brushes.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this tooth brush. I had the cheapo Oral B for a number of years, and it finally gave out. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I got this one. Very happy with the brushing action.</li>
            <li> I owned a sonic care toothbrush before purchasing this Oral-B brush, and I liked my moderate priced sonic care better than this product. I&#x27;m disappointed with the toothbrush head options. I don&#x27;t feel the round brush gets into between the teeth and removes the plaque like my sonic. I bought a mutli-function heads from a discount store for Oral-B brushes and still not satified with the cleaning. I actually had more plaque on my teeth for my teeth cleaning and caused my dental hygentist to spend more time cleaning my teeth than in years past. I feel like I need to buy a water pik to compensate for this toothbrush&#x27;s poor design and function. My teeth are not clean as I would like them to be. Do not recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and performs as described.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> My third oral B in 12 years and love the new features</li>
            <li> I do not care for the design of the Oral B brush.  All the tooth paste settles in handle and the button to turn on/off is very difficult.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight than my previous oral B. A plus. I also like the red light if too much pressure is applied. Otherwise, the brushes do the same great job. I only wish there was a way to replace the batteries for longer life.  I tried a battery store! ( I think each of the three I&#x27;ve had last 2 yrs).</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner! The buzz every 30 seconds is also a nice feature. It encourages you to brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush as a replacement to my previous Oral B electric toothbrush. This one doesn&#x27;t have an LCD screen but it seems to be as powerful as my last more expensive model. Hopefully it lasts 9 years like the last one!</li>
            <li> Deep cleans. Reminds me not to brush my gums too hard. Reaches the areas that I usually don&#x27;t reach. Seems longer than the old Oral-B I had but it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just thinner diameter wise. Great buy when paired with the polishing brush head</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Phillips electric toothbrush but had to give it up because it rattled my brains!  I kept thinking, this can&#x27;t be good!  But for various reasons, I decided lately to try the Oral-B and it is much quieter and kinder to my teeth and head.  Must be the difference in the motions between the two systems.  At any rate, I installed the Oral-B sensitive brushes and now have a system that cleans my teeth well without harshness.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a fine job of cleaning  teeth.  It vibrates every 30 seconds and at 2 minutes, longer vibration.  Its now easy to brush teeth for that period of time.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professiona is as good or better than the Oral-B I had for 8 Years</li>
            <li> Had an older version that I loved and this one will be easier to keep clean.  If you don&#x27;t own one try it.</li>
            <li> saw oral b pro 2000 at costco for $88 and it had two bases and two handles.  I missed a better deal.</li>
            <li> I previously owned an Oral B electric Tooth brush.  Loved it and after several years it would no longer hold a charge.  I thought that I did enough research to get a new one, and did.  The pro 3000 is fine except that the on off button is so small that its difficult to find and also to stop without going through several hits to turn off.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use. Its light and very convenient and an improved design.</li>
            <li> works great....teeth feel really cleaN</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and my god I have been missing out on clean teeth. The first time I used this toothbrush, I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt. I had always had a problem reaching the teeth in the back and was worried about developing a cavity. I bought this toothbrush knowing that I could reach the back of my teeth. Now, I can easily reach the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I really like most about this brush is the timer. There are 30 second intervals that the brush times you in. One for the left top portion, right top portion, left bottom portion, and right bottom portion of your mouth. This results in a good 2 minutes of cleaning when I had been lazily doing about 30-45 seconds of teeth brushing with a standard brush. I am grateful for this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a nice charging stand with a container for extra brush heads. The charging stand is great, don&#x27;t have to plug anything in... you just stand the brush up on the stand and it starts charging. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup was quite easy, just attach the brush head with one click, charge the toothbrush and you&#x27;re good to go in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is a red indicator light on the back of the brush that lets you know if you are brushing too hard. This was clearly an issue for me because the first time I used this brush, it was telling me I was brushing way too hard to begin with. This was good to know and I have now adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this 5/5 stars. This brush has changed how I clean my mouth and actually makes me WANT to go brush my teeth everyday. A great investment if you ask me!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works wonderfully, however there are several small differences I noticed that differ from the packaging and other materials. Mine does not beep every 30 seconds to indicate brushing a new section, it vibrates slower to tell you to change sections. Also mine will not stay green for a steady 5 seconds to say it is fully charged. It will just blink green continuously. I have let it charge for over a day and it still does that. Other than those 2 nuisances, it works flawlessly and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Lasts 10 days before you need to charge it again. Leave teeth feeling super clean. Love the 2 min timer for consistent brushing. Love the holder</li>
            <li> After about a year, the toothbrush stopped holding a charge.  It does not charge all the way and then quickly drops to about 40% charge. It doesn&#x27;t matter how long it&#x27;s left on the charger.  Like a lot of stuff sold on Amazon, I&#x27;m wondering if this is a counterfeit item.</li>
            <li> Oral-B does it again.  This brush configuration has been popular for years and does a fantastic job as a rechargeable.  As a dental hygienist, I recommend Oral-B brushes regularly. Just remember to not press with the brush too hard so it can do its job effectively.</li>
            <li> Use to have a sonic care, but died on me.  I like the round head brush, easier to use and brush all my teeth, since my mouth is small.  Teeth feels dentist clean afterwards.  I switch to the sensitive brush heads instead, the regular one a bit too rough.</li>
            <li> Went from an older model sonicare to this after some research.  This seems to be the model to get since all of the models that are more expensive than this have features that seem extremely pointless to me.  In fact, the fact that this toothbrush even has multiple &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; or a brief pause every 30 seconds seems pointless as well, but not enough to subtract from the fact this toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth, and is less prone to mold growth than my old sonicare was.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of electric toothbrush from Oral B/Braun. Always happy with them though for current purchase I wish Amazon could state clearly on the product voltage required. Deducted 1 star due to the voltage issue.  Not Oral B/Braun&#x27;s fault but I had to buy a transformer due to the voltage difference.</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for an older toothbrush.  I love the adjustable levels of power.  The variety of brushes to choose are great and they fit on any model.  Even better.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! would recommend to friends/family and would most defintely order again!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes since the 90&#x27;s.  Each one has had a shorter battery life than the one I had before.  The first one held a charge for two weeks when it was new.  I got this one to replace a 3 year old one because I had to charge the old one every other day. When that one was new it went up to ten days.  I charged this one fully, 16+ hours, and it gave me four days of brushing, then the red light came on, and I had to charge it another 16+ hours.  I decided to charge it every two days, so I wouldn&#x27;t have the annoying flashing green light lighting up the bathroom all night.  Unfortunately, even with only two days use, it hadn&#x27;t finished recharging when I went to bed, after 13 + hours on the charger.  I have to wonder why they stopped using the old system with no light, just a charging indicator, given that they have put such short lived batteries in the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this two stars instead of one because it still seems to clean as well as the older versions.</li>
            <li> I used this brush for two months before I went to a scheduled dentist check up. Had my first clean bill of health in ages. Normally I&#x27;m scared to go cuz they always bitch at me about my gums or tartar build up. This time all I got was &amp;#34;looks great, keep it up whatever you&#x27;re doing!&amp;#34;  Kind of anti climactic if you ask me.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW: I stopped using this brush recently after having it for over a year. It&#x27;s still going strong, maybe too strong. My teeth and gums had started having pain up into the roots requiring trips to the dentist. There came a point when I couldn&#x27;t use the toothbrush because it  hurt so bad. I went and bought a regular, old fashioned, toothbrush so I could monitor how hard I brushed. It&#x27;s been about 3-4 weeks now and the pain has disappeared. When I first received this brush I thought &amp;#34;this thing is just too powerful&amp;#34;. Well I was right. I&#x27;ve had quite a few Oral-B electric toothbrushes so I&#x27;m familiar with them and this one seemed different than the others from the start. I&#x27;ll be looking for something new now.   Ive only had it a couple weeks so time will tell. I was looking for a unit with a smaller diameter handle. My daughter has had the same one for about 5 years and hers is still going strong. It comes with 1 brush head, plug-in charging base, brush holder for several brushes which you can opt not to use if you have limited space and a manual. It has 3 speeds which is nice, so far it&#x27;s super fast on all of them. The pressure indicator light seems too sensitive and flashes even when I&#x27;m just gliding the brush over my teeth/gums. It was annoying at first but I&#x27;ve already learned to ignore it. It&#x27;s a bit loud compared to my old Oral B but sounds about like all the brushes we have. The manual says it holds a charge for 7 days under normal 2X a day brushing. I charged it fully, unplugged it on a Friday and it ran out of juice the following Friday. My old brush slowed down when it needed charging but this one gave no indication that it was running out of charge. The charging unit itself is small and takes up very little space if you don&#x27;t use the multi-brush head holder.  So far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend this one. The big negative for this one is the price but I my research found that all electric toothbrushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Still not entirely sure why these devices have not moved on to using lithium poly (have they? No indication of the power source in the description) and i wish you could just put a new battery in the item after a year rather then have to waste an entire unit when the battery runs low...  performs well at the time, until it&#x27;s predetermined obsolescence via battery kicks in.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE ORAL-B BRUSH! I never knew it existed until my Sonicare failed FOR THE THIRD TIME in 6 years. I finally did some research and discovered the Oral-B brush and didn&#x27;t hesitate to make the switch. I have only used it for a week now, but I notice a huge difference. It is very powerful and feels great. I honestly feel that my teeth are cleaner after brushing compared to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is all the interchangeable heads. There&#x27;s about 8 heads and I have ordered three - the floss action, polisher, and dual brush. I have only used the dual brush but it feels great on my teeth and does a great job cleaning them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this lasts longer than the Sonicare brush (which dies &amp;#60; 2 years). I have registered my toothbrush with Braun and have saved my receipt since there is a 2 year Manufacturer warranty --- EVERYONE WHO ORDERS SHOULD DO THE SAME! These brushes die out after about a year and half of use... I hope the Oral-B will be different though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing - The price is great! Cheaper than the Sonicare and better so far. Highly recom​mended!</li>
            <li> Replaceable battery would be nice, else it&#x27;s perfect. Love the small base. My base for my old Oral-B was rated for 1.9W, new one is 0.9W, not sure if that means it charges slower or if I can use my old base with my new brush (and vice-versa)</li>
            <li> Great brush, removed all the green from my teeth!</li>
            <li> Had a sonicare for a few years. Glad to be back with Oral B</li>
            <li> This is good but the speed is a little faster than I would prefer. Also, it stops frequently for a second or two, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> My twenty year old Oral-B rechargeable was beginning to show signs of its age. The replaceable heads would wobble ever so slighty, so I decide it was time to buy a new one. After looking at all the different models, I purchased the 3000. Wow! What a difference time makes. The head oscillates and pulsates much faster than on the 20 year old one. My teeth feel even cleaner than previously. Plus, it has 3 speeds: regular, sensitive, and whitening. Also, if you are using to much pressure, a red light comes on to let you know. And if it is as reliable as the last one, then kudos to Braun and Oral-B for continuing to make a great product.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable! The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  I switch the brush out every 3 months or so.  I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this. a small amount of toothpaste does a great job. do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me to get an electric toothbrush. After much research, I decided upon this model and I am very happy with it. It cleans very effectively and is well made. A high quality product.</li>
            <li> Works great! Cleans and polished teeth. Only down side is that there is so much action going on, it&#x27;s hard to keep all of the toothpaste in your mouth. Especially when working on the fronts.</li>
            <li> I love this and so does my hygienist, it makes her job a snap.</li>
            <li> Content with purchase.</li>
            <li> I was using a Vitality. This is a billion times better. What was I thinking? This isn&#x27;t a tootbrush... it&#x27;s something else.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very good product.  My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  My only complaint is that the button to start it is harder to push than on the Oral-B Professional Care 7500 I had in 2006, but I suppose that is due to the additional cleaning modes on the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first oral-b. I really feel good when I use it. But the problem which alway confused me is that it takes too much time (almost 20 hours)for charging.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than the Sonicare I had for 10+ years. It is like going to a dental hygienist. Great product and I really like the floss brushing heads I bought extra. My hygienist was really pleased and surprised that my teeth and gums were so healthy. No bleeding.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, item performs great!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I love the small spinning brush as opposed to the oscillating brush.  The spinning brush gets the job done better and gets into small areas.  The red light tells me when I press too hard and the three different speeds covers all types of cleaning requirements.  It&#x27;s worth spending the extra bucks for this model, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These electric tooth brush head work very well. Ever my dentist is impressed. The price and product are good.</li>
            <li> Had this for awhile, but starting to notice that it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long anymore, sometimes barely runs long enough to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Bought this when I was told to get an electric tooth brush by my periodontist.  Would have loved if they packed the Power Sensitive brush but I ended up purchasing a 3 pack of them.  The 3 operating modes are all good and I end up with the middle selection, which I believe is for sensitive teeth and gums.  I charge every week because there are 2 of us using it.  I thought there was no use buying the most expensive one and this model works just fine for us.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  This is the 2nd one I have purchased and I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Wonderful way to brush your teeth.  Easy to recharge. Very easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a electric toothbrush before this. I have been using mine for. Few weeks now and I absolutely love how clean my mouth feels after each use.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> good price, i use it daily. very good quality</li>
            <li> Oral B PRO 3000 with soft, gentle bristles allows a thorough teeth cleanse over sensitive gums. I use auromère&#x27;s aryuvedic herbal toothpaste, followed by auromère&#x27;s neem &amp; peelu herbal mouthwash. This combination couldn&#x27;t be smoother, nor more efficient. This beats a toothbrush any day 😃 It&#x27;s easy, clean, efficient - just a breeze!</li>
            <li> My teeth health has improved quite a bit since I started using this. Oral-B was recommended by my dentist. Works well and is great when you&#x27;re going to replace your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works great and holds the charge like stated</li>
            <li> I love this!  My hygienist recommended it to me.  It&#x27;s strong and cleans my teeth really well.  It is rechargable which is great!  It lasts for several days before I have to recharge it.  I am glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have had the Oral B 3000 for about two weeks.  It has performed as they stated.  Make sure you read the descriptions and features the Oral B 3000 has.  My teeth appear to be whiter and they feel cleaner.  The smaller head makes it easier to clean my back teeth.  The price seems high for the unit, however, they are offering a $10.00 gift card for a limited time. You also get a coupon for $7.00.  When this unit needs replaced I would buy another unless something happens before the warranty runs out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a mechanical toothbrush look no further than this product.  Have had excellent results! Will continue to recommend to friends and coworkers.</li>
            <li> I don t have a lot to say about it. I have tried 2 more electric toothbrushes without liking them enough for various reasons. This is a cool and interesting toothbrush with an electronic face that motivates you to finish brushing until it smiles :) And obviously it cleans the mouth very well, as any toothbrush of this price would do.&lt;br /&gt;It s a cool product, you ll love it :)</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is just great. I knew it would be. However, Maybe it won&#x27;t matter to you but it did to me. P&amp;G rebates, like most nowadays, come in the form of a debit style card. The big difference here is that you can&#x27;t get CASH for the card at your bank or any ATM, and if you want to use it for gas then you have to go out of your way and go into the gas station stand in line and wait to have the attendant punch in the information on the card manually(very inconvenient). In essence they are holding your money hostage with regards to exactly how they will allow you to spend it. I&#x27;m quite certain it is for tracking purposes so they can then figure out what you spent it on in the desire to see what new spam and unsolicited junk mail they can start sending you.If it matters to you, in the future try to find out how and by what rules will be put in place when you get \\&quot;YOUR\\&quot; money sent back to you. In the end I would rather just pay the extra and do away with the damn rebate system all together. I know nothing will change. The companies are too big and care to little about the people that buy their products or how they inconvenience them. Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> My dad is a dentist and for years recommended that I get an electric toothbrush. I never actually got one until a few weeks ago.  Finally after months of feeling sorry for myself as my gums receded I got this toothbrush. I&#x27;m very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 30 second quadrant timing feature.  My mouth feels better, cleaner and my gums have stopped being so sensitive. I should have gotten this toothbrush years ago!</li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush for years and when my old model died I purchased this. It is great much easier to charge and keep clean.</li>
            <li> Powerfull &amp; easy to use.  Worth the cost.  Had a lesser model from Oral B which just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected. Perfect.</li>
            <li> My wife dropped her previous one and it was an easy decision to replace it.  She loved the new unit and still has it today after 2 years.</li>
            <li> The battery on our old Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush no longer held a charge so we purchased the Oral-B Professional Precision 3000 Rechargeable as a replacement.  We always liked our old Oral-B toothbrush but like the new model better because of the pulses that occur every 30 seconds.  Some reviewers said that it was hard to notice the pulses.  However, we have not found this to be a problem as the pulses are very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model also has a light to indicate if you are pushing too hard.  This is a good improvement since most people think brushing harder is better (but it is not).</li>
            <li> My old one had reached the point it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  It was time to get a new one.  I was pleased with the old one (for five to six years) so I knew I would be pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I was toldby my dentist to use this brush to improve my dental hygene.  So I bought it.</li>
            <li> Selected this product after reading reviews and comparing the different models of the Oral B brushes.  This one is truly giving the biggest bang for the buck.  It has a great compact size, while still providing a good handle that feels substantial in your hand.  Totally recommend to anyone considering purchasing a new or replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought the Precision 3000 when my previous Oral-B died after about six years. This model has not lived up. I&#x27;ve had it just over a year It barely makes it five days without a charge which makes it useless to travel with. The battery indicator light only blinks AFTER the battery dies (not very helpful, I know the battery is dead when it stops brushing halfway through the cycle...!) I won&#x27;t buy it again and can&#x27;t wait for it to completely die so I can get a better model.</li>
            <li> wasnt sure about the oral b.....but i am happy i made the switch. brush head is much easier to reach back of my mouth. perfect for getting around teeth, even lets you know when to swith sides with audible/vibration change up. my teeth feel just like the dentist cleaned them.</li>
            <li> Like others, I did a lot of reading on buying my first elec toothbrush. I wanted a Sonic one (Phillips) but was reading the lower end (affordable) ones had issues w/ &#x27;gunk&#x27; collecting in the handle and head, so, ended up purchasing Oral B.  Now, the Pro 3000 operates at &amp;#34; 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations per minute&amp;#34;, do some reading and you&#x27;ll see that any Oral B brush below the Pro 3000 level has 20,000 pulsations per minute. Yea, maybe not a big deal, but.....it was to me. Read more on the Oral B site.  Now this has the &#x27;Quad Timer&#x27; - I heard this referenced in all my reading and it wasn&#x27;t 100% clear till I used the toothbrush.  Every 30 seconds the toothbrush motor revs up and then down a little telling you that you&#x27;ve brushed that area for the required 30 seconds and you can move onto the other quadrants of your mouth (a little brochure that comes w/ the toothbrush shows the quadrants in a picture).  I&#x27;m finding this invaluable and I&#x27;m guessing for little kids (and us adults) this is almost a mandatory quality to have on a brush. Many Sonic ones I was looking at did not have this feature.  This also has a red led light that lights up if you are brushing too hard - again, very valuable. I recall in high school my dentist telling me I was brushing too hard and its not good for your gums. Light is very easy to see as it lights up.  I&#x27;ve used this for a few days and am very impressed w/ its operation so far.  Will post updates later if anything changes.  Edit to add: Amazon had a $20 off coupon for this in July 2015, so final cost was $60.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, with 30 second timers to help me move along from side to side.</li>
            <li> Purchsed the new brush that was not in current packaging.  Found it to be exactly the same produce but was able to pay a much lower price.</li>
            <li> My son  gets stains on his teeth easily.  It is amazing how the Oral-B brush removes the stains and whitens his smile.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush and will never go back to standard brushing by hand.  I have noticed a very big difference but the battery seems to lose some juice after a while.  Even though I leave it in the charger, its not as strong as when i first got it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this toothbrush to arrive.  I started out using the Vitality model through recommendation of my dental hygienist and I fell in love. For an economical price, you can start using a much more powerful toothbrush than manual brushing and it is better clean for your teeth.  One thing, it does take a little bit of adjustment on your gums when switching from manual to a powered toothbrush, so I&#x27;d start out slow with the Vitality, then work your way up to this beauty. I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for two days and with charging, I&#x27;ve only been able to use it twice. The much faster speed is extremely noticeable and feels very weird on my slightly sensitive front teeth, but I hope this is just another adjustment. I haven&#x27;t yet been able to test this toothbrush&#x27;s charge since it is advertised to last 7 days, but hope to take it traveling soon. My vitality is 2 years old and the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long at all anymore, but it has never died completely. The charger is much slimmer than that of my vitality (the brush holder is detachable.)</li>
            <li> OK, so seeing that it is made in Germany explained the very high build quality of this product. I have owned many electronic toothbrushes and none compare. I can brush my sons teeth in under 30 seconds and still do a superb job. The feeling I get by brushing mine is like having my teeth cleaned. I didn&#x27;t believe that a tiny head could do such a great job. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cheaper toothbrushes and they just don&#x27;t compare.  I love my teeth and want to retain them so am happy to pay a little more for Oral-B.  I am a repeat customer.  I love the light warning when I am brushing to hard as it reminds me to brush correctly.  I thought that was an unnecessary item as I was reading the description.  :)  Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Beware that this product is 110v only , not the usual universal 100- 240v. Disappointing  fortunately used old base I had.</li>
            <li> Compared side by side vs [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that both models are exceptionally good.  The difference depends in what you are looking for in an electric toothbrush.  The main difference would really be personal preference.  I will reveal my choice at the end of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First difference: the oscillation of Oral B vs the vibration of the Sonicare.  Dentists are split on these.  Most will recommend whatever they conveniently have on hand to sell at full retail price while they have you captive in the chair.  Oscillating heads tend to be better for gums, vibrating heads are all around good.  If you have sensitive gums, then the oscillating head will probably be the best choice.  Especially if the brush has speed settings.  Also it seems that the oscillating heads are better at cleaning teeth while the sonic vibrating seems to polish and lighten better.  These are marginal though, just a slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;*Tie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus with the Oral B is the three speed setting.  You can put a slower setting on to hit gums with a gentler oscillation.  There is also a &#x27;whitening&#x27; setting, which polished the tooth more, but is a bit aggressive on gums.  Having the ability to select a speed setting is really a plus.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Oral B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B has one of my favorite features, a sensitivity warning.  Granted, this is a light up function, so you need to be brushing in front of a mirror to really get a good view of it.  But this is a feature to tell you when you are applying too much pressure, which is oddly enough, a common mistake by most folks.  The Sonicare model in this comparison does not have a sensitivity warning feature.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Oral B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare has a quadrant &#x27;pause&#x27; feature to let you know when you have sufficiently brushed one corner of your mouth.  It is a 30 second timer.  There is also a two minute timer which shuts off the brush when you should have sufficiently brushed.  But if you are like me, you often go over the two minutes, so I would usually turn the brush back on and hit my tongue and a quick once over the gums again.  It&#x27;s not an important feature unless you tend to hurry through your brushing.  But it&#x27;s nice to have something to tell you when you&#x27;ve passed the recommended minimum brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement brush heads are a pain.  Amazon does have the subscribe and save, so you don&#x27;t have to remember.  But both brushes have the blue indicator.  I typically go about a month or so between heads.  Depending on the model you have, the replacement costs are similar.  The Oral B costs $20 for 3 replacement heads (Amazon.com at time of writing).  The Sonicare goes for $35 for 2 standard (old models), $25 for 3 compact (newer models) at time of writing.  The Sonicare in this comparison has the compact heads.  Though cost might fluctuate.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Oral B (slightly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanliness of actual unit is important.  Both of these models are fairly neat.  The older Sonicare brushes had a terrible design where mold would form under the brush head area in the cavity where the magnet is.  It was a pain to clean and would require a Q-tip most of the time.  I would even disassemble and air dry the unit periodically with little result.  Luckily both of these units have a more water tight design and don&#x27;t seem to have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Tie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Counter space is important, and surprisingly the Oral B wins.  It appears to have a bigger base, but you can take the round portion off and just use that on the counter.  The Sonicare just has the one stand, which is compact, but without the ability to expand to a larger whole brushing area if you want.  The bigger base of the Oral B is for holding spare brush heads.  The Sonicare has a separate container for those.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Oral B(slightly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great for both units.  I only plug them in once every other week or so.  Both have an indicator to tell you when battery is getting low.  They both also light up when actively charging, and dim when charging is complete.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Tie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is really the only difference.  Since these units are built to last for many years (my previous Sonicare lasted 4+ years).  I am not sure of the longevity of the new models, but I trust both brands in that respect.  But the Oral B is currently $20 higher.  But if you look at some of the extra features, such as the three speed setting and the sensitivity warning, then the price might be justifiable.&lt;br /&gt;*Advantage: Tie (higher price Oral B with more features, great value for Sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I stuck with the Oral B.  I really do like the speed settings and the oscillation feels like it is really cleaning around my teeth and getting in the grooves nicely.  My gums have seemed healthier since switching as well.  If you look at the cost over time, a rechargeable toothbrush makes a lot of sense.  They are far superior to manual brushes in every regard.  The only drawback is price.  Even replacement heads are more than most manual toothbrushes.  But dentists seem to all say that an electric toothbrush is far better than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are investing in a model for the long haul, I think the Oral B might have the edge, though slightly.  I would really say these are both 5 star models in the end.  Personal preference will determine in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;$96&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Oscillating round head&lt;br /&gt;Speed settings&lt;br /&gt;Pressure warning&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Compact charging stand with optional larger base incl.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;More expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;$77&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sonic vibrating head&lt;br /&gt;QUadrant timer and 2 minute finish timer&lt;br /&gt;Compact charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Value price vs other high end models&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No speed selection&lt;br /&gt;No pressure warning(slightly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great for both units.

            <li> with less than a year of use the bottom of the toothbrush [where the toothbrush sits on the charger] completely came off. and it was impossible to charge the toothbrush or use it. couldn&#x27;t glue it back on because the piece rotted.</li>
            <li> Cleans much better than my older Oral-B 3D Excel, which I now use as my portable/vacation toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the upgrade</li>
            <li> My dentist and periodondist recommended an electric toothbrush. This brand was recommended by a family member who has used it for several years and told me that every time she gets her teeth cleaned at her dentist&#x27;s office they comment on what a good job she does at home. Brushing with this is basically the only thing she does, so it must be doing a fantastic job and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth feel a lot cleaner. My professionals told me I had been missing places with a regular tooth brush. It&#x27;s a smart investment in your oral health.</li>
            <li> 1. The description of the product warns about the limited battery capacity. You have to keep it on the charger the whole time you are not using it. If you take a trip, bring the charging base along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The charger is very slow. One hour of charging will produce half a minute of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining the two above, if you stay only overnight in a motel you may not get enough charging time. At home these problems will not occur and bother you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush and i really liked it. Timer is and pressure indicator are quite useful. Not heavy and convinient in hand.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you should consider buying abroad electric stuff is the the voltage of the charger. In my case (Russia) I had to look for the lowing adapter and happily found it.</li>
            <li> Great electronic toothbrush, works quite well and is able to really give a deep clean when compared to a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Downside is the charging time, it does take quite awhile to charge this brush, longer than 12 hours which does seem strange. Anything less seems to only last for 6 or so brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Had to get the senstive teeth heads which are different from the piece that comes with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other point to note, the power rating for the charger is 110-130v , 50-60hz .</li>
            <li> The brush has been a bit of a disappointment mostly related to its battery life.  The cleaning it gives me is fine but I&#x27;m lucky if I get 8-10 minutes out of the battery before it needs to be recharged and that normally takes about 18 hours.  This lack of battery life and glacially slow recharging speed is completely unacceptable and I have not had this problem with any of my previous Oral-B brushes a brand I have been using for 20 years.</li>
            <li> Very good brush, light in weight but working well.</li>
            <li> It has only been just over a month that I bought this toothbrush but I love it. So far I have no problems with it and it works great. Feels like I just came from the dentist whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my worn out one.  I will purchase the same thing again, when I need to!</li>
            <li> I spent the past 3 years with a sonicare toothbrush but the unit died on me, and I wanted to get something a little cheaper this time.  I settled on the Oral-B Professional 3000 series.  I read the instructions and it walked through how to know when the unit is charged or not.  It took almost 48 hours on the charger for the green light to stop blinking when I first got it out of the packaging.  It gives me 3, 2 minute brushing and it&#x27;s already blinking red for a recharge.  It took over 24 hours to charge, and it only worked for another 3 brushings before needing a charge again.  How does that equate to 7 days of normal (2 brushings per day) use?  I&#x27;m going to try to return this model because I don&#x27;t trust the battery to last very long if it&#x27;s already this dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on May 19, 2014.  I called customer service a few weeks back regarding my charging issues and they initiated a warranty maintenance request.  They told me send everything back except the brush head i&#x27;ve been using.  I did have to pay for one way shipping to their facility in Mass but they had the product back to me within a week.  They didn&#x27;t disclose what was wrong - looked like I had a new power charger in the box however.  Since then I have been getting a bout a 7-8 day stent of time off the charger before it needs to be charged.  Long term durability is still up in the air.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Highly recommend.  Was in the dental field over 20 yrs.  This is the only product we wanted our patients to use.</li>
            <li> The power of the brushing goes away after 3 or 4 times of brushing. I would recommend getting a better model</li>
            <li> Overall good product that lives up to the hype as it does exactly what the advertiser and manufacturer says it does. The item was delivered on time and it works very well so far - no complaints at all! However, I got only one brush head with the tbrush. I purchased the same item in Europe and Asia and got more as well as a variety of replacement brush heads in the package for the same item Oral b 3000. I would buy one of these for all of my friends as gifts, but I cant afford. So I will just HIGHLY recommend it to all of them and everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever, and prevents gum disease;&lt;br /&gt;keep it charged it, and change the head frequently. I gave one to everyone in my family</li>
            <li> this is the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> i like the toothbrush. but our last oral b toothbrush came with two toothbrushes, and a travel case. this one is an awesome toothbrush, but it&#x27;s just the toothbrush and stand. nothing else.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush, definitely worth it. I don&#x27;t know how other electric toothbrushes compare, but I would suggest an electric toothbrush for anyone.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product. Everything works as it should. Not much more to say really!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Oral-B products are reliable and have great products for a healthy mouth!</li>
            <li> Should have bought one years ago!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Seems like it&#x27;s even better than the last Oral-B I had that lasted many years.</li>
            <li> Works well.  No problems.  It has multiple settings.  I prefer the slower setting, but my husband likes the higher one.  If you like the slower setting and don&#x27;t need the stronger one, I would suggest getting the 1000 model, which we also have and it is less $.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Almost seems too fast at first, but you get used to it.  The lights tell you how hard to push so you can brush properly.  I like that you can keep it plugged in without damaging the battery (at least that&#x27;s what it says).  Seems well made and looks attractive.</li>
            <li> Messy, messy, messy.  This toothbrush does work well at getting your teeth clean, but you end up with a slimy mess of saliva and toothpaste covering your hand and brush.  Because you have to maneuver the brush all around, it is impossible to keep you mouth shut while you brush, and this does not create the kind of foam which usually stays in your mouth while you brush.  During the 2 minutes of brushing, my saliva slowly drips from my mouth down the brush onto my hands creating a sloppy mess.  I have to clean everything thoroughly before putting it back on it&#x27;s stand.  Even then, after a few days, the holder of the brushes builds a green (or blue or white depending on your paste) pool.  After a week, I have to clean this too.  Even my cleaning lady refused to clean this part of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth does feel pretty clean after each brushing, but the mess that is created outside is something less desirable.</li>
            <li> This was one recommeneded by our dentist.  The pressure sensitive indicator makes sure you brush with just the right amount of pressure!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush  - love the timer which reminds you to move to the next section of teeth. Also love the warning light if you press too hard.  Nicely design product for those with sensitive teeth. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used! My teeth feel squeaky clean. I can&#x27;t wait to hear what my dentist says when she calls numbers next time. It divides your teeth into 4 quadrants in your mouth. You brush one quadrant until brush does a little studder then move to next one. I realized I&#x27;ve only been brushing my entire mouth the time this brush has me do one quadrant.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a product.  First, let me say that I never really liked the idea of an electric toothbrush.  I thought I was just fine with my regularl one.  After just a few uses, I am blown away by how much cleaner my mouth and teeth feel.  This is a huge upgrade and a high quality product.  No need to buy the ones that have bluetooth capabilty, the Oral-B PRO 3000 is just right.</li>
            <li> New Oral B works fantastic, this was replacements for our old Oral B brushes we&#x27;ve been usin for bout 12 years &amp; they were beginning to slow down a lil.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it arrived as it had an American plug which meant I had to buy an adapter as I live in Australia. So far it has worked well, you do have to recharge as soon as the lights come on I learnt this the hard way.</li>
            <li> I have owned many Braun electric toothbrushes and a few from other brands. This is by far the best. It is fast and my teeth feels really clean. I was deciding between 3000 and 5000. I am glad I chose the 3000. I think the extra functions in the 5000 are nothing more than gimmicks.[[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I just wish the battery would last a bit longer and didn&#x27;t take so long to charge.  Otherwise, my teeth thank me every morning and evening when I brush with this.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargable from Braun many years ago until after a second battery replacement finally wore out the handle. I went to using one with replacable 2AA batteries and wore that out in 3 years. Then tried a new replaceable 2AA batteries but it was to sensitive in settings and gave it up but will use it for travel. This new 3000 it great and very powerful with being sensitive as well.</li>
            <li> We had an Oral-B sonic before this. This one scrubs more and better. It&#x27;s nice to have the options of the different heads. We don&#x27;t have our preferences on the heads yet, but they all seem to do a great job. I thought that they light to tell you that you&#x27;re pushing too hard was a gimmick, but it turns out that is useful information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product and more people should buy it</li>
            <li> My teeth are sparkling clean after using this power brush. It has 3 modes for brushing (standard, light, alternate standard &amp; light). I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this.  I did my homework on the other electric toothbrush out there and on the battery operated ones.  This is the absolute best.  I decided that the 1000 was not enough and the 5000 had extra bells and whistles I really didn&#x27;t need.  I read other reviews and they did help.  This is perfect!!!  Works great.  Shipped fast.  Long lasting battery once charged.&lt;br /&gt;So so glad I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans wonderfully ... my teeth are thanking me for it.  My oral hygiene is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Replaced my older brush - works great and the &amp;#34;Brushing too hard&amp;#34; light is my favorite feature.  Nice and bright and reminds me not to brush so forecfully. Hulk SMASH tooth decay!  This is the best in the line of oral-b brushes looking at value per dollar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B since they came out and still happy with it after all these years.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT IT FOR MY WIFE WHEN HERS STOPPED WORKING AND SHE LIKES IT FINE.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action is excellent.  Does a really good job.</li>
            <li> Obviously a great product but after 70 years using a brush it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and basically everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a mouth full of crowns so my dentist wants me to constantly use a rotary brush. My last sonic brand brush died a slow and peaceful death so I tried this one as a replacement. I like what it does, but it is very noisy! The first few brushings I could feel my brains jiggling! (slight exaggeration, but it is a very powerful brush) My teeth feel as clean as they do after a trip to the dentist. I like the red light that comes on to warn you that you are pushing too hard. I also like the timer on it. For anyone that says time flies, use a timed toothbrush and two minutes will go by slower than you can imagine! (haha)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they offer this with a Ni-Ca battery, the type cell phones used to have 120 years ago. Old stuff, indeed. Very easy to damage the battery if you don&#x27;t manage the discharge/charge cycles correctly. The &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; offers Li-Ion and that is way better, no memory effect, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I got myself an Oral B. Wish I knew about the battery before buying.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good toothbrush that gets compromised by the battery technology Braun is using.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my old Oral-B since it gave up on me after many many years of good use. Love the Oral-B toothbrush. Cleas perfectly and my dentist is more than pleased. If you never had one before, get one. You will save a lot on dentist costs.....excellent brush.....</li>
            <li> Kind of loud but love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. So much better than manually brushing in circles. The little sucker has a lot of power beware. Overall a great dental aid.</li>
            <li> I had a Professional Care model (equivalent to the newer 1000 or 2000 according to the company) which ran perfectly for many years, until the battery started turning itself on and off in the middle of the night (while unplugged.)    I upgraded to the new 3000 model, which has an annoying warning when you are supposed to be done with each arch. Sure wish there were some way to turn it off. The major difference is the newer one has 3 settings and a light that supposedly shows when you are brushing too hard (have never seen it and my gums are ultra sensitive.) The pulsations are the same.    Also when the battery is supposedly ready for a charge a red light flashes. This was my first time recharging and after 14 hours it had still not finished, even though the battery was not dead when I plugged it in. I called Oral B and they said it can take up to 22 hours! That&#x27;s ridiculous, as the old model took just 8 hours, even when it was getting old. Talk about downgrading the technology. So the only practical option is to leave it on the plugged-in charger every night, then once every 6 months let the battery run out and fully recharge it. They assured me that this will not &#x27;condition&#x27; the battery to accept only a partial charge.    Another somewhat useful tip from the company: if you are in a hurry, you can count on a recharge time of one hour for every one minute of brush time needed.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It makes me want to brush my teeth all the time lol. I especially like that the brush will remind you by pulsing, when to change the quadrants of teeth your brushing so each section gets its equal time and gets you to at least 2 mins of brush time. I really like that with the multiple brush heads more than one person can use this brush.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  works as described.  my teeth feel SO MUCH cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to switch from manual to electric.  I haven&#x27;t tried other electric toothbrushes, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an older model.  I love it.  I read many of the reviews and disagree with some.  This toothbrush is quieter than the older model.  I have no trouble with the toothbrush stopping due to to much pressure.  I would suggest that it you have issues with this toothbrush stopping and lighting the red light, you are brush way too hard.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> Not as expected/described.</li>
            <li> Updated review (Feb 2016): Been using this for almost a year. Far inferior to a sonicare in my opinion. Battery life is terrible, it&#x27;s loud, the design causes the brush head to drip down the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works ok but the battery life seems pretty bad - I had a Philips that would last about 2 weeks on a single charge. This lasts about 3-4 days. Not a deal breaker but would have thought it would perform a little better than that.</li>
            <li> I think the 3000 model is the sweet spot of Oral-B Pro range. More expensive models have more bells and whistles and cost even more, well into a $100+ range, but this one does everything you might want from a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;While it is possible to brush properly with a manual toothbrush, it seems that vast majority of people brush wrongly when using it, using side-to-side motion. I rind that it is much easier to do a great job of brushing your teeth if you&#x27;re using a power brush like this one. Timer works great and, especially at the beginning, helps you to time yourself. I love the charger BTW: it has no metal contacts (some of older power brushes had them) &#x3D; no water risk.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I&#x27;ve discovered: pressure sensor behaves very differently for lower &amp; upper teeth. When brushing top teeth, it activates very easily (being forced down by gravity already) and that makes the red light go on all the time. But this is not really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush, have recommended to couple of friends already.</li>
            <li> Both items were great.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best ever.  Have owned cheaper electric toothbrushes which were fine so was skeptical when it came to spending so much for this brush.  I have to admit this brush is POWERFUL and does a great job of cleaning and removing stains (big tea drinker). My mouth feels great when done and 2min. sounds like a long time to brush but flies by; the hesitation modes tell you when to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth.  One charge lasts me around six days before I have to recharge.  Great brush; highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner now!  The yellowing around the gums of my teeth are going away.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> I have resisted buying a electric toothbrush and finally decided to get one.  I have nothing to compare it to, it works very well and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using power toothbrushes from Oral-B for years. This one is an excellent compromise between functions, speed and price. It will last a few years, and it is a great help with cleaning the teeth effectively. Just don&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; head. Too big, and will never replace flossing (essential for your gum health).</li>
            <li> This tells you timing to brush each 4 sections. So you can clean evenly. Its good enough for a week or more after you charged battery.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. It seems a little bit noisy, but not too bad. I bought this one because it has 3 different modes; normal, whitening and sensitive. The three modes are just a slight variation in speed and is overall a joke. If I had the chance to trade it for the next model down (the Oral-B 1000) I would. You want to turn the brush off before removing it from your mouth or else you will &#x27;fling&#x27; toothpaste saliva all over the sink. The problem with this one (the 3000) is that you have to hit the button THREE times for it to shut off. Being that the three modes are a complete joke, I would much rather have to hit the button only once to turn it off. It sounds trivial, but makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping this review from getting a five star is whatever Oral-B genius decided to make a thing that goes in your mouth have several little cavities for nasty post-brush toothpaste to get stuck in. The brush itself is a pain to clean, meaning I usually have to artfully display it behind other things when guests visit so they do not think I use a crusty brush to get my teeth clean on a regular basis. Outside of that, the brush performs solidly and I anticipate using it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush and think it works great, but I charge it a lot more often than I&#x27;d like to admit...</li>
            <li> I have used this product, different models in history, for over 10 years.  I have had one&lt;br /&gt;run it with the dentist in which I had to have work done other than two a year cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;This work was from a problem caused years and years ago.&lt;br /&gt;My gums &amp;#34;look great,&amp;#34; and after every time I use it, my teeth feel like they were cleaned&lt;br /&gt;at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Before this puppy, I had all sorts of problems with my teeth,&lt;br /&gt;including three surgeries, and bills to prove it.  One friend over used this product and had trouble until&lt;br /&gt;dentist put her straight.  Follow the directions, enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> Got good feedback from my dental office after using the product.  I bought this product after the Philips Sonicare Healthy White electric toothbrush stopping taking a charge after about two years.  I hope this unit will last longer.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each use these and love them.  I especially like how my teeth feel very clean and smooth after each use.  This purchase ended up going to my 8 year old son.  It was always a struggle to get him to clean his teeth properly with a regular toothbrush.  We tried the cheap spin brushes and that was better but now with this his teeth are typically clean on the first try.  The bristles are better, the head is smaller which is better for smaller mouths and it has a gentler setting which he initially used until getting used to the brush.  The built in timer and pressure indicator light are also excellent features.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare and was unsure of anything else but I am in love! The multiple settings are great. I have different different brush heads and switch it up. My teeth feel so clean. My gums used to be very sensitive and sometimes bleed from brushing and this has greatly improved my oral health. After 3 weeks of use I notice an improvement and my gums no longer bleed. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush. It&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for about 15-20 years.  This model does not disappoint.  I really like how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush.  It works great, and holds a charge very well.  I love the fact that I can rinse the entire handle with no damage.  The only drawback I can find, might be the cost of the brush heads.  Maybe I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li> if you want to better clean your teeth you should have this. of course you can do it manually but this device will save time and efford on the same process. my whife broke the wrist and i bought it to her to brush easier with the other hand. she can&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
            <li> I normally do not respond to reviews ,however this machine is the best thing since sliced bread. We&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for about 20 years and I would tell you this device is outstanding. It has the power to scrub thru the worst of scum, film and food particles. We recently returned from the state championship cook-off for pork ribs and as you may know the fine meat particles from the ribs always plant themselves between your choppers. This new pro 3000 dislodged every nook and cranny of pork residue and left my mouth squeaky clean and sparkly....  OK can I have my $50.00 now lol lol no joke It&#x27;s worth every dollar...................</li>
            <li> As described...  Dentist recommended and seem to be working well..  So far good durability as well</li>
            <li> great product. works very well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush far exceeded my expectations! It is great, especially for the price. I love the 2-3 speeds and the round bristles do a great job getting between teeth. It&#x27;s like a gum massage. I can already tell a big difference in my gum health. My mouth feels so clean when I use it. I highly recommend. Amazon price and shipping was GOOD!</li>
            <li> Design better than the previous Oral-B model that I had for almost 20 years! The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that the power button takes lot of pressure to shut off and slows down during the process before shutting off.</li>
            <li> There is hardly a better toothbrush out there. - My dentist</li>
            <li> Its fine and works as you would expect from the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my upper left wisdom tooth is almost fully erupted and I am trying to keep it super clean. I don&#x27;t want to get it removed (because it doesn&#x27;t cause me any pain), but wisdom teeth are harder to scrub in a tiny mouth without much room. This toothbrush is awesome. My teeth feel CLEANER than they do when I leave the dentist! It sounds gross, but I love to run my tongue over them because they are so incredibly smooth! I used to use a Philips Sonicare, but it just vibrates back and forth and my teeth never felt more clean than they did with a regular toothbrush. Since the head on this brush is a small and round it really gets into those hard to reach places (where moving back and forth is almost impossible) and it just whisks things away! It also feels like a nice massage on my gums. I will never go back to another toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I think Oral B dental products are the best on the market!</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is when it tells you when you&#x27;re pushing too hard. I&#x27;m not trying to brush the enamel off my teeth! lol! Great price. So far it&#x27;s been wonderful. Teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just, okay.  Needs to be recharged too often.  Liked the old Oral-B model better.  do - dee -do -da -ta.....</li>
            <li> Nice features and performs as designed.  Teeth feel clean and gums massaged.  Would recommend this product without reservation.  Priced fairly.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist - great results.</li>
            <li> Maybe the sound is a bit loud when I brush my teeth.But it&#x27;s OK,I love it!</li>
            <li> This unit failed less than three months after we bought it.  I have used other Oral B/Braun electric toothbrushes over the years and had no problems.  Evidently the new owners have sent quality control straight down the dumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This used to be a good unit.  No more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that the new charging base is much less convenient than the old design.  In particular, there is no way to store the unused extra cord in the base, as used to be possible.  So the extra cord dangles all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Bought this since my dentist recommended some type of electric toothbrush since I got braces. Did research and this works just fine. Some reviews say that the rear ridges get mold after time. Well I&#x27;ve been having mine for a while and if you wipe it down after every use then no problems.</li>
            <li> Works very well my only complaint is that it is hard to feel the on/off button to shut off when done brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this series for the last 8 years. It seem that they last for around 3-4 years, so for the money, I think they&#x27;re pretty great. The pressure light on this is kind of annoying to me, but it is making me think about pressure. I was probably brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush to replace my old one that died - and this is great. I honestly don&#x27;t use the different settings (not sure that they make a difference), so I could have bought the less expensive version, but would recommend this toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever had! Perfect for someone who still has their wisdom teeth because the small, round head fits back there easily!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time without damage, It works as promised.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband.  He had one before and wore it out.  He is liking this one also..</li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner and look brighter.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B and I have been very satisfied.  I especially like the red light that comes on telling me I&#x27;m brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> OK. It has been working well. However, we found the same product cheaper at Costco, which is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is an electric toothbrush and it works well. The only issue I kind of have is that the battery only lasts one week (but this is how long it says it will last on the box) while their older models last two weeks.</li>
            <li> I should have replaced my old one a year ago!  I love this brush, it feels and looks like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Oral B rechargeable toothbrush, my girlfriend&#x27;s Sonic died so I got this for her and she loves it. I got about 8+ years of use out of my previous rechargeable Oral B&#x27;s before they no longer hold a charge. I bought a battery operated model to compare but now just use it for travel. I only wish they were constructed to allow replacing the rechargeable battery. I&#x27;m sure they could devise a way to keep it waterproof after replacing it, but then they couldn&#x27;t sell you new one&#x27;s! Initially I thought the pressure warning and multiple cleaning options were overkill, but after using it they are nice features to have.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush and will get the replacement heads like the one it comes with.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for one when the battery failed to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> It works well. I lien the sensor that let&#x27;s you know when you&#x27;re pushing down too hard. The toothbrush comes with a smaller brush, but it also works with the larger heads.</li>
            <li> Great item. Great price!!</li>
            <li> The 3000 is the one to get, if you don&#x27;t want the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Much better than I hoped.</li>
            <li> Why did I not use a electric toothbrush before now.  It works great and the rechargeable unit is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush. Apparently i&#x27;ve been brushing incorrectly (my dentist said so) and needed to use circular motion. Well this thing is like a jack hammer but not too aggressive to hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;Internal pressure sensor-tells you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard&lt;br /&gt;Timer: Tells you every 30 seconds to switch to a different area with a short vibration. 2 min end time gives a longer vibration indicator</li>
            <li> This is my second one!&lt;br /&gt;Does what it promises...&lt;br /&gt; My teeth feel superclean!</li>
            <li> I have owned this toothbrush since August, I&#x27;m 21 and my teeth kept accumulating stains and plague despite my healthy-mouth habits, so I looked to an electric toothbrush. Gave this one a try, it has been great to say the least. I left it at my parents&#x27; house this weekend and had to buy a drugstore toothbrush...which prompted me to write this review. Using a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; toothbrush just feels so wrong after using this one for a few months; my teeth definitely don&#x27;t feel as clean. My only issue with it is that you have to clean the base that it stands on if you put it back on that after using, because the extra water drips and creates a ring around the bottom (that just might be my inner clean-freak getting to me, though). I say try this one for about a month each time you brush your teeth, and then just randomly use a generic toothbrush one time...you&#x27;ll notice the difference.</li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush,and it&#x27;s better than manual brushing,nice experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades. My guy needs another one and this is the top brand.</li>
            <li> super item and service!</li>
            <li> Began using Oral-B electric toothbrushes with my dentist&#x27;s recommendation over 20 years ago.  The best feature of this model is the red light warning that your are using too much pressure.  It works like a car&#x27;s stop light.  It also has 3 speeds.  My entire family uses these and checkups are easy.  Hygienist does not find tarter or stains on our teeth.  Brushing with a manual toothbrush does not make teeth feel as clean as Oral-B electric.</li>
            <li> good product, also purchased better model and cheaper from Costco.</li>
            <li> Very good item as advertised</li>
            <li> If you are doing research and you visit drugstore.com, they have an Oral-B 8850 3D for $39.99. When you click on it there is a statement on the page that says \\&quot;The Oral-B 8850, frequently sold through professional dental offices, is the professional version of the Oral-B 3000 handle.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know if this is accurate or not since the 8850 comes with a stand up case that also holds extra replacement heads. Never the less the price is right and even if it is an older or discontinued model, if it has the same charateristics as the 3000 then it is a terrific bargain. Just say&#x27;in.</li>
            <li> I currently own the Oral-B earlier model and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 3000 series and am finding that the rotation&lt;br /&gt;of the toothbrush stops in the middle of brushing my teeth stalls and then restarts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happens everytime....What should I do?</li>
            <li> This is a nice middle ground between the entry level Oral-B models and the high-end ones. While it lacks features such as the external monitor that the 5000 model has, it covers all the bases by offering a basic timer and a sensitive mode, two features I find very helpful to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is very good, as is customary with Oral-B products. The battery life is pretty good, and lasts me several days before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Oral-B to the Sonicare mainly due to the brushes. I&#x27;ve used both, and find the smaller size of the Oral-B heads plus the fact that Oral-B makes an extra soft head gives Oral-B the upper hand for my needs. Plus, the Oral-B heads last longer than the Sonicare for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But regardless of the brand, electric toothbrushes are worlds better at cleaning teeth than manual brushes. This is a great way to get into electric toothbrushing without spending a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using a \\&quot;Spinbrush\\&quot; for several years.  The timing feature is great and my teeth feel great.  I have a permanent bottom retainer and it helps prevent tartar build up.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> Bought this for our special needs daughter. She protested a bit a first because of the motion. But, it is much quieter and softer than the Phillips SonicCare we were using. She would not use that one at all. I have noticed our teeth are brighter and whiter than with a manual toothbrush. ( I have one also ) Like that it lets you know when you should switch areas, and when you have gone 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and this was the one!  It does a GREAT job and is all I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback:  kind of loud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty straightforward. It brushes your teeth! You click once to start, and every 30 seconds it buzzes to let you know to change quadrants. There are a few other settings that we haven&#x27;t used, because the basic setting was more than serviceable. My teeth are definitely cleaner and the product is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Will be going back to Sonicare next time. It&#x27;s much more quiet and I don&#x27;t have to recharge the batteries quite as often.</li>
            <li> Having been an Oral B consumer for several years, are a bit disappointed with this unit because of the loudness and what feels like drag when the 30 second timer &amp;#34;stutters&amp;#34;.  When the 2 minute cycle is over, you feel as if the unit is going to shut down.  I don&#x27;t know why Oral B seems to have taken a step back.  The first electric brush we owned had a smoother feel.  Other than that, it seems to get the job done of cleaning teeth quite well.  I am glad that I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and buy this unit rather than the 5000 - the features are just enough!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a family friend. She had been asking for it for the longest. Apparently there is a quiz that oral b put out so you can see what toothbrush fits your needs and this one was recommended for her and she loves it. I could be wrong but I thought a rebate was supposed to come with this but I never received one. Also the extra heads don&#x27;t come with it. You have to buy your own. Other than that it was a wonderful gift and so far she seems to love it.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes the best Brush.  This was a replacement for one we bought 10 years ago.  It works great.  Dentist can always tell when you use this brush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Had a Vitality before this one. This one blows it out of the water. Using floss action head. Leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothbrush I have ever used. Wish I had bought sooner, but it was hard to talk my wife into spending that kind of money on a toothbrush. She is one of those lucky ones, 2 cavities in her entire life. Luckily I caught it on sale. No regrets what so ever. Will see how the next few check-ups go.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great, my teeth feel cleaner then when I use my standard toothbrush.  I bought this product mostly for the timer.  The &amp;#34;regular, softer, whitening&amp;#34; speed variances seem to work, not sure how much.  Love the flashing light when you are brushing too hard (which i seemed to be doing a lot in the beginning). Battery life is very long (I took it on a 6 day trip and brushed my teeth 2-3 time a day).  Charger is small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, and is easy to clean. Would recommend this to a friend.  Only drawback is the toothbrush heads are expensive, so it will continue to be more then a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> An excellent product, my teeth are cleaner than ever before. Wish it had come with more brushes to try out.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Oral-B Vitality with this brush. Does a thorough job with the standard replacement tips. Definitely appreciate both the timer alerts and the pressure sensor.</li>
            <li> I have used the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] and now that i own the Oral-B 3000 i can say there is an notable upgrade in the cleaning and shining of the teeth. I also own the [[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]] which whitens and keeps polished your teeth but it is essential to mantain a good oral hygiene (brush your teeth at least two times per day)</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!! I had researched every electric toothbrush and settled on this one. I am glad I did it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
