            <li>My son is now one, and he still doesn&#x27;t have much hair, so it has done a good job keeping the dandruff at bay.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also one more thing to clean up.</li>
            <li>Baby easily pulls the bristles out, and some come out when brushing hair too.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for the baby&#x27;s fine hair and although it looses some of its bristles</li>
            <li>although this brush does a fine job with my daughter&#x27;s hair, and she loves it both as a toy and hairbrush, it sheds.  </li>
            <li>Never has baby&#x27;s hair looked so fine.</li>
            <li>(He did not have a severe case, just a mild one!)  </li>
            <li>After doing much research, I&#x27;m glad I chose this brush!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine straight hair but being a toddler</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft but bristles come out at almost every stroke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 2 - both my babies (born 13 months apart) were born with a FULL head of hair.</li>
            <li>High quality, gentle and cute!  </li>
            <li>Really good at combing dinner out of a one-year-old&#x27;s long curly hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li>My baby loves the soft bristles &amp; for the price, I&#x27;d gladly buy several more.</li>
            <li>This brush has the perfect amount of stiffness for a baby&#x27;s head...not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft, but not so soft that you can&#x27;t grab any baby hair.  </li>
            <li>using this brush after bath time and it is very gentle on baby&#x27;s scalp.</li>
            <li>It brushes through my 15 month old daughter&#x27;s fine hair and she does not seem bothered by it at all.</li>
            <li>We wanted a natural brush for baby and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Bought it twice after losing the first one.  </li>
            <li>Baby was born with so much hair!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair very soft &amp; silky!!</li>
            <li>Very affordable too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very well.soft handle&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for about six weeks and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Bristles falling out that much is not what I consider normal.</li>
            <li>It looks nice in her nursery compared to the usual plastic brushes.</li>
            <li>This little brush fit the bill!  </li>
            <li>This comb has soft bristles and is gentle on my son&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to use on my newborn but also strong enough to work out cradle cap if you need to.  </li>
            <li>Cute little brush!</li>
            <li>It is very soft and I followed the tip to rub some oil on it</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft &amp; gentle enough for my infact, but cuts through his tangles.</li>
            <li>My husband loves brushing our 4 month old daughter&#x27;s hair with this brush.  </li>
            <li>My natural baby brush was too soft for the mob of hair</li>
            <li>So far (born with a head of hair and still has it all at almost 6 months)</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t currently have much hair at 2-3 months</li>
            <li>I wanted a baby brush that was soft, wood, and wouldn&#x27;t lose its bristles.  </li>
            <li>It is soft but yet still brushes my babies hair.</li>
            <li>My boys is thick and straight, little girls is very fine.</li>
            <li>I like this hairbrush for my newborn baby - it really smooths out his downy hair after a bath, and it has even teased out a little bit of cradle cap that accumulated here and there.</li>

            <li> Okay, I admit that I brush her hair at least once a day, usually while she is nursing.</li>

            <li> However, on occasion I have worried that the bristles were a tiny bit rough for a tender baby head, but they have never irritated him and he has never protested!  </li>
            <li> When I try to comb his hair, I feel it could be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> This is perfect...not to hard or soft.</li>
            <li> We use these on their hair after bath time while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> only problem is the handle is a little small.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as the it actually doesn&#x27;t brush even very fine little hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my little girl since she was born.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but not overly so.  </li>

            <li> This brush is really great. It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair very soft &amp; silky!! I also bought one for my nephew and his hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft but bristles come out at almost every stroke. I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s good quality control. The bristles become one more thing I have to worry about my toddlers putting in their mouth but it&#x27;s also one more thing to clean up. In terms of size and softness it&#x27;s perfect. Bristles falling out that much is not what I consider normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 - both my babies (born 13 months apart) were born with a FULL head of hair. My boys is thick and straight, little girls is very fine. We use these on their hair after bath time while it&#x27;s wet. They work great and are good quality.</li>

            <li> My natural baby brush was too soft for the mob of hair my daughter is growing. This is perfect...not to hard or soft. I may get another for play for she likes brushing her own hair. Price is great on Amazon. Two pack offered better deal. I would get that one if you need to or just ordering.</li>
            <li> My son has a lot of hair and keeps meddling them all the time. This comb has soft bristles and is gentle on my son&#x27;s head. Does it&#x27;s job well.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the handle is a little small. When I try to comb his hair, I feel it could be a little bigger. Other than that, it works great!</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit that I brush her hair at least once a day, usually while she is nursing. This brush has the perfect amount of stiffness for a baby&#x27;s head...not too hard, not too soft. So far (born with a head of hair and still has it all at almost 6 months) I&#x27;ve maybe seen 4-5 bristles come off. Not bad!</li>
            <li> It is very soft and I followed the tip to rub some oil on it and it feels even softer now. I&#x27;m using it for the baby&#x27;s fine hair and although it looses some of its bristles it is a great brush. Very affordable too.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Bought it to use as a clothes brush for a fur I bought.  It worked just as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> EDIT: although this brush does a fine job with my daughter&#x27;s hair, and she loves it both as a toy and hairbrush, it sheds.

            <li> I was very disappointed as the it actually doesn&#x27;t brush even very fine little hair. It doesn&#x27;t brush at all.</li>
            <li> High quality, gentle and cute!  Much better than those cheapies you get in the grooming kits. This will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I like this hairbrush for my newborn baby - it really smooths out his downy hair after a bath, and it has even teased out a little bit of cradle cap that accumulated here and there.

            <li> i love it ,l,looks very lovely and very suit my baby.the quality&lt;br /&gt;is very well.soft handle&lt;br /&gt; i will recommend this product to my firends</li>
            <li> Natural little baby brush. My little one just turnd 6 month and already has some decent hair to brush. I use it also to massage his scalp to try to avoid a cradle cap. Works well. I also use Sweetsation Therapy baby hair wash that helps with that. It helps.</li>
            <li> I wanted a keepsake as well as a quality baby brush and this is it. Exactly as advertised. I plan to get it engraved with the baby&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> Never has baby&#x27;s hair looked so fine.</li>
            <li> Bought it twice after losing the first one.  Really good at combing dinner out of a one-year-old&#x27;s long curly hair.</li>

            <li> I love this baby brush. It is soft but yet still brushes my babies hair. It is good quality and I&#x27;m glad it is made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Cute little brush! My baby loves the soft bristles &amp; for the price, I&#x27;d gladly buy several more. Two brushes are included.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14-month-old for Christmas. We&#x27;ve been using it for about six weeks and really like it.  Works great for her thick-volume, but fine-texture hair.  She loves to try to brush her own hair. WE HAVE NOT LOST ANY BRISTLES! After doing much research, I&#x27;m glad I chose this brush!</li>
