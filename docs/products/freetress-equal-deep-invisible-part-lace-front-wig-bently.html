            <li>I was pleased with the package when received.</li>
            <li>Love is now a must have in my hair supply list.</li>
            <li>shes cute and believable</li>
            <li>I love this hair.</li>
            <li>It was my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I will need to probably cut the bangs to be able to get this to work for me</li>
            <li>I love this hair.</li>
            <li>I wore it under a Santa hat at Christmas, which looked fabulous (and nobody knew it wasn&#x27;t my hair).</li>
            <li>many people think that it&#x27;s my real hair!</li>
            <li>but it looks great if you take time to spray and powder it a little to take away the too shiney and to give more body.</li>
            <li>and I would most certainly recommend this wig.</li>
            <li>Gets frizzy quick but overall a good wig.</li>
            <li>Love this hair my favorite hair its so soft and pretty when straighten I ordered 4 already in all colors</li>
            <li>It came out very pretty.</li>
            <li>I purchased two in different color blends, and I love how they both fit and look on me--</li>
            <li>right away</li>
            <li>I must say this is a veryyy pretty wig .</li>
            <li>pretty color choices too..</li>
            <li>My be better in a different shade.</li>
            <li>and again i wish they had more blonde thou;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>there is a lot more blonde</li>
            <li>I hot glued the tracks on there.</li>
            <li>The first two photos are before I revamped the wig.</li>
            <li>at.the top, then another and bottom is blonde.</li>
            <li>and it looks exactly as pictured when I receive it.</li>
            <li>Used some dry shampoo to remove a little shine and it is perfect!</li>
            <li>This would be a great Halloween wig, but don&#x27;t wear it out on a Saturday night and expect to be taken seriously.</li>
            <li>However, the hair just does not lay right to look realistic if wearing it without a hat of some type.</li>
            <li>People really thought is was my hair that I had curled.</li>
            <li>Even though this wig is synthetic it looked like my real hair.</li>
            <li>Returned it, cost to much for the dissappointment</li>
            <li>I had to pay a little more for the item from a diffrent wig company and will not recieve this item until the end of Febuary or the first week of March.</li>
            <li>It is really dark on top.  </li>
            <li>The cap is kind of small.</li>
            <li>I cut most of the blonde out except the last two tracks of the wig.</li>
            <li>so they were more beach wavy and added a little concealer to make my skin tone..</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was cheaper than I saw in the store and the exact same quality.....</li>
            <li>It is soooooo natural looking.</li>
            <li>Once it dries it back to New</li>
            <li>Looked natural and held the long curls well.</li>

            <li> and I had to wait for a long time to receive my order due to  it getting lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> Color little different then what expected.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing wigs lately to go about an all natural approach to taking care of my hair.</li>
            <li> then i expected</li>
            <li> For synthetic hair, it has held up rather well, but of course tends to get frizzy since it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> Usually I purchase a wig by photo only</li>
            <li> BUT the only thing I hated was that it got frizzy really quick !</li>
            <li> Not the color I wanted and the part was odd.</li>
            <li> The lace is also precut and glued odd on the part....</li>
            <li> Once it starts to look a little ratty</li>
            <li> It is not that thick, I could see thru it.</li>
            <li> She is soft but still disappointed that she did not look like the picture at all.</li>
            <li> Too fake looking.</li>
            <li> this is no lace front but twisted to the side</li>
            <li> a plastic scalp and from a Hair diva was shocked.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, because I did not get the color I order</li>

            <li> Looks nothing like the pic.</li>
            <li> I must say this is a veryyy pretty wig . I especially loved the color I chose OMFirered &amp; it was soooo pretty it looked great on me, I had  compliments for days lol ...BUT the only thing I hated was that it got frizzy really quick !I wanted it to last longer but oh well u get what u pay for .. Now I am  waiting on my next wig which is Latte , Ladies check it out</li>
            <li> Beautiful realistic wig for the price. Nice no shine hair. Just needed to take the straightener and work the curls so they were more beach wavy and added a little concealer to make my skin tone..pretty color choices too..I have 4 of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - the 3 colors don&#x27;t blend so perfectly . Too fake looking. My be better in a different shade.</li>
            <li> Not the color I wanted and the part was odd. I made it work. She is soft but still disappointed that she did not look like the picture at all. I had to brush her out to tame the wild curl..... in the description it said the picture  was color 0M2730613. the picture was actually  0H2730613. The lace is also precut and glued odd on the part....</li>
            <li> I loveeee this wig i will buy again and again i wish they had more blonde thou;)</li>
            <li> Love this hair my favorite hair its so soft and pretty when straighten I ordered 4 already in all colors</li>
            <li> Love it! Used some dry shampoo to remove a little shine and it is perfect! Fab price.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! I bought this for a 90s themed costume party and decided to go as Mariah Carey and this was just perfect. I almost didn&#x27;t think it was going to arrive on time since the delivery estimate said two days after the party but it got here the day of! I was so excited and impressed by the fast shipping! It totally made the outfit and I plan on using this wig again for future shoots! The quality is amazing and the packing was wonderful and the wig was treated with care. Thank you for a beautiful product!</li>
            <li> The wig that I received was not what I thought I ordered. It is really dark on top.  But it is Fabulous!!! Everyone loves it!!! It is soooooo natural looking. People really thought is was my hair that I had curled. :-D</li>
            <li> I have been wearing wigs lately to go about an all natural approach to taking care of my hair. Even though this wig is synthetic it looked like my real hair. Once it starts to look a little ratty I just wash it and put some gel. Once it dries it back to New</li>
            <li> Order color got mixed up. I order this wig in color OH27/30/613 the same color shown by the model and received OM27/30/613 instead. I am disappointed, because I did not get the color I order and I had to wait for a long time to receive my order due to  it getting lost in the mail.I resturn the item and repurchase it I had to pay a little more for the item from a diffrent wig company and will not recieve this item until the end of Febuary or the first week of March.</li>
            <li> I love this Wig! I purchased two in different color blends, and I love how they both fit and look on me--I get many compliments on both...many people think that it&#x27;s my real hair! #satisfiedcustomer :)</li>
            <li> She is a beautiful wig and the color was spot on with the models, literally.  I was very impressed and I would most certainly recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> This one is nice and looks good. Great deal for a new awesome look... The price was awesome and fun hairpiece..</li>
            <li> Love the hair. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the package when received. The hair was full and beautiful. It fits my head perfectly . Very happy and defiantly will order more.</li>
            <li> Love is now a must have in my hair supply list.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look anything like in the picture. Very big , like a lion. i had to flat iron it right away It needs a lot of styling to make it your own. the length is good, so is the texture. there is a lot more blonde then i expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the picture and I can&#x27;t even wear it. There&#x27;s no return address so I can&#x27;t return it either!</li>
            <li> It was a nice color. Nice style. Gets frizzy quick but overall a good wig. I would buy this wig again.</li>
            <li> This wig has 1/8 of non nonexistent  lace... a plastic scalp and from a Hair diva was shocked. this is no lace front but twisted to the side shes cute and believable</li>
            <li> The cap is kind of small. I have a big head that is around 28-30 inches altogether. This is not a lace part but a skin weft patch part. You cannot bleach the skin patch because I tried. I revamp this hair wig with one pack of Outre Batik Bundle Hair - Malaysian (18&amp;#34;, LT4/2730). I cut most of the blonde out except the last two tracks of the wig. I hot glued the tracks on there. It came out very pretty. I wanted to achieve the Singer Monice &amp;#34;Ombre&amp;#34; in her and Brandy video &amp;#34;It Belongs to Me&amp;#34;. The first two photos are before I revamped the wig. The last two photos are after. Check out my video series &amp;#34;MissBossy Fake-A-Scalp&amp;#34; review on this unit on my youtube channel called Kennesha N.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Looks good.Color little different then what expected. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Bouncy, silky hair. I love this hair.</li>
            <li> This wig did not match the picture. Dont be fooled. It is not that thick, I could see thru it. The color isnt blended, its.1 color at.the top, then another and bottom is blonde. Returned it, cost to much for the dissappointment</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this to wear after she shaved her head for charity.  She didn&#x27;t wear it often but loved it when she did.  It was my favorite.  Looked natural and held the long curls well.</li>
            <li> This wig is NOT realistic looking on it&#x27;s own! I wore it under a Santa hat at Christmas, which looked fabulous (and nobody knew it wasn&#x27;t my hair). However, the hair just does not lay right to look realistic if wearing it without a hat of some type. For synthetic hair, it has held up rather well, but of course tends to get frizzy since it&#x27;s not real. This would be a great Halloween wig, but don&#x27;t wear it out on a Saturday night and expect to be taken seriously.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive wig is so nice. I bought it for a costume but it looks great if you take time to spray and powder it a little to take away the too shiney and to give more body. my husband didnt know it was a wig, he though I had my hair done. He liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even think you could get a wig on this site but I&#x27;m so glad I did. It arrived on time and was cheaper than I saw in the store and the exact same quality.....</li>
            <li> Usually I purchase a wig by photo only and it looks exactly as pictured when I receive it. This wig did not. I just didnt like the style once I put it on my head. The hair texture is great and so is the color but I will need to probably cut the bangs to be able to get this to work for me</li>
            <li> I love this hair. The color combination is gorgeous and looked great with my skin complication. I got alot of compliments on this hair.</li>
