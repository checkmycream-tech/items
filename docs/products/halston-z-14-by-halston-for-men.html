            <li>&gt; feels great to smell good again...</li>
            <li>so I am good with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really gorgeous</li>
            <li>the women all tell my husband how good he smells when he wears the Halston.  </li>
            <li>Its still good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Delighted to find what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I often get complemented on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>and I suppose I loved it then.  </li>
            <li>smells really good, and the girls like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good &amp;#</li>
            <li>It took me all of 10 secs to turn the head to a good position and show my grandfather which way it was turned in relation to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Btw, I am beyond impressed with how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and I&#x27;m very happy to have this under the tree!</li>
            <li>When he puts it on it is very potent and affects by breathing when we get into the car.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the&lt;br /&gt;scent is sophisticated with a hint of spice.</li>
            <li>I love this on my husband!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Makes him smell amazing.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap way to smell like cinnamon, here is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received it as a gift years ago and really liked the scent.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this for my brother for Christmas and he was thrilled with the cologne..</li>
            <li>Nice smell...</li>
            <li>Still smells good, but it&#x27;s not as potent, concentrated, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is what I want and I will sure buy again if I need good smell</li>
            <li>Have always liked this cologne</li>
            <li>One thing that is quite nice about this bottle for him is that the bottle seems almost like it was smashed on one side.</li>
            <li>The smell is great both on clothes fresh out of the wash</li>
            <li>Its a very nice fresh cut wood smell.</li>
            <li>It really smells good and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li>This cologne is a nice mix of woodsy - clean!  </li>
            <li>This was a great price compared to purchasing at a large chain store.</li>
            <li>Many years ago my spouse recommended Halston Z-14.</li>
            <li>Always have love &amp;#34;Halston Z-14.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this cologne, so I just keep ordering more for him when needed.  </li>
            <li>Love  the fragrance . . .</li>
            <li>Halston cologne is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on, and it lasts all day and also into the evening with tones that linger into sexy treats that anyone would love to smell as bodies mesh skin on skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it  four stars because it is not my favorite cologne on him.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more for myself and friends</li>
            <li>A favorite for more than two decades.  </li>
            <li>have never gotten any complaints but many compliments......and most important...........not Pouchouli based like a lot of colognes these days............</li>
            <li>I may go for it one more time</li>
            <li>He has used it for many many years.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this fragrance, it lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li>At the price, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal.</li>
            <li>Love this men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>My husband love the cologne spray, used all the time.  </li>
            <li>There nothing more to said about the product</li>
            <li>Got this for my son for Christmas - he enjoyed getting his.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Perfect for romantic dates an the like.</li>
            <li>I been used it for more than 30 years...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simply the best out there .</li>
            <li>but I know how much this brand costs and this was a great deal on this product.</li>
            <li>soon.that&#x27;s why I love Amazon</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the spray.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff becasue</li>
            <li>Husbands all time favorite, could not pass up getting it for him.</li>
            <li>smoke cigars and many colognes I have tried end up clashing with the smell of the smoke.</li>
            <li>you can roll with the high rollers on a beer budget lol.highly recommend.very happy with it</li>
            <li>because they keep coming out with new stuff doesn&#x27;t take away the fact that Z-14 is still great.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the sent and it stays with me most of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so SEXY HOT!!  </li>
            <li>Other times the smell is very attractive.</li>
            <li>delivery and the perfect size, for cheaper than you can get it from other retailers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Halston 1-12 , Not bad either !</li>
            <li>Smells strong.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>Strong stuff that swaggers.</li>
            <li>As ordered, it arrives quickly !</li>
            <li>The order came quickly, but I believe the scent of the cologne wasn&#x27;t in the bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been around, but has kept it&#x27;s place against a huge field of men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li>He is 76 years old and feels the necessity to smell good.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised this isn&#x27;t more popular.</li>
            <li>Most colognes are so over powering you offend people and wife has sinus issues and they bug her pretty easy too.</li>
            <li>So excited to find it for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Since this is my spouse&#x27;s favorite cologne and the fact that he could not find it locally, he was very pleased....</li>
            <li>This cologne is a very good everyday cologne and also happens to be very cost effective.</li>
            <li>it is musky but it is unique.</li>
            <li>I purchased form them, and it did not smell anything like the original I am used to.</li>
            <li>It has a distinctive and unique woodsy spice smell which lasts all day - no alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>While this may normally be overlooked, for him it is actually an extremely nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not too strong but just right.</li>
            <li>Z14 is not unpleasant, and is certainly the best cheap fragrance you can find at the average Target.</li>
            <li>They were good about the refund, but I had to pay the shipping back to them.</li>
            <li>and I must say i prefer the Z14 the smell is simialr but has a more modern twist</li>
            <li>I prefer cool water</li>
            <li>I have loved the smell of this mens cologne and now with this this big bottle he won&#x27;t be running out anytime</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a full 5-stars for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my loyalty to Cool Water and Z-14 is a resistance to change, I prefer to believe I was lucky enough to find two superior products, that have served me well over the years.</li>
            <li>The price makes it a super value.</li>
            <li>A favorite classic fragrance for my guy.</li>
            <li>Quick service but</li>
            <li>i was very interested in experiencing the z-14</li>
            <li>I found it online for super cheap and it got to him super fast.  </li>
            <li>Its strong for about a minute, then fades to such a sexy smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>has a great scent, is strong enough to only need a couple sprays but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>&gt;  Have been complimented several times by women on how nice I smell with it</li>
            <li>and it became my most frequently used cologne.</li>
            <li>Hope you have success with it too.</li>
            <li>My significant other was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thank you for his nice Christmas present that he didn&#x27;t know he was going to get !!  </li>
            <li>Well then you picked the right</li>
            <li>It used to be priced right there with the premium colognes.</li>
            <li>Halston Z-14 is a true Classic!</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon, it&#x27;s good deal quick shipment but not free</li>
            <li>Both the product, and the usual Amazon experience, were great.</li>
            <li>It did not do well in the market, and oak moss, one of its key foundation ingredients, was basically banned by the fragrance regulatory authority, so these two facts have led to a very cheap reformulation that is not especially complex or interesting.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not what one,  who normally uses the original &amp;#34;Halston Z-14&amp;#34; expects the contents in the bottle to smell like.</li>
            <li>Price was great almost half what normally pay.</li>
            <li>Since then, and to this day, I get regular comments from women saying, &amp;#34;Wow, do you smell great.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t think of a better reason to choose a men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>It has been over thirty years since I bought my first bottle of Z-14</li>
            <li>I have tried 30 or 40 different Colognes over the years and Z-14 is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>is reasonable!  </li>
            <li>The woodsy spice smell of this is really off the chain!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent for when going out into public places.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast also and got here by Christmas !</li>
            <li>I dont think they have, Z-14 still smells &amp;#34;cinamonny&amp;#34; like it did in the 80&#x27;s, when I first used it.</li>
            <li>Just got my shipment and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;The first impression is... &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not enough to make it smell lady like by no means though because its more wood sented.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the primary purpose of the bottle design was, if this was considered by Halston in the design, but when you are blind or start thinking like someone who is, things like this are just wonderful in making life a little easier for those who have a greater struggle.</li>
            <li>would normally highly recommend this product, but I don&#x27;t want to many guys in my neck of the woods wearing the same cologne I am, if you catch my drift...</li>
            <li>Smells like the inside of a ceder chest with a very mild honeysuckle or something similar added in.</li>
            <li>With this fragrance on you will smell like you have had a bath with a lime scented body wash and had a cool water type after shave... in short &amp;#34; FRESH &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, like I-12 it smells nice, and is a little stronger and lasts longer, it still is basically a $15 dollar cologne though.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap good male fragrance, Grey Flannel by G. Beene or Tuscany by Aramis are only slightly more than this and both smell like something other than a Christmas spice.</li>
            <li>It is a very distinguished masculine scent that blends a woodsy patchouli male scent that I love as a man.</li>
            <li>Seller sent items really fast.</li>
            <li>It does not smell all &#x27;Piney&#x27; and is very well priced.</li>
            <li>The Z-14 is really inexpensive now.</li>
            <li>I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to have as strong a scent as I remember it, but lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>product arrived on time .excellent product better than expected !</li>
            <li>This goes extremely well with it, not creating a smell that is even more offensive to some.</li>
            <li>Also, the price has dropped so much over the years just because it&#x27;s an older cologne.  </li>
            <li>But make sure you use little spray because it can really over take your sences</li>
            <li>I have worked for a few big names; Prada, Nieman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avanue, yet in all my years I have hadly found a fragrance as good at any price.  </li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>I use to use this in the 70&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t like it then now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>I have found that the product was very old and had lost much of it&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Big sandalwood, and lemon and mossy leather in a loud 80&#x27;s sweater that somehow still looks good on you, coming down the street.  </li>
            <li>I smell This Perfume in Sears, by mistake my daughter spray on my hand, cost is high in sears.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it AAA+++</li>
            <li>Just be forewarned that if you get the modern reformulation, you are getting exactly what you pay for: a simple, linear, short-lived fragrance.</li>
            <li>I still have a small amount of the original Halston cologne and the original has a rich deep fragrance that lasts for hours and hours - until the next day.</li>
            <li>I forgot how much I liked the fragrance and the price and convenience of getting it delivered was a Bonus Round!!</li>
            <li>(I ordered with other stuffs to fulfills amazon free shipping policy).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My father in law loves his new Halston cologne.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this since the late 70&#x27;s and many people ask what it is, thanks to Halston for not changing or discontinuing it.</li>
            <li>A very natural fragrance....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for it&#x27;s masculine scent, and price.  </li>
            <li>(Though even there Stetson and Old Spice are highly competitive...)</li>
            <li>I have such a difficult time finding this product in the stores, so am very pleased that I can order it online and have it arrive so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells on you the whole day nice fragrance can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li>I have like this fragrance since I was young.</li>
            <li>I really like it but only wish I could afford it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still one of my old favs.  </li>
            <li>I have worn it since a young man..........</li>
            <li>One of my old favorites...</li>
            <li>An old staple, ladies compliment when I where Halston Z-14</li>
            <li>I can get this for such a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>kinda woody adult smell.</li>
            <li>They say that this is an Old Man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m an old man</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not project well, and lasts less than most other masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li>Ordered this cologne for my husband, needless to say he loves it, as do I. Such a fantastic clean, crisp, and hint of peppery smell.</li>
            <li>Not for everyone, but once it dries down, it&#x27;s a favorite that last all day, and if you are careful, will not project so far as to offend.</li>
            <li>Old school, extremely masculine, highly complex, and quite unique.</li>
            <li>Now a days it can be harder to find.. there have been so many other colognes marketed and pushed, that only select retailers still carry all lines of cologne</li>
            <li>Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Smells right but scent does not last long enough.</li>
            <li>Halston was the Tom Ford of the 1970&#x27;s, who&#x27;s talent left us far too soon.  </li>
            <li>In 1988 Cool Water was introduced and it and Z-14 have been my mainstay colognes for the past 25 years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the same stuff they cut down on it very much at lease about 48%</li>
            <li>Decadent, mature, complicated, sexy.  </li>
            <li>Never expected that big of a box</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But nonetheless it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered it and especially glad</li>
            <li> and guaranteed effective!</li>
            <li> My favorite great cologne !!!  </li>
            <li> The best thing about it was it had no alcahol smell like most mens cologne has.</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff!</li>
            <li> &gt; feels great to smell good again...</li>
            <li> so I am good with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really gorgeous</li>
            <li> the women all tell my husband how good he smells when he wears the Halston.  </li>
            <li> Its still good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Delighted to find what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I often get complemented on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> and I suppose I loved it then.  </li>
            <li> smells really good, and the girls like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good &amp;#</li>
            <li> It took me all of 10 secs to turn the head to a good position and show my grandfather which way it was turned in relation to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Btw, I am beyond impressed with how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and I&#x27;m very happy to have this under the tree!</li>
            <li> When he puts it on it is very potent and affects by breathing when we get into the car.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the&lt;br /&gt;scent is sophisticated with a hint of spice.</li>
            <li> I love this on my husband!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes him smell amazing.</li>
            <li> If you want a cheap way to smell like cinnamon, here is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received it as a gift years ago and really liked the scent.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this for my brother for Christmas and he was thrilled with the cologne..</li>
            <li> Nice smell...</li>
            <li> Still smells good, but it&#x27;s not as potent, concentrated, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is what I want and I will sure buy again if I need good smell</li>
            <li> Have always liked this cologne</li>
            <li> One thing that is quite nice about this bottle for him is that the bottle seems almost like it was smashed on one side.</li>
            <li> The smell is great both on clothes fresh out of the wash</li>
            <li> Its a very nice fresh cut wood smell.</li>
            <li> It really smells good and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> This cologne is a nice mix of woodsy - clean!  </li>
            <li> This was a great price compared to purchasing at a large chain store.</li>
            <li> Many years ago my spouse recommended Halston Z-14.</li>
            <li> Always have love &amp;#34;Halston Z-14.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this cologne, so I just keep ordering more for him when needed.  </li>
            <li> Love  the fragrance . . .</li>
            <li> Halston cologne is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on, and it lasts all day and also into the evening with tones that linger into sexy treats that anyone would love to smell as bodies mesh skin on skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it  four stars because it is not my favorite cologne on him.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more for myself and friends</li>
            <li> A favorite for more than two decades.  </li>
            <li> have never gotten any complaints but many compliments......and most important...........not Pouchouli based like a lot of colognes these days............</li>
            <li> I may go for it one more time</li>
            <li> He has used it for many many years.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this fragrance, it lasts FOREVER!</li>
            <li> At the price, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal.</li>
            <li> Love this men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband love the cologne spray, used all the time.  </li>
            <li> There nothing more to said about the product</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for Christmas - he enjoyed getting his.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Perfect for romantic dates an the like.</li>
            <li> I been used it for more than 30 years...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s simply the best out there .</li>
            <li> but I know how much this brand costs and this was a great deal on this product.</li>
            <li> soon.that&#x27;s why I love Amazon</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the spray.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff becasue</li>
            <li> Husbands all time favorite, could not pass up getting it for him.</li>
            <li> smoke cigars and many colognes I have tried end up clashing with the smell of the smoke.</li>
            <li> you can roll with the high rollers on a beer budget lol.highly recommend.very happy with it</li>
            <li> because they keep coming out with new stuff doesn&#x27;t take away the fact that Z-14 is still great.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the sent and it stays with me most of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so SEXY HOT!!  </li>
            <li> Other times the smell is very attractive.</li>
            <li> delivery and the perfect size, for cheaper than you can get it from other retailers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Halston 1-12 , Not bad either !</li>
            <li> Smells strong.</li>
            <li> Strong smell.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff that swaggers.</li>
            <li> As ordered, it arrives quickly !</li>
            <li> The order came quickly, but I believe the scent of the cologne wasn&#x27;t in the bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around, but has kept it&#x27;s place against a huge field of men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> He is 76 years old and feels the necessity to smell good.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this isn&#x27;t more popular.</li>
            <li> Most colognes are so over powering you offend people and wife has sinus issues and they bug her pretty easy too.</li>
            <li> So excited to find it for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Since this is my spouse&#x27;s favorite cologne and the fact that he could not find it locally, he was very pleased....</li>
            <li> This cologne is a very good everyday cologne and also happens to be very cost effective.</li>
            <li> it is musky but it is unique.</li>
            <li> I purchased form them, and it did not smell anything like the original I am used to.</li>
            <li> It has a distinctive and unique woodsy spice smell which lasts all day - no alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> While this may normally be overlooked, for him it is actually an extremely nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not too strong but just right.</li>
            <li> Z14 is not unpleasant, and is certainly the best cheap fragrance you can find at the average Target.</li>
            <li> They were good about the refund, but I had to pay the shipping back to them.</li>
            <li> and I must say i prefer the Z14 the smell is simialr but has a more modern twist</li>
            <li> I prefer cool water</li>
            <li> I have loved the smell of this mens cologne and now with this this big bottle he won&#x27;t be running out anytime</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a full 5-stars for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my loyalty to Cool Water and Z-14 is a resistance to change, I prefer to believe I was lucky enough to find two superior products, that have served me well over the years.</li>
            <li> The price makes it a super value.</li>
            <li> A favorite classic fragrance for my guy.</li>
            <li> Quick service but</li>
            <li> i was very interested in experiencing the z-14</li>
            <li> I found it online for super cheap and it got to him super fast.  </li>
            <li> Its strong for about a minute, then fades to such a sexy smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> has a great scent, is strong enough to only need a couple sprays but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> &gt;  Have been complimented several times by women on how nice I smell with it</li>
            <li> and it became my most frequently used cologne.</li>
            <li> Hope you have success with it too.</li>
            <li> My significant other was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Thank you for his nice Christmas present that he didn&#x27;t know he was going to get !!  </li>
            <li> Well then you picked the right</li>
            <li> It used to be priced right there with the premium colognes.</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 is a true Classic!</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon, it&#x27;s good deal quick shipment but not free</li>
            <li> Both the product, and the usual Amazon experience, were great.</li>
            <li> It did not do well in the market, and oak moss, one of its key foundation ingredients, was basically banned by the fragrance regulatory authority, so these two facts have led to a very cheap reformulation that is not especially complex or interesting.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not what one,  who normally uses the original &amp;#34;Halston Z-14&amp;#34; expects the contents in the bottle to smell like.</li>
            <li> Price was great almost half what normally pay.</li>
            <li> Since then, and to this day, I get regular comments from women saying, &amp;#34;Wow, do you smell great.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t think of a better reason to choose a men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> It has been over thirty years since I bought my first bottle of Z-14</li>
            <li> I have tried 30 or 40 different Colognes over the years and Z-14 is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> is reasonable!  </li>
            <li> The woodsy spice smell of this is really off the chain!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent for when going out into public places.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast also and got here by Christmas !</li>
            <li> I dont think they have, Z-14 still smells &amp;#34;cinamonny&amp;#34; like it did in the 80&#x27;s, when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Just got my shipment and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;The first impression is... &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not enough to make it smell lady like by no means though because its more wood sented.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the primary purpose of the bottle design was, if this was considered by Halston in the design, but when you are blind or start thinking like someone who is, things like this are just wonderful in making life a little easier for those who have a greater struggle.</li>
            <li> would normally highly recommend this product, but I don&#x27;t want to many guys in my neck of the woods wearing the same cologne I am, if you catch my drift...</li>
            <li> Smells like the inside of a ceder chest with a very mild honeysuckle or something similar added in.</li>
            <li> With this fragrance on you will smell like you have had a bath with a lime scented body wash and had a cool water type after shave... in short &amp;#34; FRESH &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, like I-12 it smells nice, and is a little stronger and lasts longer, it still is basically a $15 dollar cologne though.</li>
            <li> If you want a cheap good male fragrance, Grey Flannel by G. Beene or Tuscany by Aramis are only slightly more than this and both smell like something other than a Christmas spice.</li>
            <li> It is a very distinguished masculine scent that blends a woodsy patchouli male scent that I love as a man.</li>
            <li> Seller sent items really fast.</li>
            <li> It does not smell all &#x27;Piney&#x27; and is very well priced.</li>
            <li> The Z-14 is really inexpensive now.</li>
            <li> I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have as strong a scent as I remember it, but lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> product arrived on time .excellent product better than expected !</li>
            <li> This goes extremely well with it, not creating a smell that is even more offensive to some.</li>
            <li> Also, the price has dropped so much over the years just because it&#x27;s an older cologne.  </li>
            <li> But make sure you use little spray because it can really over take your sences</li>
            <li> I have worked for a few big names; Prada, Nieman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avanue, yet in all my years I have hadly found a fragrance as good at any price.  </li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> I use to use this in the 70&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t like it then now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> I have found that the product was very old and had lost much of it&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Big sandalwood, and lemon and mossy leather in a loud 80&#x27;s sweater that somehow still looks good on you, coming down the street.  </li>
            <li> I smell This Perfume in Sears, by mistake my daughter spray on my hand, cost is high in sears.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it AAA+++</li>
            <li> Just be forewarned that if you get the modern reformulation, you are getting exactly what you pay for: a simple, linear, short-lived fragrance.</li>
            <li> I still have a small amount of the original Halston cologne and the original has a rich deep fragrance that lasts for hours and hours - until the next day.</li>
            <li> I forgot how much I liked the fragrance and the price and convenience of getting it delivered was a Bonus Round!!</li>
            <li> (I ordered with other stuffs to fulfills amazon free shipping policy).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My father in law loves his new Halston cologne.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this since the late 70&#x27;s and many people ask what it is, thanks to Halston for not changing or discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> A very natural fragrance....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for it&#x27;s masculine scent, and price.  </li>
            <li> (Though even there Stetson and Old Spice are highly competitive...)</li>
            <li> I have such a difficult time finding this product in the stores, so am very pleased that I can order it online and have it arrive so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Smells on you the whole day nice fragrance can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I have like this fragrance since I was young.</li>
            <li> I really like it but only wish I could afford it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still one of my old favs.  </li>
            <li> I have worn it since a young man..........</li>
            <li> One of my old favorites...</li>
            <li> An old staple, ladies compliment when I where Halston Z-14</li>
            <li> I can get this for such a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> kinda woody adult smell.</li>
            <li> They say that this is an Old Man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m an old man</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not project well, and lasts less than most other masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li> Ordered this cologne for my husband, needless to say he loves it, as do I. Such a fantastic clean, crisp, and hint of peppery smell.</li>
            <li> Not for everyone, but once it dries down, it&#x27;s a favorite that last all day, and if you are careful, will not project so far as to offend.</li>
            <li> Old school, extremely masculine, highly complex, and quite unique.</li>
            <li> Now a days it can be harder to find.. there have been so many other colognes marketed and pushed, that only select retailers still carry all lines of cologne</li>
            <li> Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Smells right but scent does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Halston was the Tom Ford of the 1970&#x27;s, who&#x27;s talent left us far too soon.  </li>
            <li> In 1988 Cool Water was introduced and it and Z-14 have been my mainstay colognes for the past 25 years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not the same stuff they cut down on it very much at lease about 48%</li>
            <li> Decadent, mature, complicated, sexy.  </li>
            <li> Never expected that big of a box</li>
            <li> Few times would I rate a fragrance so high.  </li>
            <li> I only smell, too much cinnamon, alcohol, and some other mess.</li>
            <li> A lot of mens fragrance out there is toilet water, I&#x27;ve worn Halston for years and the fragrance is timeless and always brings compliments.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell bad its just not my kind of scent.</li>
            <li> while everyone is wearing AXE you can wear this &amp; its cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making it, it&#x27;s the one for him.</li>
            <li> box doesn&#x27;t have much padding but its a thick bottle..</li>
            <li> I have plenty of the other 2 to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> but I not exactly the same has when I had before.</li>
            <li> i used to buy this stuff back in 86-90 and u can&#x27;t buy enough of it, it has a mature scent thats last though the day casual or dress&lt;</li>
            <li> The spraying button isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;spray-y&amp;#34; but just a firm push usually dolls out a stream of smelly niceness.</li>
            <li> cant find it in the area for less than double this price !</li>
            <li> I think cinnamon scores very high in the likeability category for attracting people to you, it also mask smells of my job well, at least for a little while.</li>
            <li> and I can imagine it easily lasting a year with as little as I have to use each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent smells a little different and only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 was not what I had expected</li>
            <li> I expected, as advertised, notes of leather and cedar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want this these days, at least in the modern formulation.</li>
            <li> Seems to be just like the other Halston Z-14</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said they thought that this and I-12 have been reformulated since the 70&#x27;s when it was introduced.</li>
            <li> This Z-14 on the other hand is not that way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews and thank the other reviewers for steering me right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dad has been wearing this stuff forever and always buys it for at least double or triple in department stores.  </li>
            <li> There seems to be less potency in this bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li> Actually the smell of it was not good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;musky, a little spicy and not offensive</li>
            <li> This stuff is is a weak and generic nondescript scent that is gone in a few hours.</li>
            <li> but you should not wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few touchstones remaining  of his legacy, the scent and the bottle designed by Elsa Piretti, the fames Tiffany jewelry designer.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted something inexpensive to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the original one and suspect it&#x27;s a fake !!!</li>
            <li> Lingers for a while though not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> recommended this perfume for others but remember this smell is stays few hours not over day or over night (you have to spray twice in day if you want that stay on your body at least for 8hrs then spray twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a little less expensive than what I paid in the store</li>
            <li> to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I use this scent when I get tired of wearing my usual fragrance.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price, been using this brand for years...</li>
            <li> Seems to be just like the other Halston Z-14 I have purchased.  It smells the same and lasts about 8 hours.  This was a little less expensive than what I paid in the store so I am good with it.</li>
            <li> Received it as a gift years ago and really liked the scent. So I bought it this time.&lt;br /&gt;  Have been complimented several times by women on how nice I smell with it on.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;  Halston 1-12 , Not bad either ! Prefer Z-14 though ! Try both to see which one fits you!</li>
            <li> Many years ago my spouse recommended Halston Z-14. Since then, and to this day, I get regular comments from women saying, &amp;#34;Wow, do you smell great.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t think of a better reason to choose a men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Great size for the price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like hailston</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the original one and suspect it&#x27;s a fake !!!</li>
            <li> Looking to get a lot of compliments from ladies? Well then you picked the right cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cashiers, co workers, etc all telling me they like the cologne. Throw the Axe body spray away and get this.</li>
            <li> I have like this fragrance since I was young. This was a great price compared to purchasing at a large chain store.</li>
            <li> A lot of mens fragrance out there is toilet water, I&#x27;ve worn Halston for years and the fragrance is timeless and always brings compliments.</li>
            <li> It has been over thirty years since I bought my first bottle of Z-14 and it became my most frequently used cologne. In 1988 Cool Water was introduced and it and Z-14 have been my mainstay colognes for the past 25 years. I have tried just about everything over the years and never bought a second bottle of any of them. I don&#x27;t think my loyalty to Cool Water and Z-14 is a resistance to change, I prefer to believe I was lucky enough to find two superior products, that have served me well over the years. You should give them both a try.</li>
            <li> Smells right but scent does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Always have love &amp;#34;Halston Z-14.</li>
            <li> I have tried 30 or 40 different Colognes over the years and Z-14 is my all time favorite.The scent lasts all day and I get many compliments on it. The price makes it a super value. I bought several to give away as gifts.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this cologne, so I just keep ordering more for him when needed.  Hopefully it is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love  the fragrance . . . DO NOT like getting ripped-off. Ordered two bottles, paid for two bottles . . . received box with one bottle only from From FragranceNet</li>
            <li> I had ordered this for my brother for Christmas and he was thrilled with the cologne.. He has been using Halston Z-14 for years and when he received it he said it smelt just like it did years ago. There was no change of scent...Glad I ordered it and especially glad I got it from Amazon. Can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell...great price</li>
            <li> ITS OK.......not bad....would buy it again.....</li>
            <li> I forgot how much I liked the fragrance and the price and convenience of getting it delivered was a Bonus Round!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. while everyone is wearing AXE you can wear this &amp; its cheaper in the long run. lats all day. I get complements from women from 21-35. 1-2 sprays is all you need.</li>
            <li> Halston cologne is my favorite.  Thank you for sending the sample of &amp;#34;exceptional&amp;#34;.  I really like it but only wish I could afford it.  I have plenty of the other 2 to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Halston Z-14 for about 20 years and it&#x27;s still one of my old favs.  Also, the price has dropped so much over the years just because it&#x27;s an older cologne.  So what !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just  because they keep coming out with new stuff doesn&#x27;t take away the fact that Z-14 is still great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around, but has kept it&#x27;s place against a huge field of men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 is a true Classic! It is a very distinguished masculine scent that blends a woodsy patchouli male scent that I love as a man. I spray it on, and it lasts all day and also into the evening with tones that linger into sexy treats that anyone would love to smell as bodies mesh skin on skin. It&#x27;s so SEXY HOT!!  I rate it a AAA+++</li>
            <li> its a great cologne but you should not wear it everyday. it is musky but it is unique. I will give it that.</li>
            <li> My fragrance of choice for over 30 years! Old school, extremely masculine, highly complex, and quite unique. Oh, yeah...and guaranteed effective!</li>
            <li> There seems to be less potency in this bottle of cologne. This is my regular scent, so I know... Still smells good, but it&#x27;s not as potent, concentrated, etc. Borderline on wanting to exchange it...</li>
            <li> My husband loves this Cologne. He asked me to order several bottles because he ran out. He is 76 years old and feels the necessity to smell good. I gave it  four stars because it is not my favorite cologne on him. When he puts it on it is very potent and affects by breathing when we get into the car. Other times the smell is very attractive. Hope you have success with it too.</li>
            <li> Hlston is always my preffered choice for deodorant stick and Colognes. Reminds me of smooky woody cedar smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> Ok. I have used Halston Z-14 for over 20 years. I purchased form them, and it did not smell anything like the original I am used to. Actually the smell of it was not good. They were good about the refund, but I had to pay the shipping back to them. Might have been the bottle I got, but beware.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Price was great almost half what normally pay. Will be ordering more for myself and friends</li>
            <li> Another waste of money. The product is fake. You will regret it if you ignore my review because it regretted buying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product....Will purchase again.  Seller sent items really fast. I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I like my husband to wear.  It smells wonderful on him!  As long as they keep making it, it&#x27;s the one for him.</li>
            <li> A favorite for more than two decades.  Decadent, mature, complicated, sexy.  Few times would I rate a fragrance so high.  I have worked for a few big names; Prada, Nieman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avanue, yet in all my years I have hadly found a fragrance as good at any price.  Halston was the Tom Ford of the 1970&#x27;s, who&#x27;s talent left us far too soon.  This is one of the few touchstones remaining  of his legacy, the scent and the bottle designed by Elsa Piretti, the fames Tiffany jewelry designer.</li>
            <li> A very natural fragrance....I have worn it since a young man..........have never gotten any complaints but many compliments......and most important...........not Pouchouli based like a lot of colognes these days............</li>
            <li> Smells on you the whole day nice fragrance can&#x27;t go wrong I may go for it one more time it&#x27;s really gorgeous</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have as strong a scent as I remember it, but lasts a long time.  A favorite classic fragrance for my guy.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a very good everyday cologne and also happens to be very cost effective. I have worn it for years.</li>
            <li> I have found that the product was very old and had lost much of it&#x27;s fragrance.  Did Halston stop producing this product?</li>
            <li> My significant other was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have such a difficult time finding this product in the stores, so am very pleased that I can order it online and have it arrive so quickly.  the women all tell my husband how good he smells when he wears the Halston.  He has used it for many many years.  Ann Hunt, Wiliamsburg, VA</li>
            <li> Great price for what you get.  My dad has been wearing this stuff forever and always buys it for at least double or triple in department stores.  I found it online for super cheap and it got to him super fast.  So excited to find it for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Its still good but I not exactly the same has when I had before. I need to do a smell test</li>
            <li> Wana smell like a man?  Yeah you do..  this is what you need!</li>
            <li> How could you go wrong with Halston for men.  I use this scent when I get tired of wearing my usual fragrance.  Highly recommended for it&#x27;s masculine scent, and price.  As ordered, it arrives quickly !</li>
            <li> Ordered this cologne for my husband, needless to say he loves it, as do I. Such a fantastic clean, crisp, and hint of peppery smell. Its strong for about a minute, then fades to such a sexy smell.&lt;br /&gt; Btw, I am beyond impressed with how quickly it arrived. In fact, the estimated delivery was almost two weeks, we received it in 3 days!!! Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes this scent a lot so i was happy to see it on here.&lt;br /&gt;The box doesn&#x27;t have much padding but its a thick bottle.. i don&#x27;t think it would break.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this fragrance, it lasts FOREVER! Additionally, its not too overpowering  and can be used for all occasions. At the price, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal.</li>
            <li> Love this men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years, it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and the perfect size, for cheaper than you can get it from other retailers.&lt;br /&gt;I would normally highly recommend this product, but I don&#x27;t want to many guys in my neck of the woods wearing the same cologne I am, if you catch my drift...Two thumbs Up.</li>
            <li> After buying the Z-12 i was very interested in experiencing the z-14 and I must say i prefer the Z14 the smell is simialr but has a more modern twist</li>
            <li> My husband love the cologne spray, used all the time.  There nothing more to said about the product it&#x27;s sy it all.</li>
            <li> One of my old favorites...</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for Christmas - he enjoyed getting his.</li>
            <li> I remember this as a teenager. My husband wanted something inexpensive to wear everyday. This does the job. He smells delicious. Lol.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and is as described.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery...and of course, a great product!</li>
            <li> An old staple, ladies compliment when I where Halston Z-14 and I have been told it smells different on different people. Only wish they still made the deodorant stick.</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 was not what I had expected but it&#x27;s still good. Earthy,Spicy,warm cologne. The cologne has notes of basil,cypress,and cinnamon. It definitely beats Aspen by Coty. Halston is like the perfect fall and winter cologne. It&#x27;s like a potpourri..which gives this cologne that vintage pop. Classic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. Smells strong. Lingers for a while though not overwhelming. The spraying button isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;spray-y&amp;#34; but just a firm push usually dolls out a stream of smelly niceness.</li>
            <li> Strong smell. Smells great as well. Has a musky scent. But nonetheless it smells AMAZING! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone. Perfect for romantic dates an the like.</li>
            <li> Quick service but the product is not the same like it was in the 1980&#x27;s. The scent would last until the next day. The scent smells a little different and only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a nice mix of woodsy - clean!  I like the scent and price is reasonable!  Try it today if you like the woodsy, outdoor scents on your man!</li>
            <li> Delighted to find what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same... I been used it for more than 30 years... have no smell at all... great for a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> The only scent I will let my man wear.  Delivery was quick and I&#x27;m very happy to have this under the tree!</li>
            <li> I have been using this since the late 70&#x27;s and many people ask what it is, thanks to Halston for not changing or discontinuing it. It does not smell all &#x27;Piney&#x27; and is very well priced.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume . I have been using it for years and it&#x27;s simply the best out there . My wife loves it too .</li>
            <li> This has always been my signature scent since 1982... Now a days it can be harder to find.. there have been so many other colognes marketed and pushed, that only select retailers still carry all lines of cologne</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell bad its just not my kind of scent. I prefer cool water</li>
            <li> I where this as my daily Cologne.  I often get complemented on how good I smell.  And I like it too.</li>
            <li> The woodsy spice smell of this is really off the chain! It really smells good and my wife loves it! I wear it everyday. But make sure you use little spray because it can really over take your sences</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was impressed with the fragrance and have been using it for some time.</li>
            <li> I use to use this in the 70&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t like it then now that I&#x27;m older I do enjoy the sent and it stays with me most of the day.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery; great price; very happy</li>
            <li> I love this on my husband! It is not too strong but just right. Yes, I would recommend for anyone!</li>
            <li> I smell This Perfume in Sears, by mistake my daughter spray on my hand, cost is high in sears. I remember name and took picture of this perfume packing. I ordered from Amazon, it&#x27;s good deal quick shipment but not free (I ordered with other stuffs to fulfills amazon free shipping policy).&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this perfume for others but remember this smell is stays few hours not over day or over night (you have to spray twice in day if you want that stay on your body at least for 8hrs then spray twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is what I want and I will sure buy again if I need good smell perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Remember this perfume smell is similar to OBSESSION by Calvin Klein EDT SPRAY for MEN ASIN: B000HZQWFU, so I have 2 similar fragrance&#x27;s now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-HP</li>
            <li> Never expected that big of a box but I know how much this brand costs and this was a great deal on this product.I have loved the smell of this mens cologne and now with this this big bottle he won&#x27;t be running out anytime soon.that&#x27;s why I love Amazon you can roll with the high rollers on a beer budget lol.highly recommend.very happy with it</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 has been my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; cologne for - hmm - 35 years. Z-14 can be worn by any age man, for casual or evening times. The Z-14 is really inexpensive now. It used to be priced right there with the premium colognes. Be sure to get the spray. It has a distinctive and unique woodsy spice smell which lasts all day - no alcohol smell. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the worse cologne i ve smelled all my life, Smells like acid that is gone bad. I really regret buying it. I ve since thrown it away. I wont buy agaiiiiin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;BUYER BEWARE&amp;#34;,  this is advertised as Halston Z-14 by Halston Company...I have used Halston Z-14 for over 35 years,  and I can tell beyond any doubt, this isn&#x27;t  the Z-14 produced by the Halston Company!!!  It definitely is a knock-off brand.  The fragrance is not what one,  who normally uses the original &amp;#34;Halston Z-14&amp;#34; expects the contents in the bottle to smell like. Not offensive,  but isn&#x27;t Halston&#x27;s fragrance either.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn this scent in almost 30 years. The price was great and the&lt;br /&gt;scent is sophisticated with a hint of spice. Cologne is a personal choice,&lt;br /&gt;but if you like Halston, this is the place to purchase it.</li>
            <li> i used to buy this stuff back in 86-90 and u can&#x27;t buy enough of it, it has a mature scent thats last though the day casual or dress&lt;br /&gt; but I tried this stuff and it&#x27;s not the same stuff they cut down on it very much at lease about 48% it don&#x27;t last on your skin. why companies do the things they do...greed!! QUANTITY over QUALITY</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent for when going out into public places.  I use it almost every day.  Be mindful that scents work differently on different peoples&#x27; skin, as our chemistry is different from person to person.  I like that I can get this for such a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After hearing about the popularity of this fragrance, I decided to give it a try. The order came quickly, but I believe the scent of the cologne wasn&#x27;t in the bottle! I expected, as advertised, notes of leather and cedar. I only smell, too much cinnamon, alcohol, and some other mess. Sorely disappointed! This stuff has me smelling like a giant stick of Big Red.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff becasue I had it when I was a kid and I suppose I loved it then.  Strong stuff that swaggers. Big sandalwood, and lemon and mossy leather in a loud 80&#x27;s sweater that somehow still looks good on you, coming down the street.  Not for everyone, but once it dries down, it&#x27;s a favorite that last all day, and if you are careful, will not project so far as to offend.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this isn&#x27;t more popular. I bought it for my husband, and it&#x27;s so awesome. Makes him smell amazing. without getting too crazy with descriptions.&lt;br /&gt;musky, a little spicy and not offensive AT ALL/</li>
            <li> Have always liked this cologne</li>
            <li> My father in law loves his new Halston cologne.  He enjoys the earthy scent and the price was lower than in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my husband before and he likes this cologne. He has been wearing it for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time .excellent product better than expected ! cant beat the price ! cant find it in the area for less than double this price !</li>
            <li> Husbands all time favorite, could not pass up getting it for him. The price is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent. It did not do well in the market, and oak moss, one of its key foundation ingredients, was basically banned by the fragrance regulatory authority, so these two facts have led to a very cheap reformulation that is not especially complex or interesting. What we have here is the slightest 10 minute duration hint of citrus followed by an almost entirely cinnamon scent that lasts for another 4 hours or so. The fragrance does not project well, and lasts less than most other masculine fragrances. If you want a cheap way to smell like cinnamon, here is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the rave reviews here are probably based on vintage stock of this fragrance before the oak moss was removed and the formula was changed to Eau de Cinnamon. I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want this these days, at least in the modern formulation. If you want a cheap good male fragrance, Grey Flannel by G. Beene or Tuscany by Aramis are only slightly more than this and both smell like something other than a Christmas spice. Z14 is not unpleasant, and is certainly the best cheap fragrance you can find at the average Target. (Though even there Stetson and Old Spice are highly competitive...) Just be forewarned that if you get the modern reformulation, you are getting exactly what you pay for: a simple, linear, short-lived fragrance.</li>
            <li> I still have a small amount of the original Halston cologne and the original has a rich deep fragrance that lasts for hours and hours - until the next day. This stuff is is a weak and generic nondescript scent that is gone in a few hours. It is nothing like the original. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Since this is my spouse&#x27;s favorite cologne and the fact that he could not find it locally, he was very pleased.... to say the least.  Thank you for his nice Christmas present that he didn&#x27;t know he was going to get !!  The delivery was fast also and got here by Christmas !</li>
            <li> smells really good, and the girls like it. kinda woody adult smell.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said they thought that this and I-12 have been reformulated since the 70&#x27;s when it was introduced. I dont think they have, Z-14 still smells &amp;#34;cinamonny&amp;#34; like it did in the 80&#x27;s, when I first used it. I think cinnamon scores very high in the likeability category for attracting people to you, it also mask smells of my job well, at least for a little while. Again, like I-12 it smells nice, and is a little stronger and lasts longer, it still is basically a $15 dollar cologne though. You can buy $9 and $90 dollar cologne, if you want a lighthouse in the fog cologne spurge on the $90 bottle.</li>
            <li> Just got my shipment and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;The first impression is... &amp;#34; Wo... It&#x27;s good &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an expert but let me try and describe it.... With this fragrance on you will smell like you have had a bath with a lime scented body wash and had a cool water type after shave... in short &amp;#34; FRESH &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone of you have Halston 1-12 &amp; Z 14, please let me know if I should buy 1-12 !!?</li>
            <li> My favorite great cologne !!!  I highly recommend it AAA+++</li>
            <li> Found this at Sears while waiting for wife to try on all their clothes in the store. Wife actually likes it and she cant handle cologne. Most colognes are so over powering you offend people and wife has sinus issues and they bug her pretty easy too. This Z-14 on the other hand is not that way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Its a very nice fresh cut wood smell. Smells like the inside of a ceder chest with a very mild honeysuckle or something similar added in. Not enough to make it smell lady like by no means though because its more wood sented. The best thing about it was it had no alcahol smell like most mens cologne has. This is nice stuff! I can wear it anywere and not worry about bothering people.&lt;br /&gt;  Buying from Amazon and not paying retail is another plus in my book. Wifes happy to introduce me to people again too. It&lt;br /&gt; feels great to smell good again...lol</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews and thank the other reviewers for steering me right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a great scent, is strong enough to only need a couple sprays but is not overpowering. At the end of the week I have put my dirty clothes in the wash machine and after all that time sitting they still carry this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size and quality is great for the money and I can imagine it easily lasting a year with as little as I have to use each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smoke cigars and many colognes I have tried end up clashing with the smell of the smoke. This goes extremely well with it, not creating a smell that is even more offensive to some. The smell is great both on clothes fresh out of the wash and after I have had a cigar. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how it smells with cigarette smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my blind grandfather shopping a couple times per month. He immediately commented on the smell and I ended up ordering a bottle for him. One thing that is quite nice about this bottle for him is that the bottle seems almost like it was smashed on one side. Across the face of the bottle, it goes from wider to skinnier. While this may normally be overlooked, for him it is actually an extremely nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone without sight he can just pick up the bottle and, based on which way the slimmer/thicker sides are oriented, he can know which way it will spray without having to feel around on the head. I don&#x27;t know what the primary purpose of the bottle design was, if this was considered by Halston in the design, but when you are blind or start thinking like someone who is, things like this are just wonderful in making life a little easier for those who have a greater struggle. It took me all of 10 secs to turn the head to a good position and show my grandfather which way it was turned in relation to the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a full 5-stars for me. Both the product, and the usual Amazon experience, were great.</li>
            <li> husband has worn it for years, and fragrance lasts all day..and night</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews, not necessarily in Amazon reviews.  They say that this is an Old Man&#x27;s cologne.  Well, I&#x27;m an old man so, \\&quot;What&#x27;s up?\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not that gaggy soda pop stuff anyway.  It does not hang around forever, and after applied, I do not smell it after a while. \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me\\&quot;, not even my cologne.  It won&#x27;t stop an oncomer&#x27;s breath as you pass them in the dime store.</li>
