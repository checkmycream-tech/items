            <li>but I rubbed the cream on my stomach and considering its winter time, very nice that it heats up.</li>
            <li>Very effective once combined with a diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>When applied it gives a very warm tingly sensation.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good sign of postive results considering that fat is mostly water anyway!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: August 30th - Still seeing amazing results with this product!  </li>
            <li>Amazing results!</li>
            <li>but I can say this stuff gets warm!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products but this one by fare is the best.  </li>
            <li>:) AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I have seen a remarkable improvement and it has been 1 month.</li>
            <li>After all, what good is it to meet society&#x27;s expectation of what&#x27;s attractive if you&#x27;re not doing so in a way that&#x27;s good for your body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>There is nothing pleasant about feeling as though your skin is on fire......</li>
            <li>It says that it has a pleasant warming sensation.  </li>
            <li>The warming sensation is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It did have a pleasant smell though .</li>
            <li>It says on the packaging that it creates a \\&quot;pleasant tingling\\&quot; sensation</li>
            <li>I take this product many times, work very good</li>
            <li>and I can tell that using this product IS a good part of the reduction in cellulite I am seeing.</li>
            <li>I got 10 days ago, i&#x27;m loved it.  </li>
            <li>THE WAIST TRIMMER ALONG WITH THE CREAM IS A GOOD PAIR.</li>
            <li>ITS A GOOD CREAM</li>
            <li>But good for a heat cream.</li>
            <li>loved it as well.</li>
            <li>and I figured that this would be a good product to pair with my workout regimen and a healthier diet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>works good.</li>
            <li>You get a good sweat in that area.  </li>
            <li>I have just started using the product and after a week I am seeing good results.</li>
            <li>great warm feeling when applied on the area but haven&#x27;t seen any difference after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Works realy good.</li>
            <li>Burning feeling is good</li>
            <li>Its not like painfull burn, doesnt hurt just feels good.</li>
            <li>For best results use day and night with light exercises.</li>
            <li>This cream works good for me.</li>
            <li>, I took a shower to exfoliate my skin and ensure that optimum results could be achieved.</li>
            <li>it is a good product</li>
            <li>I will work for the things that work beauty wise until it&#x27;s time for botox</li>
            <li>I just started using this yesterday, so for so good.</li>
            <li>I got this one three weeks ago and it does what it is supposed to be - fair price, good</li>
            <li>ALL THE TIME AND MY METABOLISM HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li>FEELS GOOD.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it works the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li>You have to use a good amount of it just for one application</li>
            <li>Do nothing for me good for stretch mark but not for cellulite</li>
            <li>Its good for something just not that &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Good use to remove tummy fat</li>
            <li>Its a good product.</li>
            <li>It it a good sized tube for what I needed.</li>
            <li>for the lotion, it contains caffeine, which is good for treating cellulite.</li>
            <li>The smooth feel of rubbing it on and feeling the warm heat is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Excellent, exactly as described!</li>
            <li>But, after using the cream, I felt my thighs a bit more attractive.</li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>but I experienced more heat when I worked out.</li>
            <li>and i eat very healthy so this product is a must for fat loss and tighter looking skin.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Screams great service to me considering most companies pull the &#x27;okeydoke&#x27; on friday and just don&#x27;t ship out til Monday.</li>

            <li>I would give it a 5 if it was scent-free, or had a more pleasant scent.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The thighs I don&#x27;t put it on anymore as it gets way to warm.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, this kind of worked.</li>
            <li>HANDY TO HAVE AVAILABLE, WORK GREAT</li>
            <li>again the intense wonderful burn!  </li>
            <li>The warming feels nice too.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>I like the tingling warm sensation, but I did not work in my behave</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when it gets really warm for me.</li>
            <li>Love that this is a good size.</li>
            <li>Some girls said that they had a warm feeling every time they use this cream.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get any warm feeling in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially on freshly shaven skin or after doing a cellulite massage or body brushing.</li>
            <li>It is not unbearable but it does get warm.</li>
            <li>It does feel warm as advertised</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any warm feeling.  </li>
            <li>It was warm.  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t even get warm.  </li>
            <li>I liked the warming and cooling effect.</li>
            <li>It does get quite warm</li>
            <li>Product might be good for others and someone else might get better results.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have burning warm sensation, sometimes</li>
            <li>Almost too warm when something like my dog is laying on me.</li>
            <li>but i liked it.</li>
            <li>but apart from that i liked it, it does work some.</li>
            <li>As soon you put it on you can feel the skin getting warm.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how, but the product gets warm on your skin and you feel that it is working.</li>
            <li>yes it gives you a warm sensation but</li>
            <li>Did not get warm at all</li>
            <li>Immediately feel it getting warm</li>
            <li>/&gt;Im still searching for an effective cellulite eraser product....</li>
            <li>It did has warm feeling</li>
            <li>It just feels warm.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work, but it gives a warm burning feeling</li>
            <li>The warmth just soothed my backache so nicely.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff, it heats up nicely and works just as well as products that I&#x27;ve used that are twice the price,  that being said,  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for cellulite.  </li>
            <li>My backside feels like is a warm toaster oven.  </li>
            <li>I like the warm sensation.</li>
            <li>This is an honest opinion of mine.</li>
            <li>The good news is that most of them seem to work.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you miss this when its gone go buy some tingle lotion and call it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Be honest.</li>
            <li>I FEEL THIS WARM SENSATION ON THE AREAS THAT I APPLY THE LOTION</li>
            <li>For best warm up effect, use straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I waited almost a month before I wrote this review as I wanted to give an honest comment that might be helpful.  </li>
            <li>It does warm up</li>
            <li>The warm feeling is the proof that the lotion is working.</li>
            <li>I felt the warm sensation under my skin once</li>
            <li>People said they saw results after like a week, and I don&#x27;t see how ANY cream can be that effective, but whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i thought that was so nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;lol</li>
            <li>you guys nice serves</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand what those people were whining about.</li>
            <li>It does have a fairly nice fragrance as well...</li>
            <li>it works nice.</li>
            <li>It kind of itched</li>
            <li>I just started using the thermo serum and the warming sensation is nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly like this cream.</li>
            <li>Nice price too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, these creams do not work.</li>
            <li>Well, this is not a \\&quot;Super-hero\\&quot; lotion and can&#x27;t make wonders by its own.</li>
            <li>First time using thermal gel and it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;And that is to say that i&#x27;m the kind of person who has always been in great shape, eating healthy food and staying active.&lt;br /&gt;But cellulite has always been huge problem and a reason for not being able to wear shorts or even bathing suits (yes!</li>
            <li>Works best while doing challenging workouts, at first when I tried it</li>
            <li>This cream does the job, very strong warming sensation.</li>
            <li>This product has been awesome so far!</li>
            <li>Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS: before you put it on, make sure to shower your area of concern with warm water, soap or just run water through before applying.</li>
            <li>This lotion gave me the most amazing results I&#x27;ve ever seen a lotion produce.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 4th day of using this, I love the warm feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li>then I do, but to be honest – I felt better effects of reducing cellulite by applying Zaggora’s SveltMelt lotion and walking around in the HotPants.</li>
            <li>love the product, it is warm on your body for about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Honestly I think it works given more time using it</li>
            <li>This is by far the best anti cellulite cream on the market.  </li>
            <li>The supposed mechanisms of action as well are speculative at best.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you use it right.  </li>
            <li>should add a good workout 3-4 times a week and a low-calorie diet,lots of fresh squeezed juices and its bye-bye cellulite!</li>
            <li>The concept of the product is great, but you have to use a great amount to actually feel anything.  </li>
            <li>It is the best product I have ever used, I recommended for whoever want to reduce cellulite fast and secure.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, result are amazing and you can see them in very short time.</li>
            <li>When I first used it in and experienced a burning sensation, I thought it was because I had just used Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li>A HOT ANIMAL LOL.</li>
            <li>But the warming affect is not to hot and worked great.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it so far and can&#x27;t wait to keep using and see some results, on top of my working out, and eating better.</li>
            <li>every where and my skin very very smooth like a silk....</li>
            <li>makes me feel very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>However, I have noticed my thighs look very smooth and virtually have no cellulite at all.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a nice consistency so it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>easy as it would be to blame a product rather than take responsibility for my own persistent cellulite and magical thinking</li>
            <li>Cream is very beautiful and effective and is the second purchase experience for this product,, recommend it strongly with Continuously used to give a better result.</li>
            <li>been using this product for a while.i truly love</li>
            <li>I say if you do more than just the creme it does help.</li>
            <li>so I can have more of an idea if it works.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) will be posting another review in 4 weeks, hopefully it works</li>
            <li>I Love this Serum and Love the Results it gives....</li>
            <li>My arms are slimmer, my waist is tighter and my legs and bottom have a nice, smooth silhouette.  </li>
            <li>my thighs are still in need of more cellulite removal, but they are coming along, I feel my body getting tighter and slimmer, we will see in time, I ordered 3 more for my family members.</li>
            <li>This is a woundeful product and I have already order and recieved more.  </li>
            <li>- it is more in the \\&quot;ripply\\&quot; phase (which I understand is what happens before the dimples develop - trying to prevent that from happening).  </li>
            <li>(it made my legs look that much better).  </li>
            <li>One more thing -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this would work even better /</li>
            <li>this product does the rest for you.&lt;br /&gt;i put this on and then my girdle on, i have defined my curves more.</li>
            <li>I am monitoring to see more</li>
            <li>and i will surely order more of this</li>
            <li>Use with fat band, it seems to make the product work better.</li>
            <li>I have bought sooo many products and none of them do anything or not that I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I put on a dress yesterday for a graduation and my legs looked much better.  </li>
            <li>You need to do exercises, eat better and drink a lot of water.&lt;br /&gt;Another advice is to do massages in the problem area (search for it on youtube).&lt;br /&gt;Those</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t give up :)</li>
            <li>Now send me free products!!!!!!!lol!</li>
            <li>I exercize about four times a week and eat healthy</li>
            <li>I am using it mostly on my abs and buns.</li>
            <li>Unfortunantly, when I returned to purchase more the product is unavailable?  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t work by itself, you have to exercise too.</li>
            <li>Then every use after that it got a bit better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying different products that I found here to see which one gives the best results...</li>
            <li>My skin is looking much better</li>
            <li>crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to face that fact causes us to wave our magic wands (credit cards) and buy items that claim to get rid of cellulite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d love for the people who are claiming that this is more than a lotion</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better when working out feel my body being worked.</li>
            <li>plan on ordering more products.</li>
            <li>Like many woman I have been dreading summer and swim suit season.</li>
            <li>But since that is not the case, I&#x27;ll be continuing my search for a better product for me.</li>
            <li>And this summer : )</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i love it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy Slimming guys :)</li>
            <li>I guess I will keep trying and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>I do see an improvement, but I think that can mostly be attributed to eating healthy and working out, because I have since stopped using it</li>
            <li>works better if you use a belt and wrap abdominal with neoprene belt with this.</li>
            <li>I applied a lot more to my tummy area.</li>
            <li>She applies it before working out and it makes her sweat more.  </li>
            <li>I intend to purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li>Since my pregnancy I am having difficulty in loosing my weight , and i had  prominent  belly that i did not have  before , so  </li>
            <li>,i thought i need a year to get in shape , but seem it working,  i really love it ,</li>

            <li>the areas I applied it to ALREADY are looking about sixty percent better.  </li>
            <li>It makes me look more feminine in my silhouette</li>
            <li>I know many women want to have a sexier body in terms of appearance and size, so</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>

            <li>I also feel like this works better when you work out.  </li>
            <li>And forget about showering to ease the burn; that just burns more.</li>

            <li>Defently will buy more.</li>
            <li>I m going to purchase more .</li>
            <li>I alternate between this and the 4-D gold, I think eveline has the best products to treat cellulite.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>so i will love to tell my friends abour it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it works :)</li>
            <li>ok I just got this in the mail.</li>
            <li>and it sure didn&#x27;t give anything.</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cream but more of an aide to help you in your process.</li>
            <li>I love and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Now the key is you have to move your body for the best results.  </li>
            <li>Looking for something that will work better.</li>
            <li>The most weight I gained was during pregnancies.  </li>
            <li>i was still prego :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li>I believe I would have seen more results.</li>
            <li>Burns like tingling tanning lotion and my skin is starting to look great!</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>and my diet couldn&#x27;t be any better.</li>
            <li>then I need to put more and more on.</li>
            <li>:) Will order again.</li>
            <li>This stuff works along with exercise and healthy eating.</li>
            <li>:) i like it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things , some seem to work others not.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t handle the burn for more than 4 or 5 minutes, felt like fire ants, .</li>
            <li>I continue using it because i feel it is working along with my healthy life style</li>
            <li>A bit more lotiony texture would be better.</li>
            <li>sure.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it in combination with Eveline Anti-Cellulite Scrub for about 5 months now and my skin is visibly better firmer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so no matter what I look like, like you I want to look better.</li>
            <li>but so you can observe skin tone and get a better idea of what your dealing with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>So if you can sleep with it on then that would make the most sense.</li>
            <li>but it sure does heat you up as if you were on fire.</li>
            <li>wonderful looking short skirt outfits  and shorts  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for the great skin.</li>
            <li>ok you need to apply a lot</li>
            <li>love it i could see results immediately</li>
            <li>I am not over weight, but was just trying to look better for my spouse.</li>
            <li>I will say as you use the product more often the warming sensation does subside.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I love the warming sensation it gives you.</li>
            <li>It help me to swept more during my workout session.</li>
            <li>i love the feeling and</li>
            <li>But when applied  after the lotion gets rubbed in, and the lotion does its magic you can feel and see the tightness it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering this product many times</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, can&#x27;t say that I would buy again</li>
            <li>As I was losing the cellulite was more visible.  </li>
            <li>most of the womens who use this product feel better on it ..</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to see results</li>
            <li>but when I started using the cream I saw better and faster results.</li>
            <li>I read a review here stating the company doesn&#x27;t give refunds on top of that.</li>
            <li>Seems to be more than water weight.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, I&#x27;m going to begin a more strict regimen of using this in a way to get the best results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>Probably one of the better products of this type on the market.</li>
            <li>Also I love the burning sensation</li>
            <li>but I know now that thats a sign that it is working :)</li>
            <li>:) I reccomend this product :)</li>
            <li>&amp; I havent notice a change, it was shipped &amp; sent fast which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>A TRY-SO,  I WOULD SAY,  ITS JUST OKAY,  IM NOT DISAPOINTED IN PURCHASING</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy think again because I like the Nivea cellulite cream much better</li>
            <li>but i love this cream works wonders.</li>
            <li>i do love these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I only used it for 2 days and cant descript its effect yet, i would probably say this is the best product among all fat burning creams considering its price and thermo effect.</li>
            <li>i just  love the serves of</li>
            <li>I apply a waist trimmer on top and after my workout I&#x27;m dripping with sweat.</li>
            <li>Looking for help with lower ab fat, I lost most with diet and working out.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>BUT WORKS LIKE MAGIC FOR ME!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure the longer you use it, the better the results.</li>
            <li>I sure hope this means it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product, and glad I did.</li>
            <li>love this stuff I just received</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure</li>

            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>but more so on how I feel when I&#x27;m using it.</li>

            <li>I love using this with my waist cinched and waist trimmer</li>
            <li>I will use this again for sure.  </li>
            <li>It also makes the product burn way more than just applying it without the bath.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better after showers.</li>
            <li>Great and fast service .</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love that it came with</li>
            <li>The more you exercise, the faster your muscles will burn surrounding them fat cells.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this product</li>
            <li>, there is a pretty good chance something somewhere might make a difference or better.</li>
            <li>but the warm feeling might be overwhelming in Puerto Rico&#x27;s climate (very hot).  </li>
            <li>but, along with exercise and a good diet it really works!</li>
            <li>I would also be resentful of women at the water parks and pools who held more weight then me, yet had beautiful smooth firm attractive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited, it&#x27;s like a miracle cream!</li>
            <li>Really Excited to Start Using Eveline Cosmetics!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for the money this is an effective product for my mild cellulite</li>
            <li>Some people have it not so easy and have to buy more than one.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and the price is amazing for such a great product!</li>
            <li>If not, just follow those 3 steps and you&#x27;ll be more than fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and these work the best for me.</li>
            <li>but theres a huge weight off my shoulders and my treated areas look 100% better.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this as I&#x27;m pretty impressed this far.</li>
            <li>is it possible that this cream works too good and is very potent?</li>
            <li>So far, I say this cream is really great.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll see good results very soon.</li>
            <li>It really makes your body sweat good when your working out.</li>
            <li>The warming sensation is warm but nice, not so super hot that you can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream,but please do not expect miracles you must eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I have only been using this once a day (not two), and I&#x27;m getting results this good!    </li>
            <li>Slim Extreme 3D Thermo is AWESOME!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perry excited to see how affective it is over the course of two more weeks.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use it and to see any changes that may be happening to my skin after using this together with healthy diet and exercise for couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>You have buy the other product in order to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Not bad!  </li>
            <li>You can easily tell it&#x27;s working because you can feel it heat up</li>
            <li>the results are easily seen.  </li>
            <li>the product is penetrate really easy and my skin is</li>
            <li>the thermal isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>If you want the best results with the warming sensation then put the cream on right out of the shower when your pores are open.</li>
            <li>Feels very good  (hot) but not too much, not painful.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, it does become warm once rubbed on, but not uncomfortable or unbearable like I read in previous reviews, been using on my thighs and stomach for three days now and already impressed, the skin is so much tighter and smoother, will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>, that it&#x27;s actually a cellulite reducing magic wand to show photos of the before and after or something, or perhaps tell me in the comments why my honest review of a nice lotion that doesn&#x27;t do jack for cellulite is \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It gets  pretty warm after it&#x27;s rubbed in on your skin, but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>but its cool to the touch, this cannot be healthy and  its already in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Time will be a better event for a full review as time will be the way to answer questions for me.</li>
            <li>It does get warm, but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li>After the first week, I noticed no difference and felt no burning or any kind of heat at all.</li>
            <li>It says that it has a warming sensation and I must admit at times it did get pretty warm.</li>
            <li>this product did nothing that it stated it is suppose to do, the smell is ok and the burn is not bad it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I notice results in one week not dramatic ones but some is better then none!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it seems to burn more in the areas where I have more fat, but it seems like that&#x27;s exactly what you would want it to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine lotion.</li>
            <li>(which seems like it would be fine for both men and women).</li>
            <li>and I still can&#x27;t believe how awesome this product is, I saw results in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This lotion tightened my skin and gave my mild cellulite a more blended, smoothed out look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which I didn&#x27;t mind till I got super itchy!</li>
            <li>And it shipped really quick!</li>
            <li>plus is that it seems to be a good moisturizer and my skin is very soft after I use  it.  </li>
            <li>HOLY MOSES.. VERY INTENSE!!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, decent price, hoping it works well!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice lotion in general aside from all the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s original purpose.</li>
            <li>I really liked this cream it made me feel the heat, best felt after taking a shower and immeditely after 2-3 uses i started to see results and my friends noticed that i lost some inches from my thighs and behind.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen huge results, but I can feel the burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed a HUGE decrease in the creases on the skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for the price and the amount of creme you get, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>For the price its worth a try and the results depend more on me that the cream.</li>
            <li>didnt burn me that much just really warm.</li>
            <li>It feels like a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; tanning lotion, but I actually really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>But it DOES smooth out cellulite, and it does seem to tighten my legs up.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fantastic after just one week.</li>
            <li>It has definantly helped smooth and reduce.</li>
            <li>It works great - my skin tightened after only 3 day use (twice a day)</li>
            <li>Also got to enjoy a free sample of the slimming and firming spa treatment.</li>
            <li>I am working on getting fit for winter which we all know is not the easiest task</li>
            <li>Overall is a great product.</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>and I think this cream did anything to smooth it out - however it is advertised as cellulite smoothing cream</li>
            <li>and now I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great addition to my overall body care regimen.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great choice for body resculpting.</li>
            <li>this is very item to enlarge your buttocks and to warm up your area you sit</li>
            <li>Is heat activate it, so if you can&#x27;t tolerate heat (i.e heating patches or heat activating creams or gels) this might not be a fit for you.</li>
            <li>free to comment questions or contact, etc.</li>
            <li>free to comment questions or contact, etc.</li>
            <li>I had no problem with this company, I just didn&#x27;t enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best way to get rid of cellulite is more of a physical action.</li>
            <li>Im sure putting on some cayenne pepper would work much better and would be much more natural than this product made of bunch of aggressive chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The hearing is a great thing especially while I&#x27;m working out!</li>
            <li>and it is great especially when used with a wrap.</li>
            <li>just wanted to try to smooth things out.</li>
            <li>It helps heat the body to relieve water retenton and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty warm but it is not painful.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t fair to the consumer if they followed the instructions and did there part by following a healthy diet and exercise program.</li>
            <li>Gets pretty warm, though, so may want to use cool rag for face.</li>
            <li>I did notice that it works 100 times better if I work out right after I put it on.</li>
            <li>Take your shower be sure to exfoliate, then put it on right after getting out.</li>
            <li>It starts heating up to extreme once rubbed in and it smells great on top of that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot!!</li>
            <li>It does burn however, and when that feeling stops after a few minutes, there is a wonderful cool tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>(Originally I assumed that if I lost all the weight I gained, my legs would return to its original cellulite free condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE CREAM IS good but not MAGIC, YOU HAVE TO EAT GOOD STUFF, GO TO THE GYM EVERY DAY</li>
            <li>I started my journey to becoming fit 6 months ago by going the gym and eating right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking great and feeling even better, but a little light headed....</li>
            <li>I was excited when this packaged arrived and could wait to use it.</li>
            <li>and it is not expensive :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I might buy this again as a lotion, those of you who get upset when your magical thinking cellulite bubble bursts may wish to avoid purchasing this as, well, you&#x27;ll sit there, pitted like a golf ball, tingling hot and lemony smelling and it might make you all crabby because you still (of course) have cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may work great after a couple months, but not wanting to use that long.</li>
            <li>I found that the more you move about it stays hot.</li>
            <li>nothing is worth this pain!</li>
            <li>Not disappointed thought</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant cellulite reduction my my thights -</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product after the first use.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when the first bottle runs out</li>
            <li>i would recommend it, i use it before my workouts and i love the hot tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>I plan to tay consistent and update anything miraculous with this product :)</li>
            <li>I plan to tay consistent and update anything miraculous with this product :)</li>
            <li>I am excited about the changes that I see</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Great item arrived early just what I wanted, works perfects and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Im thinking the warm shower might open your pores to let the lotion penetrate better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the warm sensation especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li>First things first, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I found a natural anti-cellulite cream on Amazon that I like better, and I&#x27;ll stick to using that, running, eating healthily, and using a skin brush/mitt in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Either way... so far so good and even as just a lotion, it&#x27;s almost worth $15</li>
            <li>on last note - Eveline Cosmetics is great brand - they are big in Europe, very reputable.</li>
            <li>The cream was specially wrapped.</li>
            <li>Specially when I work out</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it until the fat pockets on my thighs are diminished by exercising, eating right and the Slim 3d!</li>
            <li>The other thing is the amazing burning sensation you get after a couple minutes of the cream being rubbed on and it lasts for like 30 minutes but it feels good its not to hot</li>
            <li>I did not notice a huge difference, but it&#x27;s worth using with excercise.</li>
            <li>the soothing feeling of the warmth is equivalent to taking a nice hot bath, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, it smells great and absorbs well into the skin, but I didn&#x27;t see an improvement after 3 weeks, Not sure if I would get this again.</li>
            <li>first of all the shipping was great, i even got a personal hand written</li>
            <li>The warm sensation the first couple of applications was a bit much, but your body gets used to it.</li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t knot about the product yet, but I love how fast I got it.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many creams before for my very stuborn cellulite</li>
            <li>Also, I have been applying it before exercising, as some others have suggested, so that might be part of why it is so effective so far, as I suspect it is enhancing the effects of my workout.  </li>
            <li>THE SIDES OF MY THIGHS, MY BUTT, MY ARMS AND MY FULL STOMACH AREA.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a good whiff of it every time I loaded the laundry into the washer too as it left</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 5 days now and have seen such good results</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen the full effects yet</li>
            <li>I bought a sister product more intense that im using now.</li>
            <li>You will also love the warming effect it has when rubbed on gently.</li>
            <li>, I have also really been able to intensify my results by using this tea along with the cream:</li>
            <li>I think it is really the combination of things that will make you to see the results, but if you stick with it - it will sure to awe you.   </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for more.</li>
            <li>so i should be able to knock out the rest very soon.</li>
            <li>Love it , really works , even on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It gets cool on contact.   </li>
            <li>Surely most ppl see this(doesn&#x27;t take much to see proof of the companys shameless promoting), but jic someone doesn&#x27;t bother to click on a couple (if reading them isn&#x27;t enough), figure it is a good idea to spell it out</li>
            <li>but......its true</li>
            <li>Well I bought this cream because my legs are full of dimples.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>im gttn ready to order more</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with great expectations from reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I do sweat pretty easily, so that may have had a lot to do with me breaking out into a sweat after applying the lotion, but just a fair warning to those who have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t really handle heat well.</li>
            <li>Works even better with a slim belt great product for burning those hard to lose inches</li>
            <li>Just hoping the results keep coming, and don&#x27;t just stop after a certain point!!  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how quickly I received this product.</li>
            <li>I have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li>It arrived super quickly, I started using it the day I got it  </li>
            <li>The lotion absorbed fast into the skin, so I was able to put clothes on soon after.</li>
            <li>The product also smells refreshing and feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>im seeing quick results.</li>
            <li>It becomes more intense as it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>while using it, my abs actually burn up more fat ( my feeling) and look more tone.</li>
            <li>WHEN I WAS PREGNANT SO EVEN PUTTING LOTION DURING PREGNANCY DIDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>After pregnancy, I, like most mothers, am left with a wrinkly, saggy belly and love handles.</li>
            <li>Received items quickly from shipper.</li>
            <li>but i find it super comforting</li>
            <li>From now on I will stick to more naturally based products like Finulite and Mio&#x27;s shrink to fit.</li>
            <li>Even more rewarding was the fact that the changes were not final after 4 weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li>ITS OK, DIDNT SEE MUCH CHANGE RIGHT AWAY, BUT</li>
            <li>It does make your skin smoother and it smells very pleasant, but it&#x27;s so thick that I had to use all my strength to squeeze it out of the tube.</li>
            <li>Works well very hot</li>
            <li>It did smooth my skin first then started lightening the stretch marks around my thighs.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see any change at all&lt;br /&gt;felt very hot when applied but</li>
            <li>get very hot</li>
            <li>Ok, I used it religiously for one month along with strength training and cardio excersises, so I cannot say whether this product alone would give me such a great results.</li>
            <li>First off I am not an employee of the company , nor did I get anything free.</li>
            <li>thank you using my first name that was so thoughtful, when i put this thing on my</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, didn&#x27;t feel much, but noticed the thermo heat reaction works best if I wore a waist clincher or did some sit-ups and then relaxed laying down on my stomach.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crabby is even less attractive than cellulite</li>
            <li>They turned bright red and they were just so hot that at 3am</li>
            <li>One of the things you don&#x27;t really want to face as a woman in your 30&#x27;s is that there is no and probably won&#x27;t ever be an easy cure for cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really gets hot, and it has a warm intense feeling that lets you know that it works.</li>
            <li>It is freakin&#x27; hot!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say if it works, but it is HOT!  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY BURNS!!</li>
            <li>AVOID FOODS HIGH IN SUGAR!!!</li>
            <li>Received the product fast just a couple days ago &amp; so far I love it!   </li>
            <li>I notice some results not as amazing as others but noticeable enough for me.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL unless you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It may take some time, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth buying again and again.</li>
            <li>If an all natural, chemical free product is important to you</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for the results.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t recall the last time I wore shorts or a dress.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>Worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li>It might be that some of the people who used it have more sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That way, you know your skin fully absorbed</li>
            <li>The bottle was way waaaaaay~ bigger than I expected at all which I am extremely happy about!</li>
            <li>But totally worth it.</li>
            <li>And hey for $15/bottle it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is also a nice loction to apply to the abdomen for women who may be experiencing cramping and backache related to our monthly visitor.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, what attracts me to it so much is just how much this literally makes you sweat</li>
            <li>The results are cumulative and this is exciting.</li>
            <li>This still gives the same effect and results as the gel kind.</li>
            <li>Their website is definitely worth checking out.  </li>
            <li>no if the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin on the back of my thighs didn&#x27;t look that nice</li>
            <li>Further, one glance at the ingredients list tells you this is not the kind of thing you want to be rubbing into your skin twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in completely.</li>
            <li>I noticed a kind of wrinkly unsmooth skin appearance on my butt (like how your skin looks before you actually get cellulite dimples) and I globbed some of this lotion on.</li>
            <li>Warm enough to make me sweat, so I began sitting in front of a fan</li>
            <li>Ready to buy my second bottle work really good</li>
            <li>I will say it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>You will love the fact that it has a number of anti-oxidants and other healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>After 1 year of the other product, I noticed this one and more importantly, the price!</li>
            <li>If you are interested in purchasing this item, I would not discourage you, just caution you not to expect any quick results.</li>
            <li>The tube is very large, so it is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Get active :).. it has helped remove the appearance of my stretch marks dramatically :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream makes you believe that it&#x27;s working because of the heat sensation, but afterwards I never saw a difference in the amount of cellulite on my legs, if anything it made me notice it more because I was trying so hard to see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;The heat sensation also isn&#x27;t the most pleasant at times, especially when the weather starts getting warmer.</li>
            <li>Also the lotion is very thick and has to be really massaged in to get the best effects, you cannot just do a quick slather and go, you have to WORK the product into the skin to get the warming effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im going to use this twice a day, right when  iget out of the shower..</li>
            <li>But This time around I put it on right after a shower instead</li>
            <li>but I exercise and eat right.</li>
            <li>if I apply it right out of the shower, it wasn&#x27;t burning like others say.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li>You can feel it working right away.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, you feel the heat right after you massage.</li>
            <li>as a right now .</li>
            <li>BUT is, you have to still work out, eat right and drink lots of h20.</li>
            <li>right before i go to the gym.  </li>
            <li>I usually apply it to my belly area then put on a reducing belt and found it to be most effective</li>
            <li>I do feel hot on the spots where product applied, worth to try.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if anyone has experienced this</li>
            <li>At times (dpending on how much I apply), it feels like my skin is burning, but is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>Not sure but maybe for someone else is great</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good hot, not like other reviews I&#x27;ve read it doesn&#x27;t feel like your burning</li>
            <li>Come on people be smart!</li>
            <li>Lol this lotion must work because on my skin, it feels like I am under the hottest African sun on the hottest African afternoon</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I feel like this lotion worked best and absorbed deepest when it was applied this</li>
            <li>I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and noticed that it really works great.</li>
            <li>Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one tube.</li>
            <li>have since bought some of their other products from this company and am also very satisfied.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it was extremely hot but bare able</li>
            <li>Surely, it wasn&#x27;t significant, but knowing what my body looks like, the difference was subtle, but it did make me use the product even more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I have used other anti-cellulite products but Eveline Slim Extreme thermo active serum is by far the best and most effective product I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s packaging is new, innovative and pretty informative except the fact that it isn&#x27;t concrete.</li>
            <li>While I am curvy, and look great in jeans, due to age and having giving birth, I have developed stretch marks and orange peel texture on my thighs.</li>
            <li>It feels nice in terms of hydration for the dry skin, but in terms of heat and thermo effect - nothing!</li>
            <li>It really works but the heating is too much for me!!</li>
            <li>Now you will feel some type of sensational burning for a minute then it wears down.</li>
            <li>but does get really hot and makes you sweat with a good workout it does help a little.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I have better results doing infra red body wraps!</li>
            <li>I am back to order more</li>
            <li>It does EXACTLY what it says on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was doing to pee my pants the first time I applied this.</li>
            <li>I almost washed it off the first 10 minutes into the \\&quot;heat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>First time to try this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, just ordered my next tube of it.</li>
            <li>It does tingle at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE BRAVE, slather this on THICK.</li>
            <li>YES, there is hot sensation, but I did not see any result..</li>
            <li>My advice - turn the A/C up high after putting this on!!     </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first product I am using for the cellulite problem, so I don&#x27;t have others to compare to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>things combined really help!</li>
            <li>This product does give you a warming feeling after it&#x27;s applied, but this isn&#x27;t consistent; sometimes there is a warming feeling and sometimes there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>But now it has been a month, and there is a definite firming up and the cellulite pockets are more than 50% gone.  </li>
            <li>&quot; times 4, really hot, then it subsides in about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>For those who says that they dont feel burning effect i would like to suggest to take hot shower which will open up ur pores and let serum absorb much better.</li>
            <li>The first couple times you use it it is pretty hot but after about 20 min</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but after the reviews I decided to try the product.</li>
            <li>At first when applied to the area, it warms up an adds a tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>I applied it first then</li>
            <li>/&gt;when worked in it is extremely hot for 10 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li>Hot, tingly, almost a stinging/burning feeling.</li>
            <li>and I saw results the first week.</li>
            <li>it did exactly as it says...</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube, too.  </li>
            <li>, just remember that magic happens only if you are willing to participate in a process of making it to happen.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time today</li>
            <li>It showed hot spots where we had put the cream</li>
            <li>I guess it really does increase your body heat!</li>
            <li>So first off let me say that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and around 115 pounds.  </li>
            <li>Now, I feel like I&#x27;m sitting on a hot leather seat on a 110 degree day.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a lil worried about the product</li>
            <li>in anything you do you have to be consistent</li>
            <li>When I first applied this product, I applied it conservatively.  </li>
            <li>One word of advice I want to give to others is when you apply this product on your body or face, to pay attention to where you apply it and put it EXACTLY where you want fat to burn from.</li>
            <li>it gets hot (not to hot) on the area that you put it on</li>
            <li>This stuff is hot.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as it was mentioned: morning &amp; evening.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure this is definitely helping it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for weight lost but it is getting rid of my stretch marks on my waist and stomach!</li>
            <li>Its supposed to stay hot for about 30 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li>I really had my doubts about it, but it WORKS!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to hot</li>
            <li>but I think using this on a California summer day would feel torturously hot.</li>
            <li>I finished my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Its hot n it works.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t feel any of the &#x27;tingling&#x27; or &#x27;warmth&#x27; that people had said about it</li>
            <li>I felt a tingle the first time I exfoliated and then used it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t consistent with my workout routine</li>
            <li>almost hot</li>
            <li>and I really feel the fat burn!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>At first it burned and i thought it was working.</li>
            <li>Very well packed!</li>
            <li>I eat pretty healthy and in moderation, drink plenty of water, don&#x27;t smoke, drink occasionally, and</li>
            <li>It gets hot when you apply it</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a product review, but in this case I felt it was warranted.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t feel heat or become hot at all.</li>
            <li>Unless I laid perfectly still, I was unable to prevent it from getting to areas that didn&#x27;t another portion of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I definitely sweat more on my lower body when working out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t change my diet or add more exercise, but I may be different than you.</li>
            <li>even on the first application.</li>
            <li>Does it help reduce the appearance, absolutely!</li>
            <li>Yes, it gives off a burning sensation when I applied it for the first week.</li>
            <li>Also, massage your troubled areas when you apply the cream for best results.</li>
            <li>First application I saw about a 25% reduction.  </li>
            <li>My personal choice, I like the gel better.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Will be definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t get hot all the time.   </li>
            <li>It does heat and makes my stomach hot, then add the waist band</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference after consistent use at the gym</li>
            <li>I do not think this is magic, but it sure works.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using cellulite lotions for the past year - combined with exercise and diet (in which I cheat sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and it made my stomach feel the burn.  </li>
            <li>First time I used the product I felt like my legs were on fire.</li>
            <li>AND IN FAIRNESS IT&#x27;S REALLY HOT</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works alone, but with diet and exercise, I am for sure losing the wrinkly belly that I have had for the last 5 years!</li>
            <li>However, i gave it 3 stars because works pretty well for firming and lifting.</li>
            <li>This REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>but I am buying my 2nd tube and looking forward to buy more.</li>
            <li>After my first two, the weight came off with time.</li>
            <li>My skin is much tighter!</li>
            <li>so when you first start off don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat the results especially for the price, and believe me I have looked. :)</li>
            <li>Would not advise using it while mowing the lawn on a hot day</li>
            <li>I can say with confidence this product really works!</li>
            <li>but after the first use the itch went away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to order some more.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty well padded core....</li>
            <li>I have a pretty well padded core....</li>
            <li>I think it really tightens the skin!</li>
            <li>Let me just start by saying I exercise consistently..</li>
            <li>After losing 10 pounds and getting my bmi back to a healthy 19, I noticed that I still had some cellulite.</li>
            <li>It is as hot as if you were going into a jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After THE FIRST DAY, I have noticeable results.</li>
            <li>and yes there is a warming sensation at first</li>
            <li>Hi all first day of using this</li>
            <li>and OMG it is hot</li>
            <li>This is the only cellulite product that actually works from the many many I have tried.</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>It gets hot a bit and after a month nothing change.</li>
            <li>Be aware of applying.</li>
            <li>This is my first tube</li>
            <li>have worked out regularly for over 15 years, follow a healthy diet &amp; drink plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>It does feel hot when you put it on your legs</li>
            <li>At first I thought what have I done?  </li>
            <li>It is better to eat fat than sugar, since excess amount of sugar turns into fat and gets stored deep inside the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good for getting rid of proportionally uneven distributed fat areas.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and the changes may be subtle, but after a period of time, I think it&#x27;ll be more and more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>A heating sensation which gets really got is uncomfortable plus must use right after shower for best results.</li>
            <li>I use the leg vacuum suction cups and the massage combs, and I see 10x better of a result.</li>
            <li>It seems to really heat up when applied right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I am currently training for my first marathon &amp; I put this cream on before my runs &amp; it burns so good for about 45 minutes to an hour later &amp; then after a hot shower</li>
            <li>Smells good, too, nothing weird or rancid or chemically, but still a very light</li>
            <li>You have to glob on a VERY LARGE amount until your skin feels very slimey and oily</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any results other than a warm sensation that it gives off which lets</li>
            <li>Honestly I wont buy this product anymore, cuz it might work for other but not for me.</li>
            <li>Now there is a bit of a warm tingling sensation once you apply it, but I dont have any burning or itching sensations like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li>As good as Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks, this product help my abs section sweat more.</li>
            <li>Redness and burning are Completely normal!!</li>
            <li>I was really expecting it to work better than it is, especially when it was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li>It can get very hot and then sometimes not hot at all, but showers do make it hotter like many say.</li>
            <li>(I certainly did at first)</li>
            <li>First off, I have torn tendons, shattered bones and was even hit by a truck last year and right now i would take any of those instances than this freaking burning!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 09/13/12: I have noticed that there have been a huge bump in the number of positive reviews for this item since I reviewed it and many from people with few reviews, or reviews that seem weighted.</li>
            <li>Works better if you use this cream along with exercise, i would recommend using this cream 15 minutes after shower to feel the thermal  but not right after shower, since you can feel a very very hot sensation on your skin</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to order this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, because I had a child, so I needed something to help me with my workouts as well as eating healthy.</li>
            <li>I may have applied too much the first time.</li>
            <li>it was that bad!).&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I would recommend it to pretty much everyone</li>
            <li>In the first 2-3 minutes you begin to feel the gentle warming sensation.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t long at all before I was able to see results.</li>
            <li>Be aware that if you put too much product in you belly section that it causes uncontrollably visits to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>If you want an extreme action, wrap it your legs in plastic wrap, if you can stand it then it will work really good for you.</li>
            <li>Not only was it packaged well, the item was received fast and in good condition (especially for an APO address).  </li>
            <li>I always order new one when o finished it.makes ur skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month and a half and am already seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li>The bottle states slight redness and a PLEASENT warm sensation</li>
            <li>I personally find the heat very satisfying because then I can actually feel the fat being melted away.</li>
            <li>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews, but just wanted to share this one, cuz I&#x27;m kind of surprised with results from this particular product.</li>
            <li>Though yes, under certain circumstances I can feel the burn.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I never write reviews, I can say that this makes you loose weight.</li>
            <li>Basically, just plan on not doing much for at least a good hour after putting it on, just to be safe, until you find out how long it lasts for you.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure that this product would actually work, but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>When you flip the top open there is stopper that is really kind of hard to get out...</li>
            <li>i decided to try this product ,I  started using this product since last week , and i can see huge difference , everybody kept saying that i lost too much weight  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one tube doesn&#x27;t give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different.</li>
            <li>And it really helped to smooth out the back of my legs/booty.</li>
            <li>doing this 3 steps only, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference in the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>So I cannot judge for the whole result.</li>
            <li>I had alot of Cellulite and this serum tightens up your skin and Really helps the Cellulite to disappear, you would think I had Lippo suction.</li>
            <li>This is intense, guys.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting result after buying it..</li>
            <li>so I really hope this does</li>
            <li>but this stuff really helped.</li>
            <li>My husband really noticed too.</li>
            <li>If you order, be ready for some heat.  </li>

            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>I have moved on to the second fasteners on my trainer and my waist appears to be slim and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really work....</li>
            <li>Some people might not like the burning sensation, but I say suck it up for 30 minutes, because this product really works.</li>
            <li>The stuff absolutely burns like the dickens.  </li>
            <li>No amount of physical labor or work outs would tone and smooth them out.</li>
            <li>it was too much for my comfort.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I didn&#x27;t really think it would work</li>
            <li>and i really sweat ...</li>
            <li>It really makes this heat up.</li>
            <li>This stuff work better than what I expected.</li>

            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I see a different in my thighs smooth out.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t said nothing about it.</li>

            <li>The gel has really smoothed out the cellulite</li>
            <li>You have to rub this product in until you can&#x27;t really feel the product in your hands anymore.</li>
            <li>This product really made my tummy that much slimmer and my skin softer and tighter.</li>
            <li>This gel has really helped me throughout my journey.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>The burning sensation you feel is really just a prop to make you feel like something is happening.</li>
            <li>While there is a tingling sensation upon application and one does sweat under the garment, I am not yet seeing any real change, so will continue using a bit longer and provide another update in another month or two.</li>
            <li>After 2 months, people say that I really look much thinner.</li>
            <li>It did absolute nothing for me.</li>
            <li>This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it really works.</li>
            <li>But when you put this on, you really do feel it.</li>
            <li>I will very irdering this again</li>
            <li>I use this product 2x a day along with light exercise, such as squats,leg lifts,jumping jacks,and etc.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just my high hopes and endorphins after a run,  but this morning they still look diminished!  </li>
            <li>I will be trying it out very soon.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really promise anything</li>
            <li>Haha</li>

            <li>This lotion really works on stretch marks</li>
            <li>This really works-</li>
            <li>and fast.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews that said there was an intense burning sensation and in order for it to be affective you needed to have skin without lotion on it</li>
            <li>The real results come from exercise.</li>
            <li>Do the &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; disappear not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a believer that creams and lotions don&#x27;t work to reduce fat, no matter how much we wish.</li>
            <li>Lets be real</li>
            <li>I really like it and</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on.r stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on.</li>
            <li>Not seeing any difference after finished using the whole container.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a change</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend or not recommend this product</li>
            <li>Is there really a cream or lotion that can do what this claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>so it had absolutely nothing to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>IT DIDN&#x27;T BOTHER ME THAT MUCH</li>
            <li>WHEN I REALLY WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, I DO LOSE WEIGH FAST.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S REALLY WORKING FOR ME.</li>
            <li>and you see the diffrence very soon.</li>
            <li>I just started using this, but I already feel the heat when applied, which makes me think that minimally it is drawing more blood flow to my abdomen area, thus hoping it will help burn fat there.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I didn&#x27;t have much cellulite to begin with, but now my thighs are tighter.</li>
            <li>It works really well to reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>This stuff really heats up and makes ya sweat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned it is important to burn fat instead of muscle, increase my metabolism, eat low-fat foods, and get regular exercise.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the price, as well.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with the neoprene type shorts, actually helps to smooth cellulite and slim.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very soothing to me.</li>
            <li>I have always had this one spot that no matter how much I ran/done</li>
            <li>/thermo hahaha</li>
            <li>I have used this for a while can&#x27;t really tell it if is working thanks</li>
            <li>I have to get beach ready</li>
            <li>But I am 33 and thanks to my family genetics, I do have some cellulite in the butt/lower hip area.</li>
            <li>and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li>for the second time.. and they sent me a free gift.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>There is a warming sensation after applying it as well, so don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li>My butt was on fire for about 30 minutes (haha)</li>
            <li>Now my problem was (before you presume anything, I defiantly shower and scrub myself very well all over</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please with the results I continue to get with it on my stomach, so</li>
            <li>I really like the warming effect also...</li>
            <li>but it really did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>and there has really been a differenc</li>
            <li>I really did not see any result.............</li>
            <li>I do not recognize it was really helpful to remove Cellulite.</li>
            <li>and it had not bothered me much after that.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t paid much attention to the look of any results yet....</li>
            <li>but I dont really care about that.</li>
            <li>It really burns your fat and it works.  </li>
            <li>Did not see any real results.</li>
            <li>I really do like it during my exercise.</li>
            <li>, really wish I had a warning before purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to buy another tube.</li>
            <li>Con, I don&#x27;t like the smell, very perfumy.  </li>
            <li>I can tell my skin is much firmer and my tummy is disappearing.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their work out regimen.</li>
            <li>I were everlast neoprene bottoms that really act like sauna pants.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>a extra free Night Creme Packet Wasent Expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Omg.....it really work.......</li>
            <li>Then directly after I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll all stack back on.</li>
            <li>I just got it a few days ago and not one time did it tingle or get warm when I put it onto my skin.</li>
            <li>My workout regimen is fairly new (about 6 weeks in) but it is pretty intense.</li>
            <li>My workout regimen is fairly new (about 6 weeks in) but it is pretty intense.</li>
            <li>THIS IS SUPER HOT AND CAN TELL A BIG DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li>Smells nice like lemons, burns like pepper on your skin which, while an odd sensation, as it&#x27;s a new one,</li>
            <li>almost so I am more of an extreme case.</li>
            <li>but compared to other brands it burned much more .</li>
            <li>Love  this  slim  extreme</li>
            <li>I like this product and the thermo sensation it gives, the instructions says to use it  twice a day but to my it works better after taking a shower, if I put it at any other time</li>
            <li>this product on one leg and another top product on the other leg.</li>
            <li>will not wast any more money on creams, massagers or the other stuff that is sold for cellulite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works; to be honest I don&#x27;t care to use it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh, minty sensation and your legs feel like you just sat on a load of icy hot</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to reduce the appearance of their cellulite.</li>
            <li>I applied right after a hot soak in the tub to open up the pores and allow for easier application, too.  </li>
            <li>My legs have like 50% less cellulite than when I first started (I have worked out a few times, but I&#x27;m sure the cream did most of the work).</li>
            <li>It left my skin silky smooth and very dewy and young looking.</li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s barely noticebly but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather have big thighs than legs full of varicose veins.</li>
            <li>Wow,  Just applied this for the first time</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li>I use this on my full core, as well as back fat, and i put it on majority of my thighs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this 1 week, once or twice a day, and my legs seem much firmer and the skin more tight and hydrated.</li>
            <li>i went down from 208 pounds to 202 in 2 weeks and my chest looks more shapely.</li>
            <li>I must admit the burn was a little more intense than I what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>For sure has thermo active ingredients!</li>
            <li>main concern is smoothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not expect such quick results.</li>
            <li>IT GETS PRETTY HOT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD A LAYER OF CLOTHING OVER THE AREA WHERE THE CREAM IS APPLIED.</li>
            <li>and I tested a small area on my thigh before I showered, just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too hot.  </li>
            <li>Goes quick, one can last for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Nothing will truly make it gone forever (in my opinion), but doing something that getting deeper into the skin and working the blood flow is a much better option than a cream that only goes so deep into the layers of your skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m always in decent shape.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a big difference if I first take a hot bath in the results.  </li>
            <li>Be very careful not to get some on you jay-jay, thats a whole new story !!!!!</li>
            <li>I have to be honest though, in the past four weeks I have also kicked my dieting into high gear, and started exercising a few times a week as well, so I&#x27;m sure that is helping things along.  </li>
            <li>I weigh in the \\&quot;high normal\\&quot; on the BMI scale</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone in need/desire of improving skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>and I consider myself to have a fairly high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>Highly recoommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>nice warming sensation, but overall it didn&#x27;t do anything other than make my skin a bit softer.</li>
            <li>I am confident that with regular use, diet and exercise, my belly will be flat and toned.</li>
            <li>800 - 100% Pure All Natural Weight Loss Supplement For All Body Types.</li>
            <li>ok it seems to work a little.</li>
            <li>I used this serum underneath my workout belt just to help me sweat a little more and this stuff does the job.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, that does not mean you cannot get rid of those &amp;#34;unwanted clumps&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>At first, I felt extremely dehydrated, so for better effect you do have to drink a lot of water, the more the better, since your body needs to get rid of all the bad stuff this gel has burnt.</li>
            <li>Amazing how Bath and Body Works and big companies can hardly get a fool proof formula down for under $15 but this has a multitude of purposes and does amazing at hydrating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an unpleasant burn, I actually kind of enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>After 3 days, I saw some minor changes in the tone and texture of the skin, at 8 days, the puffy area have begun to smooth out, and the rippled/ pitted stretch marked area has tightened up.</li>
            <li>I still have more cellulite to go, but not as much, I am a FIRM Believer and Recommend this serum to anyone want to get rid of the Cellulite.</li>
            <li>So if thats what youre looking for look elsewhere, however if you want to see the cellulite soften and pretty much disapear then this is definitely going to help.  </li>
            <li>My skin has become much more firm and taut.  </li>
            <li>I love this product using it everyday when I workout</li>
            <li>Wow, I felt really hot, probably because I had used a larger amount than the first time and had applied it on after a shower (like the instructions said...)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally go in for stuff like this---all those slimming creams and potions.</li>
            <li>It only heat activate when your fresh out the shower</li>
            <li>I just apply it has a normal moisturizing cream on hips and thighs .</li>
            <li>I would recommend to use it especially in winter time as it warms you up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t recommend this tipe of things</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change except for an extra hot ass.</li>
            <li>However, the burning only lasts for about 20 minutes and it was worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>and it does cause the areas to get hot, but it is working, and it only is lasting about 20-30 minutes, But with these Result I don&#x27;t mind the burning it is not bad burning</li>
            <li>i liked this scream and it would be one of my favorites if it wasn&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s note worthy that I only experience this sensation when I use the cream soon after showering all the natural oils off my skin.</li>
            <li>For example, before using it I did not feel confident enough to wear any shorts or skirts above mid thigh, about four weeks into using it, I felt confident enough to start wearing my short shorts and skirts again</li>
            <li>The key to it (in my experience) is doing it right after the shower.</li>
            <li>but the cream will only heat up if I apply it right after I shower.  </li>
            <li>I just got this item in the mail on the third day after ordering and right away tried it out.</li>
            <li>This popped me right back into shape in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I always use mine right after my shower when I figure my pores are open.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it burns fat off of your body, you actually have to eat right and exercise for that to happen.</li>
            <li>These people say cant feel anything maybe because you havent use enough, and you need to use it right after shower.</li>
            <li>but if you use it with working out and eating right you&#x27;ll definitely see results.</li>
            <li>Well to see results need to apply the cream right after shower, when the pores are open.</li>
            <li>As long as you remember to glob on large amounts of this  lotion!!</li>
            <li>Only been using it for a few week and can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
            <li>I will say that it is mild and does not linger long at all.</li>
            <li>I think I was using too much at first on too many different areas because I got a little nauseous when I put around my waist.</li>
            <li>My only major concern is in regard to the ingredients and whether or not it is healthy to apply twice daily.  </li>
            <li>It was simple to spread on and seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and secure and the squeeze tubes were individually sealed in clear wrap&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>NOT ONLY THE CREAM, BE REALISTIC, BUT ITS NOT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>but I also wanted a little something extra, I had saw this and was a bit non believing to be honest.</li>
            <li>In looking forward to new product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li>By the time I notice a difference, those bottles were empty,so on to something new.</li>
            <li>I have been using it faithfully, along with exercise 3-4 times a week and a healthy vegetarian diet which includes frequent juicing and lots of green tea.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and soft but not much change on the cellulite.</li>
            <li>Really like using Eveline&#x27;s thermo fat burning product, it really helps you shed those extra water weight!</li>
            <li>I expected it to make the skin warm, expected it to make me itch.  </li>
            <li>After I really worked it in I started to feel a warming sensation, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchased of Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Slimming Serum.</li>
            <li>I use it wit plastic wrap and massage it vigorously into my areas that need work, I do very little excersise,  mostly tilt, tuck, tighten</li>
            <li>I will probably only use it a few times a week, due to the chemicals and the warming sensation which isn&#x27;t very pleasant, especially since it&#x27;s the summer.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well and it has only been five days</li>
            <li>The circumstances under which I can feel the burn are application immediately after stepping out of the hot shower when my pores are open.</li>
            <li>Ive only tried it three times, the first two times i put it on before i worked out, i felt NOTHING.</li>
            <li>But that changed when one of my old friends was complaining about feeling burning sensation around her body from using slimming gel!</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the order, a small sample packet of Eveline Slimming gel- Spa Edition was also included :).   </li>
            <li>I wish they sold smaller sizes to try it out first.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure which product is doing the most work</li>
            <li>I have had this cream for 2 weeks, and I&#x27;ve only used it about 5-6 times, but it is really affective on cellulite!</li>
            <li>U just need motivation from reading this and take the first step then order this cream, go get a sweat wrap, apply cream before wrap and a daily exercise!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen improvement within the first week and I&#x27;m ordering my second tube.</li>
            <li>I tried to rationalize that meaning I don&#x27;t have any more fat to burn, and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no more heat.</li>
            <li>I threw away 1/2 of the bottle because it did nothing but make my thighs break out in a hot, red bumpy rash!</li>
            <li>it did itch and got hot, but i still haven&#x27;t used it back on my</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve lost 5 inches!</li>
            <li>First, you may experience an initial &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation</li>
            <li>Since you will have to take the time to apply it in your body, take an extra 5 minutes and massage the area really well in circles, it does make a difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a little extreme thermo effect, but pleasant (to me at least), it makes you feel like your body is shrinking and cellulite is melting :)</li>
            <li>I found this gel and the thermal tingling sensation is a little strong</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to reporting more positive results back after a few weeks!</li>
            <li>It appears to be effective, but I am not sure if the result will last after usage is discontinued.</li>
            <li>I saw the numerous positive feedback n bought it.</li>
            <li>This product in the first few weeks seem to minimally smooth out some of my cellulite, but the cellulite was definitely still visible.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a short while but have noticed results extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Well, I at least like to think that way,since imagination is a pretty powerful tool as well!</li>
            <li>After looking at a large amount of different products I went with this one because of price, reviews and my enjoyment of warming products.</li>
            <li>I  inspected the area where I applied the lotion afterwards and noticed a SLIGHT decrease in cellulite, but nothing to get too excited about.</li>
            <li>and I start to sweat hard like a sona around my stomach, I love it.</li>
            <li>That means it wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li>Although not immediate, the results became clearly noticeable in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, it leaves my skin soft and toned.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a sensation that you are in the sun in the areas coveres for 10 minutes, its a burning sensation, but I dont think it works much because when I go to the gym the burning calories feeling is completely different.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;delicate warming\\&quot; that the lotion talks about is more like burning.  </li>
            <li>The heat sensation lets you know is working, especially when it really heats up.</li>
            <li>Is my cellulite completely gone?  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I really do like it and have definitely noticed a difference..</li>
            <li>So far (1 week since I got it) I have been using this</li>
            <li>and I can definitely say that there is a very noticeable decrease in cellulite.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been slim since I used to be a professional dancer, but I one problem always bothered me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had very visible cellulite in the back of my thy and of course buttocks.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second tube, I actually really think it helps with the appearance of cellulite when you use it with exercise.</li>
            <li>(I only have very minor/early stages of cellulite from age and having two children).  </li>
            <li>Now, I do have sensitive skin with some products and get redness, burning and itching, though I did not experience this with the Eveline product.</li>
            <li>As far as the product itself I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my cellulite dimples</li>
            <li>It makes the flab disappear and your skin soft within days.</li>
            <li>I go to bed early, 8:30-9 pm and wake up early 6 am.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, I would definitely order again!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised of the burning sensation.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that my veins are much visible (their big!!!)</li>
            <li>I am stoked so far.</li>
            <li>It really helps tone up your lower body especially when combined with exercise.</li>
            <li>+ year old body..</li>
            <li>That is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>WOW, For those who say there is no burn...Are you kidding me?  </li>
            <li>Your pores will be open and ready to absorb the product.</li>
            <li>We all are different and some lose it fast, others take time.</li>
            <li>, I feel my skins get firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>: You know that atleast this stuff is trying to heat you up and giving an effort so you don&#x27;t feel like its a total waist which might be the whole heat up purpose</li>
            <li>SO FAR I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>is really in there to last for a while.</li>
            <li>Actually this serum really helped diminish the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>but my skin is not too sensitive.</li>
            <li>but I developed faded looking patches all over my legs that lasted a couple months after using.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I have used this one time so far.  </li>
            <li>when i got it i had mixed emotions about the cream really working</li>
            <li>it was soft and no cellulite in sight.</li>
            <li>I used 1 product daily and don&#x27;t see any change much.</li>
            <li>I used this product rather religiously, and tried to not look too much for immediate results.</li>
            <li>and I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for fast and visibly noticeable results - tighter skin and diminished cellulite appearance.</li>
            <li>I am in the early stages of use...about a month now.</li>
            <li>i had claw stretch marks and a pouch after my now seven month old was born.</li>
            <li>just use the old fashioned method of diet and exercise as i have been doing.</li>
            <li>Which has been a proble since I was young.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smoother and soft.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>they work, (and are all natural)</li>
            <li>Water acts as a natural cleanser by flushing toxins out of the body, therefore, stimulating body&#x27;s metabolic processes and reducing excess</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would reccommend this, especially to new mothers or someone who had just lost weight and has loose skin.</li>
            <li>I applied for 1 month straight on my right thigh ( both thighs are identical ) and after a month my skin was obviously tighter than the other by far!</li>
            <li>I liked it enough I have purchased a second bottle and several other lotions</li>
            <li>I have very flabby chunky thighs loaded with cellulite due to heredity and losing and gaining weight so much in my life.  </li>
            <li>if you can with stand the extra degrees this thermo active serum brings to you, then you would enjoy using this product, I causes me to get over-heated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very small, I workout 3 to 5 times a week, drink lots of water, eat healthy  </li>
            <li>For those of you who haven&#x27;t or are thinking about buying this product, try to imagine the burn you&#x27;d get from having red hot chili peppers on your skin, now multiply that by 2.</li>
            <li>and then I put on my workout gear and workout no less than an hour.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, I didn&#x27;t feel anything, but the second time, I put it on after I got out of the shower and almost instantly started to feel the warmth</li>
            <li>Used it with no results as of yet .... will rate again later after I give it a decent try.</li>
            <li>Have not had it long enough to say if helping to burn fat, but it sure puts extreme heat to it.</li>
            <li>it really burns, at first i had to use fan to blow cold air on my legs just to be able to bare it.</li>
            <li>I just started my journey to get my high school body back.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong and for me, not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The creme has a strange smell to it, I personally can&#x27;t really stand it</li>
            <li>this product works as long as you are showered and shake it up really well</li>
            <li>feeling is like having icy hot.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t hurt it just feels sort of like the Icy Hot</li>
            <li>I really liked this product i felt i saw results while using it, however one day i happened to read the back and noticed the warning.\\&quot;Persons with sensitive skin, prone to broken capillaries or varicose veins should not use this product,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but I have very huge unsightly valleys &amp; pits at my but &amp; thighs since 13 years old&amp; they are getting worse as</li>
            <li>All of the huge dents are now tiny little bumps.</li>
            <li>Either way, compared to my previous workout regimens in the past, the skin on my legs is feeling much tighter as a consistency period, not just more muscular or slimmer, which I believe is from the lotion.</li>
            <li>Either way, compared to my previous workout regimens in the past, the skin on my legs is feeling much tighter as a consistency period, not just more muscular or slimmer, which I believe is from the lotion.</li>
            <li>Just for extra information, I didnt get any new vericose veins while using this product, but I dont think I&#x27;ll be using it again.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and makes my skin softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is very inexpensive and worth trying at least once to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li>The first few days I applied without steaming prior and felt absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Once on takes only a few minutes to start working, at first was a bit to much</li>
            <li>thighs were a major issue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering it again because it really helped me loose weight.</li>
            <li>Adding things in such as dry brushing (using a paddle brush to agitate the skin some, as well as break up the clustered fat cells that are the existence of cellulite in the first place from lack of circulation), maybe saran wrapping (lots of ppl use things like icyhot or coconut oil to saran wrap their cores from what i gather on the internet and get off an inch or so in a day even, be it water weight or not), using this under a wrap before a workout as well as after my post-workout shower, and whatever else I can find that might make this product work the hardest</li>
            <li>All Natural Organic - Super Weight Loss Instant Green Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) -</li>
            <li>I use it after the shower gel and with the thermo active shaping serum, This one doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as the shaping one</li>
            <li>When I put this on the first time, I expected intense burning as described in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Since I am older, I am trying anything I can along with staying active and eating right to speed up the process in fear that this may be harder to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only thing i was a little bummed with was the smell and the amount of rubbing in, it was thicker than i expected more creamy compared to the nivea one---</li>
            <li>I reluctantly purchased this cream/serum after reading other reviewers&#x27; comments and noticing that the reviews were mostly positive.</li>
            <li>It will firm the skin and reduce cellulite just be consistent and use daily, to shrink your arms, stomach thighs and (back fat in my cse) rub on prior  to exercising to see maximum results, you&#x27;ll see your cottage cheese thighs become more firm with less cellulite in less then a month, just be consistent!!!</li>
            <li>I am definitely a repeat customer because I can clearly see differences in my body appearance.</li>
            <li>I used it only once so far.</li>
            <li>i didnt use it twice a day, only once in the morning after shower and considering im old (49)</li>
            <li>im tall and skinny with an athletic body but cant outrun bits of cellulite on my bum and back thighs which makes me self conscious during bikini season, so I purchased this and used it for about a month, with no sign of improvement</li>
            <li>WHAT I EXPECTED, THE ADVERTISEMENT IS VERY MISLEADING, AND NOT i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE</li>
            <li>Back to this product, please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The burn is similar to that of Icy Hot.</li>
            <li>The burn lasts for a little more than half an hour.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight bit of a strange warm sensation (especially after a shower) and it smells odd, but you&#x27;ll just have to get over that.</li>
            <li>It does cause a warming sensation for the first 30 minutes or so, but to me that just means it&#x27;s not your typical watered-down lotion.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a trip to a African desert for sure, not bad, if your needing a vacation from a long cold loney blizzard.</li>
            <li>I still have cellulite but not as much visible as it was pre slim extreme.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but the warming action can get a little intense</li>
            <li>but it doesnt heat up that much for me as ive read on other reviews.</li>
            <li>but they do not work as intensely as Eveline Slim Extreme.</li>
            <li>sooooooo my pretty behind, quickly turned unattractive, and needless to say I wont touch my backend with this stuff any more because of the acne it caused, I rather have a moon for a butt than one with acne.</li>
            <li>I have tried using this product numerous times with no other products on my skin</li>
            <li>feel to it, nothing major, but I would defiantly buy this product again in the future!</li>
            <li>my skin have no chage, no even a little hot and don&#x27;t know if it is not working for me or</li>
            <li>and it did have a little itch first time</li>
            <li>It does get a little hot</li>
            <li>Please be aware that this will get you in trouble at airports.</li>
            <li>first few times I put it on</li>
            <li>I have cellulite pretty bad for a very fit person.  </li>
            <li>My neck and chin, even my face has slimmed down ALOT, but my skin is much smoother and tighter</li>
            <li>When used consistently I can see my thighs get a little smaller (with or without my workouts).</li>
            <li>I have some serious cellulite behind my thighs and haven&#x27;t been able to wear a bathing suit or a pair of short shorts for years, but this summer I&#x27;m super determined.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the positive reviews seem to be by reviewer&#x27;s with one or few reviews in the past; though, they are noted as \\&quot;amazon verified purchase\\&quot;, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and other than smelling like bengay, i don&#x27;t really notice any difference, and proof it does what is says or even implies, tried several different types of this product from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You must remember there is no magic cream, you need to eat right, do some exercise and make a commitment to this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about 3-4 weeks ago knowing that the likelihood of success was probably small but because of the low price took the chance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but at first did not exercise work it on.</li>
            <li>Just to get the background - I started having cellulite and strech marks when first became pregant with my first dauther - strech marks were and still are pretty bad</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again, but I&#x27;ll check back after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>When this product came in I put it on my right leg 2xs a day for 2 weeks and kept using the other product on my other leg.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to much star with a little bit to see your body tolerance.</li>
            <li>My thighs looked tight and smooth with just a few dimples in the upper thigh area.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I rubbed the cream on my stomach and considering its winter time, very nice that it heats up.</li>
            <li> Very effective once combined with a diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> When applied it gives a very warm tingly sensation.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good sign of postive results considering that fat is mostly water anyway!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: August 30th - Still seeing amazing results with this product!  </li>
            <li> Amazing results!</li>
            <li> but I can say this stuff gets warm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products but this one by fare is the best.  </li>
            <li> :) AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I have seen a remarkable improvement and it has been 1 month.</li>
            <li> After all, what good is it to meet society&#x27;s expectation of what&#x27;s attractive if you&#x27;re not doing so in a way that&#x27;s good for your body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> There is nothing pleasant about feeling as though your skin is on fire......</li>
            <li> It says that it has a pleasant warming sensation.  </li>
            <li> The warming sensation is pleasant.</li>
            <li> It did have a pleasant smell though .</li>
            <li> It says on the packaging that it creates a \\&quot;pleasant tingling\\&quot; sensation</li>
            <li> I take this product many times, work very good</li>
            <li> and I can tell that using this product IS a good part of the reduction in cellulite I am seeing.</li>
            <li> I got 10 days ago, i&#x27;m loved it.  </li>
            <li> THE WAIST TRIMMER ALONG WITH THE CREAM IS A GOOD PAIR.</li>
            <li> ITS A GOOD CREAM</li>
            <li> But good for a heat cream.</li>
            <li> loved it as well.</li>
            <li> and I figured that this would be a good product to pair with my workout regimen and a healthier diet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> works good.</li>
            <li> You get a good sweat in that area.  </li>
            <li> I have just started using the product and after a week I am seeing good results.</li>
            <li> great warm feeling when applied on the area but haven&#x27;t seen any difference after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works realy good.</li>
            <li> Burning feeling is good</li>
            <li> Its not like painfull burn, doesnt hurt just feels good.</li>
            <li> For best results use day and night with light exercises.</li>
            <li> This cream works good for me.</li>
            <li> , I took a shower to exfoliate my skin and ensure that optimum results could be achieved.</li>
            <li> it is a good product</li>
            <li> I will work for the things that work beauty wise until it&#x27;s time for botox</li>
            <li> I just started using this yesterday, so for so good.</li>
            <li> I got this one three weeks ago and it does what it is supposed to be - fair price, good</li>
            <li> ALL THE TIME AND MY METABOLISM HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li> FEELS GOOD.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it works the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> You have to use a good amount of it just for one application</li>
            <li> Do nothing for me good for stretch mark but not for cellulite</li>
            <li> Its good for something just not that &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good use to remove tummy fat</li>
            <li> Its a good product.</li>
            <li> It it a good sized tube for what I needed.</li>
            <li> for the lotion, it contains caffeine, which is good for treating cellulite.</li>
            <li> The smooth feel of rubbing it on and feeling the warm heat is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent, exactly as described!</li>
            <li> But, after using the cream, I felt my thighs a bit more attractive.</li>
            <li> Very pleased</li>
            <li> but I experienced more heat when I worked out.</li>
            <li> and i eat very healthy so this product is a must for fat loss and tighter looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Screams great service to me considering most companies pull the &#x27;okeydoke&#x27; on friday and just don&#x27;t ship out til Monday.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> but this has a warming sensation that I just love; just be carful where you put it- because it does heat up!   </li>

            <li> I would give it a 5 if it was scent-free, or had a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I rub this on before I put my belly burner Weight loss belt on and the combination of the two have been amazing.</li>

            <li> It was amazing you feel the heat almost immediately and stays with you throughout the work out.</li>

            <li> Amazing.  </li>

            <li> I will update after a month or so but the texture, smell is all amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Also...for the results I get with this product I have to say AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I saw an amazing difference.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The thighs I don&#x27;t put it on anymore as it gets way to warm.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, this kind of worked.</li>
            <li> HANDY TO HAVE AVAILABLE, WORK GREAT</li>
            <li> again the intense wonderful burn!  </li>
            <li> The warming feels nice too.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> I like the tingling warm sensation, but I did not work in my behave</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when it gets really warm for me.</li>
            <li> Love that this is a good size.</li>
            <li> Some girls said that they had a warm feeling every time they use this cream.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get any warm feeling in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially on freshly shaven skin or after doing a cellulite massage or body brushing.</li>
            <li> It is not unbearable but it does get warm.</li>
            <li> It does feel warm as advertised</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any warm feeling.  </li>
            <li> It was warm.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t even get warm.  </li>
            <li> I liked the warming and cooling effect.</li>
            <li> It does get quite warm</li>
            <li> Product might be good for others and someone else might get better results.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have burning warm sensation, sometimes</li>
            <li> Almost too warm when something like my dog is laying on me.</li>
            <li> but i liked it.</li>
            <li> but apart from that i liked it, it does work some.</li>
            <li> As soon you put it on you can feel the skin getting warm.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but the product gets warm on your skin and you feel that it is working.</li>
            <li> yes it gives you a warm sensation but</li>
            <li> Did not get warm at all</li>
            <li> Immediately feel it getting warm</li>
            <li> /&gt;Im still searching for an effective cellulite eraser product....</li>
            <li> It did has warm feeling</li>
            <li> It just feels warm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, but it gives a warm burning feeling</li>
            <li> The warmth just soothed my backache so nicely.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, it heats up nicely and works just as well as products that I&#x27;ve used that are twice the price,  that being said,  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for cellulite.  </li>
            <li> My backside feels like is a warm toaster oven.  </li>
            <li> I like the warm sensation.</li>
            <li> This is an honest opinion of mine.</li>
            <li> The good news is that most of them seem to work.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you miss this when its gone go buy some tingle lotion and call it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Be honest.</li>
            <li> I FEEL THIS WARM SENSATION ON THE AREAS THAT I APPLY THE LOTION</li>
            <li> For best warm up effect, use straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I waited almost a month before I wrote this review as I wanted to give an honest comment that might be helpful.  </li>
            <li> It does warm up</li>
            <li> The warm feeling is the proof that the lotion is working.</li>
            <li> I felt the warm sensation under my skin once</li>
            <li> People said they saw results after like a week, and I don&#x27;t see how ANY cream can be that effective, but whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i thought that was so nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;lol</li>
            <li> you guys nice serves</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand what those people were whining about.</li>
            <li> It does have a fairly nice fragrance as well...</li>
            <li> it works nice.</li>
            <li> It kind of itched</li>
            <li> I just started using the thermo serum and the warming sensation is nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly like this cream.</li>
            <li> Nice price too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these creams do not work.</li>
            <li> Well, this is not a \\&quot;Super-hero\\&quot; lotion and can&#x27;t make wonders by its own.</li>
            <li> First time using thermal gel and it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;And that is to say that i&#x27;m the kind of person who has always been in great shape, eating healthy food and staying active.&lt;br /&gt;But cellulite has always been huge problem and a reason for not being able to wear shorts or even bathing suits (yes!</li>
            <li> Works best while doing challenging workouts, at first when I tried it</li>
            <li> This cream does the job, very strong warming sensation.</li>
            <li> This product has been awesome so far!</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS: before you put it on, make sure to shower your area of concern with warm water, soap or just run water through before applying.</li>
            <li> This lotion gave me the most amazing results I&#x27;ve ever seen a lotion produce.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th day of using this, I love the warm feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li> then I do, but to be honest – I felt better effects of reducing cellulite by applying Zaggora’s SveltMelt lotion and walking around in the HotPants.</li>
            <li> love the product, it is warm on your body for about 30 minutes</li>
            <li> Honestly I think it works given more time using it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best anti cellulite cream on the market.  </li>
            <li> The supposed mechanisms of action as well are speculative at best.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if you use it right.  </li>
            <li> should add a good workout 3-4 times a week and a low-calorie diet,lots of fresh squeezed juices and its bye-bye cellulite!</li>
            <li> The concept of the product is great, but you have to use a great amount to actually feel anything.  </li>
            <li> It is the best product I have ever used, I recommended for whoever want to reduce cellulite fast and secure.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, result are amazing and you can see them in very short time.</li>
            <li> When I first used it in and experienced a burning sensation, I thought it was because I had just used Tend Skin.  </li>
            <li> A HOT ANIMAL LOL.</li>
            <li> But the warming affect is not to hot and worked great.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it so far and can&#x27;t wait to keep using and see some results, on top of my working out, and eating better.</li>
            <li> every where and my skin very very smooth like a silk....</li>
            <li> makes me feel very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> However, I have noticed my thighs look very smooth and virtually have no cellulite at all.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a nice consistency so it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> easy as it would be to blame a product rather than take responsibility for my own persistent cellulite and magical thinking</li>
            <li> Cream is very beautiful and effective and is the second purchase experience for this product,, recommend it strongly with Continuously used to give a better result.</li>
            <li> been using this product for a while.i truly love</li>
            <li> I say if you do more than just the creme it does help.</li>
            <li> so I can have more of an idea if it works.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) will be posting another review in 4 weeks, hopefully it works</li>
            <li> I Love this Serum and Love the Results it gives....</li>
            <li> My arms are slimmer, my waist is tighter and my legs and bottom have a nice, smooth silhouette.  </li>
            <li> my thighs are still in need of more cellulite removal, but they are coming along, I feel my body getting tighter and slimmer, we will see in time, I ordered 3 more for my family members.</li>
            <li> This is a woundeful product and I have already order and recieved more.  </li>
            <li> - it is more in the \\&quot;ripply\\&quot; phase (which I understand is what happens before the dimples develop - trying to prevent that from happening).  </li>
            <li> (it made my legs look that much better).  </li>
            <li> One more thing -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this would work even better /</li>
            <li> this product does the rest for you.&lt;br /&gt;i put this on and then my girdle on, i have defined my curves more.</li>
            <li> I am monitoring to see more</li>
            <li> and i will surely order more of this</li>
            <li> Use with fat band, it seems to make the product work better.</li>
            <li> I have bought sooo many products and none of them do anything or not that I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I put on a dress yesterday for a graduation and my legs looked much better.  </li>
            <li> You need to do exercises, eat better and drink a lot of water.&lt;br /&gt;Another advice is to do massages in the problem area (search for it on youtube).&lt;br /&gt;Those</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t give up :)</li>
            <li> Now send me free products!!!!!!!lol!</li>
            <li> I exercize about four times a week and eat healthy</li>
            <li> I am using it mostly on my abs and buns.</li>
            <li> Unfortunantly, when I returned to purchase more the product is unavailable?  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t work by itself, you have to exercise too.</li>
            <li> Then every use after that it got a bit better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying different products that I found here to see which one gives the best results...</li>
            <li> My skin is looking much better</li>
            <li> crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to face that fact causes us to wave our magic wands (credit cards) and buy items that claim to get rid of cellulite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d love for the people who are claiming that this is more than a lotion</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better when working out feel my body being worked.</li>
            <li> plan on ordering more products.</li>
            <li> Like many woman I have been dreading summer and swim suit season.</li>
            <li> But since that is not the case, I&#x27;ll be continuing my search for a better product for me.</li>
            <li> And this summer : )</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i love it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy Slimming guys :)</li>
            <li> I guess I will keep trying and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> I do see an improvement, but I think that can mostly be attributed to eating healthy and working out, because I have since stopped using it</li>
            <li> works better if you use a belt and wrap abdominal with neoprene belt with this.</li>
            <li> I applied a lot more to my tummy area.</li>
            <li> She applies it before working out and it makes her sweat more.  </li>
            <li> I intend to purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> Since my pregnancy I am having difficulty in loosing my weight , and i had  prominent  belly that i did not have  before , so  </li>
            <li> ,i thought i need a year to get in shape , but seem it working,  i really love it ,</li>

            <li> the areas I applied it to ALREADY are looking about sixty percent better.  </li>
            <li> It makes me look more feminine in my silhouette</li>
            <li> I know many women want to have a sexier body in terms of appearance and size, so</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>

            <li> so i will love to tell my friends abour it.</li>

            <li> and it sure didn&#x27;t give anything.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cream but more of an aide to help you in your process.</li>
            <li> I love and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Now the key is you have to move your body for the best results.  </li>

            <li> The most weight I gained was during pregnancies.  </li>
            <li> i was still prego :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li> I believe I would have seen more results.</li>
            <li> Burns like tingling tanning lotion and my skin is starting to look great!</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> and my diet couldn&#x27;t be any better.</li>
            <li> then I need to put more and more on.</li>

            <li> I have tried so many things , some seem to work others not.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the burn for more than 4 or 5 minutes, felt like fire ants, .</li>
            <li> I continue using it because i feel it is working along with my healthy life style</li>
            <li> A bit more lotiony texture would be better.</li>
            <li> sure.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it in combination with Eveline Anti-Cellulite Scrub for about 5 months now and my skin is visibly better firmer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so no matter what I look like, like you I want to look better.</li>
            <li> but so you can observe skin tone and get a better idea of what your dealing with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> So if you can sleep with it on then that would make the most sense.</li>
            <li> but it sure does heat you up as if you were on fire.</li>
            <li> wonderful looking short skirt outfits  and shorts  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for the great skin.</li>
            <li> ok you need to apply a lot</li>
            <li> love it i could see results immediately</li>
            <li> I am not over weight, but was just trying to look better for my spouse.</li>
            <li> I will say as you use the product more often the warming sensation does subside.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love the warming sensation it gives you.</li>
            <li> It help me to swept more during my workout session.</li>
            <li> i love the feeling and</li>
            <li> But when applied  after the lotion gets rubbed in, and the lotion does its magic you can feel and see the tightness it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product many times</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, can&#x27;t say that I would buy again</li>
            <li> As I was losing the cellulite was more visible.  </li>
            <li> most of the womens who use this product feel better on it ..</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been able to see results</li>
            <li> but when I started using the cream I saw better and faster results.</li>
            <li> I read a review here stating the company doesn&#x27;t give refunds on top of that.</li>
            <li> Seems to be more than water weight.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, I&#x27;m going to begin a more strict regimen of using this in a way to get the best results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> Probably one of the better products of this type on the market.</li>
            <li> Also I love the burning sensation</li>
            <li> but I know now that thats a sign that it is working :)</li>
            <li> :) I reccomend this product :)</li>
            <li> &amp; I havent notice a change, it was shipped &amp; sent fast which I was happy about.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> A TRY-SO,  I WOULD SAY,  ITS JUST OKAY,  IM NOT DISAPOINTED IN PURCHASING</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy think again because I like the Nivea cellulite cream much better</li>
            <li> but i love this cream works wonders.</li>
            <li> i do love these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I only used it for 2 days and cant descript its effect yet, i would probably say this is the best product among all fat burning creams considering its price and thermo effect.</li>
            <li> i just  love the serves of</li>
            <li> I apply a waist trimmer on top and after my workout I&#x27;m dripping with sweat.</li>
            <li> Looking for help with lower ab fat, I lost most with diet and working out.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> BUT WORKS LIKE MAGIC FOR ME!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure the longer you use it, the better the results.</li>
            <li> I sure hope this means it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product, and glad I did.</li>
            <li> love this stuff I just received</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I continue to see improvement and diminished cellulite appearance, which makes me trust the product even more and feel more confident about my skin.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> but more so on how I feel when I&#x27;m using it.</li>

            <li> I love using this with my waist cinched and waist trimmer</li>
            <li> I will use this again for sure.  </li>
            <li> It also makes the product burn way more than just applying it without the bath.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better after showers.</li>
            <li> Great and fast service .</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love that it came with</li>
            <li> The more you exercise, the faster your muscles will burn surrounding them fat cells.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this product</li>
            <li> , there is a pretty good chance something somewhere might make a difference or better.</li>
            <li> but the warm feeling might be overwhelming in Puerto Rico&#x27;s climate (very hot).  </li>
            <li> but, along with exercise and a good diet it really works!</li>
            <li> I would also be resentful of women at the water parks and pools who held more weight then me, yet had beautiful smooth firm attractive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited, it&#x27;s like a miracle cream!</li>
            <li> Really Excited to Start Using Eveline Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for the money this is an effective product for my mild cellulite</li>
            <li> Some people have it not so easy and have to buy more than one.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and the price is amazing for such a great product!</li>
            <li> If not, just follow those 3 steps and you&#x27;ll be more than fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products and these work the best for me.</li>
            <li> but theres a huge weight off my shoulders and my treated areas look 100% better.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this as I&#x27;m pretty impressed this far.</li>
            <li> is it possible that this cream works too good and is very potent?</li>
            <li> So far, I say this cream is really great.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll see good results very soon.</li>
            <li> It really makes your body sweat good when your working out.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation is warm but nice, not so super hot that you can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice cream,but please do not expect miracles you must eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I have only been using this once a day (not two), and I&#x27;m getting results this good!    </li>
            <li> Slim Extreme 3D Thermo is AWESOME!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perry excited to see how affective it is over the course of two more weeks.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use it and to see any changes that may be happening to my skin after using this together with healthy diet and exercise for couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> You have buy the other product in order to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Not bad!  </li>
            <li> You can easily tell it&#x27;s working because you can feel it heat up</li>
            <li> the results are easily seen.  </li>
            <li> the product is penetrate really easy and my skin is</li>
            <li> the thermal isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> If you want the best results with the warming sensation then put the cream on right out of the shower when your pores are open.</li>
            <li> Feels very good  (hot) but not too much, not painful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it does become warm once rubbed on, but not uncomfortable or unbearable like I read in previous reviews, been using on my thighs and stomach for three days now and already impressed, the skin is so much tighter and smoother, will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> , that it&#x27;s actually a cellulite reducing magic wand to show photos of the before and after or something, or perhaps tell me in the comments why my honest review of a nice lotion that doesn&#x27;t do jack for cellulite is \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It gets  pretty warm after it&#x27;s rubbed in on your skin, but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> but its cool to the touch, this cannot be healthy and  its already in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Time will be a better event for a full review as time will be the way to answer questions for me.</li>
            <li> It does get warm, but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li> After the first week, I noticed no difference and felt no burning or any kind of heat at all.</li>
            <li> It says that it has a warming sensation and I must admit at times it did get pretty warm.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing that it stated it is suppose to do, the smell is ok and the burn is not bad it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I notice results in one week not dramatic ones but some is better then none!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that it seems to burn more in the areas where I have more fat, but it seems like that&#x27;s exactly what you would want it to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fine lotion.</li>
            <li> (which seems like it would be fine for both men and women).</li>
            <li> and I still can&#x27;t believe how awesome this product is, I saw results in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This lotion tightened my skin and gave my mild cellulite a more blended, smoothed out look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which I didn&#x27;t mind till I got super itchy!</li>
            <li> And it shipped really quick!</li>
            <li> plus is that it seems to be a good moisturizer and my skin is very soft after I use  it.  </li>
            <li> HOLY MOSES.. VERY INTENSE!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, decent price, hoping it works well!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion in general aside from all the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s original purpose.</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream it made me feel the heat, best felt after taking a shower and immeditely after 2-3 uses i started to see results and my friends noticed that i lost some inches from my thighs and behind.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen huge results, but I can feel the burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed a HUGE decrease in the creases on the skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for the price and the amount of creme you get, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> For the price its worth a try and the results depend more on me that the cream.</li>
            <li> didnt burn me that much just really warm.</li>
            <li> It feels like a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; tanning lotion, but I actually really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> But it DOES smooth out cellulite, and it does seem to tighten my legs up.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fantastic after just one week.</li>
            <li> It has definantly helped smooth and reduce.</li>
            <li> It works great - my skin tightened after only 3 day use (twice a day)</li>
            <li> Also got to enjoy a free sample of the slimming and firming spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I am working on getting fit for winter which we all know is not the easiest task</li>
            <li> Overall is a great product.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> and I think this cream did anything to smooth it out - however it is advertised as cellulite smoothing cream</li>
            <li> and now I actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great addition to my overall body care regimen.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great choice for body resculpting.</li>
            <li> this is very item to enlarge your buttocks and to warm up your area you sit</li>
            <li> Is heat activate it, so if you can&#x27;t tolerate heat (i.e heating patches or heat activating creams or gels) this might not be a fit for you.</li>
            <li> free to comment questions or contact, etc.</li>
            <li> free to comment questions or contact, etc.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with this company, I just didn&#x27;t enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best way to get rid of cellulite is more of a physical action.</li>
            <li> Im sure putting on some cayenne pepper would work much better and would be much more natural than this product made of bunch of aggressive chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The hearing is a great thing especially while I&#x27;m working out!</li>
            <li> and it is great especially when used with a wrap.</li>
            <li> just wanted to try to smooth things out.</li>
            <li> It helps heat the body to relieve water retenton and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty warm but it is not painful.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t fair to the consumer if they followed the instructions and did there part by following a healthy diet and exercise program.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty warm, though, so may want to use cool rag for face.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it works 100 times better if I work out right after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Take your shower be sure to exfoliate, then put it on right after getting out.</li>
            <li> It starts heating up to extreme once rubbed in and it smells great on top of that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot!!</li>
            <li> It does burn however, and when that feeling stops after a few minutes, there is a wonderful cool tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> (Originally I assumed that if I lost all the weight I gained, my legs would return to its original cellulite free condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE CREAM IS good but not MAGIC, YOU HAVE TO EAT GOOD STUFF, GO TO THE GYM EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> I started my journey to becoming fit 6 months ago by going the gym and eating right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking great and feeling even better, but a little light headed....</li>
            <li> I was excited when this packaged arrived and could wait to use it.</li>
            <li> and it is not expensive :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I might buy this again as a lotion, those of you who get upset when your magical thinking cellulite bubble bursts may wish to avoid purchasing this as, well, you&#x27;ll sit there, pitted like a golf ball, tingling hot and lemony smelling and it might make you all crabby because you still (of course) have cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may work great after a couple months, but not wanting to use that long.</li>
            <li> I found that the more you move about it stays hot.</li>
            <li> nothing is worth this pain!</li>
            <li> Not disappointed thought</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant cellulite reduction my my thights -</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product after the first use.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when the first bottle runs out</li>
            <li> i would recommend it, i use it before my workouts and i love the hot tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> I plan to tay consistent and update anything miraculous with this product :)</li>
            <li> I plan to tay consistent and update anything miraculous with this product :)</li>
            <li> I am excited about the changes that I see</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Great item arrived early just what I wanted, works perfects and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Im thinking the warm shower might open your pores to let the lotion penetrate better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the warm sensation especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> First things first, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I found a natural anti-cellulite cream on Amazon that I like better, and I&#x27;ll stick to using that, running, eating healthily, and using a skin brush/mitt in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Either way... so far so good and even as just a lotion, it&#x27;s almost worth $15</li>
            <li> on last note - Eveline Cosmetics is great brand - they are big in Europe, very reputable.</li>
            <li> The cream was specially wrapped.</li>
            <li> Specially when I work out</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it until the fat pockets on my thighs are diminished by exercising, eating right and the Slim 3d!</li>
            <li> The other thing is the amazing burning sensation you get after a couple minutes of the cream being rubbed on and it lasts for like 30 minutes but it feels good its not to hot</li>
            <li> I did not notice a huge difference, but it&#x27;s worth using with excercise.</li>
            <li> the soothing feeling of the warmth is equivalent to taking a nice hot bath, very relaxing.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it smells great and absorbs well into the skin, but I didn&#x27;t see an improvement after 3 weeks, Not sure if I would get this again.</li>
            <li> first of all the shipping was great, i even got a personal hand written</li>
            <li> The warm sensation the first couple of applications was a bit much, but your body gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t knot about the product yet, but I love how fast I got it.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams before for my very stuborn cellulite</li>
            <li> Also, I have been applying it before exercising, as some others have suggested, so that might be part of why it is so effective so far, as I suspect it is enhancing the effects of my workout.  </li>
            <li> THE SIDES OF MY THIGHS, MY BUTT, MY ARMS AND MY FULL STOMACH AREA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a good whiff of it every time I loaded the laundry into the washer too as it left</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 days now and have seen such good results</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the full effects yet</li>
            <li> I bought a sister product more intense that im using now.</li>
            <li> You will also love the warming effect it has when rubbed on gently.</li>
            <li> , I have also really been able to intensify my results by using this tea along with the cream:</li>
            <li> I think it is really the combination of things that will make you to see the results, but if you stick with it - it will sure to awe you.   </li>
            <li> I was really hoping for more.</li>
            <li> so i should be able to knock out the rest very soon.</li>
            <li> Love it , really works , even on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It gets cool on contact.   </li>
            <li> Surely most ppl see this(doesn&#x27;t take much to see proof of the companys shameless promoting), but jic someone doesn&#x27;t bother to click on a couple (if reading them isn&#x27;t enough), figure it is a good idea to spell it out</li>
            <li> but......its true</li>
            <li> Well I bought this cream because my legs are full of dimples.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> im gttn ready to order more</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with great expectations from reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I do sweat pretty easily, so that may have had a lot to do with me breaking out into a sweat after applying the lotion, but just a fair warning to those who have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t really handle heat well.</li>
            <li> Works even better with a slim belt great product for burning those hard to lose inches</li>
            <li> Just hoping the results keep coming, and don&#x27;t just stop after a certain point!!  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how quickly I received this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li> It arrived super quickly, I started using it the day I got it  </li>
            <li> The lotion absorbed fast into the skin, so I was able to put clothes on soon after.</li>
            <li> The product also smells refreshing and feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> im seeing quick results.</li>
            <li> It becomes more intense as it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> while using it, my abs actually burn up more fat ( my feeling) and look more tone.</li>
            <li> WHEN I WAS PREGNANT SO EVEN PUTTING LOTION DURING PREGNANCY DIDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> After pregnancy, I, like most mothers, am left with a wrinkly, saggy belly and love handles.</li>
            <li> Received items quickly from shipper.</li>
            <li> but i find it super comforting</li>
            <li> From now on I will stick to more naturally based products like Finulite and Mio&#x27;s shrink to fit.</li>
            <li> Even more rewarding was the fact that the changes were not final after 4 weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li> ITS OK, DIDNT SEE MUCH CHANGE RIGHT AWAY, BUT</li>
            <li> It does make your skin smoother and it smells very pleasant, but it&#x27;s so thick that I had to use all my strength to squeeze it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Works well very hot</li>
            <li> It did smooth my skin first then started lightening the stretch marks around my thighs.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any change at all&lt;br /&gt;felt very hot when applied but</li>
            <li> get very hot</li>
            <li> Ok, I used it religiously for one month along with strength training and cardio excersises, so I cannot say whether this product alone would give me such a great results.</li>
            <li> First off I am not an employee of the company , nor did I get anything free.</li>
            <li> thank you using my first name that was so thoughtful, when i put this thing on my</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, didn&#x27;t feel much, but noticed the thermo heat reaction works best if I wore a waist clincher or did some sit-ups and then relaxed laying down on my stomach.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crabby is even less attractive than cellulite</li>
            <li> They turned bright red and they were just so hot that at 3am</li>
            <li> One of the things you don&#x27;t really want to face as a woman in your 30&#x27;s is that there is no and probably won&#x27;t ever be an easy cure for cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really gets hot, and it has a warm intense feeling that lets you know that it works.</li>
            <li> It is freakin&#x27; hot!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say if it works, but it is HOT!  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY BURNS!!</li>
            <li> AVOID FOODS HIGH IN SUGAR!!!</li>
            <li> Received the product fast just a couple days ago &amp; so far I love it!   </li>
            <li> I notice some results not as amazing as others but noticeable enough for me.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL unless you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It may take some time, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth buying again and again.</li>
            <li> If an all natural, chemical free product is important to you</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it for the results.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t recall the last time I wore shorts or a dress.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> Worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li> It might be that some of the people who used it have more sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That way, you know your skin fully absorbed</li>
            <li> The bottle was way waaaaaay~ bigger than I expected at all which I am extremely happy about!</li>
            <li> But totally worth it.</li>
            <li> And hey for $15/bottle it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> It is also a nice loction to apply to the abdomen for women who may be experiencing cramping and backache related to our monthly visitor.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, what attracts me to it so much is just how much this literally makes you sweat</li>
            <li> The results are cumulative and this is exciting.</li>
            <li> This still gives the same effect and results as the gel kind.</li>
            <li> Their website is definitely worth checking out.  </li>
            <li> no if the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin on the back of my thighs didn&#x27;t look that nice</li>
            <li> Further, one glance at the ingredients list tells you this is not the kind of thing you want to be rubbing into your skin twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in completely.</li>
            <li> I noticed a kind of wrinkly unsmooth skin appearance on my butt (like how your skin looks before you actually get cellulite dimples) and I globbed some of this lotion on.</li>
            <li> Warm enough to make me sweat, so I began sitting in front of a fan</li>
            <li> Ready to buy my second bottle work really good</li>
            <li> I will say it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> You will love the fact that it has a number of anti-oxidants and other healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> After 1 year of the other product, I noticed this one and more importantly, the price!</li>
            <li> If you are interested in purchasing this item, I would not discourage you, just caution you not to expect any quick results.</li>
            <li> The tube is very large, so it is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Get active :).. it has helped remove the appearance of my stretch marks dramatically :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream makes you believe that it&#x27;s working because of the heat sensation, but afterwards I never saw a difference in the amount of cellulite on my legs, if anything it made me notice it more because I was trying so hard to see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;The heat sensation also isn&#x27;t the most pleasant at times, especially when the weather starts getting warmer.</li>
            <li> Also the lotion is very thick and has to be really massaged in to get the best effects, you cannot just do a quick slather and go, you have to WORK the product into the skin to get the warming effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im going to use this twice a day, right when  iget out of the shower..</li>
            <li> But This time around I put it on right after a shower instead</li>
            <li> but I exercise and eat right.</li>
            <li> if I apply it right out of the shower, it wasn&#x27;t burning like others say.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working right away.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, you feel the heat right after you massage.</li>
            <li> as a right now .</li>
            <li> BUT is, you have to still work out, eat right and drink lots of h20.</li>
            <li> right before i go to the gym.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it to my belly area then put on a reducing belt and found it to be most effective</li>
            <li> I do feel hot on the spots where product applied, worth to try.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if anyone has experienced this</li>
            <li> At times (dpending on how much I apply), it feels like my skin is burning, but is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> Not sure but maybe for someone else is great</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good hot, not like other reviews I&#x27;ve read it doesn&#x27;t feel like your burning</li>
            <li> Come on people be smart!</li>
            <li> Lol this lotion must work because on my skin, it feels like I am under the hottest African sun on the hottest African afternoon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I feel like this lotion worked best and absorbed deepest when it was applied this</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and noticed that it really works great.</li>
            <li> Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one tube.</li>
            <li> have since bought some of their other products from this company and am also very satisfied.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it was extremely hot but bare able</li>
            <li> Surely, it wasn&#x27;t significant, but knowing what my body looks like, the difference was subtle, but it did make me use the product even more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have used other anti-cellulite products but Eveline Slim Extreme thermo active serum is by far the best and most effective product I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s packaging is new, innovative and pretty informative except the fact that it isn&#x27;t concrete.</li>
            <li> While I am curvy, and look great in jeans, due to age and having giving birth, I have developed stretch marks and orange peel texture on my thighs.</li>
            <li> It feels nice in terms of hydration for the dry skin, but in terms of heat and thermo effect - nothing!</li>
            <li> It really works but the heating is too much for me!!</li>
            <li> Now you will feel some type of sensational burning for a minute then it wears down.</li>
            <li> but does get really hot and makes you sweat with a good workout it does help a little.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I have better results doing infra red body wraps!</li>
            <li> I am back to order more</li>
            <li> It does EXACTLY what it says on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was doing to pee my pants the first time I applied this.</li>
            <li> I almost washed it off the first 10 minutes into the \\&quot;heat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> First time to try this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just ordered my next tube of it.</li>
            <li> It does tingle at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE BRAVE, slather this on THICK.</li>
            <li> YES, there is hot sensation, but I did not see any result..</li>
            <li> My advice - turn the A/C up high after putting this on!!     </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first product I am using for the cellulite problem, so I don&#x27;t have others to compare to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> things combined really help!</li>
            <li> This product does give you a warming feeling after it&#x27;s applied, but this isn&#x27;t consistent; sometimes there is a warming feeling and sometimes there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But now it has been a month, and there is a definite firming up and the cellulite pockets are more than 50% gone.  </li>
            <li> &quot; times 4, really hot, then it subsides in about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> For those who says that they dont feel burning effect i would like to suggest to take hot shower which will open up ur pores and let serum absorb much better.</li>
            <li> The first couple times you use it it is pretty hot but after about 20 min</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after the reviews I decided to try the product.</li>
            <li> At first when applied to the area, it warms up an adds a tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> I applied it first then</li>
            <li> /&gt;when worked in it is extremely hot for 10 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li> Hot, tingly, almost a stinging/burning feeling.</li>
            <li> and I saw results the first week.</li>
            <li> it did exactly as it says...</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube, too.  </li>
            <li> , just remember that magic happens only if you are willing to participate in a process of making it to happen.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time today</li>
            <li> It showed hot spots where we had put the cream</li>
            <li> I guess it really does increase your body heat!</li>
            <li> So first off let me say that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and around 115 pounds.  </li>
            <li> Now, I feel like I&#x27;m sitting on a hot leather seat on a 110 degree day.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a lil worried about the product</li>
            <li> in anything you do you have to be consistent</li>
            <li> When I first applied this product, I applied it conservatively.  </li>
            <li> One word of advice I want to give to others is when you apply this product on your body or face, to pay attention to where you apply it and put it EXACTLY where you want fat to burn from.</li>
            <li> it gets hot (not to hot) on the area that you put it on</li>
            <li> This stuff is hot.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as it was mentioned: morning &amp; evening.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure this is definitely helping it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for weight lost but it is getting rid of my stretch marks on my waist and stomach!</li>
            <li> Its supposed to stay hot for about 30 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li> I really had my doubts about it, but it WORKS!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to hot</li>
            <li> but I think using this on a California summer day would feel torturously hot.</li>
            <li> I finished my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Its hot n it works.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t feel any of the &#x27;tingling&#x27; or &#x27;warmth&#x27; that people had said about it</li>
            <li> I felt a tingle the first time I exfoliated and then used it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t consistent with my workout routine</li>
            <li> almost hot</li>
            <li> and I really feel the fat burn!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> At first it burned and i thought it was working.</li>
            <li> Very well packed!</li>
            <li> I eat pretty healthy and in moderation, drink plenty of water, don&#x27;t smoke, drink occasionally, and</li>
            <li> It gets hot when you apply it</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a product review, but in this case I felt it was warranted.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t feel heat or become hot at all.</li>
            <li> Unless I laid perfectly still, I was unable to prevent it from getting to areas that didn&#x27;t another portion of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I definitely sweat more on my lower body when working out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t change my diet or add more exercise, but I may be different than you.</li>
            <li> even on the first application.</li>
            <li> Does it help reduce the appearance, absolutely!</li>
            <li> Yes, it gives off a burning sensation when I applied it for the first week.</li>
            <li> Also, massage your troubled areas when you apply the cream for best results.</li>
            <li> First application I saw about a 25% reduction.  </li>
            <li> My personal choice, I like the gel better.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Will be definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t get hot all the time.   </li>
            <li> It does heat and makes my stomach hot, then add the waist band</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after consistent use at the gym</li>
            <li> I do not think this is magic, but it sure works.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using cellulite lotions for the past year - combined with exercise and diet (in which I cheat sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and it made my stomach feel the burn.  </li>
            <li> First time I used the product I felt like my legs were on fire.</li>
            <li> AND IN FAIRNESS IT&#x27;S REALLY HOT</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works alone, but with diet and exercise, I am for sure losing the wrinkly belly that I have had for the last 5 years!</li>
            <li> However, i gave it 3 stars because works pretty well for firming and lifting.</li>
            <li> This REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> but I am buying my 2nd tube and looking forward to buy more.</li>
            <li> After my first two, the weight came off with time.</li>
            <li> My skin is much tighter!</li>
            <li> so when you first start off don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the results especially for the price, and believe me I have looked. :)</li>
            <li> Would not advise using it while mowing the lawn on a hot day</li>
            <li> I can say with confidence this product really works!</li>
            <li> but after the first use the itch went away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to order some more.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty well padded core....</li>
            <li> I have a pretty well padded core....</li>
            <li> I think it really tightens the skin!</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I exercise consistently..</li>
            <li> After losing 10 pounds and getting my bmi back to a healthy 19, I noticed that I still had some cellulite.</li>
            <li> It is as hot as if you were going into a jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After THE FIRST DAY, I have noticeable results.</li>
            <li> and yes there is a warming sensation at first</li>
            <li> Hi all first day of using this</li>
            <li> and OMG it is hot</li>
            <li> This is the only cellulite product that actually works from the many many I have tried.</li>
            <li> Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> It gets hot a bit and after a month nothing change.</li>
            <li> Be aware of applying.</li>
            <li> This is my first tube</li>
            <li> have worked out regularly for over 15 years, follow a healthy diet &amp; drink plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> It does feel hot when you put it on your legs</li>
            <li> At first I thought what have I done?  </li>
            <li> It is better to eat fat than sugar, since excess amount of sugar turns into fat and gets stored deep inside the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good for getting rid of proportionally uneven distributed fat areas.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and the changes may be subtle, but after a period of time, I think it&#x27;ll be more and more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> A heating sensation which gets really got is uncomfortable plus must use right after shower for best results.</li>
            <li> I use the leg vacuum suction cups and the massage combs, and I see 10x better of a result.</li>
            <li> It seems to really heat up when applied right after a shower.</li>
            <li> I am currently training for my first marathon &amp; I put this cream on before my runs &amp; it burns so good for about 45 minutes to an hour later &amp; then after a hot shower</li>
            <li> Smells good, too, nothing weird or rancid or chemically, but still a very light</li>
            <li> You have to glob on a VERY LARGE amount until your skin feels very slimey and oily</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any results other than a warm sensation that it gives off which lets</li>
            <li> Honestly I wont buy this product anymore, cuz it might work for other but not for me.</li>
            <li> Now there is a bit of a warm tingling sensation once you apply it, but I dont have any burning or itching sensations like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> As good as Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks, this product help my abs section sweat more.</li>
            <li> Redness and burning are Completely normal!!</li>
            <li> I was really expecting it to work better than it is, especially when it was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> It can get very hot and then sometimes not hot at all, but showers do make it hotter like many say.</li>
            <li> (I certainly did at first)</li>
            <li> First off, I have torn tendons, shattered bones and was even hit by a truck last year and right now i would take any of those instances than this freaking burning!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 09/13/12: I have noticed that there have been a huge bump in the number of positive reviews for this item since I reviewed it and many from people with few reviews, or reviews that seem weighted.</li>
            <li> Works better if you use this cream along with exercise, i would recommend using this cream 15 minutes after shower to feel the thermal  but not right after shower, since you can feel a very very hot sensation on your skin</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to order this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, because I had a child, so I needed something to help me with my workouts as well as eating healthy.</li>
            <li> I may have applied too much the first time.</li>
            <li> it was that bad!).&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I would recommend it to pretty much everyone</li>
            <li> In the first 2-3 minutes you begin to feel the gentle warming sensation.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long at all before I was able to see results.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if you put too much product in you belly section that it causes uncontrollably visits to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> If you want an extreme action, wrap it your legs in plastic wrap, if you can stand it then it will work really good for you.</li>
            <li> Not only was it packaged well, the item was received fast and in good condition (especially for an APO address).  </li>
            <li> I always order new one when o finished it.makes ur skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and a half and am already seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li> The bottle states slight redness and a PLEASENT warm sensation</li>
            <li> I personally find the heat very satisfying because then I can actually feel the fat being melted away.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone, I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews, but just wanted to share this one, cuz I&#x27;m kind of surprised with results from this particular product.</li>
            <li> Though yes, under certain circumstances I can feel the burn.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I never write reviews, I can say that this makes you loose weight.</li>
            <li> Basically, just plan on not doing much for at least a good hour after putting it on, just to be safe, until you find out how long it lasts for you.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure that this product would actually work, but I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> When you flip the top open there is stopper that is really kind of hard to get out...</li>
            <li> i decided to try this product ,I  started using this product since last week , and i can see huge difference , everybody kept saying that i lost too much weight  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one tube doesn&#x27;t give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different.</li>
            <li> And it really helped to smooth out the back of my legs/booty.</li>
            <li> doing this 3 steps only, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference in the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is intense, guys.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting result after buying it..</li>
            <li> so I really hope this does</li>
            <li> but this stuff really helped.</li>
            <li> My husband really noticed too.</li>
            <li> If you order, be ready for some heat.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say this really works.</li>
            <li> it was a really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I have moved on to the second fasteners on my trainer and my waist appears to be slim and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really work....</li>
            <li> Some people might not like the burning sensation, but I say suck it up for 30 minutes, because this product really works.</li>
            <li> The stuff absolutely burns like the dickens.  </li>
            <li> No amount of physical labor or work outs would tone and smooth them out.</li>
            <li> it was too much for my comfort.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I didn&#x27;t really think it would work</li>
            <li> and i really sweat ...</li>
            <li> It really makes this heat up.</li>
            <li> This stuff work better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> admit that the heat sensation is annoying-and sometimes it&#x27;s intense and</li>
            <li> I see the changes now and it really does burn all the fat.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I see a different in my thighs smooth out.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t said nothing about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel anything, just felt like lotion.</li>
            <li> The gel has really smoothed out the cellulite</li>
            <li> You have to rub this product in until you can&#x27;t really feel the product in your hands anymore.</li>
            <li> This product really made my tummy that much slimmer and my skin softer and tighter.</li>
            <li> This gel has really helped me throughout my journey.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> The burning sensation you feel is really just a prop to make you feel like something is happening.</li>
            <li> While there is a tingling sensation upon application and one does sweat under the garment, I am not yet seeing any real change, so will continue using a bit longer and provide another update in another month or two.</li>
            <li> After 2 months, people say that I really look much thinner.</li>
            <li> It did absolute nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it really works.</li>
            <li> But when you put this on, you really do feel it.</li>
            <li> I will very irdering this again</li>
            <li> I use this product 2x a day along with light exercise, such as squats,leg lifts,jumping jacks,and etc.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just my high hopes and endorphins after a run,  but this morning they still look diminished!  </li>
            <li> I will be trying it out very soon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really promise anything</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s when I really feel the burn.</li>
            <li> It really does heat up within 5 minutes of applying.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works on stretch marks</li>
            <li> This really works-</li>
            <li> and fast.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that said there was an intense burning sensation and in order for it to be affective you needed to have skin without lotion on it</li>
            <li> The real results come from exercise.</li>
            <li> Do the &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; disappear not so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer that creams and lotions don&#x27;t work to reduce fat, no matter how much we wish.</li>
            <li> Lets be real</li>
            <li> I really like it and</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on.r stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference after finished using the whole container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a change</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend or not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Is there really a cream or lotion that can do what this claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> so it had absolutely nothing to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T BOTHER ME THAT MUCH</li>
            <li> WHEN I REALLY WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, I DO LOSE WEIGH FAST.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S REALLY WORKING FOR ME.</li>
            <li> and you see the diffrence very soon.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, but I already feel the heat when applied, which makes me think that minimally it is drawing more blood flow to my abdomen area, thus hoping it will help burn fat there.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t have much cellulite to begin with, but now my thighs are tighter.</li>
            <li> It works really well to reduce the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> This stuff really heats up and makes ya sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned it is important to burn fat instead of muscle, increase my metabolism, eat low-fat foods, and get regular exercise.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price, as well.</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with the neoprene type shorts, actually helps to smooth cellulite and slim.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very soothing to me.</li>
            <li> I have always had this one spot that no matter how much I ran/done</li>
            <li> /thermo hahaha</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while can&#x27;t really tell it if is working thanks</li>
            <li> I have to get beach ready</li>
            <li> But I am 33 and thanks to my family genetics, I do have some cellulite in the butt/lower hip area.</li>
            <li> and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li> for the second time.. and they sent me a free gift.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> There is a warming sensation after applying it as well, so don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li> My butt was on fire for about 30 minutes (haha)</li>
            <li> Now my problem was (before you presume anything, I defiantly shower and scrub myself very well all over</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very please with the results I continue to get with it on my stomach, so</li>
            <li> I really like the warming effect also...</li>
            <li> but it really did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> and there has really been a differenc</li>
            <li> I really did not see any result.............</li>
            <li> I do not recognize it was really helpful to remove Cellulite.</li>
            <li> and it had not bothered me much after that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid much attention to the look of any results yet....</li>
            <li> but I dont really care about that.</li>
            <li> It really burns your fat and it works.  </li>
            <li> Did not see any real results.</li>
            <li> I really do like it during my exercise.</li>
            <li> , really wish I had a warning before purchase.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to buy another tube.</li>
            <li> Con, I don&#x27;t like the smell, very perfumy.  </li>
            <li> I can tell my skin is much firmer and my tummy is disappearing.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their work out regimen.</li>
            <li> I were everlast neoprene bottoms that really act like sauna pants.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> a extra free Night Creme Packet Wasent Expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Omg.....it really work.......</li>
            <li> Then directly after I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll all stack back on.</li>
            <li> I just got it a few days ago and not one time did it tingle or get warm when I put it onto my skin.</li>
            <li> My workout regimen is fairly new (about 6 weeks in) but it is pretty intense.</li>
            <li> My workout regimen is fairly new (about 6 weeks in) but it is pretty intense.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUPER HOT AND CAN TELL A BIG DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li> Smells nice like lemons, burns like pepper on your skin which, while an odd sensation, as it&#x27;s a new one,</li>
            <li> almost so I am more of an extreme case.</li>
            <li> but compared to other brands it burned much more .</li>
            <li> Love  this  slim  extreme</li>
            <li> I like this product and the thermo sensation it gives, the instructions says to use it  twice a day but to my it works better after taking a shower, if I put it at any other time</li>
            <li> this product on one leg and another top product on the other leg.</li>
            <li> will not wast any more money on creams, massagers or the other stuff that is sold for cellulite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works; to be honest I don&#x27;t care to use it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh, minty sensation and your legs feel like you just sat on a load of icy hot</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to reduce the appearance of their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I applied right after a hot soak in the tub to open up the pores and allow for easier application, too.  </li>
            <li> My legs have like 50% less cellulite than when I first started (I have worked out a few times, but I&#x27;m sure the cream did most of the work).</li>
            <li> It left my skin silky smooth and very dewy and young looking.</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s barely noticebly but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather have big thighs than legs full of varicose veins.</li>
            <li> Wow,  Just applied this for the first time</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li> I use this on my full core, as well as back fat, and i put it on majority of my thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 1 week, once or twice a day, and my legs seem much firmer and the skin more tight and hydrated.</li>
            <li> i went down from 208 pounds to 202 in 2 weeks and my chest looks more shapely.</li>
            <li> I must admit the burn was a little more intense than I what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> For sure has thermo active ingredients!</li>
            <li> main concern is smoothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not expect such quick results.</li>
            <li> IT GETS PRETTY HOT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD A LAYER OF CLOTHING OVER THE AREA WHERE THE CREAM IS APPLIED.</li>
            <li> and I tested a small area on my thigh before I showered, just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too hot.  </li>
            <li> Goes quick, one can last for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Nothing will truly make it gone forever (in my opinion), but doing something that getting deeper into the skin and working the blood flow is a much better option than a cream that only goes so deep into the layers of your skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always in decent shape.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference if I first take a hot bath in the results.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful not to get some on you jay-jay, thats a whole new story !!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest though, in the past four weeks I have also kicked my dieting into high gear, and started exercising a few times a week as well, so I&#x27;m sure that is helping things along.  </li>
            <li> I weigh in the \\&quot;high normal\\&quot; on the BMI scale</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone in need/desire of improving skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> and I consider myself to have a fairly high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> Highly recoommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> nice warming sensation, but overall it didn&#x27;t do anything other than make my skin a bit softer.</li>
            <li> I am confident that with regular use, diet and exercise, my belly will be flat and toned.</li>
            <li> 800 - 100% Pure All Natural Weight Loss Supplement For All Body Types.</li>
            <li> ok it seems to work a little.</li>
            <li> I used this serum underneath my workout belt just to help me sweat a little more and this stuff does the job.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, that does not mean you cannot get rid of those &amp;#34;unwanted clumps&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> At first, I felt extremely dehydrated, so for better effect you do have to drink a lot of water, the more the better, since your body needs to get rid of all the bad stuff this gel has burnt.</li>
            <li> Amazing how Bath and Body Works and big companies can hardly get a fool proof formula down for under $15 but this has a multitude of purposes and does amazing at hydrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant burn, I actually kind of enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> After 3 days, I saw some minor changes in the tone and texture of the skin, at 8 days, the puffy area have begun to smooth out, and the rippled/ pitted stretch marked area has tightened up.</li>
            <li> I still have more cellulite to go, but not as much, I am a FIRM Believer and Recommend this serum to anyone want to get rid of the Cellulite.</li>
            <li> So if thats what youre looking for look elsewhere, however if you want to see the cellulite soften and pretty much disapear then this is definitely going to help.  </li>
            <li> My skin has become much more firm and taut.  </li>
            <li> I love this product using it everyday when I workout</li>
            <li> Wow, I felt really hot, probably because I had used a larger amount than the first time and had applied it on after a shower (like the instructions said...)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally go in for stuff like this---all those slimming creams and potions.</li>
            <li> It only heat activate when your fresh out the shower</li>
            <li> I just apply it has a normal moisturizing cream on hips and thighs .</li>
            <li> I would recommend to use it especially in winter time as it warms you up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t recommend this tipe of things</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change except for an extra hot ass.</li>
            <li> However, the burning only lasts for about 20 minutes and it was worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> and it does cause the areas to get hot, but it is working, and it only is lasting about 20-30 minutes, But with these Result I don&#x27;t mind the burning it is not bad burning</li>
            <li> i liked this scream and it would be one of my favorites if it wasn&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s note worthy that I only experience this sensation when I use the cream soon after showering all the natural oils off my skin.</li>
            <li> For example, before using it I did not feel confident enough to wear any shorts or skirts above mid thigh, about four weeks into using it, I felt confident enough to start wearing my short shorts and skirts again</li>
            <li> The key to it (in my experience) is doing it right after the shower.</li>
            <li> but the cream will only heat up if I apply it right after I shower.  </li>
            <li> I just got this item in the mail on the third day after ordering and right away tried it out.</li>
            <li> This popped me right back into shape in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I always use mine right after my shower when I figure my pores are open.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it burns fat off of your body, you actually have to eat right and exercise for that to happen.</li>
            <li> These people say cant feel anything maybe because you havent use enough, and you need to use it right after shower.</li>
            <li> but if you use it with working out and eating right you&#x27;ll definitely see results.</li>
            <li> Well to see results need to apply the cream right after shower, when the pores are open.</li>
            <li> As long as you remember to glob on large amounts of this  lotion!!</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few week and can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
            <li> I will say that it is mild and does not linger long at all.</li>
            <li> I think I was using too much at first on too many different areas because I got a little nauseous when I put around my waist.</li>
            <li> My only major concern is in regard to the ingredients and whether or not it is healthy to apply twice daily.  </li>
            <li> It was simple to spread on and seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and secure and the squeeze tubes were individually sealed in clear wrap&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY THE CREAM, BE REALISTIC, BUT ITS NOT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> but I also wanted a little something extra, I had saw this and was a bit non believing to be honest.</li>
            <li> In looking forward to new product&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li> By the time I notice a difference, those bottles were empty,so on to something new.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully, along with exercise 3-4 times a week and a healthy vegetarian diet which includes frequent juicing and lots of green tea.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and soft but not much change on the cellulite.</li>
            <li> Really like using Eveline&#x27;s thermo fat burning product, it really helps you shed those extra water weight!</li>
            <li> I expected it to make the skin warm, expected it to make me itch.  </li>
            <li> After I really worked it in I started to feel a warming sensation, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchased of Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Slimming Serum.</li>
            <li> I use it wit plastic wrap and massage it vigorously into my areas that need work, I do very little excersise,  mostly tilt, tuck, tighten</li>
            <li> I will probably only use it a few times a week, due to the chemicals and the warming sensation which isn&#x27;t very pleasant, especially since it&#x27;s the summer.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well and it has only been five days</li>
            <li> The circumstances under which I can feel the burn are application immediately after stepping out of the hot shower when my pores are open.</li>
            <li> Ive only tried it three times, the first two times i put it on before i worked out, i felt NOTHING.</li>
            <li> But that changed when one of my old friends was complaining about feeling burning sensation around her body from using slimming gel!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the order, a small sample packet of Eveline Slimming gel- Spa Edition was also included :).   </li>
            <li> I wish they sold smaller sizes to try it out first.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure which product is doing the most work</li>
            <li> I have had this cream for 2 weeks, and I&#x27;ve only used it about 5-6 times, but it is really affective on cellulite!</li>
            <li> U just need motivation from reading this and take the first step then order this cream, go get a sweat wrap, apply cream before wrap and a daily exercise!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvement within the first week and I&#x27;m ordering my second tube.</li>
            <li> I tried to rationalize that meaning I don&#x27;t have any more fat to burn, and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no more heat.</li>
            <li> I threw away 1/2 of the bottle because it did nothing but make my thighs break out in a hot, red bumpy rash!</li>
            <li> it did itch and got hot, but i still haven&#x27;t used it back on my</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve lost 5 inches!</li>
            <li> First, you may experience an initial &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation</li>
            <li> Since you will have to take the time to apply it in your body, take an extra 5 minutes and massage the area really well in circles, it does make a difference!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a little extreme thermo effect, but pleasant (to me at least), it makes you feel like your body is shrinking and cellulite is melting :)</li>
            <li> I found this gel and the thermal tingling sensation is a little strong</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to reporting more positive results back after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> It appears to be effective, but I am not sure if the result will last after usage is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I saw the numerous positive feedback n bought it.</li>
            <li> This product in the first few weeks seem to minimally smooth out some of my cellulite, but the cellulite was definitely still visible.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a short while but have noticed results extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Well, I at least like to think that way,since imagination is a pretty powerful tool as well!</li>
            <li> After looking at a large amount of different products I went with this one because of price, reviews and my enjoyment of warming products.</li>
            <li> I  inspected the area where I applied the lotion afterwards and noticed a SLIGHT decrease in cellulite, but nothing to get too excited about.</li>
            <li> and I start to sweat hard like a sona around my stomach, I love it.</li>
            <li> That means it wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> Although not immediate, the results became clearly noticeable in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, it leaves my skin soft and toned.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a sensation that you are in the sun in the areas coveres for 10 minutes, its a burning sensation, but I dont think it works much because when I go to the gym the burning calories feeling is completely different.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;delicate warming\\&quot; that the lotion talks about is more like burning.  </li>
            <li> The heat sensation lets you know is working, especially when it really heats up.</li>
            <li> Is my cellulite completely gone?  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I really do like it and have definitely noticed a difference..</li>
            <li> So far (1 week since I got it) I have been using this</li>
            <li> and I can definitely say that there is a very noticeable decrease in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been slim since I used to be a professional dancer, but I one problem always bothered me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had very visible cellulite in the back of my thy and of course buttocks.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second tube, I actually really think it helps with the appearance of cellulite when you use it with exercise.</li>
            <li> (I only have very minor/early stages of cellulite from age and having two children).  </li>
            <li> Now, I do have sensitive skin with some products and get redness, burning and itching, though I did not experience this with the Eveline product.</li>
            <li> As far as the product itself I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my cellulite dimples</li>
            <li> It makes the flab disappear and your skin soft within days.</li>
            <li> I go to bed early, 8:30-9 pm and wake up early 6 am.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I would definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised of the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that my veins are much visible (their big!!!)</li>
            <li> I am stoked so far.</li>
            <li> It really helps tone up your lower body especially when combined with exercise.</li>
            <li> + year old body..</li>
            <li> That is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> WOW, For those who say there is no burn...Are you kidding me?  </li>
            <li> Your pores will be open and ready to absorb the product.</li>
            <li> We all are different and some lose it fast, others take time.</li>
            <li> , I feel my skins get firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> : You know that atleast this stuff is trying to heat you up and giving an effort so you don&#x27;t feel like its a total waist which might be the whole heat up purpose</li>
            <li> SO FAR I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> is really in there to last for a while.</li>
            <li> Actually this serum really helped diminish the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li> but my skin is not too sensitive.</li>
            <li> but I developed faded looking patches all over my legs that lasted a couple months after using.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have used this one time so far.  </li>
            <li> when i got it i had mixed emotions about the cream really working</li>
            <li> it was soft and no cellulite in sight.</li>
            <li> I used 1 product daily and don&#x27;t see any change much.</li>
            <li> I used this product rather religiously, and tried to not look too much for immediate results.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for fast and visibly noticeable results - tighter skin and diminished cellulite appearance.</li>
            <li> I am in the early stages of use...about a month now.</li>
            <li> i had claw stretch marks and a pouch after my now seven month old was born.</li>
            <li> just use the old fashioned method of diet and exercise as i have been doing.</li>
            <li> Which has been a proble since I was young.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smoother and soft.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> they work, (and are all natural)</li>
            <li> Water acts as a natural cleanser by flushing toxins out of the body, therefore, stimulating body&#x27;s metabolic processes and reducing excess</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would reccommend this, especially to new mothers or someone who had just lost weight and has loose skin.</li>
            <li> I applied for 1 month straight on my right thigh ( both thighs are identical ) and after a month my skin was obviously tighter than the other by far!</li>
            <li> I liked it enough I have purchased a second bottle and several other lotions</li>
            <li> I have very flabby chunky thighs loaded with cellulite due to heredity and losing and gaining weight so much in my life.  </li>
            <li> if you can with stand the extra degrees this thermo active serum brings to you, then you would enjoy using this product, I causes me to get over-heated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very small, I workout 3 to 5 times a week, drink lots of water, eat healthy  </li>
            <li> For those of you who haven&#x27;t or are thinking about buying this product, try to imagine the burn you&#x27;d get from having red hot chili peppers on your skin, now multiply that by 2.</li>
            <li> and then I put on my workout gear and workout no less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, I didn&#x27;t feel anything, but the second time, I put it on after I got out of the shower and almost instantly started to feel the warmth</li>
            <li> Used it with no results as of yet .... will rate again later after I give it a decent try.</li>
            <li> Have not had it long enough to say if helping to burn fat, but it sure puts extreme heat to it.</li>
            <li> it really burns, at first i had to use fan to blow cold air on my legs just to be able to bare it.</li>
            <li> I just started my journey to get my high school body back.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong and for me, not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The creme has a strange smell to it, I personally can&#x27;t really stand it</li>
            <li> this product works as long as you are showered and shake it up really well</li>
            <li> feeling is like having icy hot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t hurt it just feels sort of like the Icy Hot</li>
            <li> I really liked this product i felt i saw results while using it, however one day i happened to read the back and noticed the warning.\\&quot;Persons with sensitive skin, prone to broken capillaries or varicose veins should not use this product,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but I have very huge unsightly valleys &amp; pits at my but &amp; thighs since 13 years old&amp; they are getting worse as</li>
            <li> All of the huge dents are now tiny little bumps.</li>
            <li> Either way, compared to my previous workout regimens in the past, the skin on my legs is feeling much tighter as a consistency period, not just more muscular or slimmer, which I believe is from the lotion.</li>
            <li> Either way, compared to my previous workout regimens in the past, the skin on my legs is feeling much tighter as a consistency period, not just more muscular or slimmer, which I believe is from the lotion.</li>
            <li> Just for extra information, I didnt get any new vericose veins while using this product, but I dont think I&#x27;ll be using it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and makes my skin softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is very inexpensive and worth trying at least once to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> The first few days I applied without steaming prior and felt absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Once on takes only a few minutes to start working, at first was a bit to much</li>
            <li> thighs were a major issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering it again because it really helped me loose weight.</li>
            <li> Adding things in such as dry brushing (using a paddle brush to agitate the skin some, as well as break up the clustered fat cells that are the existence of cellulite in the first place from lack of circulation), maybe saran wrapping (lots of ppl use things like icyhot or coconut oil to saran wrap their cores from what i gather on the internet and get off an inch or so in a day even, be it water weight or not), using this under a wrap before a workout as well as after my post-workout shower, and whatever else I can find that might make this product work the hardest</li>
            <li> All Natural Organic - Super Weight Loss Instant Green Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) -</li>
            <li> I use it after the shower gel and with the thermo active shaping serum, This one doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as the shaping one</li>
            <li> When I put this on the first time, I expected intense burning as described in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Since I am older, I am trying anything I can along with staying active and eating right to speed up the process in fear that this may be harder to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only thing i was a little bummed with was the smell and the amount of rubbing in, it was thicker than i expected more creamy compared to the nivea one---</li>
            <li> I reluctantly purchased this cream/serum after reading other reviewers&#x27; comments and noticing that the reviews were mostly positive.</li>
            <li> It will firm the skin and reduce cellulite just be consistent and use daily, to shrink your arms, stomach thighs and (back fat in my cse) rub on prior  to exercising to see maximum results, you&#x27;ll see your cottage cheese thighs become more firm with less cellulite in less then a month, just be consistent!!!</li>
            <li> I am definitely a repeat customer because I can clearly see differences in my body appearance.</li>
            <li> I used it only once so far.</li>
            <li> i didnt use it twice a day, only once in the morning after shower and considering im old (49)</li>
            <li> im tall and skinny with an athletic body but cant outrun bits of cellulite on my bum and back thighs which makes me self conscious during bikini season, so I purchased this and used it for about a month, with no sign of improvement</li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED, THE ADVERTISEMENT IS VERY MISLEADING, AND NOT i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> Back to this product, please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The burn is similar to that of Icy Hot.</li>
            <li> The burn lasts for a little more than half an hour.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight bit of a strange warm sensation (especially after a shower) and it smells odd, but you&#x27;ll just have to get over that.</li>
            <li> It does cause a warming sensation for the first 30 minutes or so, but to me that just means it&#x27;s not your typical watered-down lotion.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a trip to a African desert for sure, not bad, if your needing a vacation from a long cold loney blizzard.</li>
            <li> I still have cellulite but not as much visible as it was pre slim extreme.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but the warming action can get a little intense</li>
            <li> but it doesnt heat up that much for me as ive read on other reviews.</li>
            <li> but they do not work as intensely as Eveline Slim Extreme.</li>
            <li> sooooooo my pretty behind, quickly turned unattractive, and needless to say I wont touch my backend with this stuff any more because of the acne it caused, I rather have a moon for a butt than one with acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this product numerous times with no other products on my skin</li>
            <li> feel to it, nothing major, but I would defiantly buy this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> my skin have no chage, no even a little hot and don&#x27;t know if it is not working for me or</li>
            <li> and it did have a little itch first time</li>
            <li> It does get a little hot</li>
            <li> Please be aware that this will get you in trouble at airports.</li>
            <li> first few times I put it on</li>
            <li> I have cellulite pretty bad for a very fit person.  </li>
            <li> My neck and chin, even my face has slimmed down ALOT, but my skin is much smoother and tighter</li>
            <li> When used consistently I can see my thighs get a little smaller (with or without my workouts).</li>
            <li> I have some serious cellulite behind my thighs and haven&#x27;t been able to wear a bathing suit or a pair of short shorts for years, but this summer I&#x27;m super determined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the positive reviews seem to be by reviewer&#x27;s with one or few reviews in the past; though, they are noted as \\&quot;amazon verified purchase\\&quot;, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and other than smelling like bengay, i don&#x27;t really notice any difference, and proof it does what is says or even implies, tried several different types of this product from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You must remember there is no magic cream, you need to eat right, do some exercise and make a commitment to this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 3-4 weeks ago knowing that the likelihood of success was probably small but because of the low price took the chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but at first did not exercise work it on.</li>
            <li> Just to get the background - I started having cellulite and strech marks when first became pregant with my first dauther - strech marks were and still are pretty bad</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again, but I&#x27;ll check back after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> When this product came in I put it on my right leg 2xs a day for 2 weeks and kept using the other product on my other leg.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to much star with a little bit to see your body tolerance.</li>
            <li> My thighs looked tight and smooth with just a few dimples in the upper thigh area.  </li>
            <li> I just received the slim extreme 3D thermo active slimming serum and applied it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference, used this product faithfully for over 6 weeks, I run/work out hard and eat right, still no results.</li>
            <li> It probably does take at least a full hour to an hour and a half before it completely goes away.  </li>
            <li> over the years i have tried several creams n lotions n treatments including endermologie &amp; radio frequency &amp; the vacuum suck treatment  which i have forgotten the name of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used it other times of day, and not really felt much.</li>
            <li> it is absolutely dripping wet from perspiration due to the cream and the neoprene.</li>
            <li> This product which promised to have a warm sensation after applying to troubled spots for cellulite  and other claims doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Either I got a defective tube, or the other claims are wildly distorted.  </li>
            <li> So I originally got this for my behind, for cellulite, let me tell you</li>
            <li> Rub icy hot all over your cellulite infested areas, or areas you wish to &#x27;firm up&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It is a total and utter waste of money and it&#x27;s extremely laughable that the product label refers to a &amp;#34;Pleasant warm sensation&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You might have a hard time keeping it on the first time.</li>
            <li> I have lost all of my baby weight from having my 3rd daughter and of course being a 32 year old mother of 3, there can be areas that needa little extra help.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old black female.  </li>
            <li> but you also don&#x27;t have to be extreme with exercise, I just simply dance a little to some songs on my iPod that only really lasts for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this product i was a little worried i had just thrown my money away on another worthless product, my order cane a lot quicker than expected :) ive only used this product a few days and my family has noticed they say my legs look better!</li>
            <li> but i didnt feel it was as hot as others have complained.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure about the fat burning but the anti-cellulite portion absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I apologize, but this is the first product that I have gotten off of Amazon that I have not liked...</li>
            <li> I like the price, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results but if it works I will purchase from this seller again.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this long enough to know if it worked.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it long enough to see if there are results.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how long it takes, this stuff does actually work and with consistency, you can get to where you want to be.</li>
            <li> I exercise every other day riding my bike several miles, power walking mixed with jogging, Zumba, and Yoga, alternating each one on a different day.</li>
            <li> Love the product, only disappointing part was the amount.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a searing burning, painful sensation after application, and was pleasantly surprised that while there was heat, the sensation felt more like using a heating pad.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing, it barely got warm :(  </li>
            <li> I used the thermo serum after shower on my outer thighs (on dry skin) twice daily.</li>
            <li> It provides a lot of energy, which I find very helpful as I diet (helps to overcome that always tired feeling that we dieters have while reducing our calories and still needing to take care of a busy life).</li>
            <li> Eat right, drink fluids, yet the cellulite I had on my stomach, upper thighs would not go away and was frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly warm right below my butt, where my cellulite is at its worst.  </li>
            <li> In a swimsuit or in a tight dress there is clearly a difference.</li>
            <li> i have a 2 year old and still little chubby not satisdied with my body yet.</li>
            <li> but if like me tired of how u look and what a change fast this will help!!</li>
            <li> but you really have to work out hard to see any difference.</li>
            <li> (Surgery really effected my muscles for a year and was hard to excercise)</li>
            <li> I usually love heat in general, but this was way too painful.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, even though it has not completely disappeared as of yet, this cream has made it drastically improve.  </li>
            <li> and I have had cellulite for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> My 18 year old niece used it on her trouble areas before she exercise</li>
            <li> i used anything and everything and so far i have my few favorites.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I felt the heat and the melting action of my fatty 60</li>
            <li> and the bottle looked bigger than expected (:</li>
            <li> then I have spent enough time in a tanning bed to be saved from this for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> COZ MY BELLY WAS REALLY STRETCHED.</li>
            <li> the body with strange chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However... I do work out 6 days a week a long with this.</li>
            <li> so I think it will take long than the week I have been using this to notice a difference in that.</li>
            <li> out 6 days a week a long with this.</li>
            <li> so I think it will take long than the week I have been using this to notice a difference in that.</li>
            <li> I think it does somewhat help with the appearance of cellulite with long term use</li>
            <li> Love this stuff the burning is as expected very uncomfortable the first few times but you get use to it!</li>
            <li> Still using it can&#x27;t wait for the long term results</li>
            <li> After I got used to the routine of using it properly and combining my work out with proper eating, the result showed it self in less then</li>
            <li> all day.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, my tummy fold seem noticeably smaller and noticed a half inch lost.</li>
            <li> I been using it for a month, and i reorder it again, but i also ordered two more items from the same Slim extreme series( shower gel and serum with cold effect).</li>
            <li> Not so fast but little by little.</li>
            <li> Not sure who is wrote the other reviews, but it did absolutely nothing for me .I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll post a follow-up after I have used it for a while in case there are any other men out there that suffer from the same issue as me.</li>
            <li> I would say that the potential health risks due to the ingredients are just notworth the lackluster results</li>
            <li> It was also delivered earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a major change in firming or tightening but it did help a little.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because everyone I had bought was much more expensive</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of the slim extreme products, and after losing 50 lbs and having 6 children I have a lot of extra skin</li>
            <li> This slim extreme does heat up your skins, I guess if you&#x27;re walk or running outside you&#x27;ll sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> but I also am at the lowest weight I have been in a very long</li>
            <li> I applied it and the itching only made it feel more painful.    </li>
            <li> To maximize I&#x27;d use a dry brush.</li>
            <li> I blow dry to speed up the heating process, or if I am just toning my neck and face</li>
            <li> It clearly says in the product that don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin, prone to broken capillaries or varicose veins.</li>
            <li> but simply something that helps if you are already active</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been analyzing the reviews for a few of the different cellulite creams-all of which I have personally tried and ordered through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but it only last a few minutes.</li>
            <li> like as a kid when you stand in front of the fireplace too long, then sit down and the back of your legs burn.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this product got 4 stars is because it worked, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a single star because it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> However, I do think it has some irritant that is supposed to heat up the skin, since I accidentally touched my face with the hand I was applying the cream with and felt instant irritation around the eye area, so there is something in it, just not strong enough to give out Thermo effect.</li>
            <li> I have lost approximately 4inches from the first purchase of my cream and trainer which was on 18th of January.</li>
            <li> i NEVER experienced the warming or hot sensation...ever...</li>
            <li> it is not as effective as it says, i am a bit disappointed with the product, not impress at all</li>
            <li> I am pretty thin but that seems to be my traget problem.</li>
            <li> Before I even bought this product I had lost about thirty pounds and had a lot of loose skin with my cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I measured my tummy area and it was at 39.7&amp;#34;, on January 2nd and today is January 18, 2015 and is down to 38&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> They took my review down last time because I said it didn&#x27;t work which it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help me with that last little bit of trimming, but this paraben-laden chemical cocktail is clearly not the way to go.  </li>
            <li> and when u apply it you have got to rub it n till its completely dry in order for the serum to activate!</li>
            <li> I have battled cellulite practically my entire life despite being normal to thin on my weight.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going to just waste my money, but I was willing to at least try it because I was embarrassed to wear shorts anymore.  </li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin person it burns like crazy when you put it on first.</li>
            <li> Not using it regularly, but whenever I do it has a slight heating sensation.</li>
            <li> I have yet to c results since its only been less than a week.</li>
            <li> I used this cream every day twice a day for over a month and a half in combination with working out, so nobody can say I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;patient&amp;#34; enough.</li>
            <li> The odd thing is that I rubbed it on my abs, arms, and upper legs...</li>
            <li> Only slight warmth elsewhere.</li>
            <li> the Slim Extreme 3d Active Slimming Serum is definitely the go-to.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give it a negative review because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week which isn&#x27;t long enough to say if the products works.</li>
            <li> Sure, I had less cellulite but looked like I had diseased skin.</li>
            <li> There is a warming effect from this lotion that was tolerable if I simply applied it on dry skin that had not been washed for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, the warming is actually very comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you stay consistent and put this product on before a work out or a walk you will notice dramatic differences throughout the week</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product after reading reviews and using Nivea&#x27;s similar product with little results for about four weeks</li>
            <li> I put a little gel on my upper arms, stomach and thighs in a circular motion to activate the gel</li>
            <li> And yes I do have a little extra fat</li>
            <li> The warmth is not at all bothersome for me and in fact makes me feel that it is actually working on those little unattractive dimpled areas.</li>
            <li> The ladies might know those little &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; on the inside upper part of the legs.</li>
            <li> I also notice people have recently been actively been down voting this review as \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cream, but when I put it on, it feels just a a very thick, hard to absorb white cream that gives nothing back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay not too bad</li>
            <li> I have a toddler, so my exercise usually entails playing with her or going for long walks; nothing too extensive or rigorous.  </li>
            <li> At first i was really getting disappointed</li>
            <li> but I only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try (used Nivea and St. Ives cellulite gel/lotion with minimal results).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really not that</li>
            <li> IT HELPS ME SWEAT UNDER THE WAIST TRIMMER AND IVE NOTICE MINIMAL RESULTS.</li>
            <li> The next few times I have used it I have felt nothing, I might as well be smoothing on baby lotion.</li>
            <li> Took only a few minutes for the lotion to activate and</li>
            <li> but i did continue to use this with no real results.  </li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no change, or reduction, of cellulite after going through two tubes of this product.  </li>
            <li> I did use it after that but had to be careful as to not get it too close to my bb.  </li>
            <li> Do I have confidence that it works, not really.  </li>
            <li> Has definitely helped me shed a few pounds in the waist.</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO GET A FIRM BELLY.</li>
            <li> PART, MY SKIN STARTING TO GET FIRM.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be alarming, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> and it says to use it twice a day so not much</li>
            <li> EVERY BIT OF IT!!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S NOT MUCH</li>
            <li> I think this product works well if you use it regularly and needs to rub well the fatty areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I have a few pointers about using the product that I personally found helpful.</li>
            <li> but I personally got used to that in just a few days</li>
            <li> that goes around my stomach while I work out, or even just during everyday activity after I put the creme on my mid section, buttocks and legs.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, I saw no additional improvement.  </li>
            <li> On my third tube don&#x27;t waste money on body wraps just use this and sweat it out.  </li>
            <li> I bought the program for I think $45.00 (I understand it is a bit pricey, but if you think about it, if you bought a few tubes of this stuff you could have gotten something that actually worked)</li>
            <li> I think the Slim Extreme tightened the loose skin somewhat.</li>
            <li> Yes, you could feel the relaxing warming sensation, but other than that, it didn&#x27;t actually get rid of even a little cellulite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong as the medical version in Brasil.  </li>
            <li> Once it started working, my skin looked tighter and firmer and the cellulite (that had been bothering me for so long) appeared less noticeable.</li>
            <li> i have lost almost all the nasty cellulite that just with in one month.i love this cream!!</li>
            <li> Also, just a warning - this cream burned so much the first few times that I thought I&#x27;ll explode - it as unbearable and not so much painful as exremely itchy.</li>
            <li> just want everyone to know that all those fantastic ratings are indeed fake!</li>
            <li> and I have seen a few results, but not MAJOR ones.</li>
            <li> So in a desperate moment (and my husband says my first &#x27;blond&#x27;&#x27; moment in 17 years of marriage), I bought this product a month ago at a chemist and have vigilantly rubbed it on my thighs twice daily.</li>
            <li> Did not smooth skin as expected ... also doesn&#x27;t keep the skin heated for a long time during your workout...</li>
            <li> There are steps you can take (like drinking grapefruit juice before a meal to reduce your insulin levels) to shave a few pounds off over time, but ultimately it comes down to dieting and exercising.  </li>
            <li> A little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this a lot, a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> About 3 weeks ago, I sat and read alot of the reviews on this Product here on Amazon and listen to other people responses</li>
            <li> It also made me extremely itchy everywhere</li>
            <li> other&#x27;s say it did</li>
            <li> I apologize if I gave the wrong impression about it the first time I posted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> , I decided to look at firming creams despite my personal belief there is no magic elixir in a tube.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it every other day</li>
            <li> The slimming gel- thermo one that I bought and have been using for the past month about 2 times per day actually works.</li>
            <li> i received it in my birthday gift basket along with lots of other skin care products.</li>
            <li> I received my Slim Extreme today.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and was so excited, only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a warming sensation on the skin upon application that, for me, lasts no longer than 20 minutes and is quite tolerable.</li>
            <li> If the heat is too bothersome, I recommend waiting for a couple of hours after showering before application (but do not apply any other oils or creams beforehand).</li>
            <li> I also use skin firming cream about two hours after applying Extreme 3D.</li>
            <li> I wore shorts out the other night to a dinner</li>
            <li> any of you had luck with their other products?</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have already recommended it to EVERYONE, and cannot wait to try the cooling skin firming slim extreme product.  </li>
            <li> Then I found Slim Extreme 3D.  </li>
            <li> Slim Extreme 3d is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it felt weird at first</li>
            <li> i ordered this and other product.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with other slimming creams before I workout.</li>
            <li> Might have to be due to the FDA regulations.</li>
            <li> NOT EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Not exactly a dream cream</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how big or small you are cellulite happens.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it&#x27;s actual price is no more than $2</li>
            <li> B002BS43HU Slim Extreme 3d Thermo Active Slimming Serum - Anti-Cellulite Fat Burner 250ml]]</li>
            <li> Slim Extreme 3d Thermo Active Slimming Serum makes me look way thinner.</li>
            <li> but that is not your fault slim extreme 3d thermo active slimming serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a month and a half (about six or seven weeks), and let me tell you - IT WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to get the cellulite active under skin.</li>
            <li> I was already active.  </li>
            <li> What do you have equilivant to this item with the thermo active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> THIS THERMO ACTIVE CREAM IS TRULY THERMO ACTIVE.</li>
            <li> I use this item as well as the active 3d Serum</li>
            <li> active</li>
            <li> but, its that crazy, and yes the cellulite have gone from my legs and it worked quickly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using Eveline anticellute shower gel and the thermo active serum together.</li>
            <li> Its heat active</li>
            <li> I have used it on my upper arm for about a month, and I am seeing a slight bit of firming, but I&#x27;m not sure  if it&#x27;s due to this product, or Mother Nature.  </li>
            <li> , I felt a slight fear of getting cancer or some other life threatening complication.</li>
            <li> I will never be able to rid myself of cellulite as it is horrible, but this put a dent in it, and no other product ever has.  </li>
            <li> and it made my eyes water because it was a CONSTANT burning, not a \\&quot;delicate warming\\&quot; like</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> some things are just not worth it, and it&#x27;s not like i had just shaved my legs or anything.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> while meant well in execution is not worth the price I paid and that was 13 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I also took to the gym (which at least shows I have a vestige of intelligence left, dear hubby!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got it on them before after applying it to my stomach, and burning wrists and arms are not fun.</li>
            <li> The cream can really heat up, but for me, has never been uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I started getting it in high school- at 103 pounds and now at 32 it is pretty bad at 130 pounds and a mom!</li>
            <li> I like to put it on my stomach and put my McDavid Tummy trimmer on it and lay down,</li>
            <li> With increased security we were patted down and they took the cream from us</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are trying to slim down.</li>
            <li> Every time I sit down I could feel my belly sticking out.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect result with just sitting down</li>
            <li> Yes of course u can&#x27;t expect to lay down all day and eat what u want</li>
            <li> It does help you slim down without</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product over any other!</li>
            <li> This is the pattern for the -Slim Extreme 3D, Slim Fat Girl Bliss &amp; Finulite-all of which I have tried with little to no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I recommend other to use this product!</li>
            <li> and I already noticed the changes.&lt;br /&gt;The cellulite appearance on my belly is much less.</li>
            <li> but for less than twenty bucks a bottle, why not try it and see??  </li>
            <li> I should start by saying that I am not super overweight, have about 20lbs to lose.</li>
            <li> The burn gradually increases but then disappears within a half hour.</li>
            <li> Did a half hour work out</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and half, once a day</li>
            <li> MAy be slightly even tone of skin.</li>
            <li> a day and a small amount (I have a small surface area to cover, I am not a big woman)  </li>
            <li> slightly getting your skin warmer</li>
            <li> The hanging skin is less than before.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight &#x27;heat&#x27; that comes after applying, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Well I have used this product for 1 month now and it seems to helps, like I have less cellulite on my thighs</li>
            <li> My abdomen is much less dimply, and my thighs have improved, though not as rapidly as my abs.</li>
            <li> but you can feel a slight tingling sensation and warmth when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, in just days of using this product I have less of what I call &#x27;raisin belly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I felt a slight tingling, thats about it.</li>
            <li> this product said slight burning</li>
            <li> I lost an inch and a half in a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I been using this product for about a week, week and a half but have yet to see results.</li>
            <li> I did exercise a little on the side, and I continued on with my regular diet (which really isnt even that bad)</li>
            <li> I was a very petite girl who had 3 very large babies and my stomach looked awful afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is dangerous I am scared to put it on agian though it did tighten my skin on thighs first time</li>
            <li> but this is not worth all the trouble.</li>
            <li> i ve been using this product for a little less than a month</li>
            <li> It has a spicy feeling when apply to leg and arms, but no special feeling when I apply it to the thighs and belly, where has the largest amount of fat.</li>
            <li> I would say it helps firms up things a little.</li>
            <li> A little background, I yo-yo about 40 pounds every 6 months.</li>
            <li> maybe when it gets a little colder out, maybe I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my tummy looks a little flatter</li>
            <li> but I did feel it when I put a little under my chin.  </li>
            <li> Try to do a little work out and eat healthier along with using it</li>
            <li> Has little mint that makes skin tingle</li>
            <li> I kept trying it for a week, although no significant weight loss, I can feel the body is tighter a little bit.</li>
            <li> the past 6 months, I&#x27;ve been using Slim Extreme 3d and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It burns your skin and does little else.</li>
            <li> IT WORKED A LITTLE BIT</li>
            <li> first tiem trying it, it was really irritating anf burned my skin!!</li>
            <li> I deserved to lose money though since I was dumb enough to buy it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels tighter, it also burns a little</li>
            <li> I work out constantly and eat fish and veggies, i just have cellulite and its very hard to get rid of, so</li>
            <li> I think it doesn&#x27;t tingle on my legs probably because I don&#x27;t agitate and scrub them as much or as hard as,say my belly, plus the skin is probably a hell of a lot less sensitive and thin on my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my stomach a few times, and the skin feels a little tighter.</li>
            <li> No thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Like it really burns and then gets cold.  </li>
            <li> Burns like crazy and did absolutely nothing for my stomach.</li>
            <li> My skin is much firmer, and my cellulite is definetly reduced!It&#x27;s a product that really helps getting rid of these terrible bumps that we carry for years!You</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and I won&#x27;t be buying it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> For three weeks It doesn&#x27;t work at all, waste of $ .</li>
            <li> I used one of this product and used it everyday after shower.</li>
            <li> and use it twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s gonna take longer than a few weeks</li>
            <li> I now have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> The product helps slim your waste and the apperance of celulite.  </li>
            <li> Ive had this lotion for a few days now.</li>
            <li> I do not know what they are talking about, this product is useless as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> so I showered and then began applying the lotion after I thoroughly dried myself off.  </li>
            <li> If you are a couch potato , don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I did it a few months before my wedding</li>
            <li> The cream immediately tightens the skin surface and the warming effect lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try it again a few hours before bed and sleep with it on.  </li>
            <li> few months now I can say I see</li>
            <li> I believe you can eat anything you want, in moderation, if you work out everyday.  </li>
            <li> Just got this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always had fatty tissue under my armpits that makes my chest get that saggy look .</li>
            <li> i still have some fatty tissue in that area</li>
            <li> I like the green serum sample she sent me too.   </li>
            <li> so, i guess thermo for winter and green one for summer.</li>
            <li> I put time into being burned, working out, and wearing and will wear anything even if I am no comfortable if it works.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, its not a money waste.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money and in my opinion should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> B008CIGOU2 Green Coffee Bean Extract</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It did help to see a reduction in the appearance of cellulite in some trouble areas.</li>
            <li> so I will plough on and hopefully see some results in few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream a few days, so I can&#x27;t tell yet.  </li>
            <li> everyday so, hope it could help.</li>
            <li> Does not work, I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I use a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Reason why is because I don&#x27;t put this on everyday, maybe 2-3x a week and still get results.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I lost a few inches on my waist.</li>
            <li> I few helpful hints I found and will share.  </li>
            <li> I used this because I had some fatty spots that were being stubborn as I was losing weight.  </li>
            <li> another total rip-off bulls**t product.</li>
            <li> The divits in your thighs are caused by small areas where the fat has separated and there is none or little causing your skin to concave in that area.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was burning like I had a really bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> After using for maybe 12 weeks I looked in the mirror and was pretty shocked at the level of improvement.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because the company will not refund your money if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost 50lbs over the past few months through diet and exercise and have kept the weight off.  </li>
            <li> how harsh, fake, and gross.</li>
            <li> For the cellulite to be gone (or, at least become less visible), you need to...</li>
            <li> this cream is a little thick</li>
            <li> I was at the point of considering surgery because I was so frustrated with the whole situation.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day usually..</li>
            <li> Product was warming to skin not sure about results</li>
            <li> It does that not sure about results yet.</li>
            <li> also was not sure to believe it.</li>
            <li> I usually use it after taking a showing and then use the serum</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether I should try another product or not.</li>
            <li> if u have a balanced diet, eat 6 small meals a day..</li>
            <li> Sorry, wish I had a different review to offer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing small differences</li>
            <li> I just got this and not sure if it will help with my cellulite</li>
            <li> My chest was on fire after a few minutes!  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want an uneven body or face!</li>
            <li> a past review I read about getting all over your clothes.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this isn&#x27;t for lazy people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ill be back</li>
            <li> This is the weirdest, freakiest, most disgusting thing ever.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks with my results!</li>
            <li> I will turn 50 in 2013, and as a petite woman all my life, I did not have cellulite until the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helps with any fat burn</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> but i havent used it everyday as i should!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if has firmed my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use it after my workouts.  </li>
            <li> But I have a difficult time eating low-fat foods and getting regular exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> , This is THE PRODUCT that eliminated my trouble spots (YAY!) -along</li>
            <li> This is no magic spot eraser</li>
            <li> Some of my cellulite has disappeared over the past couple of weeks after using the lotion as directed, so hopefully they continue to disappear with diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I have used various products--mostly from Yves Rocher, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> As crazy as it sounds, after two uses, I woke up and the back of my legs felt TIGHT.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading positive reviews however i am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is so unbelievably painful (and I have a decent pain tolerance) and once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> and i am dead serious  </li>
            <li> I had to stay in the cold shower for at least 25 minutes and wash it completely off for the burning to stop.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going to have to say \\&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s not as easy as buying a lotion to make those nasty thighs all smooth\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There may not even be a hard cure; some of my slenderest friends have cellulite as well</li>
            <li> And it was too hard to wash off my hands.</li>
            <li> However, this product is helping me knock off those hard to get inches.  </li>
            <li> (Although they dont know my little secret)</li>
            <li> I really have no idea why I was so stupid to buy that.</li>
            <li> my target is to reach at least 120-125..</li>
            <li> Have not seen alot of results yet, but will give it at least a month or two.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I were both stopped because the meter went crazy as we walked through the arms above head meter.</li>
            <li> But if you work out at least 3 to 4 days a week you&#x27;ll definately see results.</li>
            <li> ** on and by the time i realized it was melting my insides, it was too late.</li>
            <li> they should have negative stars</li>
            <li> At least I tried it</li>
            <li> There was no warm sensation from the cream.</li>
            <li> At least they tried.</li>
            <li> Two weeks and have not notice any change, but the instructions said that it will take at least 4wks to notice any change.</li>
            <li> I would give this product negative stars if I could.  </li>
            <li> and I like the warming feeling when it&#x27;s cold outside!  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of weeks before you notice the difference in smoother legs, but for this to happen, you have to apply at least once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> thick lotion&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> No creams or vitamins have helped and even with excessive exercising, it&#x27;s still there!</li>
            <li> dont buy this shit!!</li>
            <li> Few facts about cellulite to those who keep acting shocked thst you can have it being thin.</li>
            <li> The product did what it said it would do, however I feel like they should warn you to not plan anything for an hour after applying because you will be constantly itching and feel very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> In the past, they have all seemed like a bunch of false claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the expensive creams $100+ the costly serums with little to no results</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews I read, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but I am a product junkie</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not that bad of a product.</li>
            <li> Domestic burn too bad</li>
            <li> Nothing can stop u if u want it bad enough!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and its no good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, after getting sick of my cellulite and extra fat.  </li>
            <li> But I did not use this since I was unhappy with the other products.</li>
            <li> 3rd order no results , giving up :-(</li>
            <li> Well, this product makes my skin itch like crazy and the warming sensation is still in effect after an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> Seriously, those people are being wayy too overly dramatic.</li>
            <li> and I mean that part of my body drips in sweat!</li>
            <li> When it says there is a heat, they mean it!</li>
            <li> Some say it&#x27;s not great, but I think that&#x27;s your preference.</li>
            <li> I now use it for tired muscles.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using as I&#x27;m tired of feeling</li>
            <li> The dimples are getting worse as I am aging (49)</li>
            <li> so amazed with this cream,i have been  struggling with stomach area since ive had my 3 kids was tired of looking like</li>
            <li> I like to use as regular base</li>
            <li> It burns if you get the product in your armpits or behind knees.</li>
            <li> So tired of false advertising.</li>
            <li> Applying too thin will have no sensation at all, which I think does not work.</li>
            <li> I am doubtful to go back.</li>
            <li> it was worse in the shower...</li>
            <li> Poor</li>
            <li> No matter how thin I am it is always there.  </li>
            <li> They stand behind what they sell.</li>
            <li> Creme put me in the hospital for almost two weeks, very bad reaction to my stomach, please seek health professional before use..</li>
            <li> the burn is bad and was not worth going thru for no results.</li>
            <li> I lift very heavy and after a cold shower it helps soothes my sore muscles.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation can be very uncomfortable but, if you can get past that you will see results.  </li>
            <li> I do exercise a lot as well, but i did this before Slim Extreme and the annoying &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; were still there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that oily left behind feeling, and doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
            <li> I have to say I think I might be addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> Its complicated to prove it works.</li>
            <li> this lotion made me unbearably uncomfortable for about an hour after applying it.    </li>
            <li> However I took off one star because of how uncomfortable it made me.  </li>
            <li> A LOT - to the point where it is definitely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The burning seems to be uncomfortable anywhere from twenty to forty minutes after I put it on, and then gradually lessens.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference after diligent use of the cream.</li>
            <li> and I posted it in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Alas!</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> and it couldn&#x27;t be anymore wrong.</li>
            <li> It feels so weird, immediately your stomach starts to heat up and it feels like you are wearing a heating pad.</li>
            <li> Did nothing but made my legs smell weird and feel tingly</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s weird as Hell that it penetrates your epidermis...</li>
            <li> anywhere I used it wrong</li>
            <li> Keep me wrong and sweeting.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this product.</li>
            <li> Oh and it smells horrible, and you have to wash your hands 50 different times.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, I suspect that the 5 stars are fake and/or from the company itself to boost sales.</li>
            <li> This silly product is useless and should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> , ill  continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry I will not get it again</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried it anyway</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am usually a sensible consumer but podgy thighs have made a moron of me.</li>
            <li> I recomend this lotion for people up north in the snow &amp; cold</li>
            <li> If you purchase this thinking it&#x27;s going to sculpt your legs like you&#x27;ve been playing soccer and riding horses all your life, then you&#x27;re crazy.</li>
            <li> Doing bar squats and lunges like crazy but couldnt shake the appearance of the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> then i put Thermo serum, and at night i use cold slimming serum.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything (which was a bit disappointing)</li>
            <li> The heat is crazy, but I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I was running around the house like a wounded chicken.</li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap!  </li>
            <li> I had to jump into my shower to try and wash it off and just get relief from the cold water.</li>
            <li> and I sweat like crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing as the tingling effect</li>
            <li> ill do an update in two weeks, and two weeks after that!</li>
            <li> and this is just scary!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very  skeptical in the beginning and didn&#x27;t think it would do anything because it didn&#x27;t burn like</li>
            <li> Every bit of intelligence tells me that it is impossible for a cream to make you lose inches</li>
            <li> Yes there is a warming sensation, but it isnt bad.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> By the way my husband was using it for a bad neck not to lose inches.</li>
            <li> I wanted to believe that this creme would reduce the appearance for me, BADLY.</li>
            <li> My cellulite was so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to be seen in a dress, let alone</li>
            <li> This lotion BURNS badly, as well as, itches.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and it burned my legs so badly.</li>
            <li> Warming not to bad.</li>
            <li> and I am really shocked by how it dramatically reduced the cellulite.  </li>
            <li> My legs are on fire, in a way that isn&#x27;t painful, but is probably helpful.</li>
            <li> It is horribly painful</li>
            <li> but it is a really painful burn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost painful.  </li>
            <li> n bad :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be disappointed with Slim 3-D.</li>
            <li> it disappointed me</li>
            <li> Word of advice after applying it wash your hands and arms (with cold water and soap)!...</li>
            <li> i was disappointed every time</li>
            <li> Rashed my legs out :(</li>

            <li> It is very painful.</li>
            <li> and I have this awful orange skin.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to say the shipping fees for this were outrageous and it took well over 8 days to receive.</li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible.</li>
            <li> I always hated my thighs!!  </li>
            <li> To all the ladies out there trying stuff that never works or buying expensive cream we can not afford!!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion burns terribly.</li>
            <li> I have horrible cellulite on my thighs and butt.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t workout and wear this followed by a shower because doing in that order makes you burn in that shower and feels awful.</li>
            <li> Really terrible.  </li>
            <li> It was awful</li>
            <li> But it caused this worst case of acne there ever.</li>

            <li> Been using this product daily for about three weeks now.  I can see a difference!</li>
            <li> Great item arrived early just what I wanted, works perfects and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> 好大一支  效果不知道怎么样  真的能瘦吗  用一段时间后才知道咯  -。-  不过味道不咋滴</li>
            <li> been using this product for a while.i truly love it.if you want to burn fat really fast.this truly works wonders.</li>
            <li> It really works! I use it once a day usually.. sometimes twice and after shower. You will have a burning sensation afterwards, but only after shower. It works pretty well and it has only been five days, I feel like my legs look skinnier.</li>
            <li> I find this product very helpful in accomplishing the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The product is great! It really gets hot, and it has a warm intense feeling that lets you know that it works.</li>
            <li> I have battled cellulite practically my entire life despite being normal to thin on my weight.  I have tried almost every lotion, cream and trick to rid myself of these unsightly lumps.  This cream has made a noticeable difference after just a weeks use.  It does cause a warming sensation for the first 30 minutes or so, but to me that just means it&#x27;s not your typical watered-down lotion.  It has something in it that truly works.  I highly recommend this lotion for that stubborn cellulite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a month and I already noticed the changes.&lt;br /&gt;The cellulite appearance on my belly is much less.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost every day twice a day along with weekly using a waist trimmer belt and sit-ups for a couple weeks now. I say if you do more than just the creme it does help. I would say it helps firms up things a little. I also really like the warming feeling you get when you put it on. It works best after showering and scrubbing the area you will put the creme on. I also really like the smell. Some say it&#x27;s not great, but I think that&#x27;s your preference. Overall, for the price and the amount of creme you get, it&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s helped me tighten my stomach after having two children.</li>
            <li> Although I FELT the tingling/burning sensation it gives off, I didn&#x27;t notice any visible reduction in cellulite. I have better results doing infra red body wraps! I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL unless you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower. You can&#x27;t even apply it an hour or so after you&#x27;ve taken a shower because it won&#x27;t work at all. It was a waste of money and I won&#x27;t be buying it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about buying because the reviews were so mixed but I decided to just try it. I have to say I think I might be addicted to this stuff! There&#x27;s no such thing as a miracle cream but this is probably as close as it gets. I use this twice a day morning &amp; night. The &amp;#34;warming sensation&amp;#34; is just as it says on the bottle lasts about 30-40 min &amp; it actually feels like your skin is contracting. It&#x27;s only been a week &amp; I can say my stomach feels tighter but I wanna give it the suggested 4 weeks before I give it all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how quickly I received this product. The cream was specially wrapped. I applied it immediately and felt the burn! I must admit the burn was a little more intense than I what I was expecting. The burn lasts for a little more than half an hour. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I am really impressed with this product and will continue to use it along with exercise. Thank you Eveline Cosmetics!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it heats up, which makes me feel like it is really working. I put it on my belly and thighs. The thighs I don&#x27;t put it on anymore as it gets way to warm. It&#x27;s great to use before a workout. I don&#x27;t know that I noticed much afterward but I only used it a few times. I gave the bottle to my daughter in law to try. I may buy another bottle to use so I can have more of an idea if it works.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I never write reviews, I can say that this makes you loose weight. I have not seen any results on my cellulite. I&#x27;m ordering it again because it really helped me loose weight. This time i&#x27;m going to Seran wrap with it. FYI- it gets really hott, but bearable.</li>
            <li> So I did a study on my thighs with this stuff. I applied for 1 month straight on my right thigh ( both thighs are identical ) and after a month my skin was obviously tighter than the other by far! I did not use it 2x daily like is suggested but I am pleased with the results. Keep in mind I have been dieting and exercising as well and I will be ordering another tube so my left thigh can catch up! I will continue using it until the fat pockets on my thighs are diminished by exercising, eating right and the Slim 3d!</li>
            <li> I gave this serum a try after reading all the reviews. I have a lot of cellulite in my legs and this serum has helped quiet a bit. I still have cellulite but not as much visible as it was pre slim extreme. Will keep using the product in the future</li>
            <li> Lol this lotion must work because on my skin, it feels like I am under the hottest African sun on the hottest African afternoon, it felt so dam real lol I recomend this lotion for people up north in the snow &amp; cold, it&#x27;s a trip to a African desert for sure, not bad, if your needing a vacation from a long cold loney blizzard. Lol</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for 2month  as directed on bottle no changes. It just makes your skin burn with no results!!! Don&#x27;t buy it doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t knot about the product yet, but I love how fast I got it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying another bottle. I&#x27;m 37 and work out 4-5 days a week but still have problem areas, this cream helped those areas. It gets  pretty warm after it&#x27;s rubbed in on your skin, but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I work out 4-5x week, 60 minutes of cardio/core.  I had twin boys 2 years ago.  Eat right, drink fluids, yet the cellulite I had on my stomach, upper thighs would not go away and was frustrating.  I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try (used Nivea and St. Ives cellulite gel/lotion with minimal results).  It has been 2 weeks and I am really shocked by how it dramatically reduced the cellulite.  The warmth of the lotion was felt prob 10 minutes after applying but doesn&#x27;t last longer than 30 minutes.  Afterwards, it leaves my skin soft and toned.  I am back to order more so I thought I would leave this review.</li>
            <li> Its complicated to prove it works. You use it along a diet and excercise, therefore you dont know if the cream works or not. It gives you a sensation that you are in the sun in the areas coveres for 10 minutes, its a burning sensation, but I dont think it works much because when I go to the gym the burning calories feeling is completely different. For the price its worth a try and the results depend more on me that the cream.</li>
            <li> I was excited when this packaged arrived and could wait to use it. Let me tell you, this lotion does not play. It does EXACTLY what it says on the bottle.  It burns the fat off of you!! ha ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For those of you who haven&#x27;t or are thinking about buying this product, try to imagine the burn you&#x27;d get from having red hot chili peppers on your skin, now multiply that by 2. This is what this product does. OMG. I thought I was doing to pee my pants the first time I applied this. I almost washed it off the first 10 minutes into the \\&quot;heat\\&quot;. I got used to it after a whiles so it&#x27;s really not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed there are some people who said it smells; i don&#x27;t know what you are talking about. To me it smelled like a scentless lotion. Nothing funky.&lt;br /&gt;My main concern is smoothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: before you put it on, make sure to shower your area of concern with warm water, soap or just run water through before applying. No moisturing shower gels or soaps. This will allow the product to penetrate the pores and do what it&#x27;s supposed to. Otherwise it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you take the heat? ^_^</li>
            <li> Great product. Heats up great on your body.</li>
            <li> Never noticed a dfference</li>
            <li> First time to try this product. I do feel hot on the spots where product applied, worth to try.</li>
            <li> works great! very good product!</li>
            <li> Product was warming to skin not sure about results yet i need to use for 30 days. I was looking for something to get the cellulite active under skin. It does that not sure about results yet.</li>
            <li> It is dangerous I am scared to put it on agian though it did tighten my skin on thighs first time</li>
            <li> No results buy I guess I need to purchase the Tummy.clincher or something to help activate the heat or help burn some inches off</li>
            <li> I rub this on before I put my belly burner Weight loss belt on and the combination of the two have been amazing. My stomach has almost all gone away and I am looking toned again. Love this product, just ordered my next tube of it.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see results after about 2 months but I do like the warming sensation.</li>
            <li> Products works as described really didnt burn me that much just really warm. I think I was using too much at first on too many different areas because I got a little nauseous when I put around my waist. So I would treat areas separately on different days. That work. I will order again</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff because my daughter has been using it &amp; has seen great results! I have been using it for about 2 weeks and can already see improvement! The warming sensation makes me feel like its actually doing something! I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I am still using it but I can say that the burning sensation means its working.  I have seen tremendous results.</li>
            <li> I just received the slim extreme 3D thermo active slimming serum and applied it for the first time yesterday and it was burning !!! my body. I had to stand in front of the air conditoner for 40 mins but overall i like it because you can feel the effect &#x3D;) will be posting another review in 4 weeks, hopefully it works and i can see some reduction of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I used it only once so far. So I cannot judge for the whole result. The only thing I can say is that your body is heating up, not burning</li>
            <li> About 3 weeks ago, I sat and read alot of the reviews on this Product here on Amazon and listen to other people responses also was not sure to believe it. I bought the item and tried it for myself, I am on my 3rd week and I must say the results I have is AMAZING and I done NO exercising. I had alot of Cellulite and this serum tightens up your skin and Really helps the Cellulite to disappear, you would think I had Lippo suction. I still have more cellulite to go, but not as much, I am a FIRM Believer and Recommend this serum to anyone want to get rid of the Cellulite. I usually use it after taking a showing and then use the serum and it does cause the areas to get hot, but it is working, and it only is lasting about 20-30 minutes, But with these Result I don&#x27;t mind the burning it is not bad burning and I had no itching at all.. I have already placed my order for a second one. I rate this as a 5++++++ all the way. I Love this Serum and Love the Results it gives.... I will update again once my next order arrives and I finish that one...</li>
            <li> This product is like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before. You apply it and minutes later you feel warmness and tingling on your skin. It feels like you apply a chili pepper paste on your skin, if I can describe it that way. It appears to be effective, but I am not sure if the result will last after usage is discontinued. Overall, a good product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It burns.  When I first used it in and experienced a burning sensation, I thought it was because I had just used Tend Skin.  I have tried using this product numerous times with no other products on my skin and it still burns.  It is a total and utter waste of money and it&#x27;s extremely laughable that the product label refers to a &amp;#34;Pleasant warm sensation&amp;#34;.  There is nothing pleasant about feeling as though your skin is on fire......</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change. I should have taken before pictures. Maybe using it 2 times a day will produce faster results? It does tingle at first and I can feel the burn for up to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to believe that it actually worked. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, because I had a child, so I needed something to help me with my workouts as well as eating healthy. I can honestly say, this kind of worked. It may take some time, but it&#x27;s worth the money. There&#x27;s a slight bit of a strange warm sensation (especially after a shower) and it smells odd, but you&#x27;ll just have to get over that. Overall, it&#x27;s not that bad of a product.</li>
            <li> For three weeks It doesn&#x27;t work at all, waste of $ .</li>
            <li> A little background, I yo-yo about 40 pounds every 6 months. I can lose it in 6 months and gain it back 6 months later. Because of that, I am plagued with stretch marks and cellulite. I weigh in the \\&quot;high normal\\&quot; on the BMI scale and I have about 30 pounds to go before I&#x27;m at my \\&quot;low\\&quot; weight. Then directly after I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll all stack back on. Fat&#x3D;happy Skinny&#x3D;depressed. That&#x27;s just how I work.. oddly enough..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin layer&#x3D; no burning, no tightening, no nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE BRAVE, slather this on THICK. It feels like a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; tanning lotion, but I actually really enjoy it. As crazy as it sounds, after two uses, I woke up and the back of my legs felt TIGHT. The cellulite, after four uses, is already starting to disappear. If you purchase this thinking it&#x27;s going to sculpt your legs like you&#x27;ve been playing soccer and riding horses all your life, then you&#x27;re crazy. It will not do that, exercise will. But it DOES smooth out cellulite, and it does seem to tighten my legs up. Even my boyfriend said my cellulite looked like it was disappearing, and after ONLY FOUR USES. This is intense, guys. I&#x27;m excited, it&#x27;s like a miracle cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and the results are amazing!!! Mind you this product is NOT for weight loss.  So if thats what youre looking for look elsewhere, however if you want to see the cellulite soften and pretty much disapear then this is definitely going to help.  Yes there is a warming sensation, but it isnt bad.  I work out 5 times a week with running and hardcore weights.  Doing bar squats and lunges like crazy but couldnt shake the appearance of the cellulite.  This lotion has transformed the back of my legs. Im still in awe! Did not expect such quick results.</li>
            <li> This lotion gave me the most amazing results I&#x27;ve ever seen a lotion produce.  HOWEVER this lotion made me unbearably uncomfortable for about an hour after applying it.    The \\&quot;delicate warming\\&quot; that the lotion talks about is more like burning.  It is so unbelievably painful (and I have a decent pain tolerance) and once it&#x27;s on there&#x27;s no way to get it off.  It also made me extremely itchy everywhere I applied it and the itching only made it feel more painful.    It gave me amazing results though.  My arms are slimmer, my waist is tighter and my legs and bottom have a nice, smooth silhouette.  The only reason this product got 4 stars is because it worked, plain and simple.  However I took off one star because of how uncomfortable it made me.  The product did what it said it would do, however I feel like they should warn you to not plan anything for an hour after applying because you will be constantly itching and feel very uncomfortable.  The feeling is so distracting and it made my eyes water because it was a CONSTANT burning, not a \\&quot;delicate warming\\&quot; like the bottle says.</li>
            <li> HANDY TO HAVE AVAILABLE, WORK GREAT</li>
            <li> This is my second time using this item and I will be buying again and again! I use this in the morning and in the evening before my fitness class and all my gym buddies have noticed my tummy is smaller and my cellulite on my thighs has diminished greatly!! The only thing I&#x27;ve been using is this cream,  I&#x27;ve used the expensive creams $100+ the costly serums with little to no results but this has given me actual results that i can see and others can see! It will firm the skin and reduce cellulite just be consistent and use daily, to shrink your arms, stomach thighs and (back fat in my cse) rub on prior  to exercising to see maximum results, you&#x27;ll see your cottage cheese thighs become more firm with less cellulite in less then a month, just be consistent!!!</li>
            <li> This product just arrived yesterday, but oh my goodness I can already feel it working! My legs are on fire, in a way that isn&#x27;t painful, but is probably helpful. Smells nice, decent price, hoping it works well!</li>
            <li> This stuff has actually worked for me, comparing all the anti-stretch mark I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I had my baby one year ago,and I&#x27;ve been using this, and now my stretch marks are 85% gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be patient before you see results!</li>
            <li> I used one of this product and used it everyday after shower. YES, there is hot sensation, but I did not see any result.. I was really expecting result after buying it.. I am not sure whether I should try another product or not.</li>
            <li> Received the product fast just a couple days ago &amp; so far I love it!   I&#x27;ve tried so many creams before for my very stuborn cellulite but this has a warming sensation that I just love; just be carful where you put it- because it does heat up!   I am currently training for my first marathon &amp; I put this cream on before my runs &amp; it burns so good for about 45 minutes to an hour later &amp; then after a hot shower I also put it on &amp; again the intense wonderful burn!  I hope it will actually reduce my lumps...I am 5&#x27;3 and 113 lbs- not fat but I have very huge unsightly valleys &amp; pits at my but &amp; thighs since 13 years old&amp; they are getting worse as I age-  ughh..haven&#x27;t worn a swim suit for about 20 years as I am so self-conscience.  Running 30+ miles &amp; leg strength 3X&#x27;s a week not working so I really hope this does the trick- will keep an update!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on December 27, 2014 and it arrived January 2, 2015. It arrived super quickly, I started using it the day I got it  and use it twice a day everyday. I measured my tummy area and it was at 39.7&amp;#34;, on January 2nd and today is January 18, 2015 and is down to 38&amp;#34;.. My neck and chin, even my face has slimmed down ALOT, but my skin is much smoother and tighter my thighs are still in need of more cellulite removal, but they are coming along, I feel my body getting tighter and slimmer, we will see in time, I ordered 3 more for my family members. The heat sensation lets you know is working, especially when it really heats up. I use it wit plastic wrap and massage it vigorously into my areas that need work, I do very little excersise,  mostly tilt, tuck, tighten it seems to work, and I have tried it alllllllll before. I&#x27;m 38 going on 39 my target is to reach at least 120-125.. I am at 140 now and have lost 7 pds since I started. It works, if you work with the cream....eveline products are official  Wish everyone the best....</li>
            <li> This is a woundeful product and I have already order and recieved more.  It appears to be working already and the tingling sensation lets you know it&#x27;s working...I will be using these products for the recommended time.  Everyone should try it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a month and a half (about six or seven weeks), and let me tell you - IT WORKS!!  Is my cellulite completely gone?  No, but I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s gonna take longer than a few weeks no matter what I use or do.  Granted, before using I didn&#x27;t have cellulite to the extent of the deep, dimpled variety - it is more in the \\&quot;ripply\\&quot; phase (which I understand is what happens before the dimples develop - trying to prevent that from happening).  Let me tell you, even though it has not completely disappeared as of yet, this cream has made it drastically improve.  For example, before using it I did not feel confident enough to wear any shorts or skirts above mid thigh, about four weeks into using it, I felt confident enough to start wearing my short shorts and skirts again (it made my legs look that much better).  I have to be honest though, in the past four weeks I have also kicked my dieting into high gear, and started exercising a few times a week as well, so I&#x27;m sure that is helping things along.  However, I have done this before without using this cream and I can tell that using this product IS a good part of the reduction in cellulite I am seeing. Also, I have been applying it before exercising, as some others have suggested, so that might be part of why it is so effective so far, as I suspect it is enhancing the effects of my workout.  Oh, and I have only been using this once a day (not two), and I&#x27;m getting results this good!    Now, about the heat factor - make no mistake, it burns. A LOT - to the point where it is definitely uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that it seems to burn more in the areas where I have more fat, but it seems like that&#x27;s exactly what you would want it to do.  Again though, the trade off is that it works.  The burning seems to be uncomfortable anywhere from twenty to forty minutes after I put it on, and then gradually lessens.  It probably does take at least a full hour to an hour and a half before it completely goes away.  Basically, just plan on not doing much for at least a good hour after putting it on, just to be safe, until you find out how long it lasts for you.  My advice - turn the A/C up high after putting this on!!     Will this product work this well for everyone?  I don&#x27;t know, but for less than twenty bucks a bottle, why not try it and see??  One more thing - I have only been using it once a day (it suggests twice a day), and each bottle lasts me two to three weeks.  Not bad!  I&#x27;m guessing this would work even better / faster if I used it twice a day, but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to apply it in the morning before going outside in the heat of the summer - maybe when it gets a little colder out, maybe I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
            <li> all i have to say is that if you use it correctly and work out...it works.&lt;br /&gt;of course if you use this and stuff your face and over eat...ull see NO results.&lt;br /&gt;but if u have a balanced diet, eat 6 small meals a day..this product does the rest for you.&lt;br /&gt;i put this on and then my girdle on, i have defined my curves more. love this!</li>
            <li> Ive started using this about a week now and i can see some results already. I am monitoring to see more and i will surely order more of this</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully! Use with fat band, it seems to make the product work better.</li>
            <li> The best time it works is after your shower</li>
            <li> I just received this and have seen results in a couple days. The warming feels nice too. I wish i could buy a case of this! The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! I have bought sooo many products and none of them do anything or not that I can tell.  I have cellulite pretty bad for a very fit person.  I started getting it in high school- at 103 pounds and now at 32 it is pretty bad at 130 pounds and a mom! I put on a dress yesterday for a graduation and my legs looked much better.  I said I would never put another dress on but this stuff really helped. My husband really noticed too. It really does work! Only been using it for a few week and can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
            <li> I started using this product immediately after receiving it and it burns like it works, but it should not be replaced with excercise. I did not notice a huge difference, but it&#x27;s worth using with excercise.</li>
            <li> Before I even bought this product I had lost about thirty pounds and had a lot of loose skin with my cellulite.  Just a couple of days using this and my skin is tighter and firmer. I don&#x27;t know if it is going to help me lose weight, but it is an excellent lotion for skin and the warming aspect feels great on cramped muscles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 3-4 weeks ago knowing that the likelihood of success was probably small but because of the low price took the chance. I have been using it faithfully, along with exercise 3-4 times a week and a healthy vegetarian diet which includes frequent juicing and lots of green tea. I should start by saying that I am not super overweight, have about 20lbs to lose. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference after diligent use of the cream. Though yes, under certain circumstances I can feel the burn. But no, I cannot see any improvement in my cellulite. The circumstances under which I can feel the burn are application immediately after stepping out of the hot shower when my pores are open. The first few days I applied without steaming prior and felt absolutely nothing. Sorry, wish I had a different review to offer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first product I am using for the cellulite problem, so I don&#x27;t have others to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it on my legs and I&#x27;m seeing small differences but there is no miracle. You need to do exercises, eat better and drink a lot of water.&lt;br /&gt;Another advice is to do massages in the problem area (search for it on youtube).&lt;br /&gt;Those things combined really help! Just don&#x27;t give up :)</li>
            <li> I like the tingling warm sensation, but I did not work in my behave did not work. never met your expectations.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and would reccomend it to others. As cellulite creams go, we all know there is no cure-all for the problem. But, after using the cream, I felt my thighs a bit more attractive. Exercize is still the best elimination for cellulite, and being that this cream is affordable, I use it. Now send me free products!!!!!!!lol!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on July 12, 2011 and I&#x27;m still waiting to see some results! This product does give you a warming feeling after it&#x27;s applied, but this isn&#x27;t consistent; sometimes there is a warming feeling and sometimes there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to order this product. When you flip the top open there is stopper that is really kind of hard to get out...but I rubbed the cream on my stomach and considering its winter time, very nice that it heats up. You can feel the heat, I figure if I use it twice a day, this product will work miracles for me just like these others I&#x27;ve read about.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased this product.  I thought I was going to just waste my money, but I was willing to at least try it because I was embarrassed to wear shorts anymore.  After only about a week of using it twice a day, I saw a difference.  I thought it was just my imagination.  But now it has been a month, and there is a definite firming up and the cellulite pockets are more than 50% gone.  In fact, I am not timid to wear my shorts - in just a month!  I did not increase my exercise or change my diet.  I was already active.  If you order, be ready for some heat.  When you apply it, it feels like you just put on \\&quot;BenGay\\&quot; times 4, really hot, then it subsides in about 30 minutes.  I am going to reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th day of using this, I love the warm feeling it gives me. I like to put it on my stomach and put my McDavid Tummy trimmer on it and lay down, the soothing feeling of the warmth is equivalent to taking a nice hot bath, very relaxing. I&#x27;ve noticed my tummy looks a little flatter and it has def firmed it up a bit. I will keep using this as I&#x27;m pretty impressed this far.</li>
            <li> I been using it for a month, and i reorder it again, but i also ordered two more items from the same Slim extreme series( shower gel and serum with cold effect). I wouldnt order it if i didnt think it works. Not so fast but little by little. For those who says that they dont feel burning effect i would like to suggest to take hot shower which will open up ur pores and let serum absorb much better. Just want to worn u it really burns, at first i had to use fan to blow cold air on my legs just to be able to bare it. I am using shower gel then i put Thermo serum, and at night i use cold slimming serum. I aslo started exercising and it shows me results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a surgery alternative and i have to say this really works. I have seen a big difference. I exercize about four times a week and eat healthy but I have had this extra weight on my hips since I had my three kids but this cream has diminished the bumps. I am really happy with it!I has slimmed the area I hate. The first couple times you use it it is pretty hot but after about 20 min it goes away.</li>
            <li> I retracted my earlier review because it wasn&#x27;t meant to be a review it was meant to be a question and I posted it in the wrong place.  I now have been using this product for a few weeks and I have to say I really do like it and have definitely noticed a difference.. I was very  skeptical in the beginning and didn&#x27;t think it would do anything because it didn&#x27;t burn like other&#x27;s say it did and I didn&#x27;t feel any heat but I did feel it when I put a little under my chin.  Either way it works and I will be re-ordering this product.  I apologize if I gave the wrong impression about it the first time I posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;artzyladi</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream it made me feel the heat, best felt after taking a shower and immeditely after 2-3 uses i started to see results and my friends noticed that i lost some inches from my thighs and behind.</li>
            <li> This is great. I am using it mostly on my abs and buns. The key to it (in my experience) is doing it right after the shower. That&#x27;s when it gets really warm for me. I have used it other times of day, and not really felt much. Already noticing a difference in the texture of my skin. Love that this is a good size. I will be definitely getting this again when it runs out!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend  works well</li>
            <li> this cream did not work for me and no change have been seen yet.when i use it i feel the tangling and heat but no change on cellulites!</li>
            <li> The product helps slim your waste and the apperance of celulite.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd one, and will continue to buy the product.  It does give a burning sensation, but tolerable for about 2-3 mins</li>
            <li> Great product, and it was a really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My skin has become much more firm and taut.  Worth buying again and again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure that this product would actually work, but I was pleasantly surprised!  You can easily tell it&#x27;s working because you can feel it heat up and you can see the results afterwards.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Warming Warming Warming every where and my skin very very smooth like a silk....&lt;br /&gt;concerning fat burning and slimming use it then start workout for 30 min..... then believe me you will open your mouth like this :0  perfect thumb up</li>
            <li> This items is excellent.  The smooth feel of rubbing it on and feeling the warm heat is wonderful! My skin feels fantastic after just one week. Unfortunantly, when I returned to purchase more the product is unavailable?  What do you have equilivant to this item with the thermo active ingredient.  Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Tightens and firms up great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t work by itself, you have to exercise too.</li>
            <li> awesome product! awaiting the results</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAAAZING!!!!!! THIS IS SUPER HOT AND CAN TELL A BIG DIFFERENCE! I NEVER WRITE REVEIWS BUT WITH THIS PRODUCT IT WAS A MUST! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I&#x27;M BUYING 2 MORE!</li>
            <li> My HUSBAND is seeing a change after one week! Mind you I am 280 and 6&#x27;. I have plenty of cellulite. It has definantly helped smooth and reduce. I am going to try their other products as well. Very pleased and it is not expensive :)The first time I used it, I was burning like I had a really bad sunburn. Then every use after that it got a bit better. I may have applied too much the first time. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I  have ordered an Ann Cherry Waist Trainer and saw this cream to be used with same. I was hesitant at first but after the reviews I decided to try the product. I must say its a decision well made. At first when applied to the area, it warms up an adds a tingly feeling. I applied it first then my waist trainer after. I have been using this product for a month and a half and am already seeing amazing results. I have moved on to the second fasteners on my trainer and my waist appears to be slim and smooth. I have lost approximately 4inches from the first purchase of my cream and trainer which was on 18th of January. I oredered a second cream last month. Very effective once combined with a diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> Some girls said that they had a warm feeling every time they use this cream. So far (1 week since I got it) I have been using this and I don&#x27;t get any warm feeling in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that you start noticing the changes after 4 weeks, so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very small, I workout 3 to 5 times a week, drink lots of water, eat healthy  and I have this awful orange skin. I&#x27;m trying different products that I found here to see which one gives the best results...I&#x27;ll let you girls know!</li>
            <li> I bought three should of checked the ingredients...    Methylparaben / Butylparaben / Ethylparaben / Propylparaben,     I threw it out!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I use it morning and night or before a workout and it works wonders.  The only downfall is that it burns sometimes, but that way you know it is working.</li>
            <li> Ive had this lotion for a few days now. Ive only tried it three times, the first two times i put it on before i worked out, i felt NOTHING. Tonight, once i got out of the shower, i applied the lotion.. I think i found the trick! My thighs and butt literally feel like im sitting on top of a heater! Im thinking the warm shower might open your pores to let the lotion penetrate better. Im going to use this twice a day, right when  iget out of the shower.. ill do an update in two weeks, and two weeks after that!</li>
            <li> It works great - my skin tightened after only 3 day use (twice a day) Will buy again. Thank you</li>
            <li> I just got this and not sure if it will help with my cellulite but I did want to comment about thermal portion of this product. I am not sure if anyone has experienced this but the cream will only heat up if I apply it right after I shower.  If I put on the cream in the middle of the day it does not heat up at all. It gets pretty warm but it is not painful. It lasts about 20 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I got 10 days ago, i&#x27;m loved it.  My skin is looking much better and I impacient to look aditional results on next two weeks it is amazing product. Thank You</li>
            <li> It really work....I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 consecutive days and I&#x27;ve already feel the wonder of this product!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO AND HAVE BEEN USING IT AS DIRECTED. I USE IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH MC DAVID WAIST TRIMMER. THIS THERMO ACTIVE CREAM IS TRULY THERMO ACTIVE. IT GETS PRETTY HOT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD A LAYER OF CLOTHING OVER THE AREA WHERE THE CREAM IS APPLIED. I RUB SOME ON MY KNEES, THE SIDES OF MY THIGHS, MY BUTT, MY ARMS AND MY FULL STOMACH AREA. IT HELPS ME SWEAT UNDER THE WAIST TRIMMER AND IVE NOTICE MINIMAL RESULTS. ITS OBIVIOUS THAT YOU WOULD DEFINITLY NEED TO CONTINUE USE OF THE PRODUCT TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM RESULTS. EITHER WAY THE WAIST TRIMMER ALONG WITH THE CREAM IS A GOOD PAIR. ONCE I APPLY THE CREAM I WRAP MY STOMACH AREA WITH THE WAIST TRIMMER AND THE HEAT BEGINS. I GO TO THE GYM AND WORKOUT BY THE TIME I UNWRAPPING IM SEATING LIKE A HOT ANIMAL LOL. ITS A GOOD CREAM BUT CONTINUE USE FOR MAXIMUM RESULTS</li>
            <li> I have moderate cellulite on the back of my thighs and butt. No creams or vitamins have helped and even with excessive exercising, it&#x27;s still there! I decided to try this product after reading some of the reviews here. It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest scent, kind of smells like a cleaning product. But, it&#x27;s not that bad. I applied the lotion on the back of my thighs and butt and within 10 minutes, it starts to burn. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant burn, I actually kind of enjoyed it. The burn is similar to that of Icy Hot. The lotion absorbed fast into the skin, so I was able to put clothes on soon after. The burn gradually increases but then disappears within a half hour. I  inspected the area where I applied the lotion afterwards and noticed a SLIGHT decrease in cellulite, but nothing to get too excited about. However, I have now been using this for a week and I can definitely say that there is a very noticeable decrease in cellulite. Some people might not like the burning sensation, but I say suck it up for 30 minutes, because this product really works.</li>
            <li> One of the things you don&#x27;t really want to face as a woman in your 30&#x27;s is that there is no and probably won&#x27;t ever be an easy cure for cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may not even be a hard cure; some of my slenderest friends have cellulite as well so maybe that&#x27;s just how the pitted cookie crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to face that fact causes us to wave our magic wands (credit cards) and buy items that claim to get rid of cellulite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As easy as it would be to blame a product rather than take responsibility for my own persistent cellulite and magical thinking, I&#x27;m going to have to say \\&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s not as easy as buying a lotion to make those nasty thighs all smooth\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine lotion. Smells nice like lemons, burns like pepper on your skin which, while an odd sensation, as it&#x27;s a new one, almost welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But did it do jack all for my cellulite?&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I might buy this again as a lotion, those of you who get upset when your magical thinking cellulite bubble bursts may wish to avoid purchasing this as, well, you&#x27;ll sit there, pitted like a golf ball, tingling hot and lemony smelling and it might make you all crabby because you still (of course) have cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crabby is even less attractive than cellulite so know yourself before purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/13/12: I have noticed that there have been a huge bump in the number of positive reviews for this item since I reviewed it and many from people with few reviews, or reviews that seem weighted. I also notice people have recently been actively been down voting this review as \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying I smell a lemony rat here, but I&#x27;d love for the people who are claiming that this is more than a lotion, that it&#x27;s actually a cellulite reducing magic wand to show photos of the before and after or something, or perhaps tell me in the comments why my honest review of a nice lotion that doesn&#x27;t do jack for cellulite is \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working to build my pecs, recently.  I&#x27;ve had excess breast fat since going through puberty, and nothing I&#x27;ve done has worked (I&#x27;m male).  So, thought I would give this a try.  The tube is very large, so it is definitely worth the money.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, as I just got it today.  The stuff absolutely burns like the dickens.  A little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five stars since it feels like it is working, but the packaging is just a bit misleading.  It says that it has a pleasant warming sensation.  My chest was on fire after a few minutes!  If nothing else, it definitely increased the blood flow to the area it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post a follow-up after I have used it for a while in case there are any other men out there that suffer from the same issue as me.</li>
            <li> It does work well with a M.C. David waist trimmer. I go for my 1hr walk and I see a difference.</li>
            <li> This cream is just a heat cream. I now use it for tired muscles. It does nothing for fat reduction. But good for a heat cream.</li>
            <li> I just got this product recently and i love it. Once on takes only a few minutes to start working, at first was a bit to much but you get used to it. I feel so much better when working out feel my body being worked. The product also smells refreshing and feels smooth and soft. Also got to enjoy a free sample of the slimming and firming spa treatment. loved it as well. plan on ordering more products. and keeping this on my list to have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with great expectations from reading the other reviews. I do not know what they are talking about, this product is useless as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I felt the warmth the fisrt time I used it and thought maybe it would help. The next few times I have used it I have felt nothing, I might as well be smoothing on baby lotion. Don&#x27;t waste your money because the company will not refund your money if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just got this item in the mail on the third day after ordering and right away tried it out. Took only a few minutes for the lotion to activate and I must say that I love the heat it puts off! Did a half hour work out and it&#x27;s still going! Love it! Will write another review as the results develope. I&#x27;m sold on the product and going to continue use ^_^</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week and I can see a noticeable difference in the appearance of my thighs, hips, stomach, and buttocks. While I am curvy, and look great in jeans, due to age and having giving birth, I have developed stretch marks and orange peel texture on my thighs. No amount of physical labor or work outs would tone and smooth them out. I was at the point of considering surgery because I was so frustrated with the whole situation. Like many woman I have been dreading summer and swim suit season. I would also be resentful of women at the water parks and pools who held more weight then me, yet had beautiful smooth firm attractive thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I decided to look at firming creams despite my personal belief there is no magic elixir in a tube. After looking at a large amount of different products I went with this one because of price, reviews and my enjoyment of warming products. I use it 2 times a day once in the morning before I work out, and then again before bed (after I shower). The only change to my daily activities is the adding of the lotion. After 3 days, I saw some minor changes in the tone and texture of the skin, at 8 days, the puffy area have begun to smooth out, and the rippled/ pitted stretch marked area has tightened up. I am only giving this product 4 stars because I am almost out and already reordered. But then again I am using it on 1/3rd of my body from belly button to knees almost so I am more of an extreme case. Also the lotion is very thick and has to be really massaged in to get the best effects, you cannot just do a quick slather and go, you have to WORK the product into the skin to get the warming effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes about the product:&lt;br /&gt;when worked in it is extremely hot for 10 to 40 minutes&lt;br /&gt;very thick lotion&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove cellulite or burn it, but dehydrates and shrinks cells&lt;br /&gt;Has supposed Carthaginians in it, but then again baby oil is also a Carthaginian.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This lotion tightened my skin and gave my mild cellulite a more blended, smoothed out look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It left my skin silky smooth and very dewy and young looking. Never sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bottle is huge and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell is a bit strong and for me, not very pleasant. I used it on my bum and thighs and could smell it as I walked around. I&#x27;d get a good whiff of it every time I loaded the laundry into the washer too as it left it&#x27;s scent in my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is a warming effect from this lotion that was tolerable if I simply applied it on dry skin that had not been washed for a few hours. But if I applied it after a bath or shower it was too much for my comfort. Hot, tingly, almost a stinging/burning feeling. Especially on freshly shaven skin or after doing a cellulite massage or body brushing. Unfortunately, I feel like this lotion worked best and absorbed deepest when it was applied this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Contains unnatural ingredients. If an all natural, chemical free product is important to you then this one is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the money this is an effective product for my mild cellulite and I saw results the first week. If not for the smell and \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; I would have continued to purchase this one. But since that is not the case, I&#x27;ll be continuing my search for a better product for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this....arrived on time it did exactly as it says... im seeing quick results. In looking forward to new product&#x27;s. And this summer : )</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED. IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK I TRIED FOR 2 MONTHS AND DID JUST AS THE DIRECTIONS SAID AND HAD NO RESULTS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. IT IS A RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I didn&#x27;t really think it would work but I figured I had tried everything else so I gave it a shot.  It seems to do as claimed and I am happy with the result I am seeing. I have been using it for about 5 weeks.  I liked it enough I have purchased a second bottle and several other lotions form the line.  My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with this item. After several weeks of applying as directed, I was a difference in my skin; fewer cellulite and the skin looked firmer. I will be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li> great product... you fell the diference...&lt;br /&gt;i love it...&lt;br /&gt;i use it every other day and i really sweat ...</li>
            <li> not a miracle cream but does get really hot and makes you sweat with a good workout it does help a little.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in two days. Great product</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and noticed that it really works great. I did notice that it works 100 times better if I work out right after I put it on. It really makes this heat up. It is not unbearable but it does get warm.</li>
            <li> ok it seems to work a little. the thermal isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be. It may work great after a couple months, but not wanting to use that long.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like the thought of doing SOMETHING to potentially impact the look of cellulite but I don&#x27;t think I truly believed a topical could make a difference.  After using for maybe 12 weeks I looked in the mirror and was pretty shocked at the level of improvement.  I would say 80% improvement on my upper legs.  I&#x27;m still on my first tube, too.  I will say I dislike the heating effect but it&#x27;s worth it for the results.  Give it a try and be patient!</li>
            <li> This product does produce sweat and makes you feel as though it&#x27;s working but you really have to work out hard to see any difference. I also wanted to say the shipping fees for this were outrageous and it took well over 8 days to receive. Not worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone, I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews, but just wanted to share this one, cuz I&#x27;m kind of surprised with results from this particular product. I&#x27;ve always been slim since I used to be a professional dancer, but I one problem always bothered me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had very visible cellulite in the back of my thy and of course buttocks. I always worked out a lot, on daily basis, so my exercising routine stayed the same while using this slimming gel as well, so I definitely can tell the difference. I used it twice a day, before going for a run in the morning and before going to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a little extreme thermo effect, but pleasant (to me at least), it makes you feel like your body is shrinking and cellulite is melting :) Well, I at least like to think that way,since imagination is a pretty powerful tool as well! At first, I felt extremely dehydrated, so for better effect you do have to drink a lot of water, the more the better, since your body needs to get rid of all the bad stuff this gel has burnt. After I got used to the routine of using it properly and combining my work out with proper eating, the result showed it self in less then 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is to say that i&#x27;m the kind of person who has always been in great shape, eating healthy food and staying active.&lt;br /&gt;But cellulite has always been huge problem and a reason for not being able to wear shorts or even bathing suits (yes! it was that bad!).&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I would recommend it to pretty much everyone, just remember that magic happens only if you are willing to participate in a process of making it to happen. Try to do a little work out and eat healthier along with using it and you&#x27;ll see your body will change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Slimming guys :)</li>
            <li> Have not seen alot of results yet, but will give it at least a month or two.  It does feel warm as advertised</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time today but I didn&#x27;t feel any warming sensation. Maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough on. I guess I will keep trying and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> This item were received in record time. I like the price, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results but if it works I will purchase from this seller again.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was all stoked about recieving this item according to reviews I couldnt help but get excited---after i recieved it i followed directions..i NEVER experienced the warming or hot sensation...ever...not that it matters i supose? the only thing i was a little bummed with was the smell and the amount of rubbing in, it was thicker than i expected more creamy compared to the nivea one---dont get me wrong im still going to continue to use it...maybe it will work wonders eventhough i have yet to experience anything anyone else has experienced?</li>
            <li> Please be aware that this will get you in trouble at airports. My husband and I were both stopped because the meter went crazy as we walked through the arms above head meter. It showed hot spots where we had put the cream and my husband had it on his hands. With increased security we were patted down and they took the cream from us so I had to order a new one. Just a warning not to use it on day of TRAVEL in airports. I guess it really does increase your body heat! By the way my husband was using it for a bad neck not to lose inches. The pain in the neck was on us AND HOW WE ALMOST MISSED OUR PLANE. I LIKE THE PRODUCT.[[ASIN:B002BS43HU Slim Extreme 3d Thermo Active Slimming Serum - Anti-Cellulite Fat Burner 250ml]]</li>
            <li> So first off let me say that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and around 115 pounds.  I&#x27;m 23 and I have had cellulite for as long as I can remember.  I honestly can&#x27;t recall the last time I wore shorts or a dress.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself out-of-shape, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m in shape.  I have a toddler, so my exercise usually entails playing with her or going for long walks; nothing too extensive or rigorous.  I do, however, want to start working out and I figured that this would be a good product to pair with my workout regimen and a healthier diet.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product today and I tested a small area on my thigh before I showered, just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too hot.  I didn&#x27;t feel anything (which was a bit disappointing) so I showered and then began applying the lotion after I thoroughly dried myself off.  I took my time applying it in circular motions (as directed) on my thighs and lower stomach.  After I really worked it in I started to feel a warming sensation, but nothing major.  This was about 15 minutes ago. Now, I feel like I&#x27;m sitting on a hot leather seat on a 110 degree day.  It is freakin&#x27; hot! It&#x27;s mostly warm right below my butt, where my cellulite is at its worst.  My only major concern is in regard to the ingredients and whether or not it is healthy to apply twice daily.  I will probably only use it a few times a week, due to the chemicals and the warming sensation which isn&#x27;t very pleasant, especially since it&#x27;s the summer.  Obviously, I can&#x27;t speak of the long-term results but I will come back with an update in about a week.  Hopefully I won&#x27;t go on fire before then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Upon using this for a month and exercising regularly, I&#x27;m saddened to say that this product did not work for me.  I do see an improvement, but I think that can mostly be attributed to eating healthy and working out, because I have since stopped using it and I continue to see results.  I would say that the potential health risks due to the ingredients are just notworth the lackluster results</li>
            <li> Works even better with a slim belt great product for burning those hard to lose inches</li>
            <li> This stuff work better than what I expected. Five minutes after I put it on I start to feel the warming sensation and how well it works. When used consistently I can see my thighs get a little smaller (with or without my workouts). Good stuff!!!  This is my 3rd time I have bought this bottle.</li>
            <li> At first I was a lil worried about the product but I seem to to see results but in anything you do you have to be consistent</li>
            <li> This product totally works.  admit that the heat sensation is annoying-and sometimes it&#x27;s intense and sometimes it&#x27;s barely noticebly but totally worth it. I was a very petite girl who had 3 very large babies and my stomach looked awful afterwards. I have been using this product for 5 days now and have seen such good results I just bought a 2 piece bikini! Totally worth every dime will stock up-best product ever!</li>
            <li> works good. warming sensation. works better if you use a belt and wrap abdominal with neoprene belt with this. like it</li>
            <li> When I first applied this product, I applied it conservatively.  I didn&#x27;t get any warm feeling.  I thought I got lied to again.(I bought a similar product which did the same thing, nothing)  I thought I just using it as lotion then.  I applied a lot more to my tummy area. That did it.  It was warm.  I feel like I have a heat pad on my tummy for 20-30 minutes.  I have been using the product religiously, morning and night.  I think it is working for me.  My tummy seems tighter.  I shared one of the two bottles I bought initially with my sister.  She applies it before working out and it makes her sweat more.  My 18 year old niece used it on her trouble areas before she exercise, she noticed that they got thinner.  I would recommend this product, but need exercise too.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of slimming gel or lotion in my entire life. But that changed when one of my old friends was complaining about feeling burning sensation around her body from using slimming gel! Out of curiosity and the motivation to slim parts of my body, I bought one.    What can I say? Upon receiving the order, a small sample packet of Eveline Slimming gel- Spa Edition was also included :).   The slimming gel- thermo one that I bought and have been using for the past month about 2 times per day actually works. I see the changes now and it really does burn all the fat. One word of advice I want to give to others is when you apply this product on your body or face, to pay attention to where you apply it and put it EXACTLY where you want fat to burn from. You don&#x27;t want an uneven body or face!</li>
            <li> This company sends out their products in a timely fashion. I have used this product for a week and i think it is great, you can feel it working it gets hot (not to hot) on the area that you put it on it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, after getting sick of my cellulite and extra fat.  I rubbed this stuff on, twice per day everyday for the recommended 2 weeks (and until the whole bottle was used up) and I saw no results whatsoever. Yes, you could feel the relaxing warming sensation, but other than that, it didn&#x27;t actually get rid of even a little cellulite.  I did exercise a little on the side, and I continued on with my regular diet (which really isnt even that bad) but no results were shown. I think it was all in their heads for the people who said it did work. Worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li> When I put this on the first time, I expected intense burning as described in other reviews.  My skin doesn&#x27;t even get warm.  Either I got a defective tube, or the other claims are wildly distorted.  I have used it on my upper arm for about a month, and I am seeing a slight bit of firming, but I&#x27;m not sure  if it&#x27;s due to this product, or Mother Nature.  I have lost a 30 pounds and the skin is \\&quot;too big\\&quot; now.  A plus is that it seems to be a good moisturizer and my skin is very soft after I use  it.  I plan to keep using it until the tube is gone, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I broke out in an allergic rash. My brother tried as well and broke out too! :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and half, once a day and I have NOT notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this cream daily.  I do believe that this product helps with decreasing cellulite.  There has never been any adverse skin reaction and my skin is definitely smoother.  The warming sensation is pleasant.</li>
            <li> It does create a warmness. I like to put it on and then workout with a waist exercise wrap.  You get a good sweat in that area.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hot. You definitely feel it working. You might have a hard time keeping it on the first time. But once you get used to it. It does work for me.</li>
            <li> Just started, hope it works.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cream, but when I put it on, it feels just a a very thick, hard to absorb white cream that gives nothing back. It feels nice in terms of hydration for the dry skin, but in terms of heat and thermo effect - nothing! And it is also such a big tube. I wish they sold smaller sizes to try it out first. I almost want to return it, but I think I&#x27;ll just use it as body lotion in the morning and at night. However, I do think it has some irritant that is supposed to heat up the skin, since I accidentally touched my face with the hand I was applying the cream with and felt instant irritation around the eye area, so there is something in it, just not strong enough to give out Thermo effect. It might be that some of the people who used it have more sensitive skin then I do, but to be honest – I felt better effects of reducing cellulite by applying Zaggora’s SveltMelt lotion and walking around in the HotPants.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. I absolutely love the warm sensation especially in the winter time. I have seen improvements in my skin and plan to continue buying the product.</li>
            <li> I liked the warming and cooling effect. I lift very heavy and after a cold shower it helps soothes my sore muscles. It does get quite warm but I like that.</li>
            <li> I noticed some demenish of cellulite, but no big drastic changes and nothing to write home to mom about. Product might be good for others and someone else might get better results. Product just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been use the product for 2 weeks.  I see a different in my thighs smooth out.</li>
            <li> I have just started using the product and after a week I am seeing good results. Exercising with it makes it work even faster. I intend to purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t said nothing about it. I took it to the gym , only use it one time. I lose it . an I&#x27;m not going to pay it again. may be work may don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li> I almost finioshed the bottle &amp; truly don&#x27;t see any difference. MAy be slightly even tone of skin. I used it exactly as it was mentioned: morning &amp; evening. Sometimes you have burning warm sensation, sometimes not.&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks &amp; cellulite is still there &amp; visible. Will try another ramedy next time.</li>
            <li> Since my pregnancy I am having difficulty in loosing my weight , and i had  prominent  belly that i did not have  before , so  i decided to try this product ,I  started using this product since last week , and i can see huge difference , everybody kept saying that i lost too much weight  ,i thought i need a year to get in shape , but seem it working,  i really love it ,</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in between using It Works! Wraps. So I&#x27;m not sure which product is doing the most work but I&#x27;m sure this is definitely helping it along.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I put it on I didn&#x27;t really feel anything, just felt like lotion. But This time around I put it on right after a shower instead and it&#x27;s definitely a warming sensation. Almost too warm when something like my dog is laying on me. But it&#x27;s bearable when my dog is not on me haha.&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY! Not only did I notice my belly shrinking after using both products...but I also am at the lowest weight I have been in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing with healthy eating and exercise of course.</li>
            <li> I think this product is pretty awesome. I just started my journey to get my high school body back. I have some serious cellulite behind my thighs and haven&#x27;t been able to wear a bathing suit or a pair of short shorts for years, but this summer I&#x27;m super determined. The gel has really smoothed out the cellulite and I&#x27;m really impressed. I bought 2 bikinis so I can finally show off during summer! (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On March 26th, I weighed myself at 163. I am overweight for a girl standing at 5&#x27;1. I found this gel and the thermal tingling sensation is a little strong but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a past review I read about getting all over your clothes. You obviously didn&#x27;t read the directions. You have to rub this product in until you can&#x27;t really feel the product in your hands anymore. That way, you know your skin fully absorbed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then matched it with a waist trimmer and oversized hoody and sweats and ran on my elliptical for about 30-45 minutes a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that you need to adjust your diet too. If you&#x27;re still eating junk food and living a sedentary lifestyle while using this product, then obviously it&#x27;ll do nothing for you. Like I said, this isn&#x27;t for lazy people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weighed myself last night, and just about 3 weeks, I dropped to 148. Not yet at 125, but in just 3 weeks, I dropped 15 pounds. Another 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ll be at 135. This product really made my tummy that much slimmer and my skin softer and tighter. This gel has really helped me throughout my journey. I will DEFINITELY keep purchasing products from eveline.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second tube, I actually really think it helps with the appearance of cellulite when you use it with exercise.</li>
            <li> Love the product, only disappointing part was the amount. I only used it once a day and a small amount (I have a small surface area to cover, I am not a big woman)  and it only lasted 3 weeks. But the warming affect is not to hot and worked great. Haven&#x27;t seen the full effects yet but I&#x27;m getting there.</li>
            <li> I felt it worked well but compared to other brands it burned much more . It did have a pleasant smell though .</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> I usually apply it to my belly area then put on a reducing belt and found it to be most effective</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for weight lost but it is getting rid of my stretch marks on my waist and stomach! Domestic burn too bad</li>
            <li> I can feel that its working. I like the way my skin looks. the warmth of it is sigh that its working.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working! ☺</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are trying to slim down. Dont just put it on and sit..get up and move about. I found that the more you move about it stays hot. Its supposed to stay hot for about 30 to 40 minutes but I experienced more heat when I worked out. It works.</li>
            <li> After having gallbladder surgery , the skin around my belly just never looked the same, my skin felt looser and had a lot of cellulite collecting. (Surgery really effected my muscles for a year and was hard to excercise) Every time I sit down I could feel my belly sticking out. I decided to try this including with sum exercise. The first time i used it, didn&#x27;t feel much, but noticed the thermo heat reaction works best if I wore a waist clincher or did some sit-ups and then relaxed laying down on my stomach. This cream smells great(no menthol)and would stay in the skin all day.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, my tummy fold seem noticeably smaller and noticed a half inch lost.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! You can feel it working by it slightly getting your skin warmer (temporarily)and can see the slimming effect</li>
            <li> Slim Extreme 3D Thermo is AWESOME!!!  I really had my doubts about it, but it WORKS!  In two weeks I&#x27;ve lost an inch off my butt.  The warming sensation is warm but nice, not so super hot that you can&#x27;t stand it.  So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I got rash all over my belly and thighs... never buy this thing and there some french or some wiered language is all over the tube. NO english word on it!! dont buy this shit!!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product after reading reviews and using Nivea&#x27;s similar product with little results for about four weeks (I only have very minor/early stages of cellulite from age and having two children).  I was expecting a searing burning, painful sensation after application, and was pleasantly surprised that while there was heat, the sensation felt more like using a heating pad.  I applied right after a hot soak in the tub to open up the pores and allow for easier application, too.  Within a minute of applying I could feel the warming.  Now, I do have sensitive skin with some products and get redness, burning and itching, though I did not experience this with the Eveline product. Some people have mentioned the smell, but to me it&#x27;s not unlike a lotion with a fruity smell, and unlike the Nivea brand, it doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky after using (another bonus).  I just checked, and amazingly, with just ONE application, the areas I applied it to ALREADY are looking about sixty percent better.  I am in disbelief... this is some AMAZING stuff.  I am looking forward to reporting more positive results back after a few weeks! WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 30th - Still seeing amazing results with this product!  Highly recommend for anyone in need/desire of improving skin tone and texture. It really does work.</li>
            <li> this cream is a little thick but i liked it. i received it in my birthday gift basket along with lots of other skin care products. eeeh lets face it, cellulite is my problem just like any woman. i used anything and everything and so far i have my few favorites. i liked this scream and it would be one of my favorites if it wasn&#x27;t so thick. it offered some improvement but squeezing it out of the tube was a challenge. after playing tennis regularly, my wrist often hurts as it. i wish it came in a pump. but apart from that i liked it, it does work some.</li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible. The plug in the lid broke off and was stuck in the bottle but still allowed the bottle to leak out all over the plastic wrap around it. No protection against squeezing during shipping. As far as the product itself I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my cellulite dimples but I can say this stuff gets warm! It&#x27;s not to hot and I didn&#x27;t feel like I would get a chemical burn or anything but I think using this on a California summer day would feel torturously hot. I do use it daily and I like the warm feeling on cold rainy days even if it doesn&#x27;t lessen my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I am working on getting fit for winter which we all know is not the easiest task lol. I am working out but I also wanted a little something extra, I had saw this and was a bit non believing to be honest. The minute I got it I tried it out. It was amazing you feel the heat almost immediately and stays with you throughout the work out. I can tell you that it does work it tightens up you skin and helps to shed the unwanted extra lbs.</li>
            <li> If you are a couch potato , don&#x27;t waste your money . But if you work out at least 3 to 4 days a week you&#x27;ll definately see results. I love this product using it everyday when I workout</li>
            <li> I used this product every day on the same area and saw zero difference. The burning sensation you feel is really just a prop to make you feel like something is happening. Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> As soon you put it on you can feel the skin getting warm.  I used it a couple times in the triceps area to tighten the skin and it seems like is working.  The hanging skin is less than before.  I also used it in the area of neck and chin and it also seems like is working but the warm feeling might be overwhelming in Puerto Rico&#x27;s climate (very hot).  Overall is a great product.</li>
            <li> First things first, this product is amazing. It&#x27;s one of my best purchases. I am definitely a repeat customer because I can clearly see differences in my body appearance. Slim Extreme 3d Thermo Active Slimming Serum makes me look way thinner. I did it a few months before my wedding and it made my body look incredible. In a swimsuit or in a tight dress there is clearly a difference. It makes me look more feminine in my silhouette and I&#x27;m not as self-conscious as I&#x27;ve always been. I don&#x27;t know how, but the product gets warm on your skin and you feel that it is working. I use it on my thighs mostly - especially the sides and back of legs. Its works WONDERS. I know many women want to have a sexier body in terms of appearance and size, so the Slim Extreme 3d Active Slimming Serum is definitely the go-to. Get it now!</li>
            <li> I was considering zerona laser treatments. I dont need that now. I love this product. Ive lost 3 inches off my waist n an inch off my thighs. I finished my first bottle. I bought a sister product more intense that im using now. Its hot n it works.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, work&#x27;s well</li>
            <li> I use it for about 4 weeks. My skin is smooth and soft but not much change on the cellulite. But I like the heat when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Received it on time which is great! The bottle was way waaaaaay~ bigger than I expected at all which I am extremely happy about! The creme has a strange smell to it, I personally can&#x27;t really stand it but I will deal with it. I have only been using this for a short while but have noticed results extremely quickly. At first I didn&#x27;t feel any of the &#x27;tingling&#x27; or &#x27;warmth&#x27; that people had said about it but the second time I put it on, I felt it big time. Wow, I felt really hot, probably because I had used a larger amount than the first time and had applied it on after a shower (like the instructions said...) You can&#x27;t expect result with just sitting down but you also don&#x27;t have to be extreme with exercise, I just simply dance a little to some songs on my iPod that only really lasts for about 4 minutes. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works well very hot dont use w seran wrap it will itch when it heats up. It doesnt itch when u wear sweat belt to workout it just makes you sweat</li>
            <li> Another item in the market I bought that doesnt work.</li>
            <li> love the product, it is warm on your body for about 30 minutes but i didnt feel it was as hot as others have complained. i use it with golds gum slimmer belt and can tell the difference. also walk 2 miles , but this should be used with eating healthy. on the days i ate too many sweets i notice the scale did not budge.I  have placed another order.!!!</li>
            <li> Have only started using it two weeks ago but already see big changes in the smoothness of my skin and cellulite areas.  I&#x27;ve tried many products but this one by fare is the best.  I would recommend this product over any other!</li>
            <li> I reluctantly purchased this cream/serum after reading other reviewers&#x27; comments and noticing that the reviews were mostly positive. I have used the product for a couple of weeks now, along with a waist cinching product (Squeem) also purchased from Amazon, and the jury for me, is still out. While there is a tingling sensation upon application and one does sweat under the garment, I am not yet seeing any real change, so will continue using a bit longer and provide another update in another month or two. If you are interested in purchasing this item, I would not discourage you, just caution you not to expect any quick results. Good luck!</li>
            <li> product does not work at all yes it gives you a warm sensation but thats about it save your money</li>
            <li> Thermo? Did not get warm at all</li>
            <li> I use this with my waist trainer and I have seen great results! I will be buying again soon.</li>
            <li> if you can with stand the extra degrees this thermo active serum brings to you, then you would enjoy using this product, I causes me to get over-heated.</li>
            <li> This thermo-slimming cream is the best out there! The cream immediately tightens the skin surface and the warming effect lasts for a few hours. Increased blood flow to the area of applied cream flushes excess fluid. Used in addition to diet and exercise, your body-sculpting process is enhanced.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes me feel like it works.</li>
            <li> This does work.  I used it as my lotion for body wrapping.  I lost 1 1/2 inches off my stomach, 1 inch off my thighs. None off my hips/bum area after 3 hours.  The cellulite has lessened a bit.  The downside is that it burns.  Like it really burns and then gets cold.  That lasted about a hour.  I&#x27;m gonna try it again a few hours before bed and sleep with it on.  This is the third day after my initial wrap and the inches are still gone.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a single star because it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Cellulite is genetics, and only diet and exercise can truly reduce its appearance. There is a slight &#x27;heat&#x27; that comes after applying, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally go in for stuff like this---all those slimming creams and potions. In the past, they have all seemed like a bunch of false claims. Then, I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a try. Guess what? It actually worked. I use some of this according to the directions and within about 2 weeks started noticing results. After 2 months, people say that I really look much thinner. Great product. You will also love the warming effect it has when rubbed on gently. Is great when used before a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have also really been able to intensify my results by using this tea along with the cream: [[ASIN:B00ICDHICK All Natural Organic - Super Weight Loss Instant Green Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]] You will love the fact that it has a number of anti-oxidants and other healthy ingredients. It provides a lot of energy, which I find very helpful as I diet (helps to overcome that always tired feeling that we dieters have while reducing our calories and still needing to take care of a busy life). This is a great combination that should not be overlooked.</li>
            <li> First off, I have torn tendons, shattered bones and was even hit by a truck last year and right now i would take any of those instances than this freaking burning!! i have bought maybe 100 things off Amazon and never wrote a review before, even when i wasnt pleased but this is just WRONG!! i am chugging wine to cope and i would love to jump in the shower to get it off but im affraid and im a war vet, and this is just scary! warming sensation my ass! im melting! but its cool to the touch, this cannot be healthy and  its already in the garbage. I work out constantly and eat fish and veggies, i just have cellulite and its very hard to get rid of, so i though i would try this.. well, i feel like a flipping neanderthal. some things are just not worth it, and it&#x27;s not like i had just shaved my legs or anything. i went for a run, took a shower and put this s*** on and by the time i realized it was melting my insides, it was too late. who makes s*** like this!?? Im just going to stick to squats and maybe a plastic surgeon. nothing is worth this pain! stupid stupid stupid.    they should have negative stars</li>
            <li> I have had this cream for 2 weeks, and I&#x27;ve only used it about 5-6 times, but it is really affective on cellulite! My legs have like 50% less cellulite than when I first started (I have worked out a few times, but I&#x27;m sure the cream did most of the work). All of the huge dents are now tiny little bumps. There is a burning some times, but not always. I&#x27;m using it on my arms too and haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I&#x27;ve used it on my stomach a few times, and the skin feels a little tighter. So I&#x27;m not sure about the fat burning but the anti-cellulite portion absolutely works. Love this cream!! Will be buying more as soon as I run out. :)</li>
            <li> I love this cream,&lt;br /&gt;I apply it before I workout and It makes works out great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any one who works out.</li>
            <li> I do understand that you can&#x27;t melt away cellulite with creme however there are some that do reduce the appearance of it. I wanted to believe that this creme would reduce the appearance for me, BADLY. It did absolute nothing for me. I almost always got that burning sensation, but that&#x27;s all that it was a burning sensation!!&lt;br /&gt;I will just stick to my Jergen&#x27;s Firming lotion, it&#x27;s waaaaaay cheaper!! 😉😉&lt;br /&gt;This is just my opinion. What didn&#x27;t work for me may work for others!! Happy hunting!!</li>
            <li> Creme put me in the hospital for almost two weeks, very bad reaction to my stomach, please seek health professional before use..</li>
            <li> Amazing results! If you stay consistent and put this product on before a work out or a walk you will notice dramatic differences throughout the week</li>
            <li> This product functions and works very well.</li>
            <li> i am a ballerina....  it is important for my class and i to be extremely thin and tiny so the guys can pick us up, well i started using this in my routine of anorexia nervousa while combined with burn out work outs and this product put the kick in my weight loss goals. I&#x27;m looking great and feeling even better, but a little light headed.... but that is not your fault slim extreme 3d thermo active slimming serum. buy this now!</li>
            <li> It only heat activate when your fresh out the shower u can feel it othet then that it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for a week and definitely FEEL the burn. I see the increase in sweat, but haven&#x27;t seen my measurements change just yet. I&#x27;ve dropped 6 pounds in two weeks. People buying this product need to remember that this item is to be used WITH diet and exercise. Will update review when I have used for longer amount of time.</li>
            <li> After using this for&lt;br /&gt;A few months now I can say I see&lt;br /&gt;A big difference. I do work out alot but have genetic cellulite. This lotion has noticeably reduced my&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite on my&lt;br /&gt;Behind. I recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter purchase this item and she loves it and will order more when needed she loves it and tells all of her friends about it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any results other than a warm sensation that it gives off which lets me know it&#x27;s working on something. But with any product it may take an additional 30 days to see any results. I could possibly purchase again to give it a fare rating.</li>
            <li> Used them for a while. works well</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and was shipped perfectly.  I felt a tingle the first time I exfoliated and then used it.  I also feel like this works better when you work out.  I wasn&#x27;t consistent with my workout routine but i did continue to use this with no real results.  Maybe with added use and workout on a daily basis this would work out.</li>
            <li> I have used several different tummy tightening creams. And I believe that I see the best results with this cream. This is my second order for this item</li>
            <li> great warm feeling when applied on the area but haven&#x27;t seen any difference after 4 weeks. At least I tried it</li>
            <li> It works but living in Arizona with this heat. A heating sensation which gets really got is uncomfortable plus must use right after shower for best results. It did smooth my skin first then started lightening the stretch marks around my thighs. It really works but the heating is too much for me!! Great for winter season!!</li>
            <li> Well I can say I wear with my  sweat band when working out and I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> It burns. It just burns. It does nothing but set you on fire and turn your body red red red. And forget about showering to ease the burn; that just burns more. Nope. Not for me. It&#x27;s just cayenne pepper in a tube.</li>
            <li> There was no warm sensation from the cream. I just got it a few days ago and not one time did it tingle or get warm when I put it onto my skin. I wonder if it really works. I will give an update in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Works great. Heats up your mid section while walking or exercising. Use it with the Bracco adjustable waist band to help shed some water weight</li>
            <li> Works realy good. I put this on rigth before I work out with my airclimb along wearing work out melt away belt and I alredy see the result in a week. Burning feeling is good it helps you to sweat more. Its not like painfull burn, doesnt hurt just feels good. Defently will buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product! I don&#x27;t go to the gym without this. I rub it in, wrap a waist trimmer around my midsection and feel the fat burn off. You will definitely need to shower afterwards as the sweat comes rolling off. But totally worth it. I have been using it for a month and i definitely see a difference. Wish I knew about this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no change, or reduction, of cellulite after going through two tubes of this product.  I would not buy it again.  I didn&#x27;t even notice the &amp;#34;thermo&amp;#34; part when, or after, applying it.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and other than smelling like bengay, i don&#x27;t really notice any difference, and proof it does what is says or even implies, tried several different types of this product from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I can see the results after 2 weeks. but I exercise and eat right. I m going to purchase more .</li>
            <li> I used this product on my belly area and immediately started seeing my stretch marks fading!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and they have lightened up a lot compared to how dark/burgundy /purple they were.</li>
            <li> The concept of the product is great, but you have to use a great amount to actually feel anything.  Not disappointed thought</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic you can actually feel it working when you rub it on your thighs and waist. Immediately feel it getting warm almost hot you can feel it working and the results are noticeable.</li>
            <li> I saw the numerous positive feedback n bought it. I have severe cellulite n over the years i have tried several creams n lotions n treatments including endermologie &amp; radio frequency &amp; the vacuum suck treatment  which i have forgotten the name of the treatment. Alas! None seems to help. Maybe the problem doesnt lie with this serum but maybe my cellulite is severe n bad :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im still searching for an effective cellulite eraser product....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t truelly say if this works or not because I&#x27;ve only used it for a week once a day. But when you put this on, you really do feel it. I put it on before a workout and I really feel the fat burn! Lol I know I&#x27;ll see good results very soon.</li>
            <li> the victed it still out Only used once</li>
            <li> Sorry.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
            <li> When I used this product I used it on my leg stomach hips abdominal booty. And I started power walking it made the muscles in my legs get tighter, and it made my stomach sweat a lot. I can&#x27;t say that it works well or not with only one use but I can say this if it works really great I will very irdering this again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading positive reviews however i am a bit disappointed. The bottle states slight redness and a PLEASENT warm sensation and it couldn&#x27;t be anymore wrong. It burns! Which I didn&#x27;t mind till I got super itchy! I gave this products 2 days to try it out and I will not continue to use It because of the reaction i got, Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin but I would advise to check the ingredients before you buy...I would not buy this again I sill search for something else</li>
            <li> Rub icy hot all over your cellulite infested areas, or areas you wish to &#x27;firm up&#x27;. That burning sensation you get from that will be nothing in comparison to the burning sensation from this lotion. I have stopped using as I&#x27;m tired of feeling like I&#x27;m sun-burnt for hours after application, especially with the application areas being areas I need to sit on...</li>
            <li> I use this item as well as the active 3d Serum and I have noticed a big change. Don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands after application.</li>
            <li> helped my legs look smoother, But would like to know the % of caffeine in the product</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a change...</li>
            <li> This product really works! I have been struggling with losing weight and getting rid of cellulite. My cellulite was so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to be seen in a dress, let alone a pair of shorts, until I started using this product five months ago. Let me tell you it gets the job done. Now you will feel some type of sensational burning for a minute then it wears down. I use this product 2x a day along with light exercise, such as squats,leg lifts,jumping jacks,and etc. Now I am wearing dresses an shorts this summer. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to reduce the appearance of their cellulite. For best results use day and night with light exercises.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and the 4-D gold, I think eveline has the best products to treat cellulite. I also use the shower scrub 3 days a week. I have noticed a 75-80% improvement after a month of using these products. I&#x27;ve tried many other products and these work the best for me. Great price too!</li>
            <li> very good and i love it. it has been helping me from the frist day have been using it. so i will love to tell my friends abour it.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It does not work over night, but it does work.  I was set to put on my 2 piece at the beach.</li>
            <li> At first it burned and i thought it was working. But after a while i stopped feeling anything and just stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, exactly as described! Very well packed!</li>
            <li> Well I have used this product for 1 month now and it seems to helps, like I have less cellulite on my thighs</li>
            <li> It feels so weird, immediately your stomach starts to heat up and it feels like you are wearing a heating pad. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but at first did not exercise work it on. After one day of adding in some fat burning cardio the cellulite on my butt and upper thighs did appear smaller. Maybe it was just my high hopes and endorphins after a run,  but this morning they still look diminished!  I&#x27;m perry excited to see how affective it is over the course of two more weeks. It was also delivered earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> For a sensitive skin person it burns like crazy when you put it on first. but you do see the change in it.</li>
            <li> Burns like crazy and did absolutely nothing for my stomach.</li>
            <li> States on tube that it does not remove cellulite</li>
            <li> I just got it. I will be trying it out very soon. I will update if it worked or not. The bottle was not the same as the picture. Hopefully it works :)&lt;br /&gt;Update soon!</li>
            <li> ok I just got this in the mail. I applied it to the areas I wanted to. and oh my gosh!  this stuff burns D: I just started so lets see the results in 2 weeks. ill be back lol :D</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really promise anything and it sure didn&#x27;t give anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about two weeks and I can tell a difference! The smell isn&#x27;t bad, the warming is actually very comfortable. I have been using every night after a shower and in the morning. I liked it so much I just bought another tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this product. Stick with it, it works great!!</li>
            <li> When i ordered this product i was a little worried i had just thrown my money away on another worthless product, my order cane a lot quicker than expected :) ive only used this product a few days and my family has noticed they say my legs look better! (Although they dont know my little secret)</li>
            <li> I used this product along with my squeem body shaper and within 2 weeks I started seeing a big difference. The warming sensation can be very uncomfortable but, if you can get past that you will see results.  It is not a miracle cream but more of an aide to help you in your process. I love and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did no received any result plus it burns. I do not like the burn feeling is like having icy hot.</li>
            <li> Product does what it advertisement sayx it will do.  Greatly increased sweating and have seen the results in my waist line. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Not using it regularly, but whenever I do it has a slight heating sensation. I just apply it has a normal moisturizing cream on hips and thighs .</li>
            <li> Worked great!  I put a little gel on my upper arms, stomach and thighs in a circular motion to activate the gel and then I put on my workout gear and workout no less than an hour.  It makes the flab disappear and your skin soft within days. I had stretch marks on my stomach and this gel made them fade.  I exercise every other day riding my bike several miles, power walking mixed with jogging, Zumba, and Yoga, alternating each one on a different day. Now the key is you have to move your body for the best results.  I eat pretty healthy and in moderation, drink plenty of water, don&#x27;t smoke, drink occasionally, and I go to bed early, 8:30-9 pm and wake up early 6 am.  I believe you can eat anything you want, in moderation, if you work out everyday.  This workout routine has worked for me since I was 21, had two children, and now I am 52 so now maybe it will work for you too.  I just added something extra, the gel!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a major change in firming or tightening but it did help a little. I probably won&#x27;t buy again. Looking for something that will work better.</li>
            <li> it works for sweating when you  are working out</li>
            <li> When I use it I&#x27;ll let you know if I like it</li>
            <li> The heat is crazy, but I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!  Fast delivery, I would definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it works and helps when you want to trim off some weight. Just got this product a few days ago and it is already working wonders for me. Works best while doing challenging workouts, at first when I tried it I was surprised of the burning sensation. Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t hurt it just feels sort of like the Icy Hot feel to it, nothing major, but I would defiantly buy this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> I have very flabby chunky thighs loaded with cellulite due to heredity and losing and gaining weight so much in my life.  I was never over weight.  The most weight I gained was during pregnancies.  Throughout my life though, I have been a yo yo dieter. 10 pounds here and there. work out queen then not, then got physical injuries and so on.  I always hated my thighs!!  extra fat layers in my knees there for life.  The dimples are getting worse as I am aging (49) I exercise about 3 days a week, but even when I was doing it 5 days a week thighs were a major issue.  I have tried every cream on the market.  I tried this one, and what I did was put this on one leg only and used another brand on another leg that I was using for a month. When this product came in I put it on my right leg 2xs a day for 2 weeks and kept using the other product on my other leg.  I thought I noticed a difference, but when others said my leg looked smoother and thinner (that sold me) now I am applying to both thighs. All the others are garbage.  I will never be able to rid myself of cellulite as it is horrible, but this put a dent in it, and no other product ever has.  I am still in shock and I have not had the product for 4 weeks yet!! Just hoping the results keep coming, and don&#x27;t just stop after a certain point!!  I also think I will need to use it forever now!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product i felt i saw results while using it, however one day i happened to read the back and noticed the warning.\\&quot;Persons with sensitive skin, prone to broken capillaries or varicose veins should not use this product,\\&quot; so I suppose if you arent prone to that stuff (which I am)this product will be great for you. Just for extra information, I didnt get any new vericose veins while using this product, but I dont think I&#x27;ll be using it again.</li>
            <li> It clearly says in the product that don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin, prone to broken capillaries or varicose veins. I didn&#x27;t know I am, until after I used this product ONE TIME. It did has warm feeling but I&#x27;ve noticed that my veins are much visible (their big!!!) I think this product woke them up for them to act like that. So just beware. This may slim my thighs but I&#x27;d rather have big thighs than legs full of varicose veins.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think this product working at all&lt;br /&gt;i used it almost everyday&lt;br /&gt;but didn&#x27;t see any change at all&lt;br /&gt;felt very hot when applied but&lt;br /&gt;then no result was visibly seen</li>
            <li> Not working.. i read some review and find it capturing but it didn&#x27;t. I wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I was really expecting it to work better than it is, especially when it was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> im so amazed with this cream,i have been  struggling with stomach area since ive had my 3 kids was tired of looking like i was still prego :) well any way was using a waist belt was sweating some off but i started using this with out working out and i am dead serious  i have lost almost all the nasty cellulite that just with in one month.i love this cream!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure if I like it just yet. I haven&#x27;t seen any result, then again, that might be because I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously. It stings... a lot lol.</li>
            <li> To all the ladies out there trying stuff that never works or buying expensive cream we can not afford!!!!! LOOK NO FARTHER, I&#x27;m a mother of six and saw I needed something that would help me and not brake the bank!! I love this cream! I use it every day and work out with it to amplify the heat on my skin, it is great and I even measured before I started I was a 39in. waist and now a 35 in one month! Yes of course u can&#x27;t expect to lay down all day and eat what u want and it work but if like me tired of how u look and what a change fast this will help!! U just need motivation from reading this and take the first step then order this cream, go get a sweat wrap, apply cream before wrap and a daily exercise! Nothing can stop u if u want it bad enough!!! FYI it works wonders on my back pain with the heat help me workout for hours. Good luck ladies!!</li>
            <li> this thing does not work. It just feels warm.</li>
            <li> Did nothing but made my legs smell weird and feel tingly</li>
            <li> get very hot and i done think it works</li>
            <li> What. The. HELL? This is the weirdest, freakiest, most disgusting thing ever. I applied it and felt like I had a fever all over my body that was going to kill me. I thought I was going to throw up or pass out or both. And it&#x27;s weird as Hell that it penetrates your epidermis...how harsh, fake, and gross. It&#x27;s in the trash now, where it belongs.</li>
            <li> It gets hot when you apply it but I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic decrease in cellulite I guess I have to use longer</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a product review, but in this case I felt it was warranted. This lotion burns terribly. I don&#x27;t know if it works; to be honest I don&#x27;t care to use it long enough to tell. It is horribly painful and I consider myself to have a fairly high pain tolerance. Not worth it. Don&#x27;t believe the &amp;#34;pleasant warming sensation&amp;#34; descriptor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, but it gives a warm burning feeling</li>
            <li> Honestly I think it works given more time using it I believe I would have seen more results.</li>
            <li> Very good cream to lose fat</li>
            <li> nice warming sensation, but overall it didn&#x27;t do anything other than make my skin a bit softer.</li>
            <li> For sure has thermo active ingredients! Burns like tingling tanning lotion and my skin is starting to look great! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Works well. Idk if it&#x27;s slimming me but I like the warmth it creates as it promotes sweat at the gym. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and makes my skin softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li> This cream works good for me. I like to use as regular base&lt;br /&gt;I am recommended for friends.  Love this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot!! Haha it heats your skin up but I haven&#x27;t seen any change.</li>
            <li> Ok, I used it religiously for one month along with strength training and cardio excersises, so I cannot say whether this product alone would give me such a great results. Just to get the background - I started having cellulite and strech marks when first became pregant with my first dauther - strech marks were and still are pretty bad and I think this cream did anything to smooth it out - however it is advertised as cellulite smoothing cream and I think it does its job. I have noticed significant cellulite reduction my my thights - but I also drank tons of water and cut ouf my soduim intake while being on the cellulite fightin regimen. I think it is really the combination of things that will make you to see the results, but if you stick with it - it will sure to awe you.   Also, just a warning - this cream burned so much the first few times that I thought I&#x27;ll explode - it as unbearable and not so much painful as exremely itchy. I got used to it and now I actually enjoy it. Highly recoommend. on last note - Eveline Cosmetics is great brand - they are big in Europe, very reputable. And hey for $15/bottle it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream,but please do not expect miracles you must eat right and exercise. I use this a lot, a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> It does not heat up on me idk</li>
            <li> WELL HOPE IT HELPS MY LEGS AND UNDER ARMS WISH ME LUCK</li>
            <li> They took my review down last time because I said it didn&#x27;t work which it doesn&#x27;t. Spend your money on a gym membership</li>
            <li> I got this product about a month ago, and I already see changes!I see myself even buying another one:)I use it two times a day,prefebly after shower-that&#x27;s when I really feel the burn.My skin is much firmer, and my cellulite is definetly reduced!It&#x27;s a product that really helps getting rid of these terrible bumps that we carry for years!You should add a good workout 3-4 times a week and a low-calorie diet,lots of fresh squeezed juices and its bye-bye cellulite!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t feel heat or become hot at all. I review it after I have used it twice. Each time I put it on and rub it my skin have no chage, no even a little hot and don&#x27;t know if it is not working for me or anywhere I used it wrong</li>
            <li> I received my Slim Extreme today. I was so excited to try it, I took a shower to exfoliate my skin and ensure that optimum results could be achieved. I am in love with this product after the first use. The lotion has a nice consistency so it is easy to apply. In the first 2-3 minutes you begin to feel the gentle warming sensation. It becomes more intense as it is absorbed into the skin. I could see water droplets form where I had applied the lotion. It definitely draws out excess water from the cells. This is a very good sign of postive results considering that fat is mostly water anyway! I am stoked so far. It is also a nice loction to apply to the abdomen for women who may be experiencing cramping and backache related to our monthly visitor. The warmth just soothed my backache so nicely. I will update in a few weeks with my results!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this long enough to know if it worked. It burns if you get the product in your armpits or behind knees. I needed this for my legs and arms. Unless I laid perfectly still, I was unable to prevent it from getting to areas that didn&#x27;t another portion of my skin. I usually love heat in general, but this was way too painful.</li>
            <li> Just got the lotion last week. It really does heat up within 5 minutes of applying. I wear it under my buttlifter.I have yet to c results since its only been less than a week.</li>
            <li> I receivrd it and I&#x27;m using it. Let you know if it works.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works on stretch marks and I definitely sweat more on my lower body when working out. I&#x27;ve seen improvement within the first week and I&#x27;m ordering my second tube. It really helps tone up your lower body especially when combined with exercise. I recommend this product, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I like this product it works veery well .</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, it heats up nicely and works just as well as products that I&#x27;ve used that are twice the price,  that being said,  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure for cellulite.  I like to use this on my  thighs and tummy under sweats while I do a cardio workout.</li>
            <li> This really works- and fast. It toned up my belly by several inches! I didn&#x27;t change my diet or add more exercise, but I may be different than you. I just gained about 7 lbs from my summer break and my belly started to get squishy. This popped me right back into shape in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It makes you sweat and it appears to do the job if you exercise too of course!</li>
            <li> It does what it said it would do and Because it works I love it!! Specially when I work out</li>
            <li> I use this cream when I&#x27;m in the sauna / steam.  I can feel it working as it heats up a bit.  I don&#x27;t believe in miracle cures but it&#x27;s a great addition to my overall body care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 wks and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference. You do feel a burning sensation when applying it to your body. But I see no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully for about 3-4 weeks now. I am not seeing any results as of now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that I work out 6 times a week and my diet couldn&#x27;t be any better. I bought this because I was looking for something to get rid of stretch marks and I saw a review here that said it removed their stretch marks. The fat burning seemed like a great bonus. As for cellulite, I don&#x27;t have any so I can&#x27;t comment on how it would work for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is pretty annoying. I&#x27;ll put some on and rub it as directed then I need to put more and more on. I apply this anywhere I can just to get some extra fat off my body. I have tried on my arms, waist, stomach, chest, thighs, and buttocks. I only feel a burn on the thighs and butt, nowhere else. I do not see results. Perhaps it works for some people, but take from me, not even the perfect diet and exercise helped. And yes I do have a little extra fat so it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t have any fat to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work for some people but not me. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and was so excited, only to be disappointed. I had read reviews that said there was an intense burning sensation and in order for it to be affective you needed to have skin without lotion on it so I washed off the lotion on my legs and put it on. There was nothing, it barely got warm :(  I was really hoping for more.</li>
            <li> What a surprise!  This does work. I put it on the areas that need tightening and the flabbyness is reduced... even on the first application. I felt the heat and the melting action of my fatty 60+ year old body.. Thank you for such a great choice for body resculpting. *v* J</li>
            <li> I swear vy this cream. It works!</li>
            <li> Wow,  Just applied this for the first time and I can&#x27;t say if it works, but it is HOT!  Made the mistake of rubbing it on my chest.  (sigh)  My backside feels like is a warm toaster oven.  Amazing.  I&#x27;ll report back once I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, but there is heat involved here.  The people that say they didn&#x27;t get a warming sensation must have been using a different formula.</li>
            <li> As good as Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks, this product help my abs section sweat more. I try workout with and without using it, the result I get is completely different. Just 20 minutes sit-up while using it, my abs actually burn up more fat ( my feeling) and look more tone.</li>
            <li> It does have a warming effect. But after finishing the bottle, I did not notice any results. The real results come from exercise.</li>
            <li> I like the warm sensation. Does it help reduce the appearance, absolutely! Do the &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; disappear not so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my stomach, thighs, arms for two weeks now and yes it does work. :) Will order again.</li>
            <li> First time using thermal gel and it&#x27;s amazing!! Keep me wrong and sweeting. Have used for about week already. Not sure if it&#x27;s effective but it&#x27;s he heat makes me feel very comfortable.  Goes quick, one can last for about two weeks. Get another one already!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this product. I&#x27;m a believer that creams and lotions don&#x27;t work to reduce fat, no matter how much we wish. Only diet and exercise do. Yet for some reason I felt compelled to give it a whirl. Waste of money. Yes, it gives off a burning sensation when I applied it for the first week. After that, no heat at all. I tried to rationalize that meaning I don&#x27;t have any more fat to burn, and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no more heat. Then I look at my tummy and shake my head... no change. Oh well.. lessons learned best through mistakes.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, what attracts me to it so much is just how much this literally makes you sweat and I use this cream on my stomach with my bally belt when I work out and I mean that part of my body drips in sweat! The other thing is the amazing burning sensation you get after a couple minutes of the cream being rubbed on and it lasts for like 30 minutes but it feels good its not to hot and it lets you know its working. If you want the best results with the warming sensation then put the cream on right out of the shower when your pores are open. I took off one star because im not sure what it does exactly for cellulite, I will have to use it longer to find out!</li>
            <li> While this product does not provide an immediate tightening appearance as I anticipated, it has definitely made a difference on my inner thighs, the back of my thighs and my abdomen. I will turn 50 in 2013, and as a petite woman all my life, I did not have cellulite until the past couple of years. Coupled with proper diet and excercise, I began seeing seeing noticeable results within two weeks of once daily use. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a warming sensation on the skin upon application that, for me, lasts no longer than 20 minutes and is quite tolerable. I think it&#x27;s note worthy that I only experience this sensation when I use the cream soon after showering all the natural oils off my skin. The warmth is not at all bothersome for me and in fact makes me feel that it is actually working on those little unattractive dimpled areas. Before I began using Slim 3-D, I looked like I had two navels, one just above my actual navel. That is almost completely gone. My abdomen is much less dimply, and my thighs have improved, though not as rapidly as my abs. I truly believe this is a treatment cream versus an immediate, temporary fix that washes off in the shower. The results are cumulative and this is exciting. Best anti-cellulite treatment I&#x27;ve ever used. If the heat is too bothersome, I recommend waiting for a couple of hours after showering before application (but do not apply any other oils or creams beforehand). Also, massage your troubled areas when you apply the cream for best results. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be disappointed with Slim 3-D. I would give it a 5 if it was scent-free, or had a more pleasant scent. I will say that it is mild and does not linger long at all.</li>
            <li> great seller and great experience.  I have been using the cream with a weight belt and losing weight i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> This stuff works along with exercise and healthy eating. :) i like it. Lets be real just putting on creme isn&#x27;t going to make u.smaller. get up. Get active :).. it has helped remove the appearance of my stretch marks dramatically :)</li>
            <li> can I use this product when i&#x27;m in the sauna/ it&#x27;s an infra red sauna. I already bought it, but know I&#x27;m asking myself if I can use it when i&#x27;m in the sauna.</li>
            <li> I really like it and the burn you feel after you apply it makes me believe it&#x27;s working n after 3 weeks of it I can see the effect. Having said that you do have to, of course, control your diet and do a bit of exercise for max affect.</li>
            <li> First off I am not an employee of the company , nor did I get anything free. This is an honest opinion of mine. I have horrible cellulite on my thighs and butt. I have tried so many things , some seem to work others not. By the time I notice a difference, those bottles were empty,so on to something new. WOW, For those who say there is no burn...Are you kidding me?  There is a burn/tingle but you need to take proper steps in order to feel the burn..and there is one.  Take your shower be sure to exfoliate, then put it on right after getting out. Your pores will be open and ready to absorb the product. Be very careful not to get some on you jay-jay, thats a whole new story !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was running around the house like a wounded chicken. If you want an extreme action, wrap it your legs in plastic wrap, if you can stand it then it will work really good for you. I couldn&#x27;t handle the burn for more than 4 or 5 minutes, felt like fire ants, . I  just sit with a blanket snug around me ,that too will bring the heat out. I did and still see benefits to using the lotion. First application I saw about a 25% reduction.  It could have been because the wrap or just the skin tightening around my thighs. I do massage it in  while sitting on the couch watching TV, it burns but I make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must remember there is no magic cream, you need to eat right, do some exercise and make a commitment to this. If your gonna skip days, eat junk foods and couch potato yourself, then why bother. I also use skin firming cream about two hours after applying Extreme 3D. If you put in on close it will just curd up on you. We all are different and some lose it fast, others take time. I continue using it because i feel it is working along with my healthy life style i just started. I wore shorts out the other night to a dinner and then the club. It&#x27;s been three years that I have put some on, so i do feel it is working or the shorts would not have happened ..at all !!! I gave it four stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on.r stars because sometimes the burn is toooo intense to keep on.</li>
            <li> This lotion BURNS badly, as well as, itches.  I won&#x27;t use it long enough to see if there are results.</li>
            <li> Decided to try the cream over the gel this time. My personal choice, I like the gel better. This still gives the same effect and results as the gel kind. Really like using Eveline&#x27;s thermo fat burning product, it really helps you shed those extra water weight!</li>
            <li> If it worked I would not care that it got over my clothes, doesn&#x27;t work. Has little mint that makes skin tingle so you think it&#x27;s working. So tired of false advertising. It just simple does not work. You just moisturizer your skin with this</li>
            <li> I can feel the heat and the sweat after applying. I use it with a wrap when I work out at the gym and it works well.</li>
            <li> I can promise you that this product does NOT work, everyone who says it works have not bought the product. Save your money and buy some bengay if you are looking for a thermal cream.</li>
            <li> Well, this product makes my skin itch like crazy and the warming sensation is still in effect after an hour and a half. I do feel it working but the itching is unbearable.</li>
            <li> doesnt do anything to me!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it when doing exercise, my body temperature increase and I start sweating a lot, I feel my skins get firm and smooth. It is the best product I have ever used, I recommended for whoever want to reduce cellulite fast and secure. Thank you</li>
            <li> im a male and i&#x27;ve always had fatty tissue under my armpits that makes my chest get that saggy look . i&#x27;ve tried all kinds of workouts and diets and nothing seemed to work untill i came accross the product. this cream works wonders! i went down from 208 pounds to 202 in 2 weeks and my chest looks more shapely. i still have some fatty tissue in that area so i should be able to knock out the rest very soon. the only draw back is that my face is getting that sunk in look in the cheeks and my total  muscular frame has shrunk a bit. is it possible that this cream works too good and is very potent? i might have to back off of it for a week or two so my body can fill out a bit. i work out 4 times a week and i eat very healthy so this product is a must for fat loss and tighter looking skin. i strongly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference after finished using the whole container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bazzilion cellulite products by now. The good news is that most of them seem to work. This cream wasn&#x27;t an exception. It does make your skin smoother and it smells very pleasant, but it&#x27;s so thick that I had to use all my strength to squeeze it out of the tube. A bit more lotiony texture would be better. I could feel a bit of warmness if I apply it right out of the shower, it wasn&#x27;t burning like others say. Just a tad worm. Although I can&#x27;t say if it contributes to cellulite loss in any way. All in all it is a good product but they should get rid of parabens.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first 2-3 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a change and I was working out.  The reason I stopped is that it actually inflammed my belly button.  I did use it after that but had to be careful as to not get it too close to my bb.  I expected it to make the skin warm, expected it to make me itch.  Will I use it, sure.  Do I have confidence that it works, not really.  I will say, however, that I was incredibly impressed with the company.  Not only was it packaged well, the item was received fast and in good condition (especially for an APO address).  I don&#x27;t really recommend or not recommend this product but I do, however, recommend this seller.  Their website is definitely worth checking out.  In my opinion, seller gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> you can feel it work instantly and the bottle looked bigger than expected (:</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It wasn&#x27;t long at all before I was able to see results. It&#x27;s like u can feel it working</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. It was simple to spread on and seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and secure and the squeeze tubes were individually sealed in clear wrap&lt;br /&gt;and then inside another padded mailer.</li>
            <li> Love it , really works , even on my stretch marks. Is smoother and is being 2 weeks that I&#x27;m using ...great product I recommend ♡♡♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Omg this ia great i use it when i work out i can feel the thermo working great product can wait till i start seeing results.....</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it in combination with Eveline Anti-Cellulite Scrub for about 5 months now and my skin is visibly better firmer. I would recommend to use it especially in winter time as it warms you up pretty fast. Will be definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> I kept trying it for a week, although no significant weight loss, I can feel the body is tighter a little bit. But since I am doing the yoga at the same time, I don&#x27;t know which one is working. It has a spicy feeling when apply to leg and arms, but no special feeling when I apply it to the thighs and belly, where has the largest amount of fat.</li>
            <li> I love it. Although it doesn&#x27;t get hot all the time.   I would definately stick with it.   I like the green serum sample she sent me too.   It gets cool on contact.   so, i guess thermo for winter and green one for summer.</li>
            <li> The product did burn but for about 15 minutes only, that&#x27;s if a substantial amount was applied. Applying too thin will have no sensation at all, which I think does not work. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks now, have not seen any measurement improvements,</li>
            <li> Is there really a cream or lotion that can do what this claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is a pretty good chance something somewhere might make a difference or better. I just haven&#x27;t found it yet and this one while meant well in execution is not worth the price I paid and that was 13 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: You know that atleast this stuff is trying to heat you up and giving an effort so you don&#x27;t feel like its a total waist which might be the whole heat up purpose but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s packaging is new, innovative and pretty informative except the fact that it isn&#x27;t concrete. What did it say? I forgot. That means it wasn&#x27;t clear. Heat doesn&#x27;t &#x3D; treatment if that were the case then I have spent enough time in a tanning bed to be saved from this for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have cellulite as of yet in my life but I am a woman so no matter what I look like, like you I want to look better. TAKE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES! Measure your legs with a tape measure not for results but so you can observe skin tone and get a better idea of what your dealing with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It is itchy and for those of you out there who wont work for it your not going to use it. I put time into being burned, working out, and wearing and will wear anything even if I am no comfortable if it works. This feels like tingle lotion without the tan benefit. Oh and it smells horrible, and you have to wash your hands 50 different times. Then you have to wear pants because if you have a cat or dog-do the math. Don&#x27;t workout and wear this followed by a shower because doing in that order makes you burn in that shower and feels awful. So if you can sleep with it on then that would make the most sense. It&#x27;s just not worth it. It&#x27;s also a job without reward. I will work for the things that work beauty wise until it&#x27;s time for botox but this is not worth all the trouble. Honestly, if you miss this when its gone go buy some tingle lotion and call it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have any of you had luck with their other products? I am doubtful to go back. At least they tried. Onto the next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helps with any fat burn but it sure does heat you up as if you were on fire. I think it can be used for massage therapy though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it does become warm once rubbed on, but not uncomfortable or unbearable like I read in previous reviews, been using on my thighs and stomach for three days now and already impressed, the skin is so much tighter and smoother, will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best anti cellulite cream on the market.  I was a little worried because everyone I had bought was much more expensive but this showes that money doesn&#x27;t buy the best if everything.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I don&#x27;t even use it twice a day and my legs have transformed into wonderful looking short skirt outfits  and shorts  I would have never worn.  Thanks so much to the manufacturer.  I can&#x27;t say enough. This product is a miracle. Also not a work out fan so it had absolutely nothing to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I have since bought some of their other products from this company and am also very satisfied. Thanks again for the great skin.</li>
            <li> I just started using this yesterday, so for so good. It does heat and makes my stomach hot, then add the waist band and I start to sweat hard like a sona around my stomach, I love it. I will buy more when the first bottle runs out</li>
            <li> Was just shopping &amp; came across this....just want everyone to know that all those fantastic ratings are indeed fake! Surely most ppl see this(doesn&#x27;t take much to see proof of the companys shameless promoting), but jic someone doesn&#x27;t bother to click on a couple (if reading them isn&#x27;t enough), figure it is a good idea to spell it out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after consistent use at the gym but you can feel a slight tingling sensation and warmth when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. Has definitely helped me shed a few pounds in the waist.</li>
            <li> Seems to have lightened my stretch marks. When it says there is a heat, they mean it! LOL</li>
            <li> ok you need to apply a lot</li>
            <li> I do not think this is magic, but it sure works.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using cellulite lotions for the past year - combined with exercise and diet (in which I cheat sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist  told me to not stick to one specific brand, but instead switch each time I finish one. I got this one three weeks ago and it does what it is supposed to be - fair price, good results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it and i would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> love it i could see results immediately</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and it made my stomach feel the burn.  I am very happy with it so far and can&#x27;t wait to keep using and see some results, on top of my working out, and eating better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old black female.  I was trying to decrease my weight by 5-10 lbs. I am not over weight, but was just trying to look better for my spouse. This product does NOT work.  Not sure who is wrote the other reviews, but it did absolutely nothing for me .I tried working out with the Cellulite capris and again, it did nothing.  I bought this product because I read the reviews.  If you are hiring people to lie about this product-please stop.  Be honest.</li>
            <li> Love  this  slim  extreme 3 d themo  active will  order  again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this for tummy wraps. I place a generous amount and cover my stomach with plastic wrap. I have seen a difference and lost inches from my belly.</li>
            <li> this is very item to enlarge your buttocks and to warm up your area you sit</li>
            <li> This lotion BURNS! BURNS! BURNS! I threw away 1/2 of the bottle because it did nothing but make my thighs break out in a hot, red bumpy rash! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Works better if you use this cream along with exercise, i would recommend using this cream 15 minutes after shower to feel the thermal  but not right after shower, since you can feel a very very hot sensation on your skin</li>
            <li> This product say &amp;#34;Pleasant Warming Sensation&amp;#34; wrong. First time I used the product I felt like my legs were on fire. I&#x27;ve been using the product as instructed twice a day. I won&#x27;t give it a negative review because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week which isn&#x27;t long enough to say if the products works. I will say as you use the product more often the warming sensation does subside. I will write another review after using this for a month to let buyers no if the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is the third slimming purchase I have made. Out of the three, none of them worked. Save your money for Lipo Suction.</li>
            <li> i ve been using this product for a little less than a month and i havent seen not results, i do feel the warming sensation but thats it. Honestly I wont buy this product anymore, cuz it might work for other but not for me.</li>
            <li> this product works as long as you are showered and shake it up really well and when u apply it you have got to rub it n till its completely dry in order for the serum to activate! i havent seen any great results from it yet but i havent used it everyday as i should!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this product so we&#x27;ll see what will going to happen when I use it. I am not getting paid on this review that I will be making when I receive the product so I&#x27;ll give you guys an update when I started using it. I&#x27;ve made a purchase online 5/18/2013 so I&#x27;ll just have to wait and I am excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/24/2013&lt;br /&gt;I just received the product! I am so excited to use it and to see any changes that may be happening to my skin after using this together with healthy diet and exercise for couple of weeks. I&#x27;ll keep you guys updated for those who are still doing some research about this product&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL,...SO FAR I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND IN FAIRNESS IT&#x27;S REALLY HOT WHEN YOU APPLY IT. MY STRETCH MARKS WHICH IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERN ARE GETTING INVISIBLE ESPECIALLY ON MY BELLY AREA. I HAD A BIG BELLY WHEN I WAS PREGNANT SO EVEN PUTTING LOTION DURING PREGNANCY DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME COZ MY BELLY WAS REALLY STRETCHED. IT DIDN&#x27;T BOTHER ME THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT&#x27;S PART OF MOTHERHOOD AND I AM HAPPY FOR WHAT CAUSED ME TO HAVE STRETCH MARKS. I ACTUALLY PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO GET A FIRM BELLY. I DO MY WORKOUT ROUTINE ALL THE TIME AND MY METABOLISM HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD. WHEN I REALLY WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, I DO LOSE WEIGH FAST. MY PROBLEM IS MY SAGGY BELLY BECAUSE I LOST WEIGHT. I CAN SEE THE RESULTS ON MY BELLY PART, MY SKIN STARTING TO GET FIRM. OF COURSE THIS WON&#x27;T WORK IF YOU JUST SIT AROUND AND NOT DOING ANYTHING. I FEEL THIS WARM SENSATION ON THE AREAS THAT I APPLY THE LOTION AND IT REALLY FEELS GOOD. I CAN TELL THAT IT&#x27;S REALLY WORKING FOR ME. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO FAR AND I JUST BOUGHT SOME OF THE PRODUCTS WITH THE SAME BRAND AS THIS. YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB GUYS! KEEP IT UP! THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AND HELPING PEOPLE TO REACH THEIR GOALS IN LOSING WEIGHT. :) AWESOME!</li>
            <li> For best warm up effect, use straight out of the shower. I don&#x27;t know if it works alone, but with diet and exercise, I am for sure losing the wrinkly belly that I have had for the last 5 years!</li>
            <li> The cream diminishes the look of cellulite. I find that if you use it daily the cellulite there is improvement but&lt;br /&gt;you have to continue and exercise also.</li>
            <li> I take this product many times, work very good and you see the diffrence very soon. They came in the save mail all the time.  I am very happy.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WARMTH IT GIVES TOI MY SKIN! THAT LETS ME KNOW ITS WORKING. I HAVE ORDERED THE SHOWER GEL TO GO ALONG WITH IT AND MY SKIN IS TIGHTENING UP AROUND MY BELLY. I WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Two weeks and have not notice any change, but the instructions said that it will take at least 4wks to notice any change. I love the warming sensation it gives you.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, but I already feel the heat when applied, which makes me think that minimally it is drawing more blood flow to my abdomen area, thus hoping it will help burn fat there. The only thing I don&#x27;t like at this point is the odor of it.</li>
            <li> No changes in cellulite and im using it for 6 weeks now but......its true i didnt use it twice a day, only once in the morning after shower and considering im old (49) maybe thats the reason it didnt work. However, i gave it 3 stars because works pretty well for firming and lifting. The ladies might know those little &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; on the inside upper part of the legs. They used to bug me a lot but they are almost gone, i cant believe. I do exercise a lot as well, but i did this before Slim Extreme and the annoying &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; were still there. Bottom line, its not a money waste.</li>
            <li> It works, I sweat a lot with it I will purchase more!! It came on time and I use it when I work out</li>
            <li> This REALLY WORKS! FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION AND YOU WILL SEE..I normally don&#x27;t recommend this tipe of things but I am buying my 2nd tube and looking forward to buy more.</li>
            <li> I would give this product negative stars if I could.  It says on the packaging that it creates a \\&quot;pleasant tingling\\&quot; sensation but it is a really painful burn.  I gritted my teeth and withstood it for the 40 minutes it suggested the tingling should last, and since the burning and itching persisted I ran to the shower to get it off my skin.  I cannot imagine applying it twice a day!!  Really terrible.  This went in the trash immediately.  I found a natural anti-cellulite cream on Amazon that I like better, and I&#x27;ll stick to using that, running, eating healthily, and using a skin brush/mitt in the shower.  This product is a waste of money and in my opinion should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail about a couple of days ago and every time i have used it feels like my skin is burning off. It is very painful. I have not seen any results with this product and I do not recommend this product the pain is so bad!</li>
            <li> I love it!! I use it before I start my exercises in the gym. It has a burning sensation but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It help me to swept more during my workout session.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 weeks and I&#x27;m not sure if has firmed my skin.  But it does moisturize well and I like the warming feeling when it&#x27;s cold outside!  Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again, but I&#x27;ll check back after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Got here in 4 days (: the warming affect is amazing i love the feeling and boy does it makes you sweat, especially since i wear a waist trimmer! i have a 2 year old and still little chubby not satisdied with my body yet. But when applied  after the lotion gets rubbed in, and the lotion does its magic you can feel and see the tightness it does. i absolutly love it!!!</li>
            <li> I had my third child (and I have BIG baby bellies) 5 months ago, and my frame does not support excess weight well. After pregnancy, I, like most mothers, am left with a wrinkly, saggy belly and love handles. I do not recognize this body from about a year ago. After my first two, the weight came off with time. Since I am older, I am trying anything I can along with staying active and eating right to speed up the process in fear that this may be harder to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, in just days of using this product I have less of what I call &#x27;raisin belly\\&quot;. My skin is much tighter! I am confident that with regular use, diet and exercise, my belly will be flat and toned. At times (dpending on how much I apply), it feels like my skin is burning, but is cool to the touch. Sometimes it can be alarming, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I also use it on my arms as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend this, especially to new mothers or someone who had just lost weight and has loose skin.</li>
            <li> Ive used this item before and it works wonders. i would recommend it, i use it before my workouts and i love the hot tingly feeling. it lets me know its working</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin on the back of my thighs didn&#x27;t look that nice and I had put on some weight. I have been using this product for about a month, in addition to working out, eating healthier. However, I have noticed my thighs look very smooth and virtually have no cellulite at all. I have to admit I didn&#x27;t have much cellulite to begin with, but now my thighs are tighter. Yes, as people have said there is quite a sensation of heat when you put it on that will last for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Did not use it, didn&#x27;t realize it contains Paraben. Would not recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product many times and I usually use it after my workouts.  I definitely feel that my legs get firmer.  Will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, can&#x27;t say that I would buy again</li>
            <li> I have used this product as well and because I am &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; 71, it actually firmed up the hanging skin on my stomach.  I waited almost a month before I wrote this review as I wanted to give an honest comment that might be helpful.  It does warm up so when you first start off don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of the slim extreme products, and after losing 50 lbs and having 6 children I have a lot of extra skin and I&#x27;ve used this product for like 2 weeks and I can see and feel the difference. It actually works like in those before and after pictures.  I use it after the shower gel and with the thermo active shaping serum, This one doesn&#x27;t seem as hot as the shaping one and I think it has worked the best.  I have already recommended it to EVERYONE, and cannot wait to try the cooling skin firming slim extreme product.  You cannot beat the results especially for the price, and believe me I have looked. :)</li>
            <li> I started my journey to becoming fit 6 months ago by going the gym and eating right.  As I was losing the cellulite was more visible.  Then I found Slim Extreme 3D.  I love it!  It smells good and it works the appearance of cellulite is going and it seems like since I have started to use it just before working out the results are easily seen.  I have been using it about a month and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change except for an extra hot ass. You have to use a good amount of it just for one application and it says to use it twice a day so not much is really in there to last for a while.</li>
            <li> The warm feeling is the proof that the lotion is working. I don&#x27;t see my cellulite through my clothes anymore. I use it with the cellulite massager sold here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference, used this product faithfully for over 6 weeks, I run/work out hard and eat right, still no results. I am 7/8</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchased of Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Slimming Serum. Is heat activate it, so if you can&#x27;t tolerate heat (i.e heating patches or heat activating creams or gels) this might not be a fit for you. For me it has work wonders and I am soon to buy another one since mines is soon done (and since my areas were difficult to handle a 2nd tube will do) :-)</li>
            <li> I am usually a sensible consumer but podgy thighs have made a moron of me. Every bit of intelligence tells me that it is impossible for a cream to make you lose inches but I was just feeling so revolted by my thighs I grasped at straws. So in a desperate moment (and my husband says my first &#x27;blond&#x27;&#x27; moment in 17 years of marriage), I bought this product a month ago at a chemist and have vigilantly rubbed it on my thighs twice daily. I also took to the gym (which at least shows I have a vestige of intelligence left, dear hubby!) four times a week ( curves program). At the end of the month I had shifted inches off every where else on my body except for my thighs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give your money to a favored charity, blow it on some booze, inappropriate clothes, whatever but for God&#x27;s sake retain some sanity, modicum of intelligence (unlike me!) and don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap!  Please!</li>
            <li> This product is delicious ..i use it in my body ..most of the womens who use this product feel better on it ..</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all want a magic bullet when it comes to improving our body image, but the sad fact is that there just isn&#x27;t one out there.  There are steps you can take (like drinking grapefruit juice before a meal to reduce your insulin levels) to shave a few pounds off over time, but ultimately it comes down to dieting and exercising.  I&#x27;ve lost 50lbs over the past few months through diet and exercise and have kept the weight off.  I was looking for something to help me with that last little bit of trimming, but this paraben-laden chemical cocktail is clearly not the way to go.  I applied this as instructed and felt like my body was covered in blisters for a half-hour after application.  Further, one glance at the ingredients list tells you this is not the kind of thing you want to be rubbing into your skin twice a day.  The supposed mechanisms of action as well are speculative at best.  Save yourself the money, the discomfort, and the potential health consequences and do what you can to tone up the old-fashioned way.  It&#x27;s healthier that way anyway.  After all, what good is it to meet society&#x27;s expectation of what&#x27;s attractive if you&#x27;re not doing so in a way that&#x27;s good for your body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my $0.02.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works really well to reduce the appearance of cellulite. And it shipped really quick!</li>
            <li> ehhh it heats up your skin, allI can say for now</li>
            <li> This stuff really heats up and makes ya sweat. Would not advise using it while mowing the lawn on a hot day</li>
            <li> Actually this serum really helped diminish the appearance of my cellulite. It didn&#x27;t work right away. It takes a couple of weeks before you notice the difference in smoother legs, but for this to happen, you have to apply at least once or twice a day. It has a very fresh, minty sensation and your legs feel like you just sat on a load of icy hot but that just means it&#x27;s doing its job. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one tube doesn&#x27;t give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different. Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one tube. Some people have it not so easy and have to buy more than one. Regardless of how long it takes, this stuff does actually work and with consistency, you can get to where you want to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple days so I haven&#x27;t been able to see results but you can definitely feel the warmth! The first time I put it on, I didn&#x27;t feel anything, but the second time, I put it on after I got out of the shower and almost instantly started to feel the warmth so I recommend using it after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have found that it is working for myself, I use the product 2 times a day. Received items quickly from shipper.</li>
            <li> Slim Extreme 3d is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 230 pounds. I hate dieting. I don&#x27;t like to go to the gym. I love this product! It actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on weight loss. I&#x27;ve learned it is important to burn fat instead of muscle, increase my metabolism, eat low-fat foods, and get regular exercise. But I have a difficult time eating low-fat foods and getting regular exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past 6 months, I&#x27;ve been using Slim Extreme 3d and [[ASIN:B008CIGOU2 Green Coffee Bean Extract 800 - 100% Pure All Natural Weight Loss Supplement For All Body Types. 50% Chlorogenic Acid. 800mg. 60 Caps.]], and I have lost over 40 pounds of fat without doing anything else. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a week ago and can already see results!! I work out 6 times a week but my back and stomach are the hardest things for me to shape up. I used it in those problem areas and already it&#x27;s getting toned up. When I was exercising religiously and sticking to my diet saw results in those areas but when I started using the cream I saw better and faster results. I can say with confidence this product really works! I introduced it to my mom and she is hooked she can already see results all over she bought the burner cream and the shower gel! When you first put it on it was extremely hot but bare able and it did have a little itch first time but after the first use the itch went away but it still burns! I&#x27;m definitely going to order some more. If you order now you get 15% off a $35 purchase and free shipping!!!</li>
            <li> This product which promised to have a warm sensation after applying to troubled spots for cellulite  and other claims doesn&#x27;t work.  I felt the warm sensation under my skin once and that was after the 1st. use. I read a review here stating the company doesn&#x27;t give refunds on top of that. That isn&#x27;t fair to the consumer if they followed the instructions and did there part by following a healthy diet and exercise program. You get what you pay for I suppose. Also, I suspect that the 5 stars are fake and/or from the company itself to boost sales.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and its no good. Doesn&#x27;t do anything but burn. No results what so ever. Waist of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price, as well. It does help you slim down without&lt;br /&gt;intoxicating the body with strange chemicals. I use it with a slimming vest for the tummy and termal bermuda for the tighs and buttocks. I will reorder this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This silly product is useless and should be taken off the market. It burns your skin and does little else.</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with the neoprene type shorts, actually helps to smooth cellulite and slim. Seems to be more than water weight. Seems to actually &#x27;melt&#x27; the fat. Gets pretty warm, though, so may want to use cool rag for face.</li>
            <li> This stuff does tingle and have a warming sensation but i find it super comforting (it IS winter though). But it&#x27;s very soothing to me. I love it. I use this on my full core, as well as back fat, and i put it on majority of my thighs. My legs are looking awesome even though I&#x27;ve been questioning whether it works on legs because it doesn&#x27;t seem to tingle there. I always use mine right after my shower when I figure my pores are open. I think it doesn&#x27;t tingle on my legs probably because I don&#x27;t agitate and scrub them as much or as hard as,say my belly, plus the skin is probably a hell of a lot less sensitive and thin on my legs. I&#x27;ve been using this 1 week, once or twice a day, and my legs seem much firmer and the skin more tight and hydrated. This is a very nice lotion in general aside from all the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s original purpose. Amazing how Bath and Body Works and big companies can hardly get a fool proof formula down for under $15 but this has a multitude of purposes and does amazing at hydrating. Smells good, too, nothing weird or rancid or chemically, but still a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, I&#x27;m going to begin a more strict regimen of using this in a way to get the best results. Adding things in such as dry brushing (using a paddle brush to agitate the skin some, as well as break up the clustered fat cells that are the existence of cellulite in the first place from lack of circulation), maybe saran wrapping (lots of ppl use things like icyhot or coconut oil to saran wrap their cores from what i gather on the internet and get off an inch or so in a day even, be it water weight or not), using this under a wrap before a workout as well as after my post-workout shower, and whatever else I can find that might make this product work the hardest and the best for me. Either way... so far so good and even as just a lotion, it&#x27;s almost worth $15 considering what else is on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... I do work out 6 days a week a long with this. So, don&#x27;t necessarily take my results for 100% miracle. My workout regimen is fairly new (about 6 weeks in) but it is pretty intense. Either way, compared to my previous workout regimens in the past, the skin on my legs is feeling much tighter as a consistency period, not just more muscular or slimmer, which I believe is from the lotion. I have a pretty well padded core.... so I think it will take long than the week I have been using this to notice a difference in that. I will be measuring once a week. I also wear shapewear 70% of the time (always when i workout and sometimes under my clothes) to try and give my body something to conform to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also shipped very fast. The day of. and I ordered at like 2pm on Friday. Screams great service to me considering most companies pull the &#x27;okeydoke&#x27; on friday and just don&#x27;t ship out til Monday. Nope! I got this the very next Tuesday, and both items in one bag so I didn&#x27;t get schemed into paying shipping twice either. (I also ordered another different eveline cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to comment questions or contact, etc. I plan to tay consistent and update anything miraculous with this product :)out 6 days a week a long with this.

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY BURNS!! all I have to say....</li>
            <li> Do nothing for me good for stretch mark but not for cellulite</li>
            <li> HOLY MOSES.. VERY INTENSE!! I LOVE IT!! 2 THUMBS UP!! YOU CAN DEFINATELY FEEL THIS WORKING!!</li>
            <li> I had no problem with this company, I just didn&#x27;t enjoy the product. I put it on and it burned my legs so badly. They turned bright red and they were just so hot that at 3am I had to jump into my shower to try and wash it off and just get relief from the cold water. I threw it out after that</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in completely. To maximize I&#x27;d use a dry brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 days now. Don&#x27;t feel the warming sensation it&#x27;s supposed to have. I&#x27;m giving it a 3 for that reason. I will update after a month or so but the texture, smell is all amazing. It doesn&#x27;t give that oily left behind feeling, and doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it smells great and absorbs well into the skin, but I didn&#x27;t see an improvement after 3 weeks, Not sure if I would get this again. It does burn however, and when that feeling stops after a few minutes, there is a wonderful cool tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It starts heating up to extreme once rubbed in and it smells great on top of that.  Have not had it long enough to say if helping to burn fat, but it sure puts extreme heat to it.</li>
            <li> Time will be a better event for a full review as time will be the way to answer questions for me.</li>
            <li> I use this with the danskin waist trimmer belt for extra oomph, works like a charm! I use this to tone up because I don&#x27;t have any weight to lose so I use this as a body toner and it works great for me! Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once I got it. Didn&#x27;t see no effects on my thighs or anything, but my skin did got smoother. It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working.  It gets very hot and the changes may be subtle, but after a period of time, I think it&#x27;ll be more and more noticeable.  Probably one of the better products of this type on the market.</li>
            <li> Not sure but maybe for someone else is great</li>
            <li> This cream does the job, very strong warming sensation. All these creams from this company are very good you can rely on it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Used it with no results as of yet .... will rate again later after I give it a decent try.</li>
            <li> From only using it for a WEEK I IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE! I put this on once in the morning as soon as I wake up, then after I get out of the shower at night I put on once again. THATS IT! I have always had this one spot that no matter how much I ran/done Insanity/Brazil butt lift ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS, This is THE PRODUCT that eliminated my trouble spots (YAY!) -along with the help of some kettle bell swings 8D. Also I love the burning sensation/thermo hahaha it felt weird at first but I know now that thats a sign that it is working :) This is no magic spot eraser but simply something that helps if you are already active :) I reccomend this product :)</li>
            <li> I felt a slight tingling, thats about it. I use is like regular body lotion, Its good for something just not that &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used this cream every day twice a day for over a month and a half in combination with working out, so nobody can say I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;patient&amp;#34; enough. People said they saw results after like a week, and I don&#x27;t see how ANY cream can be that effective, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream makes you believe that it&#x27;s working because of the heat sensation, but afterwards I never saw a difference in the amount of cellulite on my legs, if anything it made me notice it more because I was trying so hard to see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;The heat sensation also isn&#x27;t the most pleasant at times, especially when the weather starts getting warmer. I stopped using it once it got hotter because I&#x27;d practically sweat it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best way to get rid of cellulite is more of a physical action. I use the leg vacuum suction cups and the massage combs, and I see 10x better of a result. Nothing will truly make it gone forever (in my opinion), but doing something that getting deeper into the skin and working the blood flow is a much better option than a cream that only goes so deep into the layers of your skin.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 days and cellulite was gone from my legs. Great product. I think it really tightens the skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while can&#x27;t really tell it if is working thanks</li>
            <li> I could definitely feel the heat after I rub this in. I can see how it would help burn fat with the temperature it gets to. Works great with the belly wraps also.</li>
            <li> I got it because of the great reviews, I guess it works for some but not me. im tall and skinny with an athletic body but cant outrun bits of cellulite on my bum and back thighs which makes me self conscious during bikini season, so I purchased this and used it for about a month, with no sign of improvement it disappointed me so I stopped using it and saved my money..</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for 3 weeks &amp; I havent notice a change, it was shipped &amp; sent fast which I was happy about. Im going to finish it up &amp; see what happens! Hopefully something good! I have to get beach ready lol!</li>
            <li> IT not what I thought it was. You have buy the other product in order to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews I read, I was a little skeptical. But I have to say I am amazed with the results. After just 2 weeks I can already see the difference. I highly recommend this product. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> IT WORKED A LITTLE BIT BUT I DID NOT EXPECT A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM A CREAM,  I JUST THOUGHT FOR THE PRICE I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY-SO,  I WOULD SAY,  ITS JUST OKAY,  IM NOT DISAPOINTED IN PURCHASING IT THO</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I exercise consistently.. But I am 33 and thanks to my family genetics, I do have some cellulite in the butt/lower hip area. I have tried MD cellulite back when it was $79.00 a pop! It worked somewhat but I still noticed cellulite. After 1 year of the other product, I noticed this one and more importantly, the price! It&#x27;s been 2 months now and I really love it. I definitely noticed a decrease in the cellulite. My skin feels tighter as well. I had almost no burning sensation that others talk about but my skin is not too sensitive. I thnk it is a great product but should be accompanied by a good deal of exercise!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see results! I especially like moisturizing effect and I would definitely recommend this product. it works best for me with exercise.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a change. I like the smell, but the warming action can get a little intense</li>
            <li> I clicked three just to get in a write a review.  But I did not use this since I was unhappy with the other products.</li>
            <li> it is not as effective as it says, i am a bit disappointed with the product, not impress at all</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s OK. I don&#x27;t think it burns fat off of your body, you actually have to eat right and exercise for that to happen. What i like about it is the warming sensation but this is also what I don&#x27;t like about the product as well. Because of the warming sensation this is not a product i would put on before going to work in the morning. I think it does somewhat help with the appearance of cellulite with long term use but this product is not a &amp;#34;sit-on-your-ass-and-do-nothing-creme&amp;#34;. I won&#x27;t buy think again because I like the Nivea cellulite cream much better and I can use it any time of day without the feeling of my legs burning off, especially in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li> I used this before my recent bikini competition, in combination with the finulite day/night serum. I would use this lotion after showering and as needed. And it really helped to smooth out the back of my legs/booty. [...]</li>
            <li> It helped reduce appearance of cellulite but I developed faded looking patches all over my legs that lasted a couple months after using. Sure, I had less cellulite but looked like I had diseased skin. No thanks!!! From now on I will stick to more naturally based products like Finulite and Mio&#x27;s shrink to fit. They work great without ruining the skin.</li>
            <li> i ordered this and other product. for the second time.. and they sent me a free gift. i thought that was so nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;lol it was like the face scrub? so happy. but i love this cream works wonders. works how its suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;i dont use both creams at once. when i run out i go to the next one so its like a back up for me.. all these creams seem to work&lt;br /&gt;the same tho.. i do love these.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I can feel thermo effect of this product, it is burning on my belly. Although I only used it for 2 days and cant descript its effect yet, i would probably say this is the best product among all fat burning creams considering its price and thermo effect. These people say cant feel anything maybe because you havent use enough, and you need to use it right after shower. Also you need to massage your belly while using it.</li>
            <li> first tiem trying it, it was really irritating anf burned my skin!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. At first i was really getting disappointed but then probably 3 weeks after continuously using it i finally start seeing results.I use it after or before working out to my Insanity dvd collection. And I&#x27;d apply is before bed. It takes a while! Just have to be patient. Not all products are miracle workers.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have used this one time so far.  It does get warm, but not uncomfortably so.  It did help to see a reduction in the appearance of cellulite in some trouble areas.</li>
            <li> This does not work.  I got tricked by another gimmick and it angers me.  Only diet and exercise!  No miracle tubes in the future.a</li>
            <li> For a $15 cream, it does the trick. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it does help.</li>
            <li> i just  love the serves of you guys nice serves</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with other slimming creams before I workout. I apply a waist trimmer on top and after my workout I&#x27;m dripping with sweat. There is a warming sensation after applying it as well, so don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
            <li> first of all the shipping was great, i even got a personal hand written thank you using my first name that was so thoughtful, when i put this thing on my but i felt like i had walked for a mile, my but was on fire i wanted to take my skin off i couldent handle it there so i put it on my legs it did itch and got hot, but i still haven&#x27;t used it back on my but, its that crazy, and yes the cellulite have gone from my legs and it worked quickly. i just have to build the courage to put it back on my butt.</li>
            <li> After losing 10 pounds and getting my bmi back to a healthy 19, I noticed that I still had some cellulite. (Originally I assumed that if I lost all the weight I gained, my legs would return to its original cellulite free condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this and used it about once a day. After the first week, I noticed no difference and felt no burning or any kind of heat at all. Now after using it for about 2 months, I finally get how to use it! You have to glob on a VERY LARGE amount until your skin feels very slimey and oily (kinda of like how it feels after you put on sunscreen). Don&#x27;t try to save or use the product frugally, because then you won&#x27;t feel the heating up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people were complaining that the burning sensation was unbearable. Seriously, those people are being wayy too overly dramatic. I personally find the heat very satisfying because then I can actually feel the fat being melted away. On the scale of 1 - 10 (10 being unbearable), the heating sensation is about 0.5 . I honestly don&#x27;t understand what those people were whining about. It is as hot as if you were going into a jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this product does actually work. I noticed a kind of wrinkly unsmooth skin appearance on my butt (like how your skin looks before you actually get cellulite dimples) and I globbed some of this lotion on. My butt was on fire for about 30 minutes (haha) but the next day, I actually didn&#x27;t see any unsmoothness or wrinklyness. My butt looked awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because after doing some research, it seems that this product contains some ingredients that are potentially harmful and carcinogenic. Everytime I applied this cream, I felt a slight fear of getting cancer or some other life threatening complication. Therefore, I will not be purchasing this product again. But if you are not a paranoid health freak like me, I definitely encourage you to try this out because it does work! As long as you remember to glob on large amounts of this  lotion!!</li>
            <li> After THE FIRST DAY, I have noticeable results. I recommend this product to everyone I know that has tricky cellulite.</li>
            <li> Looking for help with lower ab fat, I lost most with diet and working out. I think the Slim Extreme tightened the loose skin somewhat.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME!!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE EVERY BIT OF IT!!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S NOT MUCH BUT WORKS LIKE MAGIC FOR ME!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> when i got it i had mixed emotions about the cream really working but after 2 weeks i noticed a change in the tone of my stomach and thighs.  I use it twice a day and yes there is a warming sensation at first but it wears off after 20mins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for about a month and I have seen a few results, but not MAJOR ones. I&#x27;m quite sure the longer you use it, the better the results. It says that it has a warming sensation and I must admit at times it did get pretty warm. Warm enough to make me sweat, so I began sitting in front of a fan (if I was staying at home), until the warming sensation stopped. I do sweat pretty easily, so that may have had a lot to do with me breaking out into a sweat after applying the lotion, but just a fair warning to those who have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t really handle heat well. Some of my cellulite has disappeared over the past couple of weeks after using the lotion as directed, so hopefully they continue to disappear with diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong as the medical version in Brasil.  Might have to be due to the FDA regulations.</li>
            <li> Hi all first day of using this and OMG it is hot my stomach, butt and thighs feel like they are on fire, they say it&#x27;s meant to do this so I will plough on and hopefully see some results in few weeks and I&#x27;ll repost again!</li>
            <li> THE CREAM IS good but not MAGIC, YOU HAVE TO EAT GOOD STUFF, GO TO THE GYM EVERY DAY AND THIS CREAM HELP TO BURN YOUR FAT, ITS NOT ONLY THE CREAM, BE REALISTIC, BUT ITS NOT EXPENSIVE SO TRY IT</li>
            <li> After one time of trying this product, I can already see a noticable difference.  I used plastic wrap after I rubbed it into my legs, stomach and thighs. I have the creme on my legs about 40 minutes and my stomach for 20 minutes. The itching started and felt as if I were sweating but I wasnt. Caution...when you get into the shower to wash this off, the water activates the creme and makes it hotter...it was worse in the shower...OMG! I had to stay in the cold shower for at least 25 minutes and wash it completely off for the burning to stop.  It was awful but I am going to continue using it because I can already see results!</li>
            <li> Yowsers!  I&#x27;m writing this review as my inner thighs burn...like as a kid when you stand in front of the fireplace too long, then sit down and the back of your legs burn.  Ooh wee!  I sure hope this means it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream a few days, so I can&#x27;t tell yet.  The odd thing is that I rubbed it on my abs, arms, and upper legs...but only my inner thighs are on fire.  Only slight warmth elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product, and glad I did. You can feel it heating up once you rub it into your skin. So far I&#x27;ve lost 5 inches!</li>
            <li> This is the only cellulite product that actually works from the many many I have tried. Skin looks tighter and smoother</li>
            <li> I think this product works well if you use it regularly and needs to rub well the fatty areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I would rate this as 3 stars for my experience with it, but because it actually works I rated it 4 stars. So I originally got this for my behind, for cellulite, let me tell you I had the best looking bottom after a couple weeks and it no longer looked like the surface of the moon with all the dimples and craters. it was soft and no cellulite in sight. Now my problem was (before you presume anything, I defiantly shower and scrub myself very well all over and I do bathe well and if I can help it I don&#x27;t skip days) But it caused this worst case of acne there ever. sooooooo my pretty behind, quickly turned unattractive, and needless to say I wont touch my backend with this stuff any more because of the acne it caused, I rather have a moon for a butt than one with acne. but I will say that it doesn&#x27;t cause that on my stomach and I&#x27;m very please with the results I continue to get with it on my stomach, so I would buy it again for that reason. It can get very hot and then sometimes not hot at all, but showers do make it hotter like many say. Word of advice after applying it wash your hands and arms (with cold water and soap)!...I&#x27;ve got it on them before after applying it to my stomach, and burning wrists and arms are not fun.</li>
            <li> I like this product and the thermo sensation it gives, the instructions says to use it  twice a day but to my it works better after taking a shower, if I put it at any other time I don&#x27;t feel the thermo sensation. about getting slimmer it&#x27;s too soon to tell a difference but I&#x27;ll keep you posted. ( the thermo sensation las around 15 minutes) and you don&#x27;t need to much star with a little bit to see your body tolerance.</li>
            <li> This product met my needs. Used it every morning with my McDavid Waist Trimmer and it is getting results. Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> love this stuff I just received but im already using under a waist trainer. I really like the warming effect also...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. You can feel it working right away. A must buy.</li>
            <li> Loved this! Redness and burning are Completely normal!! After all it is THERMOactive get</li>
            <li> Good use to remove tummy fat</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and burns when you put it on</li>
            <li> hate to give this one star but it really did not work for me.  the company will refund but you have to pay shipping charges to return.  the burn is bad and was not worth going thru for no results.</li>
            <li> I seen results with my body, I put it on before I workout and there has really been a differenc, ill  continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Did not smooth skin as expected ... also doesn&#x27;t keep the skin heated for a long time during your workout...</li>
            <li> Disappointed...I thought you could put this on your stomach but its only for waist, hips, and thighs. That is my problem area.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing that it stated it is suppose to do, the smell is ok and the burn is not bad it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I really did not see any result.............Sorry I will not get it again, I will not recommended the best things is run in the park.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders!!! I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the burning sensation at all. I could start to see results within a week of using it. I use it twice a day. I use on my breasts, stomach, and my thighs. Definitely has smoothed the stubborn cellulite. Will continue to use. great product</li>
            <li> I used 1 product daily and don&#x27;t see any change much. It gets hot a bit and after a month nothing change. I cut off my food and do exercise 15&#x27; everyday so, hope it could help.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, you feel the heat right after you massage. I notice how I reduce my abdominal part.</li>
            <li> I do not recognize it was really helpful to remove Cellulite. However, what I know is that i could feel when I spreaded on this cream my legs.</li>
            <li> Does not work, I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I got an allergic reaction on my body. I was very excited to use this product but I&#x27;m sure If I didn&#x27;t have a allergic reaction I would have give this a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. I definitely feel the heat, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually doing anything.</li>
            <li> NOT EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED, THE ADVERTISEMENT IS VERY MISLEADING, AND NOT i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> I used this product rather religiously, and tried to not look too much for immediate results. After almost using about 3 quarters of the tube, I could see results! Surely, it wasn&#x27;t significant, but knowing what my body looks like, the difference was subtle, but it did make me use the product even more. The warm sensation the first couple of applications was a bit much, but your body gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I used this serum underneath my workout belt just to help me sweat a little more and this stuff does the job. I work out 1 hr a day and 6 days a week. I have 4 kids but I&#x27;m always in decent shape. It&#x27;s just that extra skin in the tummy area. So this is no miracle serum but if you use it with working out and eating right you&#x27;ll definitely see results.</li>
            <li> When applied it gives a very warm tingly sensation.  It helps reduce the appearance of cellulite + I do a routine exercise. Be aware that if you put too much product in you belly section that it causes uncontrollably visits to the bathroom. Be aware of applying.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good  product. This is my second time buying it and it does what it said. It&#x27;s tingling for a moment but then it goes away. I always put it on before I work out.</li>
            <li> I really have no idea why I was so stupid to buy that. It doesnt work, Im sure putting on some cayenne pepper would work much better and would be much more natural than this product made of bunch of aggressive chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt pay attention that it was Eveline product - I cant believe i bought it! i dont know about USA, but back at home (RUSSIA) its one of the cheapest brand and no self respecting person would buy (well, those who care about themselves and have money wouldnt 100%)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months now. Although not immediate, the results became clearly noticeable in about 3 weeks. I have a few pointers about using the product that I personally found helpful. First, you may experience an initial &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation but I personally got used to that in just a few days and it had not bothered me much after that. I would recommend using Eveline anticellute shower gel and the thermo active serum together. The anticellulite shower gel opens up the skin pores and helps the serum &amp;#34;do the job.&amp;#34; I definitely saw a big difference once I started doing that (2 weeks after I initially started using the product) and this is why I think the results may be noticeable in just 2 weeks (as opposed to 4 weeks). I used the thermo serum after shower on my outer thighs (on dry skin) twice daily. Once it started working, my skin looked tighter and firmer and the cellulite (that had been bothering me for so long) appeared less noticeable. Even more rewarding was the fact that the changes were not final after 4 weeks of using the product. I continue to see improvement and diminished cellulite appearance, which makes me trust the product even more and feel more confident about my skin. I have used other anti-cellulite products but Eveline Slim Extreme thermo active serum is by far the best and most effective product I have tried. I am excited about the changes that I see and I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for fast and visibly noticeable results - tighter skin and diminished cellulite appearance.</li>
            <li> Just love it. I always order new one when o finished it.makes ur skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product has been awesome so far! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I love it! The hearing is a great thing especially while I&#x27;m working out!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to aid in weight loss and tightening skin to hopefully reduce the appearance of cellulite, and the belly fat. I am in the early stages of use...about a month now. I haven&#x27;t paid much attention to the look of any results yet....but more so on how I feel when I&#x27;m using it. I do love it. I chose to use the product in conjunction with a neoprene belt (bought at walmart for $4.97) that goes around my stomach while I work out, or even just during everyday activity after I put the creme on my mid section, buttocks and legs. When I take the belt off after use (about 1 to 2 hours) it is absolutely dripping wet from perspiration due to the cream and the neoprene. When I work out without the cream and the belt I do not sweat a fraction of that. I lost 8 pounds in three weeks doing this, and watching what I eat. The cream can really heat up, but for me, has never been uncomfortable. It seems to really heat up when applied right after a shower. It does have a fairly nice fragrance as well...(which seems like it would be fine for both men and women). So far, I say this cream is really great.</li>
            <li> great product, love it. it works.</li>
            <li> Ready to buy my second bottle work really good I am using it on my legs and on my arms and I can see the difference with days&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me I dont feel the heat but I dont really care about that. the product is penetrate really easy and my skin is&lt;br /&gt;very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I found this product through reading review. I put it on the lovehandle handle muffin top section after i shower n it works nice. I am pretty thin but that seems to be my traget problem. Its heat active but it doesnt heat up that much for me as ive read on other reviews. I use a few times a week. I notice some results not as amazing as others but noticeable enough for me.</li>
            <li> Makes you sweat where ever you put it and it is great especially when used with a wrap.</li>
            <li> Just received it and am trying it out now</li>
            <li> I use this with the danskin waist trimmer belt, works along with exercise and healthy eating,Worked great,i like it</li>
            <li> this is thermo, but I dont use it regularly to notice a difference, ;-/</li>
            <li> Its a great product i use this with my belly burner belt and man i was sweating a lot</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> Great item and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> It really burns your fat and it works.  It&#x27;s so good for getting rid of proportionally uneven distributed fat areas.</li>
            <li> i had claw stretch marks and a pouch after my now seven month old was born. this erased the stretchmarks. I can feel the warmth whem i work out and the dreaded pouch is almost gone after one month constant use of thisand palattes</li>
            <li> When will I learn to stop buying crap like this!?</li>
            <li> Not doing anything to help my cellulite.</li>
            <li> Do not like the sticky feel, or the burning of my skin.  Did not see any real results. And it was too hard to wash off my hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Not exactly a dream cream but defiantly is up there! Will be buying again! Love the tingly feeling</li>
            <li> When applied, it heats up dramatically. Results were ok.. Nothing special. Wont be investing in this again. Nivea has something similar and cheaper.</li>
            <li> People need to remember everything doesnt work for everyone. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a zillion and one products out there. This is not a weight loss product. But I love it! It has helped make my legs have a smoother look and its even lighting up my stretch mark scars. This product is very inexpensive and worth trying at least once to see if it will work for you. Also...for the results I get with this product I have to say AMAZING. Reason why is because I don&#x27;t put this on everyday, maybe 2-3x a week and still get results. Its a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any burn from this thing. thing I waited my money. Wouldn&#x27;t offer it to anyone else. Poor</li>
            <li> I did not see any results!</li>
            <li> This slim extreme does heat up your skins, I guess if you&#x27;re walk or running outside you&#x27;ll sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen huge results, but I can feel the burn. It&#x27;s very smooth and has a pleasant scent. I recommend combining exercise and a healthy diet. I&#x27;m a week in and have lost 3 lbs!</li>
            <li> I love it.. It really makes your body sweat good when your working out. It even works good when your just laying around with the lotion over your stomach with plastic reynolds wrap and a warm cloth over the reynolds wrap..</li>
            <li> 1st time I used it I didn&#x27;t feel anything. The 2nd time I used a waist slimming belt &amp; I felt a warm/tingling feeling. It kind of itched but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Use with a wrap or belt.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month couldn&#x27;t see any differents in my belly. so don&#x27;t waste your money. I guess there are nothing that can help with a big belly.</li>
            <li> All you feel is it heat up a bit after you put it on. It does nothing for cellulite</li>
            <li> i love this product . cuz i feel it work on my body in the parts that i need to lose that extra weight . also this lotion plus the lycra combine it together for the best result . as a right now . i ti works .</li>
            <li> I been using this cream for a wile. I really do like it during my exercise. Feels very good  (hot) but not too much, not painful. Would order more. .</li>
            <li> I like this product. I do see results. This product for me only has the warming sensattion after a shower. For me it is acually a burning sensation and I didnt  like that. I dont put it on anymore after a shower. I just put it on twice a day. This is my first tube and I will most definetly buy more.</li>
            <li> Cream is very beautiful and effective and is the second purchase experience for this product,, recommend it strongly with Continuously used to give a better result. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 items at the same time and I had an adverse effect to all three, really wish I had a warning before purchase. Product has a tingle to it and if not washed off will blister the skin. My friend tried some on her skin to see if she would have the same reaction and she did! Threw the unused product away!</li>
            <li> Try something else. I used this for a month...watched my diet...went to the gym. I am not overweight just wanted to try to smooth things out. Didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> ITS OK, DIDNT SEE MUCH CHANGE RIGHT AWAY, BUT ITS WORHT THE TRY AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS, I SEEN ALIL CHANGE. NOTHING BIG</li>
            <li> Few facts about cellulite to those who keep acting shocked thst you can have it being thin. It doesn&#x27;t matter how big or small you are cellulite happens. It&#x27;s where the LACK of fat is. The divits in your thighs are caused by small areas where the fat has separated and there is none or little causing your skin to concave in that area.</li>
            <li> I just started using the thermo serum and the warming sensation is nice. I&#x27;m optimistic that by the end of the tube I see a change in the cellulite.</li>
            <li> this product said slight burning but i felt like my body was on fire. I will not use this product and I tried it three times. i was disappointed every time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this product but still no changes, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again ,  I think in one month you should see some difference</li>
            <li> Warming not to bad. Great improvements on my legs seen a differents in 2 weeks. Will reorder my second tube</li>
            <li> Obviously did not work.  I deserved to lose money though since I was dumb enough to buy it.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this cream because my legs are full of dimples. Well to see results need to apply the cream right after shower, when the pores are open. I used until I finished and I am ready to buy another tube. It works well in the legs and around the thighs. I will say it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty awesome! I use it with a waist trainer while doing cardio and it helps me sweat off that belly fat!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, result are amazing and you can see them in very short time. You feel it is working immediately after applying it.</li>
            <li> well i did experiment. this product on one leg and another top product on the other leg. took photos every week for three weeks. no change in either leg. will not wast any more money on creams, massagers or the other stuff that is sold for cellulite. just use the old fashioned method of diet and exercise as i have been doing. that works, and just accept mother nature</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I use it during my workout and I sweat like crazy. I lost a few inches on my waist.</li>
            <li> I have lost all of my baby weight from having my 3rd daughter and of course being a 32 year old mother of 3, there can be areas that needa little extra help.  This cream will not replace proper diet and working out.  However, in conjunction with, it is an excellent beauty \\&quot;secret\\&quot;.  A friend of mine is selling \\&quot;those wraps\\&quot;.  I wanted to see if I could find a cheaper alternative.  So, I amazoned and found this. Decided to try it based on the reviews.  I apply it to the area I want to treat and I wrap myself in saran plastic wrap.  I blow dry to speed up the heating process, or if I am just toning my neck and face I wrap then work out.  I see beautiful smooth results around the face. It helps heat the body to relieve water retenton and smooth skin. I&#x27;ve even noticed a HUGE decrease in the creases on the skin on my neck.  Which has been a proble since I was young.  Anyway, my BUT is, you have to still work out, eat right and drink lots of h20. Enjoy the results!</li>
            <li> Come on people be smart! NONE of these creams get rid of cellulite! Not a damn one. The only way to get rid of cellulite is to massage your skin to dispute the water build up that is causing your skin to look bubbly. The people who make these creams know this so they make these lotions that don&#x27;t absorb into the skin so that people will keep massaging the area thinking that the product worked when it didn&#x27;t only the massage did. Money lost and another customer fooled!</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels tighter, it also burns a little, I use it before I go on the elliptical and sweat a lot.  Con, I don&#x27;t like the smell, very perfumy.  But it works for me!</li>
            <li> Rashed my legs out :(</li>
            <li> 3rd order no results , giving up :-(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay not too bad</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but I am a product junkie so I was excited to try it. I honestly like this cream. I have been using this product several days and I already feel like my tummy is flatter. I don’t know how it works, but it does. I do wear it with a waist slimmer when exercising to make me sweat, and I think this cream is actually helping out immensely and speeding up my progress. I can tell my skin is much firmer and my tummy is disappearing. I also wear it to sleep after a shower and when I wake up in the mornings before work. Now there is a bit of a warm tingling sensation once you apply it, but I dont have any burning or itching sensations like some other reviewers. The tingling feeling actually goes away in about 10 minutes. I do recommend this product to anyone who wants to enhance their work out regimen.</li>
            <li> I use to see cellulite on my stomach, but ever since i started to use this serum while working out, i dont see any anymore. I plan to use this all over my body now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been analyzing the reviews for a few of the different cellulite creams-all of which I have personally tried and ordered through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve noticed the positive reviews seem to be by reviewer&#x27;s with one or few reviews in the past; though, they are noted as \\&quot;amazon verified purchase\\&quot;, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  This is the pattern for the -Slim Extreme 3D, Slim Fat Girl Bliss &amp; Finulite-all of which I have tried with little to no improvement.  Note: I am in my mid-30&#x27;s have worked out regularly for over 15 years, follow a healthy diet &amp; drink plenty of water.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been plagued with cellulite since my teen years-thank you to my parents-for passing along that gene :).  This product in the first few weeks seem to minimally smooth out some of my cellulite, but the cellulite was definitely still visible.  A few weeks later, I saw no additional improvement.  Disappointing as the tingling effect did make me believe it would do \\&quot;something\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried it anyway and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  It works, you can feel it!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smoother and soft. It does feel hot when you put it on your legs but it only last a few minutes.</li>
            <li> On my third tube don&#x27;t waste money on body wraps just use this and sweat it out.  It works.</li>
            <li> amazaing product.. you can notice the different with in a week time .. Of course i will buy more ..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff the burning is as expected very uncomfortable the first few times but you get use to it! I love using this with my waist cinched and waist trimmer I notice results in one week not dramatic ones but some is better then none! Still using it can&#x27;t wait for the long term results</li>
            <li> Use it when I jog outside every day, because the warming sensation, while wearing my waist cincher and after two weeks I saw the stretch marks I have become smoother. Would recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you use it right.  I few helpful hints I found and will share.  I used this because I had some fatty spots that were being stubborn as I was losing weight.  I was getting slimmer but I had these flab spots that wouldn&#x27;t budge.  So I put the cream on in the morning right before i go to the gym.  I were everlast neoprene bottoms that really act like sauna pants.  WOW the burn.  Then, I put it on the second time after I shower while my pores are open.  Again I could feel the heat.  I use it on my hips and tummy.  I have found that if you put it on and the room is airconditioned and you just flop on the couch that I got nothing from it.  So moisture on the skin helped my absorbtion.  However, this product is helping me knock off those hard to get inches.  I lost an inch and a half in a week and a half.  I am also goin to try the cooling one next.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. THIS PRODUCT WORKS!! My husband even commented on the results, and he had no idea that I was using anything at all. I have been very, very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bet neither of you knew that this cream is russian made, and in fact is one of the cheapest brands in eastern Europe. Moreover, it&#x27;s actual price is no more than $2 and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. So save your money.</li>
            <li> I felt a warming sensation and my skin appears somewhat tighter.  I hope it is working but cannot tell yet.</li>
            <li> I have used various products--mostly from Yves Rocher, don&#x27;t get me wrong they work, (and are all natural) but they do not work as intensely as Eveline Slim Extreme. I have seen a remarkable improvement and it has been 1 month. I may not be perfect but theres a huge weight off my shoulders and my treated areas look 100% better. I am impressed. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff . .really works . .u feel great and the heat sensation lasts for hrs and hrs. .infact I love it so much im gttn ready to order more</li>
            <li> I have tried everything out there.  I have horrible cellulite from a botched liposuction job.  No matter how thin I am it is always there.  I put this cream on and in about thirty minutes I saw an amazing difference.  It burned like I was standing in a fire though.  At first I thought what have I done?  It&#x27;s almost painful.  However, the burning only lasts for about 20 minutes and it was worth it for me.  My thighs looked tight and smooth with just a few dimples in the upper thigh area.  I will use this again for sure.  Now that I know what to expect, I&#x27;ll just be prepared for the agony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to add this.  I have noticed a big difference if I first take a hot bath in the results.  I think that opens the pores.  It also makes the product burn way more than just applying it without the bath.</li>
            <li> GREAT product! of course it doesn&#x27;t do miracles... but, along with exercise and a good diet it really works! I never believed in lotions/ creams etc.. on helping get rid of cellulite, but after I read all of the reviews I decided to try it and I still can&#x27;t believe how awesome this product is, I saw results in less than 2 weeks. Since you will have to take the time to apply it in your body, take an extra 5 minutes and massage the area really well in circles, it does make a difference!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and the price is amazing for such a great product! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I been using this product for about a week, week and a half but have yet to see results. It does get a little hot but it&#x27;s a good hot, not like other reviews I&#x27;ve read it doesn&#x27;t feel like your burning it&#x27;s a tingling feeling only lasts about 25 mins. It seems to work better after showers.</li>
            <li> Could not see a difference in skin tightening</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Makes me sweat as if i worked out for hours in the gym. Works wonders. I have been buying it for almost 4years now. Great and fast service . Fats delivery. Love it</li>
            <li> another total rip-off bulls**t product. don&#x27;t buy this. period.</li>
            <li> They stand behind what they sell. I have since had lazer lipo. It it a good sized tube for what I needed. Nice price too.</li>
            <li> Product Came On Time!  Really Excited to Start Using Eveline Cosmetics! Love that it came with a extra free Night Creme Packet Wasent Expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> What a burn it feels great !  I love to rub on before a work out ! It feels like you do twice the work out !</li>
            <li> I apologize, but this is the first product that I have gotten off of Amazon that I have not liked... At all. Honestly, these creams do not work. HOWEVER, that does not mean you cannot get rid of those &amp;#34;unwanted clumps&amp;#34;. I have done a lot of research on cellulite reduction/removal, and finally found something that actually worked. Ya&#x27;ll might have heard of Joey Atlas, and probably thought it was a scam (I certainly did at first) but if you go to his website and watch his video then you can get a reduced price for a video to REMOVE cellulite. I bought the program for I think $45.00 (I understand it is a bit pricey, but if you think about it, if you bought a few tubes of this stuff you could have gotten something that actually worked) and I have almost gotten rid of the cellulite after 4 weeks. Back to this product, please do not waste your money. Buy something that actually works.</li>
            <li> Well, this is not a \\&quot;Super-hero\\&quot; lotion and can&#x27;t make wonders by its own. For the cellulite to be gone (or, at least become less visible), you need to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. DRINK LOTS OF WATER!!! About 64 oz a day. Water acts as a natural cleanser by flushing toxins out of the body, therefore, stimulating body&#x27;s metabolic processes and reducing excess fat.&lt;br /&gt;2. DO PLENTY OF EXERCISE!!! The more you exercise, the faster your muscles will burn surrounding them fat cells.&lt;br /&gt;3. AVOID FOODS HIGH IN SUGAR!!! It is better to eat fat than sugar, since excess amount of sugar turns into fat and gets stored deep inside the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By doing this 3 steps only, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference in the appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lotion, it contains caffeine, which is good for treating cellulite. If you can afford it, get it! If not, just follow those 3 steps and you&#x27;ll be more than fine.</li>
            <li> Omg.....it really work.......I put it on 15 before I workout within in one week I was empress with the results. I lost 5 inches of my belly. I recommend other to use this product!</li>
