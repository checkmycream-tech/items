            <li> Best ever! Love it every night in the shower! Anything Aveeno is a awesome!</li>
            <li> I usually love lavender scented soaps and when I saw Aveeno made a body wash for it, I bought one. It made my skin burn so bad, on my legs especially. A very painful reaction for me, although it seems many people love this item. Did not work for me and I usually don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This bathwash does not have many bubbles.  Sometimes it takes alot of lather to make you feel good.  The scent is mild, but I have to use an awful lot to really smell good.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is very calming when used as a body wash but will also bubble and make a great soaking bath.</li>
            <li> very good,I love it .It has great work to make body clear and do not dry,So I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and leaves you feeling soft and clean. I have purchased this product, and the other variety&#x27;s and each of them have been top notch.</li>
            <li> I bought it on line because it was cheaper than buying locally.  We use it all the time and buying it online saved me money.</li>
            <li> A good product for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;And so on and so forth.  I&#x27;ve already said all there is to say</li>
            <li> I am &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to shower gels and have tried many different brands and types.  I decided to try this one; it has everyhing I am looking for in a gel: need to use very little on a bath poof to clean your entire body, light but noticeable scent, soothing, and moisturizing. I feel it is comparable to others I have used that are far more expensive.  I will be ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this. It has a great smell and is very gentle on the skin. I would buy this again. it&#x27;s my guilty pleasure.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I enjoy very much. It is somewhat expensive but it is worth it. It is thick and rich and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for something to replace my Jergens body wash I loved.  So far this is the winner.  Nice smell, leaves my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice. It cleans very well. And I also use this product for shaving and it seems to do a very good job. No nicks and it keeps the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> smell is not that good but it cleans you well and makes skin soft, but did not like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno body wash has a nice and soft lavender aroma.  It leaves my skin smooth and not dried.  It makes bath time relaxing. Would recommend this to my friends.  I even use this on my baby because this Aveeno product smells softer than the Johnson and Johnson one.</li>
            <li> Combine this body wash with the Salux massaging cloths and then spread the Aveeno calming lotion over the body. This  will make you so relaxed that you may want to wait until your bed time to do all of this. I recommend using all 3 items for relaxation and will order again and recommend  the products to friends and family</li>
            <li> My soap was drying out my skin and needed something else. This stuff helps make sure my skin has moisture, is soft, and it smells nice! Aveeno quality :)</li>
            <li> This product has an amazing scent and is very calming.  It also leaves the skin soft and refreshed.  I have sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with some body washes and this feels so nice on my skin.  It is not to thick and rinses off perfectly.  So far Aveeno products have not let me down!!</li>
            <li> I am not saying I bought this for the &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; factor but it did affect my decision in getting this over some other body wash. So- NO CALMING effect. Smells OK, does not linger on. Does not leave my skin dry. Three stars for deceiving name.</li>
