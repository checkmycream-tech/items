            <li>I love this kit!  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I purchased a costly &amp;#</li>
            <li>I kind of......ohh.........</li>
            <li>I can keep my tooties looking good and healthy...............</li>
            <li>After I acquaint myself with this tool, I am sure it will prove to be a good buy.</li>
            <li>I do my own toes with this...</li>
            <li>The parcel was nicely wrapped and everything seems to be in order.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean up my cuticles before polishing my nails and it did a great job.  </li>
            <li>It runs powerfully and beautifully every time.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves since it is wireless and very easy to replace wheels.</li>
            <li>This is a great help, bought it as I had surgery on my right hand and could not cut my own fingernails or toenails.  </li>
            <li>you are better off spending more for better quality!</li>
            <li>very nice and powerful</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!!</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I thought it would be, although handy tools and gentler than my nail file, need to use it on a regular basis to get the best effect.</li>
            <li>It work ok but not at well as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Love all the attachments.</li>
            <li>This product worked but required alot more time to do finger nails than it did with clippers and nail file.  </li>
            <li>think I better stay with going to get them done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this one rather than the ones sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>This works well, but I had hoped for a better buffer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>Just bought 3 more for my daughters.  </li>
            <li>Works okay on fingernails.</li>
            <li>Surgery was then performed and I would have to take antibiotics and have more pain.</li>
            <li>I have also file the top of the nails keeping them fairly healthy looking(not</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I think it needs more power</li>
            <li>Better to get a Dremel and use their bits.</li>
            <li>but he sure needs to with them</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love my body tools.</li>
            <li>Safe for diabetes to use.</li>
            <li>but I had rather have more attachments.  </li>
            <li>However, this one is okay for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>I am like many others that have read the reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>but I guess it okay</li>
            <li>work OK could be stronger.</li>
            <li>but my wife love it  </li>
            <li>sometime we have to take turns or my wife want to do my nails :)</li>
            <li>For the price it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li>One of the most easily used and convenient tools I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I was able to complete a self pedicure in 45 minutes and my feet look great.  </li>
            <li>The first one I believe is 3 years old and is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived on time, in excellent conditiion, item was packaged well.</li>
            <li>This unit is cheaply made but better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much bough one for my mother</li>
            <li>maybe a little bit more of power and maybe another tool would make it a close-to-a perfect product.</li>
            <li>like the product, looks like is not gonna fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>I had a similar tool many years ago and it was great...</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use and maneuver.</li>
            <li>Using it is easy.</li>
            <li>It comes with varied and easy to use tools.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to store in the drawers and/or closet in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably fine for fingernails,but not for stubborn foot callouses.</li>
            <li>The little emery bands work best for my man&#x27;s nails but the easiest way to replace the band is to peel it off like a spiral using needle nosed pliers.  </li>
            <li>Not really that great for pedicures but more for manicures.</li>
            <li>Forget about it doing any kind of job in trimming toe nails; even filing seemed to take a much longer time.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY ENJOY USING THIS BODY TOOL FOR MANICURE &amp; PEDICURES, IT HELPS A LOT.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It was to powerful for me but would be ok for men&#x27;s toenails.</li>
            <li>, He was really Happy when He open His package</li>
            <li>works great, batteries last awhile on one charge</li>
            <li>Works very well and has a nice selection of drill heads and sanders.</li>
            <li>Buy something more powerful.</li>
            <li>, I thought that it would have been more powerful but.</li>
            <li>Replacement emery bands are available separately and rather inexpensively elsewhere on Amazon (found 100 for about $2).</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Very useful..</li>
            <li>very useful tool ,and not just for me</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that the LED light that supposed to light up when charging didn&#x27;t, so I thought, ok, if its just an LED problem, I can stand.  </li>
            <li>It was worth $15 to me, thanks for asking, I would&#x27;ve payed much more for a better product to satisfy my need for it.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my hands clean and my nails both clean and neat.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good and I enjoy using the various attachments supplied.</li>
            <li>This tool will quickly, powerfully and accurately file and shape nails in seconds.</li>
            <li>The 3 stars are for the drill when it worked and great customer service from Amazon, the minus 2 stars are for the nonetheless faulty</li>
            <li>product is superior to similar Electric Manicure Pedicure kits that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Need something more gentle for my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Some say its a good product, some say it&#x27;s totally rubbish and do not even work.</li>
            <li>So, I ended up contacting Amazon and they offered me a full refund including shipping.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ma loving this</li>
            <li>Excellent solution for thinning or shortening thick toenails.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li>(make sure u read the instruction manual carefully and replace the correct type), and started charging for 24 hours, then magic!</li>
            <li>But all the other tips work great.  </li>
            <li>Also great for fingernails, but have to becareful not to press to hard or will take off more than you want.</li>
            <li>Working pretty fine until now</li>
            <li>Lost charge quickly.</li>
            <li>I try to pamper myself every weekend with a home manicure and pedicure and with this product I was able to achieve very professional results!</li>
            <li>Overall we are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>AND I FILE MY FINGERNAILS DOWN- AM SO HAPPY WITH MY PEDICURE SET</li>
            <li>For less than the cost of one manicure or pedicure it is a great investment.</li>
            <li>got  my order very quickly with no damages already tried all attachments and they work very good&lt;</li>
            <li>All the parts were very easy to use and pretty inexpensive to re-order  new parts when I need them.</li>
            <li>I have used this product now for several weeks, and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This item paid for itself with the first use!</li>
            <li>Had to go to the Podiatrist for my nails, they were a mess and he suggested I get a pedicure kit and this one is GREAT...</li>
            <li>I really like this product!!</li>
            <li>This device is easy to control and has more than enough power.</li>
            <li>This works very well not as well as a manicurist but just fine for me</li>
            <li>With this great little machine, I have had no pain.</li>
            <li>It works good only at certain angles.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful in smooth skin around the nail and shaping.  </li>
            <li>This tool is not as powerful as I  had hoped.</li>
            <li>Love the fact you can use battery power or plug cord directly into the unit.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as we thought it should be .</li>
            <li>The tool is very easy to use, gentle and easy to hold in position, and there was in fact NO powdered stuff left.  </li>
            <li>But I bought it mainly for pedicures anyway and the rest of the tools work fine.  </li>
            <li>I have a small callous on the side of my foot in this worked exceptionally well!</li>
            <li>This product, while not very strong, is good and does the job quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have debated for a long time whether to ask for one or not; I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>Its the right size to hold in your hand an work with.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.  </li>
            <li>It is still going strong, but the tools, though well-made, are not as varied as my new one.  </li>
            <li>Great little machine!</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT little tool!  </li>
            <li>It works ok but could be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>Used it for first time after plugging in for about 7 hours and it was powerful.  </li>
            <li>She was very pleased and it does exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>Having attractive nails is important, both socially and professionally important because the attractiveness, or lack there-of, of one nails is tremendously indicative as to one&#x27;s mental and emotional state-of-mind.</li>
            <li>Had previously used this product and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It runs very fast too.  </li>
            <li>This is a real life-saver!  </li>
            <li>Most definitely recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very well worth it.</li>
            <li>I comes with enough accessories to be more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>The tip recommended for use on fake nails worked best for this application.</li>
            <li>Gave it away after first try.</li>
            <li>I charged for over 24 hours before first use, then tried it</li>
            <li>So ok, now I&#x27;m left with a drill that does not work lying on my table, so I thought,</li>
            <li>Can get hot sometimes and the friction causes heat that leads to smoke, but you just need to be aware.</li>
            <li>The charging mechanism broke in the first month so had to plug it in while using it.  </li>
            <li>The price is good, but it is waste of your money.</li>
            <li>Really good except i lost the rotator circular file within a few days.</li>
            <li>This product could use a little more power but for the price it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Omgoodness,  my toes look fabulous and this cut down the time to do them in half and honestly made them look more precision.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will help me to smooth out the calluses and uneven toenails on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time this past weekend and was delighted with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little manicure/pedicure set</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t to expensive but very good to work with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a good manicure in Kona without an appointment and that doesn&#x27;t work for my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a little more power but seemed to work pretty well the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>and it actually works to smooth my gel nails between fills.</li>
            <li>Works very well for manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for something that didn&#x27;t need replacement heads too often but that is not the case with this product.</li>
            <li>--THANK YOU VERY MUCH-MRS. DELORES ROSENKILDE</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just haven&#x27;t used it enough to be comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My wife being from Europe,is really into foot care,so I thought I&#x27;d buy her one.</li>
            <li>and there would be powdered stuff all over my floor; and I wondered if it would really do that much.  </li>
            <li>This device works really well.</li>
            <li>The Podiatrist would cut my nails straight across.</li>
            <li>I would have much pain when the doc clipped my toe nails.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power...</li>
            <li>I have no feedback from the family, but I really like mine.</li>
            <li>Makes taking care of my toe nails so much easier between going to the doctor.</li>
            <li>The device does work, but it is nowhere near as powerful as the Medicool device.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product only for light tasks.</li>
            <li>I like this machine so much I&#x27;ve&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I find it very helpful.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>For real this time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x60;t really tell you about it as it was a gift for someone</li>
            <li>the power was very week</li>
            <li>, it looked good, but is certainly NOT anywhere near a professional tool</li>
            <li>This product is very elementary and has no power behind it to do any kind of pedicure job.  </li>
            <li>The product came quickly and was as described, but when my wife tried to use it, the power of the rotary tool was pretty low</li>
            <li>Reviewed this product earlier when first received and gave a good review then , with proviso added that it does require a firm push to place the attachment in ---having</li>
            <li>This one is better due to the recharging stand and all the attachements.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful and versatile than her past kits.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m finally winning the battle by keeping the nail filed down and letting the medicine really soak in.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this set and was able to file my nails down.  </li>
            <li>The top falls off if you try to hold it up side down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure buying a Black and Decker or  </li>
            <li>It needs more speed and better/stronger filing tools to get the job done in less than an afternoon.</li>
            <li>Cut my pedicure time by more than half.  </li>
            <li>I go to, uses a similar machine quickly</li>
            <li>So luckily for me, the problem is with the rechargeable batteries from the factory and not withthe actual drill.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this product for you and your &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; family.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this device for the price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it............for anyone..</li>
            <li>but I wish it had a little more power.</li>
            <li>Its nice to get a product that can Manicure Hard Toenails.</li>
            <li>With toolz, I not only substantially reduce the time required to trim them, but it is also fun to use.</li>
            <li>I tried the corded one but his is much lighter and just as powerful with a long life charge.</li>
            <li>this product I have been able to file and round the edges of my toe nails.</li>
            <li>Yes, the rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t cheap, but you can always use it on other electronics.</li>
            <li>Could use a little more torque, but seems to work well so far.  </li>
            <li>I like that my new one is  cordless.</li>
            <li>After no less than 6 phone calls, waiting on hold, calling manufacturer and amazon, many emails and promises, I still do not have the missing piece I paid for.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old, and doing my nails is not easy any more.  </li>
            <li>a Dremel 687-01 52-Piece General Purpose Rotary Tool , much cheaper, would have done the job efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using this kit, my nails are in much better shape and have not split like they had been doing in the past.  </li>
            <li>I think it is more for a manicure since the attachments are small.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this kit, no more nail salons for me in the summertime.</li>
            <li>nails and feet always look like a professional done it.!</li>
            <li>Over the past 2 years I have purchased 3 more for my daughters.  </li>
            <li>The Body Toolz Manicure Kit is very unique and its not too small to use.  </li>
            <li>So this drill, not saying it&#x27;s perfect or fantastic, but at least no more sore hands with the repetitive filing action.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made; flimsy; any pressure, any time you trry to actually use it,  device falls apart; don&#x27;t waste your money; it&#x27;s in the garbage</li>
            <li>They included two of one type of file for acrylic nails that I can&#x27;t use and omitted the one I could use for natural nails.  </li>
            <li>My Nail Genie Junior lost is old as the hills</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old and thought I can do my toe nails by myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has enough power to really file your nails, even your toe nails.  </li>
            <li>I can do my nails professionally from home....</li>
            <li>I use it quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>This kit allows me to give myself manicures that are so professional</li>
            <li>* 10 or more years ago, my late husband bought me a manicure set from the Frontgate catalogue.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product maybe a year ago and it has completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I had a small battery operated set previously, but this unit is so good.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to purchase a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;however, this one works decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use for normal upkeep on toenails that are a little harder to cut with a normal toenail clipper.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this to drill file my nails, as I need to play the piano, I need to keep my nails short, well, virtually none!</li>
            <li>Included was a list to call to buy extra disposable stuff needed at a high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a good job on my hard nails and where clips won&#x27;t get into tight places.  </li>
            <li>I received my products 2 days later than expected, Amazon offered a partial refund for the shipping, so that was ok.</li>
            <li>Mine is finally losing power, so I just ordered myself a new one.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use tool for handling those thick toenails.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be good for heavy, thick toenails but</li>
            <li>For harder nails, the increased friction from applying increased pressure easily (and constantly) stops the head from spinning; it simply does not possess the high torque of other devices.</li>
            <li>It only actually started drilling/filing with new replacement batteries!</li>
            <li>Powerful for little drill.  </li>
            <li>A little steep, but worth it.</li>
            <li>When you hit the good skin it does not remove that, only the hard dead skin.</li>
            <li>Hi, I&#x27;ve been trying similar products for many years and find that the battery operated manicure products are just no good at all for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far.</li>
            <li>For that much money, I expected a REAL Tool with Real Power and Serious Implements.  </li>
            <li>Had an old personal model similar to this.</li>
            <li>Just died after 13 months of use which was mainly spring/summer months not much use in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not long on patience, it ended up in the garbage!</li>
            <li>It works but takes a rather long session to complete.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one a few years ago and thought I would replace it.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been in such good shape, especially in the cold seasons.</li>
            <li>I soak mine in Listerine every day which slows down the fungus growth very well.</li>
            <li>(Well, I mean before it actually stops on its own after a few minutes).</li>
            <li>I was able to grind down my thick crusty toe nail and remove all the yellow stains and cracking.</li>
            <li>and while I have no recommendations for any revisions or modifications, we have found this product to be less effective on thick toe nails than we had expected.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for a pedicure as that is difficult for an old gal like me to reach the toes.</li>

            <li> I love this kit!  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I purchased a costly &amp;#</li>
            <li> I kind of......ohh.........</li>
            <li> I can keep my tooties looking good and healthy...............</li>
            <li> After I acquaint myself with this tool, I am sure it will prove to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> I do my own toes with this...</li>
            <li> The parcel was nicely wrapped and everything seems to be in order.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean up my cuticles before polishing my nails and it did a great job.  </li>
            <li> It runs powerfully and beautifully every time.  </li>
            <li> Wife loves since it is wireless and very easy to replace wheels.</li>
            <li> This is a great help, bought it as I had surgery on my right hand and could not cut my own fingernails or toenails.  </li>
            <li> you are better off spending more for better quality!</li>
            <li> very nice and powerful</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be, although handy tools and gentler than my nail file, need to use it on a regular basis to get the best effect.</li>
            <li> It work ok but not at well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Love all the attachments.</li>
            <li> This product worked but required alot more time to do finger nails than it did with clippers and nail file.  </li>
            <li> think I better stay with going to get them done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this one rather than the ones sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> This works well, but I had hoped for a better buffer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and love it.  </li>
            <li> Just bought 3 more for my daughters.  </li>
            <li> Works okay on fingernails.</li>
            <li> Surgery was then performed and I would have to take antibiotics and have more pain.</li>
            <li> I have also file the top of the nails keeping them fairly healthy looking(not</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I think it needs more power</li>
            <li> Better to get a Dremel and use their bits.</li>
            <li> but he sure needs to with them</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my body tools.</li>
            <li> Safe for diabetes to use.</li>
            <li> but I had rather have more attachments.  </li>
            <li> However, this one is okay for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I am like many others that have read the reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> but I guess it okay</li>
            <li> work OK could be stronger.</li>
            <li> but my wife love it  </li>
            <li> sometime we have to take turns or my wife want to do my nails :)</li>
            <li> For the price it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li> One of the most easily used and convenient tools I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I was able to complete a self pedicure in 45 minutes and my feet look great.  </li>
            <li> The first one I believe is 3 years old and is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived on time, in excellent conditiion, item was packaged well.</li>
            <li> This unit is cheaply made but better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much bough one for my mother</li>
            <li> maybe a little bit more of power and maybe another tool would make it a close-to-a perfect product.</li>
            <li> like the product, looks like is not gonna fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> I had a similar tool many years ago and it was great...</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Using it is easy.</li>
            <li> It comes with varied and easy to use tools.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to store in the drawers and/or closet in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably fine for fingernails,but not for stubborn foot callouses.</li>
            <li> The little emery bands work best for my man&#x27;s nails but the easiest way to replace the band is to peel it off like a spiral using needle nosed pliers.  </li>
            <li> Not really that great for pedicures but more for manicures.</li>
            <li> Forget about it doing any kind of job in trimming toe nails; even filing seemed to take a much longer time.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY ENJOY USING THIS BODY TOOL FOR MANICURE &amp; PEDICURES, IT HELPS A LOT.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It was to powerful for me but would be ok for men&#x27;s toenails.</li>
            <li> , He was really Happy when He open His package</li>
            <li> works great, batteries last awhile on one charge</li>
            <li> Works very well and has a nice selection of drill heads and sanders.</li>
            <li> Buy something more powerful.</li>
            <li> , I thought that it would have been more powerful but.</li>
            <li> Replacement emery bands are available separately and rather inexpensively elsewhere on Amazon (found 100 for about $2).</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Very useful..</li>
            <li> very useful tool ,and not just for me</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that the LED light that supposed to light up when charging didn&#x27;t, so I thought, ok, if its just an LED problem, I can stand.  </li>
            <li> It was worth $15 to me, thanks for asking, I would&#x27;ve payed much more for a better product to satisfy my need for it.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my hands clean and my nails both clean and neat.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and I enjoy using the various attachments supplied.</li>
            <li> This tool will quickly, powerfully and accurately file and shape nails in seconds.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars are for the drill when it worked and great customer service from Amazon, the minus 2 stars are for the nonetheless faulty</li>
            <li> product is superior to similar Electric Manicure Pedicure kits that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Need something more gentle for my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Some say its a good product, some say it&#x27;s totally rubbish and do not even work.</li>
            <li> So, I ended up contacting Amazon and they offered me a full refund including shipping.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ma loving this</li>
            <li> Excellent solution for thinning or shortening thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  </li>
            <li> (make sure u read the instruction manual carefully and replace the correct type), and started charging for 24 hours, then magic!</li>
            <li> But all the other tips work great.  </li>
            <li> Also great for fingernails, but have to becareful not to press to hard or will take off more than you want.</li>
            <li> Working pretty fine until now</li>
            <li> Lost charge quickly.</li>
            <li> I try to pamper myself every weekend with a home manicure and pedicure and with this product I was able to achieve very professional results!</li>
            <li> Overall we are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> AND I FILE MY FINGERNAILS DOWN- AM SO HAPPY WITH MY PEDICURE SET</li>
            <li> For less than the cost of one manicure or pedicure it is a great investment.</li>
            <li> got  my order very quickly with no damages already tried all attachments and they work very good&lt;</li>
            <li> All the parts were very easy to use and pretty inexpensive to re-order  new parts when I need them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for several weeks, and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This item paid for itself with the first use!</li>
            <li> Had to go to the Podiatrist for my nails, they were a mess and he suggested I get a pedicure kit and this one is GREAT...</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!</li>
            <li> This device is easy to control and has more than enough power.</li>
            <li> This works very well not as well as a manicurist but just fine for me</li>
            <li> With this great little machine, I have had no pain.</li>
            <li> It works good only at certain angles.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful in smooth skin around the nail and shaping.  </li>
            <li> This tool is not as powerful as I  had hoped.</li>
            <li> Love the fact you can use battery power or plug cord directly into the unit.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as we thought it should be .</li>
            <li> The tool is very easy to use, gentle and easy to hold in position, and there was in fact NO powdered stuff left.  </li>
            <li> But I bought it mainly for pedicures anyway and the rest of the tools work fine.  </li>
            <li> I have a small callous on the side of my foot in this worked exceptionally well!</li>
            <li> This product, while not very strong, is good and does the job quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have debated for a long time whether to ask for one or not; I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> Its the right size to hold in your hand an work with.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right.  </li>
            <li> It is still going strong, but the tools, though well-made, are not as varied as my new one.  </li>
            <li> Great little machine!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT little tool!  </li>
            <li> It works ok but could be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> Used it for first time after plugging in for about 7 hours and it was powerful.  </li>
            <li> She was very pleased and it does exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Having attractive nails is important, both socially and professionally important because the attractiveness, or lack there-of, of one nails is tremendously indicative as to one&#x27;s mental and emotional state-of-mind.</li>
            <li> Had previously used this product and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It runs very fast too.  </li>
            <li> This is a real life-saver!  </li>
            <li> Most definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very well worth it.</li>
            <li> I comes with enough accessories to be more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> The tip recommended for use on fake nails worked best for this application.</li>
            <li> Gave it away after first try.</li>
            <li> I charged for over 24 hours before first use, then tried it</li>
            <li> So ok, now I&#x27;m left with a drill that does not work lying on my table, so I thought,</li>
            <li> Can get hot sometimes and the friction causes heat that leads to smoke, but you just need to be aware.</li>
            <li> The charging mechanism broke in the first month so had to plug it in while using it.  </li>
            <li> The price is good, but it is waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Really good except i lost the rotator circular file within a few days.</li>
            <li> This product could use a little more power but for the price it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Omgoodness,  my toes look fabulous and this cut down the time to do them in half and honestly made them look more precision.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will help me to smooth out the calluses and uneven toenails on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time this past weekend and was delighted with the results.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice little manicure/pedicure set</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t to expensive but very good to work with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a good manicure in Kona without an appointment and that doesn&#x27;t work for my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a little more power but seemed to work pretty well the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> and it actually works to smooth my gel nails between fills.</li>
            <li> Works very well for manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for something that didn&#x27;t need replacement heads too often but that is not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> --THANK YOU VERY MUCH-MRS. DELORES ROSENKILDE</li>
            <li> I think it works very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t used it enough to be comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My wife being from Europe,is really into foot care,so I thought I&#x27;d buy her one.</li>
            <li> and there would be powdered stuff all over my floor; and I wondered if it would really do that much.  </li>
            <li> This device works really well.</li>
            <li> The Podiatrist would cut my nails straight across.</li>
            <li> I would have much pain when the doc clipped my toe nails.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power...</li>
            <li> I have no feedback from the family, but I really like mine.</li>
            <li> Makes taking care of my toe nails so much easier between going to the doctor.</li>
            <li> The device does work, but it is nowhere near as powerful as the Medicool device.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product only for light tasks.</li>
            <li> I like this machine so much I&#x27;ve&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I find it very helpful.  </li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> For real this time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t really tell you about it as it was a gift for someone</li>
            <li> the power was very week</li>
            <li> , it looked good, but is certainly NOT anywhere near a professional tool</li>
            <li> This product is very elementary and has no power behind it to do any kind of pedicure job.  </li>
            <li> The product came quickly and was as described, but when my wife tried to use it, the power of the rotary tool was pretty low</li>
            <li> Reviewed this product earlier when first received and gave a good review then , with proviso added that it does require a firm push to place the attachment in ---having</li>
            <li> This one is better due to the recharging stand and all the attachements.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful and versatile than her past kits.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m finally winning the battle by keeping the nail filed down and letting the medicine really soak in.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this set and was able to file my nails down.  </li>
            <li> The top falls off if you try to hold it up side down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure buying a Black and Decker or  </li>
            <li> It needs more speed and better/stronger filing tools to get the job done in less than an afternoon.</li>
            <li> Cut my pedicure time by more than half.  </li>
            <li> I go to, uses a similar machine quickly</li>
            <li> So luckily for me, the problem is with the rechargeable batteries from the factory and not withthe actual drill.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this product for you and your &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; family.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this device for the price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it............for anyone..</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a little more power.</li>
            <li> Its nice to get a product that can Manicure Hard Toenails.</li>
            <li> With toolz, I not only substantially reduce the time required to trim them, but it is also fun to use.</li>
            <li> I tried the corded one but his is much lighter and just as powerful with a long life charge.</li>
            <li> this product I have been able to file and round the edges of my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Yes, the rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t cheap, but you can always use it on other electronics.</li>
            <li> Could use a little more torque, but seems to work well so far.  </li>
            <li> I like that my new one is  cordless.</li>
            <li> After no less than 6 phone calls, waiting on hold, calling manufacturer and amazon, many emails and promises, I still do not have the missing piece I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 years old, and doing my nails is not easy any more.  </li>
            <li> a Dremel 687-01 52-Piece General Purpose Rotary Tool , much cheaper, would have done the job efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using this kit, my nails are in much better shape and have not split like they had been doing in the past.  </li>
            <li> I think it is more for a manicure since the attachments are small.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit, no more nail salons for me in the summertime.</li>
            <li> nails and feet always look like a professional done it.!</li>
            <li> Over the past 2 years I have purchased 3 more for my daughters.  </li>
            <li> The Body Toolz Manicure Kit is very unique and its not too small to use.  </li>
            <li> So this drill, not saying it&#x27;s perfect or fantastic, but at least no more sore hands with the repetitive filing action.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made; flimsy; any pressure, any time you trry to actually use it,  device falls apart; don&#x27;t waste your money; it&#x27;s in the garbage</li>
            <li> They included two of one type of file for acrylic nails that I can&#x27;t use and omitted the one I could use for natural nails.  </li>
            <li> My Nail Genie Junior lost is old as the hills</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and thought I can do my toe nails by myself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has enough power to really file your nails, even your toe nails.  </li>
            <li> I can do my nails professionally from home....</li>
            <li> I use it quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> This kit allows me to give myself manicures that are so professional</li>
            <li> * 10 or more years ago, my late husband bought me a manicure set from the Frontgate catalogue.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product maybe a year ago and it has completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I had a small battery operated set previously, but this unit is so good.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to purchase a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;however, this one works decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use for normal upkeep on toenails that are a little harder to cut with a normal toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this to drill file my nails, as I need to play the piano, I need to keep my nails short, well, virtually none!</li>
            <li> Included was a list to call to buy extra disposable stuff needed at a high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my hard nails and where clips won&#x27;t get into tight places.  </li>
            <li> I received my products 2 days later than expected, Amazon offered a partial refund for the shipping, so that was ok.</li>
            <li> Mine is finally losing power, so I just ordered myself a new one.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use tool for handling those thick toenails.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good for heavy, thick toenails but</li>
            <li> For harder nails, the increased friction from applying increased pressure easily (and constantly) stops the head from spinning; it simply does not possess the high torque of other devices.</li>
            <li> It only actually started drilling/filing with new replacement batteries!</li>
            <li> Powerful for little drill.  </li>
            <li> A little steep, but worth it.</li>
            <li> When you hit the good skin it does not remove that, only the hard dead skin.</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve been trying similar products for many years and find that the battery operated manicure products are just no good at all for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far.</li>
            <li> For that much money, I expected a REAL Tool with Real Power and Serious Implements.  </li>
            <li> Had an old personal model similar to this.</li>
            <li> Just died after 13 months of use which was mainly spring/summer months not much use in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not long on patience, it ended up in the garbage!</li>
            <li> It works but takes a rather long session to complete.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one a few years ago and thought I would replace it.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been in such good shape, especially in the cold seasons.</li>
            <li> I soak mine in Listerine every day which slows down the fungus growth very well.</li>
            <li> (Well, I mean before it actually stops on its own after a few minutes).</li>
            <li> I was able to grind down my thick crusty toe nail and remove all the yellow stains and cracking.</li>
            <li> and while I have no recommendations for any revisions or modifications, we have found this product to be less effective on thick toe nails than we had expected.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for a pedicure as that is difficult for an old gal like me to reach the toes.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my toenails, as I have broken most of my toes on both feet &amp; the nails are thick.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality cheap!</li>
            <li> Tonight I finally decided to use this tool and to my surprise it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to do anything.</li>
            <li> Battery level last a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the flat tool for filing nails; the plastic ridge gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> She expected the standard $19.99 model from the local specialty store.  </li>
            <li> The revolutions are simply not high enough to get rid of callouses.</li>
            <li> It was too expensive and it was a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I would have expected this to last longer bc of the lack of use in the winter.</li>
            <li> I read the instruction manual carefully and finally started charging.</li>
            <li> BUT THE BIG MINUS IS A MOTOR</li>
            <li> It would run as long as you don&#x27;t touch anything with it.</li>
            <li> It does slow down as some say when you press harder which is really not a problem, just light pressure cuts through the thickest nails.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, you can file too far down through your nail to the nail bed before you know it.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t strong enough to use this to file regular nails, so it would make this impossible to use with acrylic nails..</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in my hands that I need to remove with a buffer so I can apply a prescription</li>
            <li> Previously I used a &amp;#34;Nail Dazzler&amp;#34; for over 25 years (yes the same one) however it took over an hour just to file my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I like all the accessories and the ability to use it&#x27;s internal battery (even less power) or plug it in.</li>
            <li> Problem with other manicure kits was the rechargeable battery quitting long before it should.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit and it is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> but this one does not have the power I expected at this price.  </li>
            <li> I expected to use the electric manicure/pedicure kit for my finger and toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Not much power.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent all year.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to send the item back so it won&#x27;t be a waste for the environment, maybe they can fix it and re-sell it as second-hand or something.</li>
            <li> Manicure-pedicure kit with tools does not do the job I had expected.  </li>
            <li> If I could give a minus</li>
            <li> So right now it&#x27;s a piece of useless junk sitting on table.  </li>
            <li> If you press down on the nail even a little bit, the bit stops spinning, even if the unit is plugged into an electric outlet, it just doesn&#x27;t deliver enough torque.  </li>
            <li> Just about what I wanted, does have product information where I can order other attachments.</li>
            <li> I have to change the batteries with those that I have already charged in my other battery charger.</li>
            <li> Runs too fast and hard - hard to control.  </li>
            <li> Only word of caution is to not leave old batteries in it (they corroded and rendered it useless).  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not really worth buying.</li>
            <li> Found out it also works well on rough dead skin on the elbows.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put it down until I finished all my nails .</li>
            <li> ANY LONGER- MY HUSBAND FILES MY TOE NAILS DOWN -</li>
            <li> but it broke down</li>
            <li> I previously had the Medicool TurboFile II device</li>
            <li> This one is definitely not adequate to the task.</li>
            <li> and she was unable to do a decent manicure.</li>
            <li> Extremely weak, low speed, not powerful.</li>
            <li> Then when you need to trim them, the are hard and dry and catch the teeth on the files.</li>
            <li> It is a neat little tool for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy but matches the price.  </li>
            <li> If you put just a little over pressure it will stop.</li>
            <li> So I need to file them around once every 2 days, and if you need to file 10 fingers every 2 days, believe me, it&#x27;s not fun!</li>
            <li> The electric tool is just fine, but the bits are worthless.  </li>
            <li> I am diabetic and am unable to get a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this item.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Would not rate with any stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Then it ran out of charge and went dead, then I noticed I did not get a charging cable with it.  </li>
            <li> For example, one who is usually nervous about something, whatever that something might be, typically bites one&#x27;s nails and if one maintains the appearance of one&#x27;s nails with an Electric Manicure Pedicure Kit, then the sight of \\&quot;nervous nails\\&quot; ought to not be an issue.</li>
            <li> it helps to file down my hard toenails.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be tricky to use, possibly hurting my toes if I held it wrong; I thought it would make a mess</li>
            <li> I have fought with nail fungus for years and found the secret to using something to cut thick nails and to file them down is to use a solution that will dry them out.</li>
            <li> Very little power for the job it was designed to do.  </li>
            <li> The removable battery is a plus, you don&#x27;t have to send it back to replace it when it fails.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Especiall when they are mishapen and hard to clip as mine are.  </li>
            <li> If you press too hard against your nails</li>
            <li> I got it for toe nails, I am a elderly woman and became hard to prop my foot on something to reach, so this solves problem because I can sit and reach my toenails</li>
            <li> Plus, all the accessories you need or at least i do.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this product, as it lacks quality and is NOT durable.  </li>
            <li> but the rpm sucks.</li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> and I use it at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> My husband has thick toenails and it is a lot of work to keep them trimmed.</li>
            <li> keep them from being so thick.  </li>
            <li> Attachments are very small and need replacements.  </li>
            <li> No good as a Pedicure Kit or my toe nails are too tough.</li>
            <li> She is elderly and her toenails are very thick.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother who has very thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The nail buffer tool came broken.  </li>
            <li> All those qualities make impossible to do anything with nails and dead skin around.</li>
            <li> I have tried other electric manicure/pedicure sets and been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I am a little disappointed</li>
            <li> If you are needing to file very thick nails or artificial nails</li>
            <li> Replacement bits were insanely expensive.  </li>
            <li> Grinding tool became useless after 2 uses and was ineffectual.</li>
            <li> Just assumed it would be useless since I didn&#x27;t remember when I received it, or who to contact.</li>
            <li> Impossible to use like this.</li>
            <li> ugly that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not do without this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> buyer beware; :-(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it was worthless after that.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in it</li>
            <li> This was a vicious circle.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>

            <li> It work ok but not at well as I hoped. My husband has thick toenails and it is a lot of work to keep them trimmed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for several weeks, and I LOVE IT! Previously I used a &amp;#34;Nail Dazzler&amp;#34; for over 25 years (yes the same one) however it took over an hour just to file my fingernails. This tool will quickly, powerfully and accurately file and shape nails in seconds. To be honest, I purchased a costly &amp;#34;pet nail filer&amp;#34; and this things works 100% better on the Yorkie&#x27;s toenails than the expensive pet tool. So I highly recommend this product for you and your &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; family.</li>
            <li> Excellent  I am very happy with with this product. I couldn&#x27;t put it down until I finished all my nails .</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in my hands that I need to remove with a buffer so I can apply a prescription cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail salon I go to, uses a similar machine quickly but this one does not have the power I expected at this price.  I&#x27;m sure buying a Black and Decker or  a Dremel 687-01 52-Piece General Purpose Rotary Tool , much cheaper, would have done the job efficiently.  Also, they can be found at Home Depot or any place for hobbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emery barrels included with this Body Toolz was not even the correct size. Included was a list to call to buy extra disposable stuff needed at a high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I used it I cannot return it.  Disappointed.  Getting the Dremel.</li>
            <li> Did not have the proper attachments for a pedicure. Lost charge quickly. IO had to do pedicure/manicure in stages while waiting for the tool to recharge-definitely inferior to Dremel.</li>
            <li> Great tools.  I had a small battery operated set previously, but this unit is so good.  Lots of power and it actually works to smooth my gel nails between fills. Great kit...would make a good gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit and it is a huge disappointment.  They included two of one type of file for acrylic nails that I can&#x27;t use and omitted the one I could use for natural nails.  After no less than 6 phone calls, waiting on hold, calling manufacturer and amazon, many emails and promises, I still do not have the missing piece I paid for.  buyer beware; :-(</li>
            <li> Works very well for manicure or pedicure. Battery level last a long time. Love all the attachments.</li>
            <li> This is a real life-saver!  I can keep my nails in good shape now.</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;ve been trying similar products for many years and find that the battery operated manicure products are just no good at all for me.  I may as well use an emery board.  This product, while not very strong, is good and does the job quickly.  My problem is enlarged toe nails that can only be cut by a podiatrist.  Using this product over several times solved everything, and I now don&#x27;t have to hide my toenails.  merrilyninforesthills     pussycats2@verizon.net</li>
            <li> For that much money, I expected a REAL Tool with Real Power and Serious Implements.  This is a toy!</li>
            <li> Having attractive nails is important, both socially and professionally important because the attractiveness, or lack there-of, of one nails is tremendously indicative as to one&#x27;s mental and emotional state-of-mind. For example, one who is usually nervous about something, whatever that something might be, typically bites one&#x27;s nails and if one maintains the appearance of one&#x27;s nails with an Electric Manicure Pedicure Kit, then the sight of \\&quot;nervous nails\\&quot; ought to not be an issue.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and was hoping for a tool to make pedicures easier. This tool is not as powerful as I  had hoped.</li>
            <li> The device seems to be well designed and well built and while I have no recommendations for any revisions or modifications, we have found this product to be less effective on thick toe nails than we had expected.</li>
            <li> My Nail Genie Junior lost is old as the hills and I lost some bits.  Replacement bits were insanely expensive.  So i got this and what a value.  No cord to get in the way.  Comes with a bunch of attachments and replacement bits.  Powerful for little drill.  I have made myself bleed a couple of times.  Bought this to fight toe nail fungus and I&#x27;m finally winning the battle by keeping the nail filed down and letting the medicine really soak in.  Threw the Nail Genie Junior away for good.</li>
            <li> I expected to use the electric manicure/pedicure kit for my finger and toe nails.  I am 67 years old, and doing my nails is not easy any more.  This product worked but required alot more time to do finger nails than it did with clippers and nail file.  Forget about it doing any kind of job in trimming toe nails; even filing seemed to take a much longer time.  It needs more speed and better/stronger filing tools to get the job done in less than an afternoon.</li>
            <li> The product does not perform the functions it was created for. Extremely weak, low speed, not powerful. All those qualities make impossible to do anything with nails and dead skin around. The price is good, but it is waste of your money. I had already returned my product.</li>
            <li> Reviewed this product earlier when first received and gave a good review then , with proviso added that it does require a firm push to place the attachment in ---having truly got used to that , would not be without it now!&lt;br /&gt;It really is an excellent product and does all anyone would need for &amp;#34; a File Maintenance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this about a year ago and it worked great....but now it does not hold a charge at all and is not usable.</li>
            <li> I prefer a darker lead</li>
            <li> Not really that great for pedicures but more for manicures. I was really looking for something that didn&#x27;t need replacement heads too often but that is not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, had so much fun playing nail salon with my granddaughter.  All the parts were very easy to use and pretty inexpensive to re-order  new parts when I need them.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with my purchase. The ad said it was electric and it is actually battery powered. Tried it and wish I had not purchased it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough power to accomplish anything.  I ended up having to use my dremel, and that works great.</li>
            <li> I kind of......ohh.........I&#x27;m old and thought I can do my toe nails by myself.&lt;br /&gt;I think I better stay with going to get them done.</li>
            <li> The accessory attachments would not stay in the device after two or three uses.  Grinding tool became useless after 2 uses and was ineffectual.</li>
            <li> I REALLY ENJOY USING THIS BODY TOOL FOR MANICURE &amp; PEDICURES, IT HELPS A LOT.</li>
            <li> Could use a little more torque, but seems to work well so far.  Did my wife a nice pedicure and it worked good.</li>
            <li> This nail kit is the BOMB!</li>
            <li> I AM HANDICAPPED- CAN&#x27;T CUT MY NAILS ANY LONGER- MY HUSBAND FILES MY TOE NAILS DOWN - AND I FILE MY FINGERNAILS DOWN- AM SO HAPPY WITH MY PEDICURE SET--THANK YOU VERY MUCH-MRS. DELORES ROSENKILDE</li>
            <li> Had previously used this product and loved it.  This was a replacement and works just as well.  Only word of caution is to not leave old batteries in it (they corroded and rendered it useless).  Totally my issue and not the fault of this product.  Keeps my tootsies looking great!</li>
            <li> I have a similar product, not from the same company. Mine is electric with a cord, not batteries. It does slow down as some say when you press harder which is really not a problem, just light pressure cuts through the thickest nails. I have fought with nail fungus for years and found the secret to using something to cut thick nails and to file them down is to use a solution that will dry them out. I soak mine in Listerine every day which slows down the fungus growth very well. Then when you need to trim them, the are hard and dry and catch the teeth on the files. Great product. Don&#x27;t know what I would do without mine.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product.  Good price for what it does.  Don&#x27;t care for the flat tool for filing nails; the plastic ridge gets in the way.  But I bought it mainly for pedicures anyway and the rest of the tools work fine.  Problem with other manicure kits was the rechargeable battery quitting long before it should.  Hope this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Used it for first time after plugging in for about 7 hours and it was powerful.  Much more powerful than I thought it would be.  I used it to clean up my cuticles before polishing my nails and it did a great job.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this one rather than the ones sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li> Good tool for the toenails.  Especiall when they are mishapen and hard to clip as mine are.  I am glad I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my hands clean and my nails both clean and neat.  I do almost all of the cooking In our two person, two cat family.Therefore, I insist on cleanliness in myself and my kitchen.  Before tools, It took an inordinately amount of time to do my fingernails. With toolz, I not only substantially reduce the time required to trim them, but it is also fun to use.</li>
            <li> I think it works very well. Does what it said it will do. If something would happen to this I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other electric manicure/pedicure sets and been disappointed.  This one works well.  It has enough power to really file your nails, even your toe nails.  It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t strong enough to use this to file regular nails, so it would make this impossible to use with acrylic nails..</li>
            <li> This works well, but I had hoped for a better buffer.  Maybe I just haven&#x27;t used it enough to be comfortable with it.  It is a neat little tool for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Got the power and works as advertized. Plus, all the accessories you need or at least i do. I tried the corded one but his is much lighter and just as powerful with a long life charge. Use if for my nails and in between my toes. Most definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This electric manicure pedicure kit is a great tool for shaping up fingernails and toenails.  It comes with 6 attachments for shaping nails, smoothing nail surfaces and edges and a circular brush for applying creams and removing nail polish.  Since I have been using this kit, my nails are in much better shape and have not split like they had been doing in the past.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this item. Just about what I wanted, does have product information where I can order other attachments. Very happy</li>
            <li> I have a small callous on the side of my foot in this worked exceptionally well! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be, although handy tools and gentler than my nail file, need to use it on a regular basis to get the best effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and love it.  Just bought 3 more for my daughters.  A little steep, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My wife being from Europe,is really into foot care,so I thought I&#x27;d buy her one.Save your money!!She hates it!! The revolutions are simply not high enough to get rid of callouses.It&#x27;s probably fine for fingernails,but not for stubborn foot callouses.It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Cut my pedicure time by more than half.  Love the fact you can use battery power or plug cord directly into the unit.  Good variety of tools to use.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife after she had requested one for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She expected the standard $19.99 model from the local specialty store.  She is delighted with this kit.  Much more powerful and versatile than her past kits.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have never had a pedicure before.  However, problems with my feet led me to try using this tool.  I am very impressed with it  I thought it would be tricky to use, possibly hurting my toes if I held it wrong; I thought it would make a mess and there would be powdered stuff all over my floor; and I wondered if it would really do that much.  All my concerns were not needed.  The tool is very easy to use, gentle and easy to hold in position, and there was in fact NO powdered stuff left.  It is great and I&#x27;m sure it will help me to smooth out the calluses and uneven toenails on my feet.  It is very well worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the things the wife wanted for Christmas.  She was very pleased and it does exactly as expected.  It being cordless and all the attachments are real nice.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with this purchase it works great.</li>
            <li> like the product, looks like is not gonna fall apart easily. maybe a little bit more of power and maybe another tool would make it a close-to-a perfect product.</li>
            <li> I have had a fungus under my toe nails  and treated with medication. Podiatry visits were every three months. I purchased this set and was able to file my nails down.  I now am able to wear sandles and nail poilish; which I couldn&#x27;t do for over twenty years!</li>
            <li> Easy to use tool for handling those thick toenails. Compact and easy to use for normal upkeep on toenails that are a little harder to cut with a normal toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> I received this for a Christmas gift. I have debated for a long time whether to ask for one or not; I am glad I did! It does the job, however, I did proceed with caution as to not over use and end up with shorter finger nails than I wanted, ha! I comes with enough accessories to be more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> One of the most easily used and convenient tools I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to purchase a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;however, this one works decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Good enough to get my feet through this summer!</li>
            <li> The kit was purchased to take care of an elderly persons feet that had been neglected. The tip recommended for use on fake nails worked best for this application. Overall we are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The filing pieces will not remain in the unit, that is they keep falling out. Impossible to use like this. Junking the unit.</li>
            <li> I had one similar to this one before.  It lasted for about 12 years.  It took a lot of use.  I like that my new one is  cordless.</li>
            <li> This device works really well. I started using Karsal on my toe nails but still needed to reduce the thickness. of them. This device is easy to control and has more than enough power. Found out it also works well on rough dead skin on the elbows. When you hit the good skin it does not remove that, only the hard dead skin. Highly recommend this device for the price.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and I enjoy using the various attachments supplied. It is almost like having a manicurist in your home.  It did meed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be good for heavy, thick toenails but no go.  There&#x27;s not enough torque.  If you press down on the nail even a little bit, the bit stops spinning, even if the unit is plugged into an electric outlet, it just doesn&#x27;t deliver enough torque.  Works okay on fingernails.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.It has plenty of power for her needs and she uses it on both her fingernails and her toe nails it comes with all the tools a she needs.</li>
            <li> Since March 2012, I have had no problems with my toe nails. I use to suffer from ingrown toe nails. The Podiatrist would cut my nails straight across. When the nails grew they would inbed into my flesh and cause me infection and lots of pain. Surgery was then performed and I would have to take antibiotics and have more pain. This was a vicious circle.&lt;br /&gt;With this product I have been able to file and round the edges of my toe nails. I used the slimmest bit. I have also file the top of the nails keeping them fairly healthy looking(not ugly that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not do without this product. Would you please tell me where to get extra quality tools as they are called. I call them bits.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I omitted one great reason to buy this product. I would have much pain when the doc clipped my toe nails. With this great little machine, I have had no pain. I am in control.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Fabulous for a pedicure as that is difficult for an old gal like me to reach the toes.</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  I can do my nails professionally from home....love it.  This kit has everything needed to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great little machine! Does the job.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power...I had a similar tool many years ago and it was great...but this one just doesn&#x27;t compare..&lt;br /&gt;Sorry...</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This product was in my price range.&lt;br /&gt;The power and tools met the needs, that I purchase this product for.&lt;br /&gt;This product is superior to similar Electric Manicure Pedicure kits that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I had a manicure set for 35 years.  It was from a country in Europe.  I loved it.  This one is similar.  I use it quite frequently.  So far, I love it.  And it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not much power.  It works but takes a rather long session to complete.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much bough one for my mother</li>
            <li> This is a good product but I wish it had a little more power. If you press too hard against your nails it stops. I like all the accessories and the ability to use it&#x27;s internal battery (even less power) or plug it in.</li>
            <li> Really good except i lost the rotator circular file within a few days. It went flying off somewhere.</li>
            <li> This works very well not as well as a manicurist but just fine for me</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Enough power for my toenails. Be careful though, you can file too far down through your nail to the nail bed before you know it.</li>
            <li> It works ok but could be a little more powerful.I think it is more for a manicure since the attachments are small.</li>
            <li> Good quality and seems to do the job. The removable battery is a plus, you don&#x27;t have to send it back to replace it when it fails.</li>
            <li> For the price it does a pretty darn good job.</li>
            <li> It was a present - my Mom likes it - I think it needs more power</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and several for Christmas presents last year.  I have no feedback from the family, but I really like mine.</li>
            <li> The electric tool is just fine, but the bits are worthless.  I used the fingernail bit once and it was worthless after that.  Better to get a Dremel and use their bits.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality cheap! don not buy you are better off spending more for better quality! I wish I would have returned it when I had the chance</li>
            <li> Xmas present for brother don&#x27;t know if he used it or not but he sure needs to with them feet</li>
            <li> It was too expensive and it was a cheap product. It was worth $15 to me, thanks for asking, I would&#x27;ve payed much more for a better product to satisfy my need for it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made; flimsy; any pressure, any time you trry to actually use it,  device falls apart; don&#x27;t waste your money; it&#x27;s in the garbage</li>
            <li> Really love this great gadgit. Makes taking care of my toe nails so much easier between going to the doctor. Also great for fingernails, but have to becareful not to press to hard or will take off more than you want.</li>
            <li> I previously had the Medicool TurboFile II device but it broke down so I decided to purchase this one as a replacement. The device does work, but it is nowhere near as powerful as the Medicool device. For harder nails, the increased friction from applying increased pressure easily (and constantly) stops the head from spinning; it simply does not possess the high torque of other devices. I would recommend this product only for light tasks.</li>
            <li> Incredible tool set.  Best money I&#x27;ve spent all year.  I am diabetic and am unable to get a professional pedicure.  I was able to complete a self pedicure in 45 minutes and my feet look great.  It runs very fast too.  I would recommend this set to anyone...!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT little tool!  Wish I had known about it years ago.  Would recommend its use to anyone.</li>
            <li> Freaking amazing accessory for doing my pedicures!  Omgoodness,  my toes look fabulous and this cut down the time to do them in half and honestly made them look more precision. This item paid for itself with the first use! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and was as described, but when my wife tried to use it, the power of the rotary tool was pretty low and she was unable to do a decent manicure.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Works well, easy to use and maneuver. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It was to powerful for me but would be ok for men&#x27;s toenails.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible work horse.  It runs powerfully and beautifully every time.  I use this on my mother&#x27;s toenails.  She is elderly and her toenails are very thick.  This machine not only keeps those nails trim but I also use it across the entire tops of each nail&lt;br /&gt;to keep them from being so thick.  Vibration is very low, she never complains of discomfort.  I like this machine so much I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;purchased a 2nd one to have as back up but haven&#x27;t needed it yet.  The first one I believe is 3 years old and is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived on time, in excellent conditiion, item was packaged well.</li>
            <li> This product is very elementary and has no power behind it to do any kind of pedicure job.  I was very disappointed in it, it looked good, but is certainly NOT anywhere near a professional tool and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very useful.. Working pretty fine until now</li>
            <li> This product could use a little more power but for the price it seems to work fine.  If you are needing to file very thick nails or artificial nails I am not sure this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time this past weekend and was delighted with the results.  I try to pamper myself every weekend with a home manicure and pedicure and with this product I was able to achieve very professional results!</li>
            <li> Gift works well from what I&#x27;m told</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to my son, I have one and He always wanted it one alike, He was really Happy when He open His package and so it</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this product, as it lacks quality and is NOT durable.  Attachments are very small and need replacements.  Very little power for the job it was designed to do.  Since I&#x27;m not long on patience, it ended up in the garbage!</li>
            <li> Had to go to the Podiatrist for my nails, they were a mess and he suggested I get a pedicure kit and this one is GREAT...I can keep my tooties looking good and healthy...............highly recommend it............for anyone..it does fingernails also and helps if&lt;br /&gt;you have ingrown toenails........................</li>
            <li> This is a great help, bought it as I had surgery on my right hand and could not cut my own fingernails or toenails.  This is a great tool and I find it very helpful.  I also have my son using it and he likes it too!</li>
            <li> Had an old personal model similar to this. This one is better due to the recharging stand and all the attachements. More than I expected. Using it is easy.</li>
            <li> No good as a Pedicure Kit or my toe nails are too tough. Wasted my money on this item. Ray B.</li>
            <li> works great on me and my pets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far. I bought this mainly for my toenails, as I have broken most of my toes on both feet &amp; the nails are thick. So this works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to have at your finger tips, pun intended.  It is very helpful in smooth skin around the nail and shaping.  It&#x27;s a little flimsy but matches the price.  The nail buffer tool came broken.  But all the other tips work great.  I will ask the company to send another tip.  It&#x27;s wonderful for pedicure at home as well.</li>
            <li> The Body Toolz Manicure Kit is very unique and its not too small to use.  Its the right size to hold in your hand an work with.  It wasn&#x27;t to expensive but very good to work with.  Ms Patricia A. Harris</li>
            <li> Runs too fast and hard - hard to control.  Need something more gentle for my fingernails.  I was looking for a nail buffer.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase. After I acquaint myself with this tool, I am sure it will prove to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> got  my order very quickly with no damages already tried all attachments and they work very good&lt;br /&gt;, just what I needed</li>
            <li> Good. Use it occasionally when needed</li>
            <li> works great, batteries last awhile on one charge</li>
            <li> I love my body tools. I was able to grind down my thick crusty toe nail and remove all the yellow stains and cracking. Now my wife will let me play footsey with her again. Whoa</li>
            <li> Containes rechargeable batteries that must be replaced. No replacements offered.</li>
            <li> I do my own toes with this...may not hold up over one year but pays for itself in 1st month!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother who has very thick toe nails. Works very well and has a nice selection of drill heads and sanders.</li>
            <li> Works great. I recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an electric home manicure/pedicure set that has enough power to deal with callouses.  It seems they don&#x27;t exist.  This one is definitely not adequate to the task.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for medicures and pedicures. Same tools the podiatrist uses. Safe for diabetes to use. Now I can do my nails at home and get the same results as the salons.</li>
            <li> this makes the job easier</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit, no more nail salons for me in the summertime. My feet and nails stay done. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I was very impressed with it, nails and feet always look like a professional done it.!</li>
            <li> Just died after 13 months of use which was mainly spring/summer months not much use in the winter.  I would have expected this to last longer bc of the lack of use in the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a good manicure in Kona without an appointment and that doesn&#x27;t work for my lifestyle.  This kit allows me to give myself manicures that are so professional I don&#x27;t bother with salon manicures anymore.</li>
            <li> Buy something more powerful.It does the job but the rpm sucks.If you put just a little over pressure it will stop. Not really worth buying.Trust me look else where.This unit is cheaply made but better than nothing. The only way to find out is buy it like me,that&#x27;s the only way you will know if that is what you are looking for. You can use it plugged in or without. The real good one is from Bed,Bath ,and Beyond ,that has power.I will be buying that one again. It&#x27;s the case that opens and closes,it almost looks like a sea shell and in back the machine spot  is there,like the area for where you put the machine and that will burn you if you don&#x27;t know how to use it. Can&#x27;t think of the brand name. Good luck</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I wish it had a little more power but seemed to work pretty well the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not enough power for pedicure. Gave it away after first try. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Would not rate with any stars if I could.</li>
            <li> This product does not charge at all and can you believe it I have to change the batteries with those that I have already charged in my other battery charger. it sucks.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little manicure/pedicure set but I had rather have more attachments.  However, they can be purchased separately.  However, this one is okay for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I got it for toe nails, I am a elderly woman and became hard to prop my foot on something to reach, so this solves problem because I can sit and reach my toenails</li>
            <li> I got one for myself several years ago.  Every time I went to use it, one of my girls had it.  Over the past 2 years I have purchased 3 more for my daughters.  Mine is finally losing power, so I just ordered myself a new one.  It is a great price and I use it at least once a week.  For less than the cost of one manicure or pedicure it is a great investment.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my hard nails and where clips won&#x27;t get into tight places.  Very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> i like this product but I am a little disappointed, I thought that it would have been more powerful but.</li>
            <li> I am like many others that have read the reviews of this product. Some say its a good product, some say it&#x27;s totally rubbish and do not even work. I&#x27;m one of those that decided to take the plunge. I received my products 2 days later than expected, Amazon offered a partial refund for the shipping, so that was ok. The parcel was nicely wrapped and everything seems to be in order. I read the instruction manual carefully and finally started charging. The first thing I noticed is that the LED light that supposed to light up when charging didn&#x27;t, so I thought, ok, if its just an LED problem, I can stand.  I charged for over 24 hours before first use, then tried it, it worked, for about 2 minutes and it died. I then charged for another 2 days, it worked! For about 30sec! So, I ended up contacting Amazon and they offered me a full refund including shipping. I wanted to send the item back so it won&#x27;t be a waste for the environment, maybe they can fix it and re-sell it as second-hand or something. But no, they just asked me to dispose it myself. So ok, now I&#x27;m left with a drill that does not work lying on my table, so I thought, yes, the product is faulty, but what is actually the problem? So I tried buying replacement rechargeable batteries from my local electronics shop (make sure u read the instruction manual carefully and replace the correct type), and started charging for 24 hours, then magic! It worked! For real this time. I mainly use this to drill file my nails, as I need to play the piano, I need to keep my nails short, well, virtually none! So I need to file them around once every 2 days, and if you need to file 10 fingers every 2 days, believe me, it&#x27;s not fun! So this drill, not saying it&#x27;s perfect or fantastic, but at least no more sore hands with the repetitive filing action. Yes, the rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t cheap, but you can always use it on other electronics. So luckily for me, the problem is with the rechargeable batteries from the factory and not withthe actual drill. So if you are one of those people like me and can&#x27;t resist buying this drill, AND if you are one of those unlucky ones like me who received a faulty one, you may like to try replacing the rechargeable batteries! The 3 stars are for the drill when it worked and great customer service from Amazon, the minus 2 stars are for the nonetheless faulty product.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. The drill with the faulty battery in, seems like its turning, but it has absolutely no power and definitely cannot file anything, not even the softest nails, it just stops whenever you place your nails anywhere near it. (Well, I mean before it actually stops on its own after a few minutes). It only actually started drilling/filing with new replacement batteries! Those of you who have received a \\&quot;weak\\&quot; drill may like to try replacing batteries too. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t really tell you about it as it was a gift for someone else.i guess I could get back to you later but I guess it okay this what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Can get hot sometimes and the friction causes heat that leads to smoke, but you just need to be aware.</li>
            <li> thought was a good product to start, didn&#x27;t use it for a while just sparingly use.  Then it ran out of charge and went dead, then I noticed I did not get a charging cable with it.  So right now it&#x27;s a piece of useless junk sitting on table.  never tried to contact anyone about no charger.  Just assumed it would be useless since I didn&#x27;t remember when I received it, or who to contact.</li>
            <li> Manicure-pedicure kit with tools does not do the job I had expected.  It comes with varied and easy to use tools.  It&#x27;s easy to store in the drawers and/or closet in my bathroom.  The electric cord plugs in conveniently.  The color is quite attractive. And the price is right.  All plus factors.  BUT THE BIG MINUS IS A MOTOR WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF POWER TO DO THE JOB. *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 10 or more years ago, my late husband bought me a manicure set from the Frontgate catalogue.  It is still going strong, but the tools, though well-made, are not as varied as my new one.  Is there any way you could convince the manufacturer to &amp;#34;rev up the motor?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to use for my son&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> It did not work for me the power was very week and it was very short life of electricity. It only used it was within two minutes it was too unuseful.  I need to return it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product maybe a year ago and it has completely stopped working.  The charging mechanism broke in the first month so had to plug it in while using it.  Now that doesn&#x27;t work.  I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one a few years ago and thought I would replace it.  Do I like the product? You bet I do!</li>
            <li> good price! as advertised.  for people who like doing nails</li>
            <li> work OK could be stronger.</li>
            <li> Great! My nails have never been in such good shape, especially in the cold seasons.</li>
            <li> It works good only at certain angles. The top falls off if you try to hold it up side down.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!! Shipping was quick!!</li>
            <li> If I could give a minus I would. Tonight I finally decided to use this tool and to my surprise it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to do anything. If I applied any pressure to my nail this machine would die out. It would run as long as you don&#x27;t touch anything with it. Save your money. I am so disappointed. I threw the box away so I can&#x27;t return it. That&#x27;s $40.00 in the trash.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ma loving this</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as we thought it should be .</li>
            <li> This Product is very good. it helps to file down my hard toenails. Its nice to get a product that can Manicure Hard Toenails. Thank you Body Toolz Electric. Pearl.</li>
            <li> very nice and powerful</li>
            <li> Wife loves since it is wireless and very easy to replace wheels.</li>
            <li> I have used this with my manicures and pedicures at home. It is easy to use. I like the cord-free handle.</li>
            <li> very useful tool ,and not just for me but my wife love it  sometime we have to take turns or my wife want to do my nails :)</li>
            <li> Excellent solution for thinning or shortening thick toenails.  The little emery bands work best for my man&#x27;s nails but the easiest way to replace the band is to peel it off like a spiral using needle nosed pliers.  Saves a lot of time and aggravation using a file or emery board manually.  Replacement emery bands are available separately and rather inexpensively elsewhere on Amazon (found 100 for about $2).</li>
