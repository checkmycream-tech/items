    <ol>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of ways to do my eyebrows myself and this product seems the best.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It was perfect</li>

            <li>These strips work great.</li>
            <li>This works great for eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>obviously lol)</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT FOLKS...</li>
            <li>You warm the strips between your hands to heat up the wax, pull the strips apart, so you have 2 of them, press it on your skin, pull it off, and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>recommends it.&lt;br /&gt;Creams it&#x27;s over for me, it burns the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Result much better whit this product, great!</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would and the price is awesome</li>
            <li>I am delighted to stop giving away my money to the salon.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used my hair dryer to warm it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil included is nice for soothing and removing residue.</li>
            <li>I detach a strip, warm it up by rubbing the strip between my hands.</li>
            <li>This product is so spectacular I have to tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li>STILL the best product I have tried for removing unwanted hair cheaply and quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to trim the strips before you warm them to get a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice, just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find anything better than these it seems.</li>
            <li>I was also able to trim the wax strips to the appropriate size needed.</li>
            <li>I found that holding the strip against the light bulb on my vanity warmed it nicely.</li>
            <li>I could probably get better results.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it between your hands to heat it up well.</li>
            <li>These probably just work better on some peopler than on others.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Good price, always get it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other wax removers, but this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>people having problems with the wax sticking to their face make sure you warm the strips enough.</li>
            <li>i bought this because it looked to be more gentle since it isn&#x27;t heated in microwave.</li>
            <li>This product does almost as good a job on my upper lip and face as  the salon does.</li>
            <li>The plastic didn&#x27;t work very well, the cloth wax strips are much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised nobody has thought to use a hair dryer to warm their strips..???</li>
            <li>a loyal fan and ol&#x27; Sally Hansen won&#x27;t ever discontinue it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my upper lip only and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>This particular Sally Hansen wax strip is the absolute hands down best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the wax that you warm up in the microwave.</li>
            <li>You simply put it on your hands and rub your hands together to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li>I used my blow dryer on low heat to warm the wax strip.</li>
            <li>I could only stomach that for 1 try, so now that I&#x27;m more comfortable with them</li>
            <li>No mess- easy clean up.</li>
            <li>The strips are portable, clear, quick and easy to place, and always take that hair away.  </li>
            <li>oil in every box takes any residue right off.</li>
            <li>This pulled my skin off, and wasn&#x27;t even the right size for an eyebrow.</li>
            <li>I just went online to treat myself to some of the necessities and this was one of the first things on my list.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly how it says it does.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as hot wax depilatories - I had to use a tweezer to remove stray hairs</li>
            <li>In recent years, it has not been easy to find in the store</li>
            <li>I do not like it for eyebrows, though-not accurate enough.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind except for the hair under my chin.</li>
            <li>It tends to grow fast when I aunt flo comes to visit.</li>
            <li>I always use this product for light facial hair.</li>
            <li>Pull fast, don&#x27;t hesitate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine gave me one of these kits since she felt it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Simply rubbing the strips between your hands does not get the wax warm enough.</li>
            <li>My friend thought they were great, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li>Very convenient no mess product.</li>
            <li>The strips are a little big, but as long as you have a great pair of scissors that is easily fixed!</li>
            <li>They work great on facial hair, I have tried it on my bikini area as well with poor results.</li>
            <li>If you read the directions, it is really important to hold the wax strip in your hands for several minutes to heat it up to body temperature, you then pull the strip apart and apply it to the facial hair area you want to wax, rub in the correct direction, and pull up the strip.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this worked, and sometimes it just pulled my skin and made say ouch.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all and this kit gives the exact same results that the Nair used to.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get hot enough to pull anything off.</li>
            <li>I had to cut them down to fit.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised off the result, it works like a charm</li>
            <li>Success was definitely more likely if you held the strip long enough to warm it really well, but it was still hit and miss.&lt;br /&gt;The strips aren&#x27;t messy and there is not chance you could burn yourself or have hot spattered wax anywhere - but it can still be painful and ineffective.  </li>
            <li>The last reviewer was right to try this b/c it avoids the mess of heating wax and potential for burning, but not only that, it works and very rarely causes ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with an after gel to use after the wax to calm down your pores.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been fighting facial hair for my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li>So thank you to online retailers for making this one available and typically 2 to 3 dollars less than in stores.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this very version of Sally Hansen wax strips for at least 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> I tore at least a third of my eyebrow off because the strips are not narrow enough.</li>
            <li> There are multiple sized strips in the box, but I&#x27;m assuming I can cut them down, seeing as I only use them for my lip.</li>
            <li> Fold one half of the strip onto itself for later use and wax one side of my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I kept finding this other product by Sally Hansen that is not the same!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other at home wax kits, this is definitely the easiest.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions and keep waxing the same area, you will experience skin loss and other adverse effects.</li>
            <li> uhh no thanks</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, so extra hair is a part of my everyday life.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with those eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Now I need to find someone to give all these other wax kits to.</li>
            <li> I use the other half on the other side and voila......</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product years ago because when I would get my eyebrows professionally done, they always made them too thin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust any other brand of wax strips!</li>
            <li> There are a LOT of strips in this box and it cost me less than $8.</li>
            <li> Pull the skin tight after the strip is applied and hold it as you remove the strip.</li>
            <li> But it is not for those who cannot stand a little pain.</li>
            <li> They work, but can leave a little bit of a sticky film</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin but can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works...</li>
            <li> and it wasnt messy.</li>
            <li> felt like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Have used it, but not sure it will work for repeated use.  </li>
            <li> Sadly this stuff will not did not remove my facial hair (eyebrow).  </li>
            <li> a little awkward and messy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also left a residue that was impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> A waste of money and time, useless!</li>
            <li> So another useless product.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because I don&#x27;t trust salons to wax my eye brows. The strips are a little big, but as long as you have a great pair of scissors that is easily fixed!</li>
            <li> i bought this because it looked to be more gentle since it isn&#x27;t heated in microwave. it didn&#x27;t burn my skin-it adhered to it and removed the skin itself when peeled off. also left a residue that was impossible to remove. save your money on this one. i am still healing my wounds.</li>
            <li> It says to grow out the hair for like 21 days....uhh no thanks haha. but i guess if you had longer hair it will work.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of ways to do my eyebrows myself and this product seems the best. I cut out the shape that I want and apply above my eyebrow and below. It works for me.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product.  I tried it twice, just to be sure.  Both times, even though I followed the directions and used the azulene finishing oil, my upper lip was left with sticky residue.  I&#x27;m going back to the wax that you warm up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, so extra hair is a part of my everyday life. I don&#x27;t really mind except for the hair under my chin. It tends to grow fast when I aunt flo comes to visit. These strips work great. You simply put it on your hands and rub your hands together to warm up the wax. Peel the strip, and you now have to wax strips to use. That is enough for the job I need, so this box tends to  last me months. It also comes with an after gel to use after the wax to calm down your pores. I don&#x27;t trust any other brand of wax strips!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen hair removing wax strips work. But it is not for those who cannot stand a little pain.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I know what I am talking about when it comes to the nuisance, embarassment, shame, etc. of unwanted hair.  This product makes dealing w/it tolerable.  I have been using this very version of Sally Hansen wax strips for at least 10 years now.  Today is my 40th birthday and I&#x27;ve been fighting facial hair for my entire adult life.  I just went online to treat myself to some of the necessities and this was one of the first things on my list.  In recent years, it has not been easy to find in the store and I thought it was being discontinued.  I kept finding this other product by Sally Hansen that is not the same!  So thank you to online retailers for making this one available and typically 2 to 3 dollars less than in stores.  As you might imagine, I&#x27;ve tried everything from electrolysis to laser, and salon waxing to home waxing.  This particular Sally Hansen wax strip is the absolute hands down best.  The last reviewer was right to try this b/c it avoids the mess of heating wax and potential for burning, but not only that, it works and very rarely causes ingrown hairs.  I have never had them take my skin off and the azulene (sp?) oil in every box takes any residue right off. The strips are portable, clear, quick and easy to place, and always take that hair away.  Please try it out so you too become a loyal fan and ol&#x27; Sally Hansen won&#x27;t ever discontinue it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE in July 2013.  STILL the best product I have tried for removing unwanted hair cheaply and quickly.</li>
            <li> I always use this product for light facial hair. Good price, always get it right away. And it works! I&#x27;ve tried other wax removers, but this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Pulled my skin off, I pluck my brows and have had them waxed before. This pulled my skin off, and wasn&#x27;t even the right size for an eyebrow. I had to cut them down to fit.</li>
            <li> It does what its suppose to. But I no longer use this to wax my eyebrows or upper lip since waxing causes skin irritation. Last time I used this it caused acne all around my eyebrow and upper lip area! It looked so embarrassing and took a week to start fading away! I will stick to threading instead.</li>
            <li> Works exactly how it says it does. Very convenient no mess product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find anything better than these it seems. Too harsh for my skin but can&#x27;t seem to find anything that works...</li>
            <li> This kit worked as described.  You follow the directions and remove the unwanted hair.  It served it&#x27;s purpose for the value.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as hot wax depilatories - I had to use a tweezer to remove stray hairs</li>
            <li> This works great for eyebrow waxing. I used my blow dryer on low heat to warm the wax strip. I was also able to trim the wax strips to the appropriate size needed. No mess- easy clean up.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> They work, but can leave a little bit of a sticky film</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem to work.  I tried to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product years ago because when I would get my eyebrows professionally done, they always made them too thin. Simply rubbing the strips between your hands does not get the wax warm enough. I found that holding the strip against the light bulb on my vanity warmed it nicely. (low wattage and with the strips un-separated obviously lol) I&#x27;ve also used my hair dryer to warm it. Also, be sure to trim the strips before you warm them to get a nice smooth edge. They work great on facial hair, I have tried it on my bikini area as well with poor results. I could only stomach that for 1 try, so now that I&#x27;m more comfortable with them I could probably get better results. I&#x27;ve tried other at home wax kits, this is definitely the easiest.&lt;br /&gt;For people having problems with the wax sticking to their face make sure you warm the strips enough. Pull the skin tight after the strip is applied and hold it as you remove the strip. Pull fast, don&#x27;t hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;The oil included is nice for soothing and removing residue.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s terrible I should just say.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit is wonderful! (: It was really easy to use and it wasnt messy. It was perfect</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a wax kit since Nair Fruit wax was discontinued. I have tried them all and this kit gives the exact same results that the Nair used to. I use this for my upper lip only and it works perfectly. I detach a strip, warm it up by rubbing the strip between my hands. Fold one half of the strip onto itself for later use and wax one side of my upper lip. It gets all of the hair in one pass. I use the other half on the other side and voila......ladystache is history. I don&#x27;t experience any redness or swelling. If you don&#x27;t follow the directions and keep waxing the same area, you will experience skin loss and other adverse effects. I am delighted to stop giving away my money to the salon. Now I need to find someone to give all these other wax kits to. (AAF, 34y/o)</li>
            <li> This product does almost as good a job on my upper lip and face as  the salon does. I do not like it for eyebrows, though-not accurate enough. Make sure you rub it between your hands to heat it up well.</li>
            <li> The plastic didn&#x27;t work very well, the cloth wax strips are much better. I got these ones because I couldn&#x27;t find the cloth ones.</li>
            <li> A waste of money and time, useless!</li>
            <li> Have used it, but not sure it will work for repeated use.  Leaves skin tingling and sore for over a day.</li>
            <li> Sadly this stuff will not did not remove my facial hair (eyebrow).  So another useless product.  The only thing it did was leave sticky glue on my face.  Back to the salon I go.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews. This product is so spectacular I have to tell everyone about it. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use. You warm the strips between your hands to heat up the wax, pull the strips apart, so you have 2 of them, press it on your skin, pull it off, and you&#x27;re done! There are a LOT of strips in this box and it cost me less than $8. Going to the salon to get my lip waxed costs $6. This saves a ton of money and there&#x27;s no embarrassment of going into a salon to say you need to get your lip waxed. There are multiple sized strips in the box, but I&#x27;m assuming I can cut them down, seeing as I only use them for my lip. Great deal, so easy, do not hesitate to buy these!!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me one of these kits since she felt it worked really well.  If you read the directions, it is really important to hold the wax strip in your hands for several minutes to heat it up to body temperature, you then pull the strip apart and apply it to the facial hair area you want to wax, rub in the correct direction, and pull up the strip.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this worked, and sometimes it just pulled my skin and made say ouch.  Success was definitely more likely if you held the strip long enough to warm it really well, but it was still hit and miss.&lt;br /&gt;The strips aren&#x27;t messy and there is not chance you could burn yourself or have hot spattered wax anywhere - but it can still be painful and ineffective.  These probably just work better on some peopler than on others.  My friend thought they were great, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as described.  Works well.  Good product for the price.  Would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised off the result, it works like a charm and I do not hurt !&lt;br /&gt;I recommends it.&lt;br /&gt;Creams it&#x27;s over for me, it burns the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Result much better whit this product, great!</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would and the price is awesome</li>
            <li> a little awkward and messy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It works though.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years. I&#x27;m surprised nobody has thought to use a hair dryer to warm their strips..??? Simple solution &amp; makes the product kick butt. Remember to hold the skin taught as you pull off...And...pull opposite of hair growth. WORKS GREAT FOLKS...</li>
            <li> I tore at least a third of my eyebrow off because the strips are not narrow enough. However, it does remove hair without the expense of going to a salon. Just be careful with those eyebrows.</li>
            <li> every time I tried to use the strips it never worked. didn&#x27;t get hot enough to pull anything off. felt like I wasted my money.</li>
