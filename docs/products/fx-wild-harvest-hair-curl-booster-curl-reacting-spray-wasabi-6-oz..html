    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Controls my &amp;#34;mind of its own&amp;#34; curly hair. Expensive though</li>
            <li> I have used this prodect for several years but it was discontinued.  It holds my hair in place and makes it shine beautifully like no other spray that I have found.  I do wish it were not discontinued!!!</li>
            <li> Long story short - thumbs up on this product (and the line for that matter).  If you are interested in details and some tips, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I am very impressed with the fx curl line.  They are effective and as hair products go, they are very reasonably priced.  Most run around $6.99.  I have tried many many MANY (seriously) products for my thick curly hair.  My hair has a solid wave, curls in an s pattern, will get some ringlets.  With coaxing I can get a really nice strong curl but in parts of my hair they are more fragile than others (they are more prone to collapse into a frizzy wave). So if I don&#x27;t have a good product to use the curls look blah.  I hate when a product is too heavy or just not effective so that after drying my hair with a diffuser I have some great looking curls but then I also have strands that are lifeless, frizzy and almost straight.  Very frustrating.  One only needs to look under my sink to see that I am OBSESSED with buying curl care products, always looking for THE ONE that will do it all.  Of course I want lovely uniform curls but the product also needs to feel light, not super sticky, but also not too soft (too soft equals soft hair but limp curls), good frizz control (I am prone to lots of frizz at the crown) and just that right amount of crunchiness (ie. hardness as my hair dries).  This is because it will lock in a good spiral curl that will look great, and be soft and crunch free, once I smooth in some frizz-ease serum or the serum from this line (just tried it as well, very nice) when my hair has dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily product line-up is first, a leave in conditioner (this line has a very good one, not heavy at all which is good - again, want to avoid the too soft issue).  Next I use a mousse (I&#x27;m ordering the fx curl mousse, I&#x27;m interested to see if it falls in line with the nice quality of their other products) and then a touch of curl cream and a half-dollar size glob of gel.  I know it sounds like A LOT of products for one head of hair but thick coarse hair can handle more.  Finally I spray this stuff on it and very lightly scrunch it in (a lot of products say scrunch scrunch scrunch but the more you scrunch the more your hair will frizz.  And as an aside, a good trick I stumbled across in all my years diligent trial and error in an attempt to have every day be a good hair day ~  Most products tell you to apply them to damp/towel dried hair.  I&#x27;ve learned that this is a bad idea.  I apply my products to wet hair.  I give it a good squeeze or two to get out as much water as I can but that&#x27;s it.  The difference is dramatic for me.  If I put products into towel dried hair I get way more unstructured frizzy curls.  Of course, again, I am using quite a few products so applying them to wet hair dilutes them a bit so my hair doesn&#x27;t end up too heavy with build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note - I&#x27;ve also used this product on dry hair even though it is not included in the directions.  It works incredibly well.  It seems kind of sticky initially after you spray it in and are scrunching but that actually goes away once the product absorbs and it really does perk up lifeless curls!

            <li> The product said it was new but came all sticky and not full! I paid 13 dollars for it but it had a 6 dollar old worn price tag on it! Not the new I expected!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair the extra hold to encourage good curl!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, curly hair, that can be combed straight or scrunched into curls. I have used many hair curling products, and I was actually looking for another that is no longer available when I ran into this. For the outrageous price ($30+), well, I&#x27;d pay anything if it was all the other reviews said it was. But it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s alright, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything remarkable as far as curls go. I guess everything works different on different hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There are better products out there, I just have to find them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found that keeps my curls in place, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t feel like lacquer when applied. ,y hair is still soft and touchable, still has movement, but my curls stay in place. I love it.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan... seems like there&#x27;s a lot of alcohol, which seems to dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hold my curls better than not putting any product on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it works...I love the smell of it! it&#x27;s just an all around great curl boosting spray! Love Love Love it!!</li>
            <li> I gave it away as a gift but my friends hair looks awesome so get it. Her hair looks really bangin.</li>
            <li> It came in a bottle that had a good part of the label wiped out--secondhand?or happened in transit?It smells like pure alcohol,and is very drying to the hair.Would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WONDERS ON MY STRAIGHT HAIR. IT GIVES MY HAIR  A LOT OF BODY AND SOFT CURLS.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother- she lpves this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This has alcohol in it which dries out hair. I was expecting a moisturizing/conditioning kind of action to boost curls. this is more like hair spray.</li>
            <li> This product really works on my hair, which is thin with a little natural wave.  First after  shampoo, I use a leave-in conditioner. Next I apply  Marc Anthony&#x27;s Curl enhancer foam: Now I have curls all over. Everybody who comments, says \\&quot;I&#x27;d love to have your hair\\&quot;. Then several days later, for maintenance to control wilt or fuzz, I spray on FX curl booster as necessary.  It restores the curl and adds shine without feeling oily, sticky or heavy.  I only have experience with the wababi style FX booster at the higher price.</li>
            <li> Great for redefining curls</li>
            <li> I have a huge drawer full of curl boosters, and this is the best product I have found.  I got so tired of hard strands that seemed to strip the color that I had almost given up.  I wanted a natural look that would enhance my easy to curl hair and not make it look plastic.  I originally purchased this product at Ulta (on a whim and quest for yet another product).  To my surprise, this product restores my curls and waves and makes my hair soft and shiny too.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have yucky stuff in it such as parabens.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I resorted to Amazon (like always).  The bottle is small but it lasts a long time.  I also use it as a finishing spray on the front of my hair which is straighter than the back.  You can use it on wet or dry hair.  I have not noticed any odor.  I love it.  I just hope I can continue to find it and not have to pay the high price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything to keep my curls in shape and especially didn&#x27;t work against humidity. It may work for others, but unfortunately, not for me.</li>
            <li> EASY BETWEEN STYLING TO FRESHEN CURLS</li>
            <li> I love this scrunching spray! Works great on curly hair. Suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more. So happy to have found it again!</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve found for my curls! Gives me body and shine that I&#x27;ve not acquired with any other curly hair product, without building up or coating. This is a definite must for anyone with wavy or curly hair!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has naturally curly hair I was looking for something to take out friz and make them more bouncy this stuff is Awful it&#x27;s sticky it makes her hair feel stiff plus it stinks. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I don&#x27;t use it to curl my hair, I use it for a light hold and bouncy hair.  It doesn&#x27;t dull the hair like other sprays.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for my curls.  I can&#x27;t find it in any store in my area, so I was happy to find here.</li>
            <li> i had some of this for a year or two before trying it. I loved it and it held my curls after rolling my hair in curl and snap that I also ordered here. Now I have read that this is no longer available and the replacement is made overseas with a different formula.  I hope this that came is the original formula. let you know after trying it</li>
            <li> Always liked product.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for a long while</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Very prompt mailing.</li>
