            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>And this was a great price!</li>
            <li>and she loved it!</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent that is not overpowering and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Sealed box, perfect condition, LOVE THIS PERFUME!</li>
            <li>ive been totally thrilled to have ordered this from you excellent thankyou</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy with it, I like it too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as a sample I smelled in the store.</li>
            <li>Wife loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d order this again, since I like a scent that&#x27;s a bit more noticeable, but I&#x27;ll happily continue wearing this until I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes at a great price.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this!</li>
            <li>Jade is still my favorite, but this is very nice not to sweet.</li>
            <li>HUGE bottle here normally sells for much more, so this is an excellent price!</li>
            <li>Love this one</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Never had so many people stop me just to ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Light fragrance is nice, but doesn&#x27;t stay with me all day.</li>
            <li>I love it and everyone else does too</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure about it.</li>
            <li>Indian Garnet is floral and woodsy--and this isn&#x27;t my favorite scent profile.  </li>
            <li>This is on my list of favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent, and have had many compliments.</li>
            <li>I finally found this awesome scent!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more staying power than it does, although my friends say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is only available as an eu de toilette, but would probably be perfect if they made it in a parfum.</li>
            <li>I ordered this scent without smelling it because I absolutely love all of the Omnia scents and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Smells like you took a freshly laundered towel, lightly sprayed it with Chanel Allure EDT, then hung it on the line on a warm sunny day at the beach.</li>
            <li>Best fragrance for women, hands down.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Love the cologne and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn omnia original for 11 years...ordered this one by mistake....</li>
            <li>This is a rich fragrance, but not my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This perfume smells really good, it&#x27;s not strong, just a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much that I even bought the body oil to go with it.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, which pleased me.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is beautiful and unique, but it&#x27;s barely detectable unless you put your nose directly to your skin.</li>
            <li>This particular one has an exotic spice-like smell.</li>
            <li>My new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely my new favorite.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, and received compliments the first time she wore it!</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, a little mild over time</li>
            <li>Awesome new scent ... Been looking for something new for a long time ...</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it is such a summery scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light cozy warm clean smell</li>
            <li>I thought that it could get any better than my previous favorite Coral.  </li>
            <li>Delicate, feminine and soft -- a great value, too!</li>
            <li>I love the rich, somewhat exotic yet delicate fragrance - I would order it again!</li>
            <li>Absolutely devine!  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get much floral out of this fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this scent elsewhere, and was delighted to find it on Amazon in a larger size for less than it cost me the first time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new fragrance and decided to try Bulgari Omnia Indian Garnet based on other reviews - I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>A very nice, subtle perfume but the scent does not last more than an hour; even when I put a little odorless oil on my skin before spraying to hold the scent.  </li>
            <li>Once again, this specific line of perfume does not fail to impress.  </li>
            <li>Received compliments the first time I used it and subsequently.  </li>
            <li>Although it is not a heavy fragrance, it seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>The only downside so far has been the &amp;#34;fade factor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people have commented that this perfume is really subtle and fades quickly, but I kind of like that people standing ten feet away from me aren&#x27;t being assaulted by my scent, and I can personally attest that the scent is still noticeable after several hours of wear - at least to a person standing near enough to speak to me.</li>
            <li>Too much money for too little result.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells like you took a freshly laundered towel, lightly sprayed it with Chanel Allure EDT, then hung it on the line on a warm sunny day at the beach. It&#x27;s a light cozy warm clean smell that&#x27;s very wearable all year round. I think it&#x27;s one that after a few hours you may not smell it but others will when you get in their vicinity or walk by.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this! Will purchase again.</li>
