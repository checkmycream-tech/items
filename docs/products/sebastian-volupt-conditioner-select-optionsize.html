            <li> Great buy for the price. Nice soft hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got this at such an amazing price!! When I did hair this is the line we used. You can literally feel the volume once you use this.&lt;br /&gt;Came before bit was supposed to! Its from Sebastian so it&#x27;s not an imposter. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner...have been using for a few weeks now and hair is definitely much better...less dry and has more body!  So glad I tried this and has made all the difference.</li>
            <li> I use this with the shampoo!  It&#x27;s great!  Detangles my hair easily.  I would recommend this product.  It is a great value.</li>
            <li> I was using Living Proof Full products on my fine, limp, straight hair for a long time, which worked great. After Jenifer Aniston bought the company, they stopped selling the larger bottles of shampoo and conditioner, and the products are quite costly unless you buy the larger bottles. I asked my stylist for a recommendation and she gave me Sebastian Volupt to try. I love this product line, it works every bit as well as Living Proof to add volume and fullness to my hair, and at a much better price. My hair is full, shiny, and soft, and the volume lasts all day. This line is great for hair that is colored, too. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is genuine Sebastian conditioner. I have used volupt before and loved it, but this product leaves a residue on my hair and it gets so dry that it tangles easily. I do not recommend purchasing. I&#x27;m going to throw mine in the trash and buy a genuine Sebastian product (which is always fantastic on my hair!)</li>
            <li> Excellent for anyone with fine hair who needs a little more volume.  Much, much cheaper than in the salon, too!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo it lasts a long time and has a lot of suds</li>
            <li> This is the first Sebastian product I have used that has left me disappointed. It&#x27;s very watery and leaves my hair tangled as if I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner at all. I will stick with Penetraitt.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner that does not weigh my hair down and makes it shiny!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, very fine hair.  This product gave my hair some body and that made my hair look thicker.  I was able to just brush through my hair the next morning and go.  Didn&#x27;t need to restyle from the beginning.  The one drawback was that my hair looked oily, dirtier earlier than before but I can wash it.  I like the extra lift and the couple extra days of hair body.</li>
            <li> Item as described, wrapped in plastic... thanks</li>
            <li> Great value ....huge bottle, outstanding product. Only about $10.</li>
            <li> Rancid.....poor decision</li>
            <li> Great conditioner that I am using on color treated hair with no bad effects on color. The product it great.</li>
            <li> I love this product as an alternate change from a daily routine. It restores the shiny, healthy glow to thinning, aging hair.</li>
            <li> This is the one shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve found that I actually, really like! It actually does what it says and volumizes!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser a few years ago and have been using it since.  The salon no longer sells it so I have to go on line to buy this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my hair except this along with the shampoo.</li>
