            <li>(thick/coarse/frizzy/wavy/curly).. it does smell good and softens my hair but in terms of control like flyaways and frizz it didn&#x27;t provide much hold.. was delivered on time..</li>
            <li>I paid a little more for someone with the best feedback and was not dissapointed.</li>
            <li>but and it evaporates easily</li>
            <li>I can not camb my hair easily like the time that I used the product that I bought form a salon.  </li>

            <li>Thanks for the smazing deal!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So worth the price!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but I promise it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, soft shiny hair, with no extra oil residue.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and clean, it is light and not \\&quot;goopy\\&quot;, it really does make your hair \\&quot;relax\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to decide on which is best for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product because there were good reviews on different site.  </li>
            <li>Getting it here on amazon makes it more reasonable.</li>
            <li>It works and definitely smells good.</li>
            <li>Is wonderful for smothing and de-volumizing thick curly hair though.</li>
            <li>Really helps my hair look healthy.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Works well on curly/thick hair, both wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Really light consistcy and scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Truly wonderful for frizzies and getting your hair as smooth as possible when blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I also experienced this with two other hair products.</li>
            <li>I think this is great for all hair types but especially dry damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Dont buy it if you expect your hair to be soft and frizz free for more than one hour because it wont do it.</li>
            <li>Hair Feels super silky and manageable after using the Kerastase line.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I think just with a big brush and a hairdryer you will be able to do ALMOST as good as a professional</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve referred to this as ever since the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Even using cheap shampoos, this product worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is a good quick fix on dry unruly hair as well.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair with a natural wave</li>
            <li>With about 4 pumps of this stuff tho added to my damp hair, I can blow dry and curl it with in 30 minutes, and it makes my hair so silky and soft, and best of all straight!</li>
            <li>I really like that it helps control my hair frizz and keeps my hair shiny but the smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>This product is super pricey, but I&#x27;ve tried tons of things on my hair, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have always absolutely LOVED this stuff and suddenly, for the first time in my life, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>At my beauty shop, the same product was $10 more!  </li>
            <li>It is best product especially for dry hair like I have.</li>
            <li>this product makes my hair really soft and smooth... become easy to brush my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny of it, it smells good and it leaves your hair looking really shinny and healthy without weighting your hair down.</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy wavy/curly hair, that on occasion, I like to wear straight.</li>
            <li>but you will be happy you put the Paul Mitchell junk down!</li>
            <li>This product is light, not sticky and makes a real difference when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li>And compared to some other products that are smaller bottles for more $$, I think this is a pretty good value!</li>
            <li>Worth ever penny.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth it</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The old one would really change my hair texture and give me the kind of straightness and shine that looked heat-styled.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, which is why I purchased this for my trip back to the Midwest.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its good, its functional , its working very well, I m still using ... but the smell in my humble opnion its not one of the better.</li>
            <li>Was promised by seller free upgrade to 2-day shipping which is why I went with this seller even though they were only $2 more.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product to use if you don&#x27;t want your hair curling up in humid weather especially.</li>
            <li>but this product is by far better.</li>
            <li>works wonderfull on all types of hair beleive me they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>,,def worth the investment</li>
            <li>It also smells better than pretty much anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair/skin/face/etc - I get compliments on it on a regular basis. :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to product to everyone who has fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li>makes my hair calm right down, leaves a great sheen but not oily, and really supple.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it wasnt right for my hair type?</li>
            <li>Adds great sheen to hair without making it feel oily or slick.  </li>
            <li>THANK you very much.</li>
            <li>if you do not have soooooo much hair I really recommend this!!</li>
            <li>I love what this Oleo-Serum has done for my natural soft curly hair,I&#x27;m able to manage my hair better with Kerastase than other products!!..</li>
            <li>As I jumped out to examine what exactly was going I realized the bleached parts were coming out..</li>
            <li>my hair took to this stuff pretty immediately.</li>
            <li>This is the miracle product I&#x27;ve been looking for my whole life!</li>
            <li>For me it only gets better if you use it after brushing the hair.</li>
            <li>In short, it just isnt my favorite product.</li>
            <li>When I first applied the serum, I thought \\&quot;wow\\&quot;, this stuff feels great!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am using this product for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>it was the first time  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s way more than enough.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says for your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have been able to find that makes my hair feel silky.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always pretty frizzy/fluffy the day I wash it.</li>
            <li>This is simply an oil syrum like the many others on the market.</li>
            <li>There are many L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al products out there for a quarter of the price that will get the same results.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser first used this product on my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various serums but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>You can see a difference in your hair the first time you try it.  </li>
            <li>This has kept her hair healthy &amp; shiny through dyes and daily blow drying.</li>
            <li>I have thick, color-treated/highlighted hair and have tried many serums to tame my frizzy hair and this is the best out of all of them.  </li>
            <li>Paid the same amount at Nordstrom Rack as on Amazon and Amazon was far more convenient!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it, and it works fantastic, as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>rose scent, make my dry hair very smooth and moistrizing, not very oil</li>
            <li>The other Oleo products that go with this one are also amazing</li>
            <li>, I am in love with this serum and will try the ELIXIR KERASTASE SERUM, I will be using when just drying my hair or flat ironing</li>
            <li>(if you do more than that, your hair may lose the volume and look flat).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many hair products but this may rank as one of the best!  </li>
            <li>and i love this product, it makes my hair shinny and healthy and alot more shinny than it was, my hair was pretty dull and dry, thank God my co-worker suggestd this product.</li>
            <li>It is light on my hair, but controls and softens ,ike no other product.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit expensive, but considering that hair is so important to feeling and looking good, its worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down which is nice.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair SUPER soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I do not think all of the positive reviews are real.</li>
            <li>When it is humid outside, my hair expands and is less attractive.  </li>
            <li>I have mid length, fine hair (</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but recently got it colored.</li>
            <li>I have fine, but coarse wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get very dry because I&#x27;m blow drying more now that I have straight hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product and it was delivered before it was expected</li>
            <li>I have bald spots now and very damaged hair.</li>
            <li>and it prevents breakage since I have so much hair</li>
            <li>so if you want STRAIGHT HAIR believe me BUY THIS SERUM, it will relax you wavy hair</li>
            <li>You really need to blow out your hair to see the results - maybe it needs to be heat activated in order to work?</li>
            <li>Use too much and your hair will look greasy.  </li>
            <li>Some much cheaper on Amazon than the supermarket.</li>
            <li>I used this along with Oleo Shampoo and it makes my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li>very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real L&#x27;Oreal product protects your hair from heat.</li>
            <li>I have wavy straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have soooooo much hair.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>i have to use it very sparingly even on my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I dont really find myself reaching for this one too often.</li>
            <li>(with all these attributes, it is still very healthy-looking.)</li>
            <li>I put this on before drying my hair--it adds a softness and shininess that I really like.  </li>
            <li>I love it and use it on still wet hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps smooth hair without making it greasy or building up product.</li>
            <li>After application, hair appeared too oily, but once I used my curling iron, hair appeared much softer and healthier.  </li>
            <li>IT FAST --</li>
            <li>It said that this would make real hair and extensions shine and protect the hair from heat.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but I also use BioSilk, and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of stuff and nothing really</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is real or counterfeit</li>
            <li>I do not like the sprayer because it sprays too much product in one spot and</li>
            <li>Leaves no oily feeling, but it really reduces the frizz, calms my hair and gives it a hint of shine.  </li>
            <li>It really does work to combat the frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping - plan to re-order when I am out.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair product, and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does make ur hair soft right after u put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extra note on the serum itself -- I have used the serum for years, while using other shampoos (notably Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1).</li>
            <li>Product is over priced and mine came with a Chinese lable put over the original one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to spend much money on beauty products, but I will always buy this!</li>
            <li>Smells great and just few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t stick my hair to itself, so it&#x27;s still easy to brush through after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I have LONG fine hair but lots of it...</li>
            <li>Very nice product and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works.</li>
            <li>It is not worth more than $10.</li>
            <li>I just reordered another bottle of it having used the last bottle for almost a full year.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Florida which equals frizz!  </li>
            <li>I live in very humid south florida..amazed at how well this has worked...</li>
            <li>Turned my dry, frizzy, wavy hair into smooth shiny silk.</li>
            <li>So I still use the product in styling and it is a decent product.</li>
            <li>I bought this after finishing up an older bottle, and I do notice a difference between formulas.</li>
            <li>Used in high end&lt;br /&gt;Salons.</li>
            <li>Highly recomnend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I introduced my hairdresser to it and recommended it highly.</li>
            <li>I will try other kind next time.</li>
            <li>but WOW this stuff has helped me sooo much.</li>
            <li>Best serum by far, but very expensive.  </li>
            <li>Normally I get it at Gene Juarez, but they were out, so I ordered it from Amazn.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of extremely curly, fine hair that is unmanageable.</li>
            <li>and it curls right back up...</li>
            <li>It works great when applied when wet and also when applied to dry hair after a blow dry.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but love it!!</li>
            <li>i started to use this with my new hair dryer</li>
            <li>I have curly  /  wavy hair and live in FL.</li>
            <li>live in CA so not a lot of humidity here; however, my hair sometimes has a mind of</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy, feels natural and becomes super super soft.  </li>
            <li>Spent a bit more for the Kerastase, but have eliminated products from my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li>Made hair very soft: check.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>When you are old we don&#x27;t get all this high tech stuff, so thank you again.</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>Normally, I would have to use a straightener to straighten my hair, to make it soft.</li>
            <li>It also makes it so soft!</li>
            <li>I first bought this product while on a cruise in the Italian Riviera.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair shiny and smooth, but not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li>The product is light and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>This product seems to settle my hair down but ultimately nothing tames it more than straightening it.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair more manageable ,My hair feels soft after I applied on my wet hair before I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>After all nothing makes someone look more aged than a head of damaged and dry hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, however I found that L&#x27;oreal professional techniant liss control and intense control smoothing serum worked better and was much less expensive.</li>
            <li>This product definitely helps to calm my hair, especially when applied before blow drying.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Will not add any texture to your hair, but definitely eases the process of drying it straight.</li>
            <li>and it also make it soft .</li>
            <li>Just one or two drops is enough to give shine and silkiness, makes it easier to blow my waves straight.  </li>
            <li>NOT HEAVY ,, MAKES YOU HAIR MOVE AND KEEPS IT SILKY...</li>
            <li>I apply it on damp hair and it dries to soft, sooooo shiny, like I have never seen it before.</li>
            <li>My hair becomes greasy fast especially when I use products</li>
            <li>no product I have found so far has corrected these the way that the Oleo-Relax serum does.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but have a Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li>I am rating it because she is a 62 yr old beauty with hair that gets frequent compliments from others.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday, and wonder how I lived without it!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny - I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and if I wash and use products and let it dry naturally it will be wavy and pretty but not shinny</li>
            <li>I use it while I blow dry or before straightening my hair with a hot iron.</li>
            <li>I first apply a product called (brand) Bed Head &amp;#34;Control Freak.&amp;#34;  I then blow dry my hair -- and then apply this product -- and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it about another 5&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I use maybe less than a full pump for my pixie cut</li>
            <li>Dont even waste you time thinking it&#x27;s worth all your money!</li>
            <li>Because any curls or waves will be lost forever once this serum is applied and get ready for Flat hair city!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this serum to use as a heat protectant for my flat/curling iron because all other serums that I&#x27;ve tried made my hair so heavy and oily aspect and after reasing reviews saying that this one doesn&#x27;t do that, so I tried and used 4 pumps cause my hair is so damaged from high and lowlight, my hair didn&#x27;t get oily at all, it feels like silk, I don&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my hair softer and more manageable  -  just a small amount needed.</li>
            <li>I wash and towel dry and put some and after drying I put little bit more</li>
            <li>have tried for about two months and my hair is exactly as before, unruly and very dry.</li>
            <li>(I hope it is real); but it makes my hair super soft and less dry.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time since you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li>I managed salons for a long time and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so I use curling iron to put cuticles together or flat iron, normally I don&#x27;t use hairspray with my curling iron and the curls stay put for 6 hours naturally</li>
            <li>But, after my new promise to myself, I finally asked what it was, and bought it.</li>
            <li>I get when I trying to blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I did not question the fact that she left me under a hot dryer too long with my foils.</li>
            <li>I have extremely course hair that gets a layer of &#x27;flyaways&#x27; at the first drop of rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would help with the major case of frizz</li>
            <li>I have curly hair for the first time in my life due to chemo</li>
            <li>Favorite product for my thick frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth it to me</li>
            <li>But as far as actual results--meh.</li>
            <li>I am versy surprised because I do not feel this product has the same qulity of the product that I have bought.  </li>
            <li>, I have also used this when I have left my hair naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>Kind of too expensive for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>All my friends ask me what kind of \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; I have done, it looks like the day after I did an (expensive) keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I know this product is kind of expensive....</li>
            <li>My hair is smoother, far less frizzy, and looks much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this to people who has coarse, thick and unmanageable hair like mine.</li>
            <li>So... if you&#x27;re not willing to shell out the bucks for the whole &amp;#34;regimen&amp;#34; or whatever, I&#x27;d still recommend using the serum.</li>
            <li>so I have to turn the top and push down at the same time to get the oil out, which can be messy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with hair that tends to be dry and possibly frizzy.</li>
            <li>Though my hair is not long, I have ton of it-</li>
            <li>Super watery, not the thick oil that I know it needs to be.</li>
            <li>I have been using an average of 3-4 professional salon products on it to keep it tame and even then, on the most humid days, those products are a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really tames the frizz and you only need a little bit.</li>

            <li> It may cost you more</li>
            <li> It smells lovely.  </li>

            <li> Excellent product, helped moisturizer dry and Coe damaged hair.  </li>

            <li> The consistent of the serum is very light and liquid but does an amazing job in your hair.</li>

            <li> Works great on natural curls and with Keratin treated hair.  </li>
            <li> (thick/coarse/frizzy/wavy/curly).. it does smell good and softens my hair but in terms of control like flyaways and frizz it didn&#x27;t provide much hold.. was delivered on time..</li>
            <li> I paid a little more for someone with the best feedback and was not dissapointed.</li>
            <li> but and it evaporates easily</li>
            <li> I can not camb my hair easily like the time that I used the product that I bought form a salon.  </li>

            <li> Thanks for the smazing deal!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So worth the price!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but I promise it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, soft shiny hair, with no extra oil residue.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and clean, it is light and not \\&quot;goopy\\&quot;, it really does make your hair \\&quot;relax\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to decide on which is best for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product because there were good reviews on different site.  </li>
            <li> Getting it here on amazon makes it more reasonable.</li>
            <li> It works and definitely smells good.</li>
            <li> Is wonderful for smothing and de-volumizing thick curly hair though.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hair look healthy.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on curly/thick hair, both wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Really light consistcy and scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Truly wonderful for frizzies and getting your hair as smooth as possible when blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I also experienced this with two other hair products.</li>
            <li> I think this is great for all hair types but especially dry damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Dont buy it if you expect your hair to be soft and frizz free for more than one hour because it wont do it.</li>
            <li> Hair Feels super silky and manageable after using the Kerastase line.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I think just with a big brush and a hairdryer you will be able to do ALMOST as good as a professional</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve referred to this as ever since the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Even using cheap shampoos, this product worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is a good quick fix on dry unruly hair as well.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair with a natural wave</li>
            <li> With about 4 pumps of this stuff tho added to my damp hair, I can blow dry and curl it with in 30 minutes, and it makes my hair so silky and soft, and best of all straight!</li>
            <li> I really like that it helps control my hair frizz and keeps my hair shiny but the smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> This product is super pricey, but I&#x27;ve tried tons of things on my hair, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have always absolutely LOVED this stuff and suddenly, for the first time in my life, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> At my beauty shop, the same product was $10 more!  </li>
            <li> It is best product especially for dry hair like I have.</li>
            <li> this product makes my hair really soft and smooth... become easy to brush my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny of it, it smells good and it leaves your hair looking really shinny and healthy without weighting your hair down.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy wavy/curly hair, that on occasion, I like to wear straight.</li>
            <li> but you will be happy you put the Paul Mitchell junk down!</li>
            <li> This product is light, not sticky and makes a real difference when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> And compared to some other products that are smaller bottles for more $$, I think this is a pretty good value!</li>
            <li> Worth ever penny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth it</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The old one would really change my hair texture and give me the kind of straightness and shine that looked heat-styled.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, which is why I purchased this for my trip back to the Midwest.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its good, its functional , its working very well, I m still using ... but the smell in my humble opnion its not one of the better.</li>
            <li> Was promised by seller free upgrade to 2-day shipping which is why I went with this seller even though they were only $2 more.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product to use if you don&#x27;t want your hair curling up in humid weather especially.</li>
            <li> but this product is by far better.</li>
            <li> works wonderfull on all types of hair beleive me they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> ,,def worth the investment</li>
            <li> It also smells better than pretty much anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair/skin/face/etc - I get compliments on it on a regular basis. :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to product to everyone who has fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li> makes my hair calm right down, leaves a great sheen but not oily, and really supple.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it wasnt right for my hair type?</li>
            <li> Adds great sheen to hair without making it feel oily or slick.  </li>
            <li> THANK you very much.</li>
            <li> if you do not have soooooo much hair I really recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I love what this Oleo-Serum has done for my natural soft curly hair,I&#x27;m able to manage my hair better with Kerastase than other products!!..</li>
            <li> As I jumped out to examine what exactly was going I realized the bleached parts were coming out..</li>
            <li> my hair took to this stuff pretty immediately.</li>
            <li> This is the miracle product I&#x27;ve been looking for my whole life!</li>
            <li> For me it only gets better if you use it after brushing the hair.</li>
            <li> In short, it just isnt my favorite product.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the serum, I thought \\&quot;wow\\&quot;, this stuff feels great!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am using this product for more than ten years.</li>
            <li> it was the first time  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way more than enough.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says for your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I have been able to find that makes my hair feel silky.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always pretty frizzy/fluffy the day I wash it.</li>
            <li> This is simply an oil syrum like the many others on the market.</li>
            <li> There are many L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al products out there for a quarter of the price that will get the same results.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser first used this product on my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various serums but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> You can see a difference in your hair the first time you try it.  </li>
            <li> This has kept her hair healthy &amp; shiny through dyes and daily blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have thick, color-treated/highlighted hair and have tried many serums to tame my frizzy hair and this is the best out of all of them.  </li>
            <li> Paid the same amount at Nordstrom Rack as on Amazon and Amazon was far more convenient!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it, and it works fantastic, as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li> rose scent, make my dry hair very smooth and moistrizing, not very oil</li>
            <li> The other Oleo products that go with this one are also amazing</li>
            <li> , I am in love with this serum and will try the ELIXIR KERASTASE SERUM, I will be using when just drying my hair or flat ironing</li>
            <li> (if you do more than that, your hair may lose the volume and look flat).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many hair products but this may rank as one of the best!  </li>
            <li> and i love this product, it makes my hair shinny and healthy and alot more shinny than it was, my hair was pretty dull and dry, thank God my co-worker suggestd this product.</li>
            <li> It is light on my hair, but controls and softens ,ike no other product.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit expensive, but considering that hair is so important to feeling and looking good, its worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down which is nice.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair SUPER soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I do not think all of the positive reviews are real.</li>
            <li> When it is humid outside, my hair expands and is less attractive.  </li>
            <li> I have mid length, fine hair (</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but recently got it colored.</li>
            <li> I have fine, but coarse wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get very dry because I&#x27;m blow drying more now that I have straight hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product and it was delivered before it was expected</li>
            <li> I have bald spots now and very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> and it prevents breakage since I have so much hair</li>
            <li> so if you want STRAIGHT HAIR believe me BUY THIS SERUM, it will relax you wavy hair</li>
            <li> You really need to blow out your hair to see the results - maybe it needs to be heat activated in order to work?</li>
            <li> Use too much and your hair will look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Some much cheaper on Amazon than the supermarket.</li>
            <li> I used this along with Oleo Shampoo and it makes my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li> very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real L&#x27;Oreal product protects your hair from heat.</li>
            <li> I have wavy straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have soooooo much hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> i have to use it very sparingly even on my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I dont really find myself reaching for this one too often.</li>
            <li> (with all these attributes, it is still very healthy-looking.)</li>
            <li> I put this on before drying my hair--it adds a softness and shininess that I really like.  </li>
            <li> I love it and use it on still wet hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps smooth hair without making it greasy or building up product.</li>
            <li> After application, hair appeared too oily, but once I used my curling iron, hair appeared much softer and healthier.  </li>
            <li> IT FAST --</li>
            <li> It said that this would make real hair and extensions shine and protect the hair from heat.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, but I also use BioSilk, and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of stuff and nothing really</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is real or counterfeit</li>
            <li> I do not like the sprayer because it sprays too much product in one spot and</li>
            <li> Leaves no oily feeling, but it really reduces the frizz, calms my hair and gives it a hint of shine.  </li>
            <li> It really does work to combat the frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - plan to re-order when I am out.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product, and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does make ur hair soft right after u put it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extra note on the serum itself -- I have used the serum for years, while using other shampoos (notably Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1).</li>
            <li> Product is over priced and mine came with a Chinese lable put over the original one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to spend much money on beauty products, but I will always buy this!</li>
            <li> Smells great and just few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stick my hair to itself, so it&#x27;s still easy to brush through after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I have LONG fine hair but lots of it...</li>
            <li> Very nice product and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works.</li>
            <li> It is not worth more than $10.</li>
            <li> I just reordered another bottle of it having used the last bottle for almost a full year.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Florida which equals frizz!  </li>
            <li> I live in very humid south florida..amazed at how well this has worked...</li>
            <li> Turned my dry, frizzy, wavy hair into smooth shiny silk.</li>
            <li> So I still use the product in styling and it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after finishing up an older bottle, and I do notice a difference between formulas.</li>
            <li> Used in high end&lt;br /&gt;Salons.</li>
            <li> Highly recomnend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I introduced my hairdresser to it and recommended it highly.</li>
            <li> I will try other kind next time.</li>
            <li> but WOW this stuff has helped me sooo much.</li>
            <li> Best serum by far, but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Normally I get it at Gene Juarez, but they were out, so I ordered it from Amazn.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of extremely curly, fine hair that is unmanageable.</li>
            <li> and it curls right back up...</li>
            <li> It works great when applied when wet and also when applied to dry hair after a blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but love it!!</li>
            <li> i started to use this with my new hair dryer</li>
            <li> I have curly  /  wavy hair and live in FL.</li>
            <li> live in CA so not a lot of humidity here; however, my hair sometimes has a mind of</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy, feels natural and becomes super super soft.  </li>
            <li> Spent a bit more for the Kerastase, but have eliminated products from my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> Made hair very soft: check.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> When you are old we don&#x27;t get all this high tech stuff, so thank you again.</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li> Normally, I would have to use a straightener to straighten my hair, to make it soft.</li>
            <li> It also makes it so soft!</li>
            <li> I first bought this product while on a cruise in the Italian Riviera.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair shiny and smooth, but not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li> The product is light and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> This product seems to settle my hair down but ultimately nothing tames it more than straightening it.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair more manageable ,My hair feels soft after I applied on my wet hair before I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> After all nothing makes someone look more aged than a head of damaged and dry hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, however I found that L&#x27;oreal professional techniant liss control and intense control smoothing serum worked better and was much less expensive.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps to calm my hair, especially when applied before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Will not add any texture to your hair, but definitely eases the process of drying it straight.</li>
            <li> and it also make it soft .</li>
            <li> Just one or two drops is enough to give shine and silkiness, makes it easier to blow my waves straight.  </li>
            <li> NOT HEAVY ,, MAKES YOU HAIR MOVE AND KEEPS IT SILKY...</li>
            <li> I apply it on damp hair and it dries to soft, sooooo shiny, like I have never seen it before.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes greasy fast especially when I use products</li>
            <li> no product I have found so far has corrected these the way that the Oleo-Relax serum does.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but have a Brazilian Blowout.</li>
            <li> I am rating it because she is a 62 yr old beauty with hair that gets frequent compliments from others.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, and wonder how I lived without it!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny - I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and if I wash and use products and let it dry naturally it will be wavy and pretty but not shinny</li>
            <li> I use it while I blow dry or before straightening my hair with a hot iron.</li>
            <li> I first apply a product called (brand) Bed Head &amp;#34;Control Freak.&amp;#34;  I then blow dry my hair -- and then apply this product -- and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it about another 5&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I use maybe less than a full pump for my pixie cut</li>
            <li> Dont even waste you time thinking it&#x27;s worth all your money!</li>
            <li> Because any curls or waves will be lost forever once this serum is applied and get ready for Flat hair city!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this serum to use as a heat protectant for my flat/curling iron because all other serums that I&#x27;ve tried made my hair so heavy and oily aspect and after reasing reviews saying that this one doesn&#x27;t do that, so I tried and used 4 pumps cause my hair is so damaged from high and lowlight, my hair didn&#x27;t get oily at all, it feels like silk, I don&#x27;t stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair softer and more manageable  -  just a small amount needed.</li>
            <li> I wash and towel dry and put some and after drying I put little bit more</li>
            <li> have tried for about two months and my hair is exactly as before, unruly and very dry.</li>
            <li> (I hope it is real); but it makes my hair super soft and less dry.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time since you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li> I managed salons for a long time and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> so I use curling iron to put cuticles together or flat iron, normally I don&#x27;t use hairspray with my curling iron and the curls stay put for 6 hours naturally</li>
            <li> But, after my new promise to myself, I finally asked what it was, and bought it.</li>
            <li> I get when I trying to blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I did not question the fact that she left me under a hot dryer too long with my foils.</li>
            <li> I have extremely course hair that gets a layer of &#x27;flyaways&#x27; at the first drop of rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would help with the major case of frizz</li>
            <li> I have curly hair for the first time in my life due to chemo</li>
            <li> Favorite product for my thick frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but worth it to me</li>
            <li> But as far as actual results--meh.</li>
            <li> I am versy surprised because I do not feel this product has the same qulity of the product that I have bought.  </li>
            <li> , I have also used this when I have left my hair naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> Kind of too expensive for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> All my friends ask me what kind of \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; I have done, it looks like the day after I did an (expensive) keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I know this product is kind of expensive....</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother, far less frizzy, and looks much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this to people who has coarse, thick and unmanageable hair like mine.</li>
            <li> So... if you&#x27;re not willing to shell out the bucks for the whole &amp;#34;regimen&amp;#34; or whatever, I&#x27;d still recommend using the serum.</li>
            <li> so I have to turn the top and push down at the same time to get the oil out, which can be messy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with hair that tends to be dry and possibly frizzy.</li>
            <li> Though my hair is not long, I have ton of it-</li>
            <li> Super watery, not the thick oil that I know it needs to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using an average of 3-4 professional salon products on it to keep it tame and even then, on the most humid days, those products are a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really tames the frizz and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product actually does tame my extraordinarily damaged,  (which is damaged due to genetics, poor nutrition, coloring, exposing it to hot water too often, and wearing it in a ponytail) naturally wavy (and frizzy!)</li>
            <li> But, it should only be used if you are wearing your hair bone straight, blow dried, flat ironed, etc.</li>
            <li> With the heat from a hair dryer and a round brush I can get my hair straight without a flat iron!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or oily as some other leave-on products.</li>
            <li> Using it on my damp, coarse hair helps it lay flat for days!!</li>
            <li> but after putting this KERASTASE serum the curls were flat after 1 hour</li>
            <li> I apply to my ends before using flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use this after I finish flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Without it, I have to use a curling iron or flat iron to make my hair presentable.</li>
            <li> This is an essential part of my hair regiment, especially during those dry winter months when my hair tends to get extremely dry and coarse.  </li>
            <li> Other conditioners seem to dry out my hair but this product leaves it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get discouraged by the price-- it will last you a long while!</li>
            <li> I put it on towel-dried hair, but sometimes put a microscopic amount on my ends after they are dry and styled, or even the next day.</li>
            <li> My blonde, dry, brittle, aging hair looks transformed after using Keratase.  </li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I use and the only one I need - not only does it prevent frizz and fly-aways, but it can be used either while my hair is wet OR after completely dry, and never makes my hair feel or look oily.</li>
            <li> is!A bottle will last a very long time if you use it once a week; my hairdresser has suggested to me that any one product should never be overused--it can do damage!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and frizzy, but this cuts down on dry time</li>
            <li> No need to blow dry, and it makes it a breeze to use the flat iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> Smooths and give a little &amp;#34;chunkiness&amp;#34; and separation to the ends of my too thick, too full, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would smooth it out but didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune at the hairdressers&#x27; trying different products to relax and remove fuzziness from my porous hair.  </li>
            <li> I had long hair and purchased for control of the curls and frizzies.  </li>
            <li> shipping took too long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> One pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have rather thick hair that gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have the most difficult head of hair and the Kerastase Oleo-Relax Serum is the only product that can tame my gnarly locks.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but you can also be pretty liberal without your hair looking like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> serum)--this stuff in conjunction with the Kerastase serum will make your hair unbelievably shiny, bouncy, and soft!</li>
            <li> my long blond locks look like I went to pro!  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair in the front and dry hair at the ends..</li>
            <li> The serum is made for dry hair and has the effect of softening and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Helps smooth hair wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair so that could be why.</li>
            <li> But, with this, I can let it air dry and then use a curling iron to style it</li>
            <li> When I style my hair (blow dry and either curl or straighten)</li>
            <li> It retexturizes the hair and it particularly helpful for people with thick course hair and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> have really long hair with very dry ends.</li>
            <li> Only use a little bit-or else it will make your hair flat and oily.  </li>
            <li> I live in an extremely hot and some times muggy climate, and that doesn&#x27;t help things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting the appropriate &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of this serum is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it on dry hair for additional smoothing!</li>
            <li> The key is only use a small dime size amount.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit pricey, but I believe I have seen recent price points for half the cost.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> Gray hair is very dry and unruly.</li>
            <li> and I still have quite a bit, it goes a long way, has almost no scent either to interfere with you other scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely expensive, but at the rate I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ll have this product for 6 months, which makes it worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li> In any humidity I have to wear it pulled back tight</li>
            <li> overall just so so and a little too pricey for me..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished with my third bottle in a row, so now I&#x27;m taking a little mini-break and using Chi Iron guard just during flat-ironing.</li>
            <li> Use only a little before blow drying your hair otherwise hair becomes too oily.</li>
            <li> Too little serum results in hair that is only half-treated.</li>
            <li> My hair is much, much less frizzy even on rainy days and through workouts, and the volume has reduced without making my hair look flat.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I spent $40 for something that really doesn&#x27;t do much for--at least not for this curly-girl.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and yet worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I put this on when my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> I like to put this in after a shower, while my hair is still wet, and distribute it through the lengths of my hair.</li>
            <li> It just takes a few drops of this product mixed in with leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly, frizzy hair that goes completely out of control if there&#x27;s any heat or humidity.</li>
            <li> Also my hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same as it did with my other little glass bottle I got from a salon.</li>
            <li> My hair only started to frizz a little bit and simply by brushing it again, it seemed to flatten out and tame down again.  </li>
            <li> I had tried and spent a lot of money on other products before.</li>
            <li> I blowdry my hair a few times a week and follow it up with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Although the price leave a little to be desired, you only need a small amount and the bottle generally lasts me for a few months.  </li>
            <li> This works - doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy, I use it on wet and a little on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well so don&#x27;t be scared by the price.</li>
            <li> However a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it lasts forever because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> my disappointment is that it does not really soak into the hair and deeply condition, but it doesn&#x27;t really say that it will.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Another advantage of these products is that they don&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (like John Frieda products) or greasy (like some other hair oils).</li>
            <li> I have been using Kerastase every day for the past several years.</li>
            <li> This works as well as any other product I have had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, that said , It does work as well as any other frizz control product.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> This serum is extremely lightweight, but still has the benefits of dimethicone in making hair look sleek and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works just like the other serums you could buy at Target (like Oleo therapy serum by Loreal) but at a cheaper price...</li>
            <li> I had a perm that did not respond to any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any of the other products in this line.  </li>
            <li> Look at other companies or just order from the source.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with a little bit of texturizing creme for a smoother blow dry.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount (less than dime size amount) for it to work.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and smelling wonderfully, not the slightest bit greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li> A little drop applied to wet hair, comb through and style.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is NOT  worth the price that they have listed.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair which also must be unruly because that is what the product is for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down yet controls frizziness.  </li>
            <li> Weighs down my curls.  </li>
            <li> I use it to weigh down curls.</li>
            <li> It cuts your blow-drying time down.</li>
            <li> It smooths down the frizz and does add some shine.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave it too greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Settles down the frizzies but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> Provides shine but doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Kerastase products are hands down the on the market.  </li>
            <li> Almost half bottle of that already gone.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is $20 less than the salon.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair less frizzy when I straighten it.</li>
            <li> I know my hair is coming out in chunks I have thick waist long hair</li>
            <li> BUT I will continue to use this product, just a little less than before.</li>
            <li> Far less expensive at Amazon versus Vidal Sassonn where she previously purchased it.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum after reading reviews of loads of serums and needing a product for my thick, wavy hair which I blow dry a lot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, curly, dry, and porous.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, curly hair</li>
            <li> and too much serum results in hair that is weighed down to the point of looking dirty.  </li>
            <li> This one is lighter, still gives shine but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; my hair and keep it from getting a little poofy in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is very thick, wavy, and has dried out some from coloring.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price--be careful when traveling with it as it can leak, and that&#x27;s just sad considering how expensive it</li>
            <li> however, it tends to feel heavy on my hair and can sometimes even feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> There is some drying after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> I had bought this in France a few years ago but could never find it in the States.</li>
            <li> This  stuff is not cheap</li>
            <li> my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Yes, I lost half of my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair shiny for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know how to tame it.</li>
            <li> It works, though I&#x27;ll probably on the lookout for a less expensive serum to serve the same purposes once I run out.</li>
            <li> I have also realized that using this product for more than a few days in a row, even with washing in between, results in build-up that is bad enough that I have to use a clarifying (stripping :( ) shampoo to remove it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but for the money, was hoping that I would see a more dramatic relaxing effect.</li>
            <li> and she foiled my hair for blond as usual.  </li>
            <li> I used better serums before, you have to use just a small amount, otherwise your hair will be terrible.</li>
            <li> With just a small drop</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet.</li>
            <li> b/c usually hair products leave a lot to be desired</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t upgrade took several days so be wary of this seller.</li>
            <li> It came in a small bottle and  I was anxious to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great for my thick dry hair</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Approve and recommend for those who have weak hair with little volume .</li>
            <li> It also adds shine to dull hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil lately</li>
            <li> I use this with the Kerastase Elixir Ultime The Imperial Oleo Complex.  </li>
            <li> but once I put the Oleo Complex the scent is bearable.  </li>
            <li> The oil is lightweight but did not help with frizz on my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/waves that takes me awhile to control and straighten.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is slow because it&#x27;s from the UK, so don&#x27;t wait until you run out.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair is back in shape I&#x27;ll still use this everyday!!!!!</li>
            <li> those with curly hair know what I mean.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> I have below waist length very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair; it&#x27;s very thick, and often frizzy.</li>
            <li> and i mean bleach it!</li>
            <li> Also, the dispenser arrived broken</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some people are so crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff but it is so expensive at the salon</li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> so frustrating!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that responds poorly to humidity:(.</li>
            <li> Too bad it does not travel well and is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Getting the &amp;#34;dosage&amp;#34; correct is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> that I find it very expensive</li>
            <li> Either this is a bad product or it&#x27;s counterfeit.</li>
            <li> That helps my terribly frizzy hair.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product I love it</li>
            <li> Love the product and it was delivered before it was expected</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair and 2 months later decided to chemically straighten it. I was in the shower and next thing I know my hair is coming out in chunks I have thick waist long hair I started screaming! As I jumped out to examine what exactly was going I realized the bleached parts were coming out..I was in tears at this point I have bald spots now and very damaged hair. HOWEVER this was gifted to my by my boyfriend and let me just say my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and this has helped revitalize my hair by atleast 70% I&#x27;m addicted!!i put it in after I shower and it prevents breakage since I have so much hair you can&#x27;t tell that I lost a lot of hair but WOW this stuff has helped me sooo much. Even when my hair is back in shape I&#x27;ll still use this everyday!!!!! BUY IT!! You won&#x27;t regret it im so thankful I know about it..my hair took to this stuff pretty immediately.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune at the hairdressers&#x27; trying different products to relax and remove fuzziness from my porous hair.  When it is humid outside, my hair expands and is less attractive.  While my daughter lived in London, she performed in hair shows and the stylists used this product.  She shared it with me.  It is expensive and yet worth every penny.  I consider it a miracle drug for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this serum to use as a heat protectant for my flat/curling iron because all other serums that I&#x27;ve tried made my hair so heavy and oily aspect and after reasing reviews saying that this one doesn&#x27;t do that, so I tried and used 4 pumps cause my hair is so damaged from high and lowlight, my hair didn&#x27;t get oily at all, it feels like silk, I don&#x27;t stop touching my hair. My hair is naturally wavy and if I wash and use products and let it dry naturally it will be wavy and pretty but not shinny so I use curling iron to put cuticles together or flat iron, normally I don&#x27;t use hairspray with my curling iron and the curls stay put for 6 hours naturally but after putting this KERASTASE serum the curls were flat after 1 hour so if you want STRAIGHT HAIR believe me BUY THIS SERUM, it will relax you wavy hair and I think just with a big brush and a hairdryer you will be able to do ALMOST as good as a professional, I am in love with this serum and will try the ELIXIR KERASTASE SERUM, I will be using when just drying my hair or flat ironing but I will use  argan oil for curling iron .....I wash and towel dry and put some and after drying I put little bit more, smell is great.....They say it was shipped for UK and it was at my door in 5 days.......LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li> I was hoping to love it based on all the reviews but it&#x27;s just okay. You really need to blow out your hair to see the results - maybe it needs to be heat activated in order to work?</li>
            <li> Always have loved this stuff</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that responds poorly to humidity:(. This product definitely helps to calm my hair, especially when applied before blow drying.  You can also use it on dry hair for additional smoothing!</li>
            <li> This product works really well for thick hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down yet controls frizziness.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more from this product.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but for the money, was hoping that I would see a more dramatic relaxing effect.</li>
            <li> I have mid length, fine hair (except I have a lot of hair which makes blow drying/straightening quite a chore!) This product is light, not sticky and makes a real difference when I straighten my hair. My hair is naturally wavy and frizzy, but this cuts down on dry time and I don&#x27;t even need to use a straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely expensive, but at the rate I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ll have this product for 6 months, which makes it worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li> Simply love it! Since I have all kind of allergies I was looking for this product for years. Great for shiny hair!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t transform my hair like what others say.. maybe my hair is hopeless (thick/coarse/frizzy/wavy/curly).. it does smell good and softens my hair but in terms of control like flyaways and frizz it didn&#x27;t provide much hold.. was delivered on time.. overall just so so and a little too pricey for me..</li>
            <li> It smells good and works good after I straighten my hair</li>
            <li> Love this for using before blowdrying my curly hair! Leaves it smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I put 2 pumps in my hair before blow- drying and 1 pump before flat-ironing. Turned my dry, frizzy, wavy hair into smooth shiny silk. This is the miracle product I&#x27;ve been looking for my whole life!</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Weighs down my curls.  Keeps frizz away.  I stopped buying this at my salon for $50.  This serum does what it says it will.  The key is only use a small dime size amount.  Use too much and your hair will look greasy.  This is a good quick fix on dry unruly hair as well.  Again - use it sparingly.  Avoid your roots.  I use it to weigh down curls.</li>
            <li> Some much cheaper on Amazon than the supermarket. It smells great and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum after reading reviews of loads of serums and needing a product for my thick, wavy hair which I blow dry a lot. It works great when applied when wet and also when applied to dry hair after a blow dry.  As a bonus, it smells great and makes you feel like you&#x27;ve just come out of a salon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because there were good reviews on different site.  My hair has mind of it&#x27;s own and it&#x27;s very hard to manage.  I used this along with Oleo Shampoo and it makes my hair very manageable.  It smells very nice, too.</li>
            <li> Expensive but love it!!</li>
            <li> The product is great. I have used it for several years. Normally I get it at Gene Juarez, but they were out, so I ordered it from Amazn. Same great product, lower price - it just came without a box... But same product. I don&#x27;t like styling my hair, just a dab of this serum, scrunch, and I am done. It defines curls very nicely without making hair greasy, and tames fly aways as well.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of hair products. This is good</li>
            <li> The Keratase Oleo Relax Serum is great for using with heating products.  Although the price leave a little to be desired, you only need a small amount and the bottle generally lasts me for a few months.  In addition, scent is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have extremely course hair that gets a layer of &#x27;flyaways&#x27; at the first drop of rain or humidity.  In any humidity I have to wear it pulled back tight so it doesn&#x27;t frizz up.  I have been using an average of 3-4 professional salon products on it to keep it tame and even then, on the most humid days, those products are a waste of time and money.  But this one????  wow!  I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for years!  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week, some days humid, some days not......and it does the job.  My hair only started to frizz a little bit and simply by brushing it again, it seemed to flatten out and tame down again.  Already ordered a second bottle, I can&#x27;t go without now!</li>
            <li> This is a good product to smooth and soften hair. I have thick, coarse hair which also must be unruly because that is what the product is for. This product seems to settle my hair down but ultimately nothing tames it more than straightening it. Good combination to use as well straightening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every anti-frizz serum out there and this is the BEST one! It smells lovely and clean, it is light and not \\&quot;goopy\\&quot;, it really does make your hair \\&quot;relax\\&quot;. It makes your hair shiny and smooth, but not weighed down by product. It cuts your blow-drying time down. And compared to some other products that are smaller bottles for more $$, I think this is a pretty good value! A little goes a long way, but you can also be pretty liberal without your hair looking like an oil slick. If you want to step up the results another notch, use the Philip B Rejuvenating Oil Treatment as a conditioning treatment (it&#x27;s a treatment, NOT a leave-in serum)--this stuff in conjunction with the Kerastase serum will make your hair unbelievably shiny, bouncy, and soft! These two products are now my best kept secrets to amazing hair!</li>
            <li> ...that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve referred to this as ever since the very first time I used it. Truly wonderful for frizzies and getting your hair as smooth as possible when blow drying or flat ironing. Very much worth the price--be careful when traveling with it as it can leak, and that&#x27;s just sad considering how expensive it is!A bottle will last a very long time if you use it once a week; my hairdresser has suggested to me that any one product should never be overused--it can do damage! I&#x27;ve almost finished with my third bottle in a row, so now I&#x27;m taking a little mini-break and using Chi Iron guard just during flat-ironing. Quite happy with that product as well!</li>
            <li> Worth ever penny.  Lasts a long time since you don&#x27;t need too much. Will not add any texture to your hair, but definitely eases the process of drying it straight.</li>
            <li> I have been with my hairdresser for 2 1/2 years. I went in to her this April and she foiled my hair for blond as usual.  I trusted her, so I did not question the fact that she left me under a hot dryer too long with my foils. Yes, I lost half of my hair! If I did not have Kerastase Nutritive Oleo Relax Serum, I would not have kept the rest of my hair! For those that do not know me, my hair looks beautiful, healthy and shiny! I would have never gotten a comb through my hair and I would have had to shave my head if it wasn&#x27;t for this product! Thank You!</li>
            <li> It is good before but this one feels not as stick as before the item purchased off line shop.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft! Love it</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy wavy/curly hair, that on occasion, I like to wear straight. I purchased this product about a year ago after hearing a lot of great things. I thought it would help with the major case of frizz I get when I trying to blow dry my hair straight. It didn&#x27;t help. It did, however, make my hair feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the cost. A Brazilian Blowout works best for taking out the frizz, but then again, I lose all my curl potential for a couple months. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a great defrizzing serum.</li>
            <li> This product is a counterfeit. I&#x27;ve used it before (via in-store and salon purchases) and it had a fragrant, semiliquid thickness that nourishes hair fibers leaving hair polished and silky. The real L&#x27;Oreal product protects your hair from heat. Because this version is a watery knock-off, if you continue blow-drying or styling your hair with heat, your hair will be permanently damaged.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what the fuss is like the rest of reviewers, my hair is still frizzy</li>
            <li> I love this product....Altough it is pricy it is worth every penny of it, it smells good and it leaves your hair looking really shinny and healthy without weighting your hair down. It truly is good stuff for hair...</li>
            <li> I have oily hair in the front and dry hair at the ends.. It&#x27;s the best oil so far.. I have used so many product for My hair but it make them oily which I don&#x27;t like so this product protect your hair without making it oily and it also make it soft . I have wavy straight hair. If you have oily hair and you would like to use oil or serum use this .. Definetly worth it</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily. We have been using it for years&amp;#62; One bottle lasts about 8 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I have found Amazon to have the best price.</li>
            <li> I used better serums before, you have to use just a small amount, otherwise your hair will be terrible. For me it only gets better if you use it after brushing the hair.</li>
            <li> Either this is a bad product or it&#x27;s counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I have using this product almost a month.That helps my terribly frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have soooooo much hair. Then I use atleast 6 pushes everytime.Almost half bottle of that already gone.Two month a bottle.... Kind of too expensive for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also I don&#x27;t like the smell that like a rose.I will try to find another product.Maybe....&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you do not have soooooo much hair I really recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This is an essential part of my hair regiment, especially during those dry winter months when my hair tends to get extremely dry and coarse.  The serum is made for dry hair and has the effect of softening and moisturizing.  I apply in the morning prior to applying any hair gel and use it as sort of a second conditioner just to moisturize and protect my hair.  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, and wonder how I lived without it!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny - I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff but it is so expensive at the salon I just can&#x27;t afford it. Getting it here on amazon makes it more reasonable. You just can&#x27;t beat kerastase for hair care. I managed salons for a long time and this is the real deal. I paid a little more for someone with the best feedback and was not dissapointed.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product as my stylist recomended it for me. It is ok. I have curly fine hair that tends to be frizzy. This product sounded like a good solution however, it tends to feel heavy on my hair and can sometimes even feel a bit greasy. i have to use it very sparingly even on my frizzy hair. I have noticed that of all the many hair products in my bathroom I dont really find myself reaching for this one too often. In short, it just isnt my favorite product. Maybe it wasnt right for my hair type?</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews here.  I find it does what it says it will.  It smooths down the frizz and does add some shine.  However, it does not work miracles.  My hair is blonde and damaged by hi-lighting, so I realize I need a deep conditioner.  This serum cannot provide that.  I was hoping it would, so my disappointment is that it does not really soak into the hair and deeply condition, but it doesn&#x27;t really say that it will.  So I still use the product in styling and it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> Love this in my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff you can get for your hair. Used in high end&lt;br /&gt;Salons. Small bottle lasts a long time. Will not find it cheaper anywhere.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using it since I discovered it in Paris years ago. Great for coarse, curly hair</li>
            <li> Love the feel, smell, and affect of this serum.  Paid the same amount at Nordstrom Rack as on Amazon and Amazon was far more convenient!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27; promptly .packaged for safety.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing else to say , so I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2014</li>
            <li> I have below waist length very thick hair and I live in Florida which equals frizz!  A couple of pumps of this serum and after working it gently through the hair and the ends, my hair feels and looks wonderful.  It retexturizes the hair and it particularly helpful for people with thick course hair and curly hair.  I am on my second bottle now and would not want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years, recommending it for longer, and bring it with me to every hair stylist appointment.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Great product. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It works and definitely smells good. But I would say that it does not fundamentally improve hair frizziness. It just help with the appearance.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was excited to try this product. Though my hair is not long, I have ton of it-it&#x27;s thick, curly, dry, and porous. (with all these attributes, it is still very healthy-looking.) I wanted the serum because it might relax my curl a bit when I wanted to go for a straighter style. When I first applied the serum, I thought \\&quot;wow\\&quot;, this stuff feels great!\\&quot; But as far as actual results--meh. My hair may have felt a bit softer, but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m sorry to say I spent $40 for something that really doesn&#x27;t do much for--at least not for this curly-girl. The search continues....those with curly hair know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Used it in Hawaii after a day at the beach swimming a salt water and shampooing.</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling serum of all time. It&#x27;s not great for my thick dry hair but and it evaporates easily but it smells divine so I use it just for that!</li>
            <li> Seems to work great on my fine blonde hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave it too greasy or weighed down. Looks shiny. I&#x27;ve never bought any Kerastase products before so I have nothing to compare it with, but the smell is very strong. Too perfumey for my taste. BUT I will continue to use this product, just a little less than before.</li>
            <li> I love how silky and manageable Oleo-Relax leaves my curly hair! I received the product very quickly &amp; LOVED the price!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and receive great compliments n my hair texture and shine - from hair dressers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was wonderful and concerned about my not getting the  product on time.  Offered to send another shipment with samples and followed up to the last minute.  I will always order this product from this seller as they know how to satisfy their costumes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews and because i have frizzy hair. I was so excited to find this. It does make ur hair soft right after u put it on. But after couple of hours, that softness is gone and your hair becomes frizzy again. This is NOT  worth the price that they have listed. I wanted to return it. But since i used just ONE drop out of it, they would not take it back. Dont buy it if you expect your hair to be soft and frizz free for more than one hour because it wont do it. Also it gave me breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and so far I&#x27;m happy with the product.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Best serum by far, but very expensive.  Helps smooth hair wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell.  I like to mix it with a little bit of texturizing creme for a smoother blow dry.</li>
            <li> Always liked that product line, after I started using my hair has greatly improved. Approve and recommend for those who have weak hair with little volume .</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to try the [[ASIN:B004530AB2 K&amp;Eacute;RASTASE ELIXIR ULTIME]] but bought this by accident (they have similar bottles). I was going to return it but decided to keep it to try after reading the reviews online. I wish I had known about this YEARS ago -- my hair has literally transformed. I have naturally thick, curly, frizzy hair that goes completely out of control if there&#x27;s any heat or humidity. This gives my hair a beautiful shine and \\&quot;weight.\\&quot; It works amazingly with a curling iron -- my hair is voluminous, wavy, and smooth. It holds up in heat and rain too. Will be using this for forever.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I use it almost every day. I apply to my ends before using flat iron.</li>
            <li> I put this on before drying my hair--it adds a softness and shininess that I really like.  Very nice product and a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s not heavy or oily as some other leave-on products.</li>
            <li> I had long hair and purchased for control of the curls and frizzies.  Works great on natural curls and with Keratin treated hair.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Not wort the money. The oil is lightweight but did not help with frizz on my thick wavy hair. Did at shine though.</li>
            <li> i started to use this with my new hair dryer and i love this product, it makes my hair shinny and healthy and alot more shinny than it was, my hair was pretty dull and dry, thank God my co-worker suggestd this product.</li>
            <li> I love to buy hair products! This is one of my favorites.  With just a small drop my long blond locks look like I went to pro!  This serum is magic in a bottle!  Makes my hair so smooth and silkly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love ths product.  Smooths out the frizz in my hair and makes it more manageable.  It also adds shine to dull hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair; it&#x27;s very thick, and often frizzy. This product smooths out my hair without making it look greasy. You only need a small amount (less than dime size amount) for it to work. Don&#x27;t get discouraged by the price-- it will last you a long while!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this serum. It does not make hair look too oily and it also smells nice. Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair shiny for long periods of time. I&#x27;m not sure about this product yet.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of drops make your hair silky smooth, de-tangles them immediately, and lasts forever. I love it and use it on still wet hair after shampooing. My hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like that it helps control my hair frizz and keeps my hair shiny but the smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I received the item promptly!  The product is wonderful and really gives my hair a healthy sheen.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not greasy at all. nice scent.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for more than ten years. It is best product especially for dry hair like I have.</li>
            <li> I use four pumps for my African American hair. This stuff is the best . My hair was like straw and this product is changing it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and you can see the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have the most difficult head of hair and the Kerastase Oleo-Relax Serum is the only product that can tame my gnarly locks.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of hair products and Kerastase blows them all out of the water.  Also, the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.  At my beauty shop, the same product was $10 more!  This is a must buy for anyone with frizzy locks.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would like to have is a cap.&lt;br /&gt;But I love it !!!&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this to people who has coarse, thick and unmanageable hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair so soft!  A little goes a long way as well so don&#x27;t be scared by the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the oleo-relax shampoo, anti-frizz masque (basically conditioner), and serum. They work wonderfully together. My hair is much, much less frizzy even on rainy days and through workouts, and the volume has reduced without making my hair look flat. Another advantage of these products is that they don&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (like John Frieda products) or greasy (like some other hair oils). My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice. The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works. One last note... I have used some shampoos/conditioners that seem to cause dandruff. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face. They also smell lovely. Not too flowery or fruity or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra note on the serum itself -- I have used the serum for years, while using other shampoos (notably Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1). Even using cheap shampoos, this product worked pretty well. It definitely helps smooth hair without making it greasy or building up product. So... if you&#x27;re not willing to shell out the bucks for the whole &amp;#34;regimen&amp;#34; or whatever, I&#x27;d still recommend using the serum.</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve found to keep my hair healthy looking.</li>
            <li> it was the first time  I bought it and i think its perfect thing for hair treatment and thank you</li>
            <li> I put this on when my hair is still wet and I can literally feel my hair RELAX. I have thick curly/waves that takes me awhile to control and straighten.  I even put it on one day then decided to wear my hair curly and it didn&#x27;t even curl.  With the heat from a hair dryer and a round brush I can get my hair straight without a flat iron!</li>
            <li> Great product and packaged to fit</li>
            <li> I have rather thick hair that gets very frizzy. I have been using Kerastase every day for the past several years. I had tried and spent a lot of money on other products before. it makes my hair more manageable ,My hair feels soft after I applied on my wet hair before I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Its  an ok product and it does not keep away my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but recently got it colored. Using this makes a huge difference in the appearance of my hair and the texture. It gives it beautiful shine without making it greasy. However a little goes a long way. I use maybe less than a full pump for my pixie cut and it&#x27;s way more than enough.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have Rosanna Rosanna Danna Hair, right after blow drying!  Whoa.......This is a lite product that&lt;br /&gt;is best used before hot rollers or the curling, straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE any hair product from Kerastase!</li>
            <li> My friend recommanded it to me. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 6/5, I would do it in a heartbeat. This is the only hair product I use and the only one I need - not only does it prevent frizz and fly-aways, but it can be used either while my hair is wet OR after completely dry, and never makes my hair feel or look oily. It also smells better than pretty much anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair/skin/face/etc - I get compliments on it on a regular basis. :)</li>
            <li> The product is light and does not weigh the hair down. I like it. I have also recommended it to my sister and niece.</li>
            <li> Love this product for blowing my hair.  Just one or two drops is enough to give shine and silkiness, makes it easier to blow my waves straight.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Great hair product.  I love it!  Makes hair shine.</li>
            <li> Use only a little before blow drying your hair otherwise hair becomes too oily. It smells wonderful and after using, your hair seems to have more life and shine. Also seems to control frizzes.</li>
            <li> I bought this after finishing up an older bottle, and I do notice a difference between formulas. I like to put this in after a shower, while my hair is still wet, and distribute it through the lengths of my hair. The old one would really change my hair texture and give me the kind of straightness and shine that looked heat-styled. This one is lighter, still gives shine but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; my hair and keep it from getting a little poofy in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it during the day too to get rid of poof, add shine, and keep my lengths slippery and protected so they don&#x27;t get breakage and damage from wind, friction, and all I put them through. It works, though I&#x27;ll probably on the lookout for a less expensive serum to serve the same purposes once I run out.</li>
            <li> both products are great.</li>
            <li> it is really good, not oily at all. It makes my hair look shining and healthy. Can&#x27;t love it more!</li>
            <li> After application, hair appeared too oily, but once I used my curling iron, hair appeared much softer and healthier.  I would recommend this product.  Unfortunately, Keratase has so many products so it&#x27;s hard to decide on which is best for your hair.  Still, happy with &amp;#34;this&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use this as a smoothing serum for any style. But, it should only be used if you are wearing your hair bone straight, blow dried, flat ironed, etc. Because any curls or waves will be lost forever once this serum is applied and get ready for Flat hair city! Lesson learned! Is wonderful for smothing and de-volumizing thick curly hair though.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for smoothing dry course hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;ITS NOT HEAVY ,, MAKES YOU HAIR MOVE AND KEEPS IT SILKY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REC IT FAST -- AND I RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says for your hair.  I have not found a better product than this for dealing with unruly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, however I found that L&#x27;oreal professional techniant liss control and intense control smoothing serum worked better and was much less expensive.</li>
            <li> This product actually does tame my extraordinarily damaged,  (which is damaged due to genetics, poor nutrition, coloring, exposing it to hot water too often, and wearing it in a ponytail) naturally wavy (and frizzy!) hair.  My hair is smoother, far less frizzy, and looks much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the appropriate &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of this serum is very difficult.  Too little serum results in hair that is only half-treated. and too much serum results in hair that is weighed down to the point of looking dirty.  Getting the &amp;#34;dosage&amp;#34; correct is very difficult.  I have also realized that using this product for more than a few days in a row, even with washing in between, results in build-up that is bad enough that I have to use a clarifying (stripping :( ) shampoo to remove it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before recommended by my stylist and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Just that I find it very expensive</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair that is extrememly reactive to the weather, i.e., humidity.  I&#x27;m looking for a replacement product that Sexy Hair products discontinued.  Unforunately, this isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s just OK for my hair.  It did make it smoother but didn&#x27;t add any texture to my hair to help it hold its shape.</li>
            <li> A great hair product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have been able to find that makes my hair feel silky.  I use it while I blow dry or before straightening my hair with a hot iron.</li>
            <li> I have curly  /  wavy hair and live in FL. Oleo Relax keeps my hair from waving with the Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  This stuff is great!!  Yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is worth every penny.  Really helps my hair look healthy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair for the first time in my life due to chemo and I didn&#x27;t know how to tame it. This works great. Settles down the frizzies but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I read about this in a blog about hair extensions.  It said that this would make real hair and extensions shine and protect the hair from heat.  That is exactly what it does and it only takes a small (about 1 or 2 pumps) amount and your hair doesn&#x27;t it look greasy.  This works as advertised which is refreshing b/c usually hair products leave a lot to be desired</li>
            <li> This works as well as any other product I have had. None of them get rid of the frizz for too long.&lt;br /&gt;But, that said , It does work as well as any other frizz control product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not experiencing the mind-altering awesomeness of this product the way others are.  I have thick, dry, curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed the feel, texture, or curl of my hair.  Also, the dispenser arrived broken so I have to turn the top and push down at the same time to get the oil out, which can be messy.</li>
            <li> Made hair very soft: check.&lt;br /&gt;Made hair smell lovely: check.&lt;br /&gt;Got rid of hair frizz and fuzz: NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search continues...fyi, I have somewhat coarse hair that is color treated and it&#x27;s always pretty frizzy/fluffy the day I wash it. Was hoping this would smooth it out but didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. Also, 4.2 oz is tiny!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair softer and more manageable  -  just a small amount needed. Does not leave a greasy feel on the hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some people are so crazy about this product. I like it just fine but the shine factor did not last even an hour on my hair. It looked great when I first applied it, but then just kind of disappeared. I have dry hair so that could be why. It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have fine frizzy hair and I have tried dozens, if not hundreds of hair products to control and improve it. Nothing has worked as well as this one. I apply it on damp hair and it dries to soft, sooooo shiny, like I have never seen it before. No need to blow dry, and it makes it a breeze to use the flat iron afterwards. I have been using Moroccan Oil lately but this is 100 times better, I wish I knew about this product sooner. All my friends ask me what kind of \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; I have done, it looks like the day after I did an (expensive) keratin treatment. So worth the price!</li>
            <li> Item was satisfactory........shipping took too long.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders….I live in CA so not a lot of humidity here; however, my hair sometimes has a mind of it&#x27;s own, which is why I purchased this for my trip back to the Midwest.  I can tell you that this kept my hair from frizzing, even with the unbearable humidity.  It left my hair soft and smelling wonderfully, not the slightest bit greasy or weighted down.  Will definitely be a go to product from here on out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, helped moisturizer dry and Coe damaged hair.  Would buy again in the future.  But this requires to many words</li>
            <li> Using it on my damp, coarse hair helps it lay flat for days!! It also gives shine.  There is some drying after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much! Product arrived on time and perfect! Very nice! Beautiful and useful. I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It is the best for calming naturally curly hair. Hair Feels super silky and manageable after using the Kerastase line.</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this product! This stuff is doing wonderful things for my hair. I think this is great for all hair types but especially dry damaged hair like mine. It is not greasy either....love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Nothing to &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; you hair. This is simply an oil syrum like the many others on the market. Product is over priced and mine came with a Chinese lable put over the original one. I do not think all of the positive reviews are real. I also experienced this with two other hair products. What is going on Amazon? This product is way too expensive for what it does. Dissapointing!</li>
            <li> Excellent for thick frizzy hair. I apply before blow drying and it makes my hair shiny and manageable. Highly recomnend</li>
            <li> This is liquid gold in a bottle ! I have to have this all the time for my hair . Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but not all by itself.  I first apply a product called (brand) Bed Head &amp;#34;Control Freak.&amp;#34;  I then blow dry my hair -- and then apply this product -- and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; it about another 5&amp;#34;.  I LOVE the combination.  My hair is somewhat coarse, wavy, and has a LOT of body.  This product seemed to add more body to it (which I don&#x27;t need).  If your hair needs body -- and isn&#x27;t wavy, this may be just the product for you.  I like this product, but I also use BioSilk, and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li> It just takes a few drops of this product mixed in with leave in conditioner. It does wonders for your hair.</li>
            <li> I already knew the product and anything from kerastase is just the best anyone can get for hair. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.  A little drop applied to wet hair, comb through and style.  It keeps my hair smooth without adding volume.  It is without fragrance which is very important to me</li>
            <li> this serum make my hair very smooth. No tangle hair anymore.  This is a great product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I know this product is kind of expensive.... but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I have really long hair with very dry ends. this product makes my hair really soft and smooth... become easy to brush my hair.&lt;br /&gt;if you don&#x27;t like those oil leave in conditioner, you should try this one, the result is the same as the moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have long hair, that is wavy, sometimes too wavy!  Just 2 pumps evenly distributed makes my hair calm right down, leaves a great sheen but not oily, and really supple.  I bought this months ago and I still have quite a bit, it goes a long way, has almost no scent either to interfere with you other scents.</li>
            <li> perfect item and came over the pond in just a week</li>
            <li> This stuff really tames the frizz and you only need a little bit. Plus it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Service was awesome...ive only used it twice..my hair wont hold a curl when I use it.</li>
            <li> Its good, its functional , its working very well, I m still using ... but the smell in my humble opnion its not one of the better. I will try other kind next time. ;P</li>
            <li> Excellent product for minimizing frizx</li>
            <li> my all time favorite serum for frizziesz!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and shiny. Smells great and just few drops go a long way. It works great for anti frizz in a rainy windy day.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Adds great sheen to hair without making it feel oily or slick.  I don&#x27;t feel like it weighs my hair down at all.  I get tons of compliments on how shiny my hair is.  Get this!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite hair product.  Expensive, but it lasts a long time.  Only use a little bit-or else it will make your hair flat and oily.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, and it works fantastic, as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.  Makes it shiny and smooth looking.</li>
            <li> very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product i&#x27;ve tried in my entire life!!!! Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> The only product my wife and oldest daughter will use after a smoothing treatment. Amazon&#x27;s price is $20 less than the salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and then the salons stopped carrying it. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> rose scent, make my dry hair very smooth and moistrizing, not very oil</li>
            <li> This is the most loved hair product I have! It makes&lt;br /&gt;My hair shinny without looking greasy and on the top of it... Smells really good!</li>
            <li> and a little goes a LONG way! I like that it doesn&#x27;t stick my hair to itself, so it&#x27;s still easy to brush through after it&#x27;s dry. I put it on towel-dried hair, but sometimes put a microscopic amount on my ends after they are dry and styled, or even the next day. Smooths and give a little &amp;#34;chunkiness&amp;#34; and separation to the ends of my too thick, too full, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair with a natural wave so when I blow it out the ends are a bit frizzy and fly away. My stylist used this on me and it was great but she said be careful because there&#x27;s a professional version and a consumer version... Maybe that&#x27;s why when I use it I&#x27;m not blown away with the results. I guess this is the consumer line. Not overly impressed and the next day my hair looks greasy I&#x27;ve tried varying the amount to no avail. Will keep searching for a product that works or not save money and try buying from my salon. Was promised by seller free upgrade to 2-day shipping which is why I went with this seller even though they were only $2 more. Didn&#x27;t upgrade took several days so be wary of this seller.</li>
            <li> I have never used a better brand than Keratase.  This makes my fine hair look great.  My hair becomes greasy fast especially when I use products but I use this stuff twice in the morning, TWICE.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy, feels natural and becomes super super soft.  It may cost you more but you will be happy you put the Paul Mitchell junk down!</li>
            <li> Kerastase has incredible products.  This serum is extremely lightweight, but still has the benefits of dimethicone in making hair look sleek and manageable. It smells lovely.  The product arrived on time and was well priced.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to product to everyone who has fine hair like I do. It really makes my hair smooth and shine. My friends keep asking what treatments I did on my hair :)</li>
            <li> This product is okay . This is made by L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al.  There are many L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al products out there for a quarter of the price that will get the same results.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time while straightening.  All Kerastase products are AWESOME.  The other Oleo products that go with this one are also amazing</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering this product...I have a lot of extremely curly, fine hair that is unmanageable. I live in an extremely hot and some times muggy climate, and that doesn&#x27;t help things. It can take me an hour to straighten my hair only to still have it some what frizzy and then I step outside and it curls right back up...so frustrating! With about 4 pumps of this stuff tho added to my damp hair, I can blow dry and curl it with in 30 minutes, and it makes my hair so silky and soft, and best of all straight! It doesn&#x27;t curl back up, even in humidity. This is by far my favorite hair product, and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> We all know that coloring hair damages the ends (split ends) and no product I have found so far has corrected these the way that the Oleo-Relax serum does. I had bought this in France a few years ago but could never find it in the States. All of the Kerastase products are superior to any I have found in the world.</li>
            <li> Love Keratase products!  My blonde, dry, brittle, aging hair looks transformed after using Keratase.  Its a bit expensive, but considering that hair is so important to feeling and looking good, its worth the splurge.  After all nothing makes someone look more aged than a head of damaged and dry hair!</li>
            <li> Loved this serum - the fragrance and the soft luster it added to my hair. It also helped my hair to feel softer just after washing (my hair is naturally very coarse).  It was a bit pricey, but I believe I have seen recent price points for half the cost.</li>
            <li> very very very  good for my hair...After wash hair, put 2 drops of kerastase nutritive oleo relax serum makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks. I have fine, but coarse wavy hair. I leave it in after I shower (2small pumps) and it makes my hair SUPER soft and manageable. Normally, I would have to use a straightener to straighten my hair, to make it soft. But, with this, I can let it air dry and then use a curling iron to style it and it looks awesome!! This product is super pricey, but I&#x27;ve tried tons of things on my hair, and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well on curly/thick hair, both wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Really light consistcy and scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have thick, color-treated/highlighted hair and have tried many serums to tame my frizzy hair and this is the best out of all of them.  I use this with the Kerastase Elixir Ultime The Imperial Oleo Complex.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent but once I put the Oleo Complex the scent is bearable.  I am not too sure that this comes packaged in a box shrink-wrapped.  I went to the salon and they were being sold outside the box.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years! It makes my hair feel soft and not oily. I use it in conjunction with a curl cream. It is a little pricey but worth it to me</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product to use if you don&#x27;t want your hair curling up in humid weather especially.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oleo-Relax Serum for years and it is fantastic. It makes my hair less frizzy when I straighten it. It also makes it so soft! I&#x27;m not usually one to spend much money on beauty products, but I will always buy this!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this prodect before so I bought it for Amazon.  I am versy surprised because I do not feel this product has the same qulity of the product that I have bought.  I can not camb my hair easily like the time that I used the product that I bought form a salon.  My hair is very dry so I will find a product that could help me.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but have a Brazilian Blowout. My hair tends to get very dry because I&#x27;m blow drying more now that I have straight hair. My hairdresser first used this product on my hair and I finally bought some for myself. I love this product. It not only adds shine and volume, but it has a great scent too. I highly recommend this product for anyone with hair that tends to be dry and possibly frizzy. It&#x27;s great and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> One pump goes a long way. It will last 6 months. I used to use frizz ease and bio silk but this product is by far better. I have wavy hair -- it is great for de-frizzing as well as protecting your hair when blow drying. I used to buy this at hair salons for $40. Thanks for the smazing deal!!!</li>
            <li> Not too sticky, it doesnt make my hair too shiny &amp; smells good! I like it.</li>
            <li> I use this after I finish flat ironing my hair. Goes good with Oleo Relax Creme. Provides shine but doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I&#x27;ve tried various serums but this one is my favorite and it lasts forever because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product while on a cruise in the Italian Riviera.  I had a hair cut, the stylist used this product and I could see how well it worked with my hair.  A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a long time.  The serum controls the hair and adds shine.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin as well as on my hair.  I love this oil.  It also smells good</li>
            <li> Gives a shine to hair</li>
            <li> Price, shipping and timeliness - perfect  combination.  Other conditioners seem to dry out my hair but this product leaves it soft and manageable.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best...good for static taming freezy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works just like the other serums you could buy at Target (like Oleo therapy serum by Loreal) but at a cheaper price...</li>
            <li> I have short salt and pepper hair.  Gray hair is very dry and unruly. I have tried tons of stuff and nothing really works.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product and the reviews were great. This  stuff is not cheap so I thought it must be good.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried for about two months and my hair is exactly as before, unruly and very dry. I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had my money back.</li>
            <li> This works - doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy, I use it on wet and a little on dry hair.  Makes hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> me and my husband just love this product/ light and gives to great healthy look to  our hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2000. Best product for smooth manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, soft shiny hair, with no extra oil residue. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a perm that did not respond to any other conditioner. This works very well. I introduced my hairdresser to it and recommended it highly. I will definitely reorder it when needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is real or counterfeit (I hope it is real); but it makes my hair super soft and less dry. Even my stylist has commented on how much better my hair feels.</li>
            <li> works wonderfull on all types of hair beleive me they are worth every penny.I love what this Oleo-Serum has done for my natural soft curly hair,I&#x27;m able to manage my hair better with Kerastase than other products!!..I do recommend them all!!</li>
            <li> fantastic for knotty hair</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years love it</li>
            <li> fantastic...I have LONG fine hair but lots of it...I live in very humid south florida..amazed at how well this has worked...love all the Kerastase items..,,def worth the investment and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! After my last birthday, I promised myself that I would start &amp;#34;doing&amp;#34; my hair everyday. The only problem is that it is very thick, wavy, and has dried out some from coloring. I&#x27;ve seen this used on my hair at different times and never bothered to find out what it was, because I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be doing it myself at home. But, after my new promise to myself, I finally asked what it was, and bought it. It is great!!! When I style my hair (blow dry and either curl or straighten) it actually looks and feels healthier/shinier than if I just conditioned it and left it alone! I love this product! I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I am rating it because she is a 62 yr old beauty with hair that gets frequent compliments from others. Far less expensive at Amazon versus Vidal Sassonn where she previously purchased it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me who dyes your hair every 2-3 weeks for more than 2 years and i mean bleach it! Then this is your product. Dont even waste you time thinking it&#x27;s worth all your money! I have nice color hair and been told it&#x27;s still heathy looking!</li>
            <li> Kerastase products are hands down the on the market.  You can see a difference in your hair the first time you try it.  And I&#x27;ve tried everything!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair product I have ever used. It smooths my bushy hair and makes it look and feel wonderful! Well worth the price! Without it, I have to use a curling iron or flat iron to make my hair presentable. With it, my hair looks fine without doing a thing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, so happy i bought it.  I used the serum every day, just one to two drops.  The consistent of the serum is very light and liquid but does an amazing job in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase and all their products but this is my favorite! I have wavy hair which is unruly most of the time and this does the trick taming it! A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts a long time. If you use it every day, 1 pump is enough. It&#x27;s good for a year.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It came in a small bottle and  I was anxious to use it. I do not like the sprayer because it sprays too much product in one spot and it feels like spraying J&amp;J Baby Oil. I will not buy again for this price. It is not worth more than $10. I &#x27;ll continues looking for another product.</li>
            <li> Leaves no oily feeling, but it really reduces the frizz, calms my hair and gives it a hint of shine.  Very natural looking.  Too bad it does not travel well and is so expensive.</li>
            <li> So, I have to say, as an Indian girl with incredibly curly hair, this is the best serum out there to combat frizziness (and believe me, I have tried A LOT).  I blowdry my hair a few times a week and follow it up with a flat iron.  With this product, however, if I chose to forego the flatiron and just walk out of my apartment, my hair would be perfectly frizz free even if there was a monsoon outside.  I never travel without it.  Also, a little bit goes a long way.  I just reordered another bottle of it having used the last bottle for almost a full year.  All you need is one pump of it (if you do more than that, your hair may lose the volume and look flat).  Just trust me, this stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;As a closing note, I have also used this when I have left my hair naturally curly.  It really does work to combat the frizz. It&#x27;s pricey, but I promise it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Product shipped super fast and works AMAZING! Favorite product for my thick frizzy hair! Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased I did have to call and get help ordering, but they were wonderful. When you are old we don&#x27;t get all this high tech stuff, so thank you again. Charlene Smith</li>
            <li> Yeah, redhead, North Texas, 10 months of the year, REQUIRED.</li>
            <li> SUPER antifrizz product, smells delish!...</li>
            <li> My hair is silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any of the other products in this line.  This is the only one that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use this for 10 years more.Great fragrance and use with &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment&amp;#34;.I&#x27;m always push 10 pumps Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment and 3 or 4 pumps Oleo-reax Serum for my hair(my hair is very long),this W combo makes Super beautyful hair!!!</li>
            <li> too watery and doesn&#x27;t do the job of moisturizing. I boat one in Paris and it had a different texture.</li>
            <li> Best product for frizzy hair.  It is expensive but well worth the price.  A little goes a long long way.  All this product line is excellent.  Also try the oleo relax shampoo.  It is used in the best salons</li>
            <li> Thank you, this is the best product in the market to make your hair look great and health.  It is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real stuff. Super watery, not the thick oil that I know it needs to be. Also my hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same as it did with my other little glass bottle I got from a salon. Look at other companies or just order from the source.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who has processed hair the survived chemo, so she needs serous protection. This has kept her hair healthy &amp; shiny through dyes and daily blow drying. Shipping is slow because it&#x27;s from the UK, so don&#x27;t wait until you run out.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! Make my hair feel like silk! Fast shipping - plan to re-order when I am out. THANK you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I haven&#x27;t received a counterfeit version of this product. I have always absolutely LOVED this stuff and suddenly, for the first time in my life, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair products but this may rank as one of the best!  It is light on my hair, but controls and softens ,ike no other product.  Spent a bit more for the Kerastase, but have eliminated products from my daily routine.</li>
