            <li>&quot; I might pass this one onto my daughter and upgrade mine again after more research.</li>
            <li>Comb is a flexible plastic (not as rigid as my prior comb attachment) and when I looked in the box I found two if each attachment so I am very happy.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love all of the diffusers as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get five stars because the nozzle attachments pop off fairly easily and somehow bounce on my sink and go flying.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great volume of air and constant heat.</li>
            <li>Another thing that makes me happy is that my old diffuser attachment actually fits this dryer - doing a happy dance right now.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my first TS-2 that lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the double nozzled concentrator that came with it, it&#x27;s amazing for pre-drying.</li>
            <li>Had it for only one day - tried it out - and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>

            <li>Has a nice long cord.</li>
            <li>This blow-dry dries my hair incredibly fast, there is little or no frizz afterward which is amazing!</li>
            <li>When it gets too hot, it will trip the power.  </li>
            <li>Then I would have to use my flatiron several minutes trying to straighten my hair which cooked my hair some more .  </li>
            <li>It also has a long cord which is helpful if the room doesn&#x27;t have many sockets or if the sockets are not in convenient places.  </li>
            <li>You would never know I had curl in my hair and it leaves it a healthy dry.  </li>
            <li>Pick straitens very well.</li>
            <li>This is no longer a problem, my hair comes out straight and looking like</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful but not too loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed that I&#x27;ve dried my hair in the late afternoon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist and needed a high power blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Loving the T2 because it leaves my hair straighten to the point I&#x27;ve hardly had to use my flatiron.  </li>
            <li>so I have access to all the high tech brand new tools</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as loud as I expected and quieter than my last one, the air flow is great and dries my hair faster than my other one</li>
            <li>Powerful heats up just enough to dry but not burn your head and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>: Airflow could be better, electricity cable is long and thick</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and had problems with my hair sticking  up on top no matter what product I used.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a hairdryer with a bit more technology because I have always had long, thick hair.  </li>

            <li> Its as loud as any other blow dryer</li>
            <li> In the past I always bought my hair dryers at the drug store, never putting much thought in what I purchased.</li>
            <li> The drier is definitely not lightweight but drying time for my hair is not long so weight is not really a concern.</li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars because the power and speed buttons get hot when ur holding the dryer therefore shutting it off (a little inconvenient) but all in all very powerful and sturdy.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than expected</li>
            <li> and it usually takes forever for it to dry with other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair approximately 10 minutes quicker than my old dryer</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t burn my house down.  </li>
            <li> And it dries everything in half the time.</li>

            <li> Pros: good design, comfortable handle, good value (price / benefits)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Airflow could be better, electricity cable is long and thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product and I recommend.</li>
            <li> This blow-dry dries my hair incredibly fast, there is little or no frizz afterward which is amazing! Has a nice long cord. It doesn&#x27;t get five stars because the nozzle attachments pop off fairly easily and somehow bounce on my sink and go flying. Also, it is quite heavy.</li>

            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and needed a high power blow dryer. This one is awesome. Perfect size. And it dries everything in half the time. I love the double nozzled concentrator that came with it, it&#x27;s amazing for pre-drying. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is awesome. I have long thick hair and a normal blow dryer takes 10+ mins to dry my hair. This one has it down to 3 mins flat. Powerful heats up just enough to dry but not burn your head and gets the job done. Not too heavy at all. Its as loud as any other blow dryer but it gets the job done quicker. This is a steal for $40. Very happy with my purchase only t2&#x27;s for me from now on. Pick straitens very well. I don&#x27;t even need to flat iron after to get the fluff out.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great! Just as good as my T3 evolution. Can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again !</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer! In the past I always bought my hair dryers at the drug store, never putting much thought in what I purchased. I have thin hair and had problems with my hair sticking  up on top no matter what product I used. This is no longer a problem, my hair comes out straight and looking like I just left the salon. I would highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> I researched dryers and even though there were a couple negative reviews I gave it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I gave only 4 stars because the power and speed buttons get hot when ur holding the dryer therefore shutting it off (a little inconvenient) but all in all very powerful and sturdy. I&#x27;m a hairdresser so I have access to all the high tech brand new tools and I chose this. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  It does what it says.  When it gets too hot, it will trip the power.  I kind of like this feature so I don&#x27;t burn my house down.  It dries the hair quickly.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this blow dryer only a week and so far is a great hair dryer! In the week I&#x27;ve had it, I have encountered no problems. It gets very hot and my hair dries quickly.  It dries my hair approximately 10 minutes quicker than my old dryer and I do not use the hottest setting. I have thick, natural curly hair and this actually gets all my hair dry without frizzing. It&#x27;s powerful but not too loud. It also has a long cord which is helpful if the room doesn&#x27;t have many sockets or if the sockets are not in convenient places.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> excellent will buy another</li>
            <li> I like that it is powerful and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I am truly loving this hair dryer. I have thick, some what course hair with some curl and enough for three people.  Because of the weight and thickness my curl is a kinked up mess.  My old brand hair dryer would dry my hair but it left some curl, very frizzy, and dried out.  Then I would have to use my flatiron several minutes trying to straighten my hair which cooked my hair some more .  Loving the T2 because it leaves my hair straighten to the point I&#x27;ve hardly had to use my flatiron.  You would never know I had curl in my hair and it leaves it a healthy dry.  I&#x27;m so impressed that I&#x27;ve dried my hair in the late afternoon then gotten up the next day without having to do any touchups. This has never happened.  I would say the only drawback is the buttons are set up backwards to what I&#x27;m use to.  Every time I want to turn it off, I find myself turning it up.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the blow dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for about 2 weeks now and I have to say it works great.  It&#x27;s a little heavier than expected but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  It&#x27;s not as loud as I expected and quieter than my last one, the air flow is great and dries my hair faster than my other one and I love the attachments. I would recommend this dryer to anyone!</li>
            <li> Creates great shine and straightens hair easily.  It is loud, powerful, and a bit heavy but does the job in less time so I am happy with it.  I wanted to try a hairdryer with a bit more technology because I have always had long, thick hair.  Now that I am convinced there is \\&quot;something to them\\&quot; I might pass this one onto my daughter and upgrade mine again after more research. The heaviness is the only reason I gave it four out of five stars because I have a shoulder/neck issue.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. Had it for only one day - tried it out - and it does a good job. Comb is a flexible plastic (not as rigid as my prior comb attachment) and when I looked in the box I found two if each attachment so I am very happy. Another thing that makes me happy is that my old diffuser attachment actually fits this dryer - doing a happy dance right now. The drier is definitely not lightweight but drying time for my hair is not long so weight is not really a concern.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. I have long, thick hair and it usually takes forever for it to dry with other blow dryers. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly without frizz and does not get too hot. I love all of the diffusers as well. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my first TS-2 that lasted for many years.  It is powerful and has a great feel in my hand.</li>
            <li> Great volume of air and constant heat.</li>
