            <li>Makes your scalp feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>Since first finding it, I have never been able to find it again in brick and mortar stores!  </li>
            <li>This is my second order, love the product, great service</li>
            <li>Helps to make my hair smooth work blow drying.</li>
            <li>Great product, recommend purchase, have used for several years</li>
            <li>I first found this on sale at a CVS and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many hair products and honestly this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and I love the smell of it!</li>
            <li>Really makes your hair smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty light</li>
            <li>I have been buying it, in bulk online ever since and its definitely worth the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>Guess it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>My all-time favorite is J. Frieda Nourish + Style which evidently is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for some, this product would be enough.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s all that strengthening.</li>
            <li>it sooooooooooooooooo much it smells so nic on hair</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and it smells great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>Frieda has a whole host of \\&quot;Root Awakening\\&quot; products and frequently this one is not on the shelves.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that can get frizzy; this stuff works to keep everything smoothed down nicely before you apply a finishing product, such as mousse, etc.</li>
            <li>I randomly bought this once and was surprised at what a great product it was.</li>
            <li>However, my hair has a lot of volume and is pretty coarse</li>
            <li>I have use alot of the John Frieda products in the past, i have told a few people about the product and feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole last bunch I could lay my hands on</li>
            <li>But seems it is either in short supple or not available any more.</li>
            <li>It really does offer the right amount of control and shine and is at the same time very light and leaves my hair touchable and soft as apposed to other products that leave it greasy or brittle or sticky and hard.  </li>
            <li>A good product, yet a little hard to find in my area.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> He just smooths it on short hair and let&#x27;s it air dry.</li>
            <li> blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair looked and was shocked to know that I blow dry/flat iron almost every day.</li>
            <li> I use on wet hair after showering before styling, &amp; don&#x27;t need gel.</li>
            <li> I think it takes me a few months (6ish) to get through this entire bottle!</li>
            <li> and I have long medium weight hair with a little wave and texture to it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this all throughout my hair, starting at my scalp and working towards the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Also this product is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or make it feel stiff or sticky like other blow dry creams.</li>
            <li> Alas, the results are not the same.  </li>
            <li> You just need a small amount and it is not oily nor weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> I have terrible problems with flyaways, and this certainly helps, although doesn&#x27;t completely control them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before quite often in the past</li>
            <li> A bit hard to find these days...</li>
            <li> Now its so hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Its hard to find in stores, so I will def order again</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this smoothing lotion from John Frieda. All you need is a tiny amount, applied to damp hair. I have wavy hair that can get frizzy; this stuff works to keep everything smoothed down nicely before you apply a finishing product, such as mousse, etc. A bit hard to find these days...Frieda has a whole host of \\&quot;Root Awakening\\&quot; products and frequently this one is not on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I first found this on sale at a CVS and fell in love with it.  It really does offer the right amount of control and shine and is at the same time very light and leaves my hair touchable and soft as apposed to other products that leave it greasy or brittle or sticky and hard.  Since first finding it, I have never been able to find it again in brick and mortar stores!  I have been buying it, in bulk online ever since and its definitely worth the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and I love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> works alright. not the best of the leave in conditioner/lotion types but is good for the price. a little goes a long way and it smells great but I don&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite is J. Frieda Nourish + Style which evidently is no longer available.  The container shape is the same as the Strength and Restoring formula so thought I&#x27;d try it.  Alas, the results are not the same.  Guess it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before quite often in the past so I know it well.  Really makes your hair smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for this in many stores but have been unable to find it. So glad to see it on Amazon. I use on wet hair after showering before styling, &amp; don&#x27;t need gel.</li>
            <li> i think it smells like calming mint must buy WILL BUY MORE i looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it sooooooooooooooooo much it smells so nic on hair</li>
            <li> Non sticky, washes off easily, nice smell. Been very happy with the product. But seems it is either in short supple or not available any more. I bought the whole last bunch I could lay my hands on</li>
            <li> Used to use a product from Aveeda on my hair that was four times the price. Found this at Walmart several years ago and have used it since. Helps to make my hair smooth work blow drying. Walmart stopped carrying it and now can only find on Amazon. Have to stock up. My husband and I both use it. He just smooths it on short hair and let&#x27;s it air dry.</li>
            <li> Works well as conditioner, but it also works to help repel mosquitos because of the eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> I love this mint smell! I usually apply this all throughout my hair, starting at my scalp and working towards the ends of my hair. This is creamy and light! I think it takes me a few months (6ish) to get through this entire bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this product and am sorry that it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is my second order, love the product, great service</li>
            <li> I have used this product with very good results for a couple of years.  I am amazed that it is being discontinued.  I can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li> i love this product! of course i discovered it as it became discontinued, but i&#x27;m happy i found it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product, recommend purchase, have used for several years</li>
            <li> Really love the smell of this.  Makes your scalp feel healthy.  Not sure if it really strengthens or not!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this that I tried and just loved the way it made my hair feel.  I have terrible problems with flyaways, and this certainly helps, although doesn&#x27;t completely control them.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair gross the next day as some smoothing products do.</li>
            <li> I have use alot of the John Frieda products in the past, i have told a few people about the product and feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty light and I have long medium weight hair with a little wave and texture to it. I&#x27;m not sure it really does the trick. Smells good, but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s all that strengthening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair product for over a year now. It works really well.It&#x27;s very light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for a couple of years now.  I have wavey, coarse hair that requires a lot of product to manage.  This smoothing lotion is the foundation product I use.  I&#x27;m sure for some, this product would be enough.  However, my hair has a lot of volume and is pretty coarse so it needs extra work.</li>
            <li> I randomly bought this once and was surprised at what a great product it was. Now its so hard to find in stores so I have to buy it on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry and flat iron my hair almost every day and this product keeps my hair looking hydrated and shiny. Even my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair looked and was shocked to know that I blow dry/flat iron almost every day. Also this product is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or make it feel stiff or sticky like other blow dry creams.</li>
            <li> A good product, yet a little hard to find in my area. You just need a small amount and it is not oily nor weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> John Frieda smoothing lotion is great to get the frizz out of your hair and I have tried many hair products and honestly this is the only one that works. Its hard to find in stores, so I will def order again</li>
