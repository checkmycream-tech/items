            <li> I had my doubts that the little bit of oily liquid in one capsule would tame my sheep-like hair, but tame it it did! Shiny, not greasy, light not heavy...this is also perfect for travel. Throw one for each day into your bag and you can leave a host of other haircare at home. My one tip is to not twist the cap of the geltab off for use...things can get messy. I use a little scissors and then pour the ingredients into my palms and smooth away on damp hair. Shine that is clean and free was never so easy.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It leave my hair healthy and shiny I can&#x27;t stop using it and smells divine</li>
            <li> I use one of these softgels on my face nightly.  Made an improvement on my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin!  (an excess I rub on my hair).  Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys these things.  They are small capsules with twist off tops.  Once broken, you squeeze the oils onto your palms and work it into your hair.

            <li> This works great on your hair or your face!  I use it mostly as a facial moisturizer.  My skin is very dry and this goes on and absorbs very quickly and my skin feels so soft!  I have also used this as a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; and let it totally absorb before applying foundation and the foundation goes on much more smoothly.

            <li> Nevo Hydra Pearls&lt;br /&gt;Best hair oil I have used.  Not thick or greasy.  Leaves my ends soft.  I have to use 2beads on my longish hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and smooth....love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with this product. If you like silicones, then you will like this. Also, if ysed sparingly, you won&#x27;t get that build up, weighed down feeling. On the plus side, smells great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the results I get after applying this product to my thick, coarse, chemically treated hair. I apply one of this drops to my hair every week after it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I really love these pearls.  It was just as described.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair (but a LOT of it). It used to be silky, shiny, and straight, but quite a few years ago, suddenly changed and got wavy and frizzy.  Also, my I live where there is hard water which is not good for hair. I have tried so many products to stop the frizzies. Most products weigh my hair down and/or make it oily.  Nevo Hydra Pearls is the first product that actually works with my hair to make it silky and manageable without weighing it down. My hair is actually bouncy. It works great with my straightening iron which I use sparingly because it tends to damage my hair.  These \\&quot;pearls\\&quot; are great to travel with too.  I have medium length hair and I sometimes only use half the contents of one pearl but even a whole one will not make it greasy.  I rub it evenly on my hands and apply it first, to the driest part of my hair (which is the back) and then I work the rest through.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have dry  and colored hair.i get softness and shine with this. Fist found it by my hair dresser. Much cheaper on amiazon, I have shared with my friends  and they agree</li>
