            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Turns out that the warm moist air brought all the dirt to the surface.</li>
            <li>The concept is nice but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>These are new to me and I am still working out the way they work best</li>
            <li>to better help you understand the product</li>
            <li>and it was okay...</li>
            <li>It is more of a skin breaker.  </li>
            <li>My Wife likes them, it does the job better than fingernails alone.  </li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>But it doesnt really take off a lot of blackhead, its a good product if you dont have a lot of blackheads, but</li>
            <li>Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sharp and very nice plated silver color.</li>
            <li>but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>And this wasn&#x27;t worth the &amp;</li>
            <li>Its amazing that something so small and cheap can have a huge impact on someones life.</li>
            <li>and it pops right out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>but they do exactly what they advertise.  </li>
            <li>Tried countless different methods and all i ended up with was red perfect circles on my face....if you are looking to turn into a dalmatian then i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The loops on the end are too large for my pores, the lancet on the end however is nice and sharp</li>
            <li>Everything was shipped fast, items was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to get at stubborn pimples &amp; blackheads.</li>
            <li>It looked great, tired it</li>
            <li>This this doesn&#x27;t really extract the way you think it does.  </li>
            <li>but after wash your face really well and put some moisturizer on</li>
            <li>and its much easier to use  - as anticipated</li>
            <li>After your face is done, it feels like it&#x27;s actually smaller, and baby smooth...</li>
            <li>Really haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet..</li>
            <li>You guys play too much games with my order.</li>
            <li>I put all my faith and money into amazon and this is the thanks</li>
            <li>These are really just needles with a rounded edge at the end.  </li>
            <li>Invest in a tweezerman extractor for real results.</li>
            <li>Love this little tool.</li>
            <li>This is the only extractor I use the loop is just perfect and the metal isn&#x27;t too thick like all the other ones ive tried</li>
            <li>the long one i got is a little bended, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>it is and ok product very confusing to use needs to come with some sort of instructions</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even really want to use it on my skin due to this.</li>
            <li>The lancing point is not sharp at all and the round part is too large.</li>
            <li>Get at a magnifying mirror, set the ring end down on the edge of a full pore, and press down and in...  </li>

            <li> Great extractors especially considering the price which wasn&#x27;t bad for 2!</li>
            <li> Is not gentle enough on the face.  </li>
            <li> Just note it does take a long time to get this mailed to you.</li>
            <li> i use it for taking out the stubborn little tiny white head pimple or acne on my face.</li>
            <li> It worked but be very careful not to go to deep.  </li>
            <li> I always scarred my face when I would try to remove black heads &amp; white heads, and I always felt like I didn&#x27;t get everything out!</li>
            <li> Also, use the little tool the big tool is clunky.</li>
            <li> The topic is gross, but these little tools EMPTY pores.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s painful and my eyes tear up every time I use it.</li>
            <li> this one is not really for you.</li>
            <li> hurts for deeper ones, but thats to be expected</li>
            <li> #60;$5.00 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t anything that i expected it to be, it hurts like hell when you use the circle part to extract.</li>
            <li> i love this tool i used to have really bad black heads</li>
            <li> All you do is puncture the blackhead, then press the blackhead remover, at the other end, over it</li>
            <li> Just take your time, hold the skin then break it with the sharp end.</li>
            <li> The tips weren&#x27;t sharp, some of the metal was rusted.</li>
            <li> Stubborn pimples and blackheads can be poked with the needle end and the other end gets the rest of the impurities out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, though, they look pointier and sharper than the other brand lancet, so I decided to keep them.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The sharp end could be sharper.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove acne like other ones I&#x27;ve bought before</li>
            <li> I guess I should have payed the 13 bucks for the other one amazon had.</li>
            <li> It does hurt to push down in some areas but that could be because of the lack of fat in those areas.</li>
            <li> Tool is a little too sharp on both ends.</li>
            <li> The object I got looked vaguely like this, but instead of 2 different tools I was sent 2 copies of the same tool, neither of which was like the ones described of pictured.  </li>
            <li> I ended up have to throw out half of them.</li>
            <li> Hate is a strong word</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll dab a little bit of Hydrogen Peroxide afterwords.</li>
            <li> Leaves a little bit of a sting.  </li>
            <li> My nose is the worse for blackheads and this is the only thing that will get it out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li> Proactive was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Some of the needles were sharp and pointy but some was dull.</li>
            <li> So small that I purchased it and my neat freak mother lost it on me, that is a feat in itself.</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> On a more serious note... my oldest son at 16 has horrible acne.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on clearing my black heads and also popping painful white heads.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed, as I was looking for a tool similar to what the dermatologist uses.</li>
            <li> Also delivery was very slow.</li>
            <li> It is really poor material quality.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this at all.</li>
            <li> These needles need to be very sharp otherwise, extraction would be very painful.  </li>
            <li> It was annoying and it caused my acne to get worse.</li>
            <li> Using my APNEA machine at night with a mask and heated moist air, my nose swelled up and was painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> takes all that dirt and nasty stuff out of your face.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only extractor I use the loop is just perfect and the metal isn&#x27;t too thick like all the other ones ive tried</li>
            <li> Makes getting ingrown hairs and popping pimples easy. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Love this little tool. It works very well. Especially with a makeup mirror. It&#x27;s much easier to get at stubborn pimples &amp; blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love this! All you do is puncture the blackhead, then press the blackhead remover, at the other end, over it and it pops right out. My nose is the worse for blackheads and this is the only thing that will get it out.</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes my job easier</li>
            <li> I always scarred my face when I would try to remove black heads &amp; white heads, and I always felt like I didn&#x27;t get everything out! It was annoying and it caused my acne to get worse. The extractors are wonderful. I just soak them in alcohol and use them. I&#x27;ll dab a little bit of Hydrogen Peroxide afterwords. Great extractors especially considering the price which wasn&#x27;t bad for 2!</li>
            <li> it is and ok product very confusing to use needs to come with some sort of instructions to better help you understand the product</li>
            <li> The loops on the end are too large for my pores, the lancet on the end however is nice and sharp</li>
            <li> The Needles arrived blunt and damaged, they look like they had been dropped on the floor before being inserted into the packaging.  These needles need to be very sharp otherwise, extraction would be very painful.  I would not recommend purchasing these because you cannot control the quality of what you receive and it&#x27;s a hassle to dispute a couple of dollars.</li>
            <li> Tool is a little too sharp on both ends. Is not gentle enough on the face.  Was disappointed, as I was looking for a tool similar to what the dermatologist uses.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. It works wonders on clearing my black heads and also popping painful white heads. Would definitely reccommend. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The lancing point is not sharp at all and the round part is too large. I would not buy or recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The object I got looked vaguely like this, but instead of 2 different tools I was sent 2 copies of the same tool, neither of which was like the ones described of pictured.  Don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li> It looked great, tired it and it was okay... But it doesnt really take off a lot of blackhead, its a good product if you dont have a lot of blackheads, but if you do... this one is not really for you.</li>
            <li> This this doesn&#x27;t really extract the way you think it does.  It is more of a skin breaker.  It worked but be very careful not to go to deep.  Leaves a little bit of a sting.  Just take your time, hold the skin then break it with the sharp end. Also, use the little tool the big tool is clunky.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with post-menopausal acne.  Without getting graphic, let me say these are so helpful in keeping me well groomed and presentable.</li>
            <li> i love this tool i used to have really bad black heads and i have been using it for a while and let me tell you if your sons or daughters have acne problems this is the tool to get for them. takes all that dirt and nasty stuff out of your face. but after wash your face really well and put some moisturizer on</li>
            <li> These are new to me and I am still working out the way they work best but they do exactly what they advertise.  It did take a bit longer than I thought for them to make it all the way to Texas but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> works as intended. hurts for deeper ones, but thats to be expected</li>
            <li> Everything was shipped fast, items was exactly as described. Does what it says will do. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great quality product</li>
            <li> Simple and effective. Just note it does take a long time to get this mailed to you.</li>
            <li> Hate is a strong word so I&#x27;m just gonna say I didn&#x27;t like this. The tips weren&#x27;t sharp, some of the metal was rusted. You get what you pay for. And this wasn&#x27;t worth the &amp;#60;$5.00 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> On a more serious note... my oldest son at 16 has horrible acne. His face practically talks to me saying, &amp;#34;Squeeze me please!&amp;#34;. For years we have tried all types of treatments to no avail. Even on antibiotics and medication from the doctor did nothing. Proactive was a waste of time and money. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. Although I have never had acne, i did have numerous blackheads on my nose. Using my APNEA machine at night with a mask and heated moist air, my nose swelled up and was painful to the touch. Turns out that the warm moist air brought all the dirt to the surface. I found these tools and they made all the difference in the world. Stubborn pimples and blackheads can be poked with the needle end and the other end gets the rest of the impurities out. Its amazing that something so small and cheap can have a huge impact on someones life. We bought a steaming facial sauna and combined it with this product. My sons face is clearer that prepuberty....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, though, they look pointier and sharper than the other brand lancet, so I decided to keep them.&lt;br /&gt;But still I don&#x27;t know if they are sharper than sewing needles.  I wanted something sharper than regular sewing needles.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with blackheads and no matter what treatments, creams, strips, astringents, whatever... nothing helps... but this. Sure, it&#x27;s painful and my eyes tear up every time I use it. But it works. Every woman knows that with beauty, comes pain.</li>
            <li> works wonders on blackheads!</li>
            <li> It does the job. The sharp end could be sharper. It does hurt to push down in some areas but that could be because of the lack of fat in those areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product.  Nothing else worked, but this did.  Great price for what it does. :)</li>
            <li> My Wife likes them, it does the job better than fingernails alone.  and its much easier to use  - as anticipated</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this at all. Tried countless different methods and all i ended up with was red perfect circles on my face....if you are looking to turn into a dalmatian then i highly recommend. Also delivery was very slow.</li>
            <li> These are the bomb.  The topic is gross, but these little tools EMPTY pores.  Get at a magnifying mirror, set the ring end down on the edge of a full pore, and press down and in...  I&#x27;m warning you, it gets addicting.  After your face is done, it feels like it&#x27;s actually smaller, and baby smooth...</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than I thought from China. Looks like good quality.  Really haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet..</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t anything that i expected it to be, it hurts like hell when you use the circle part to extract.</li>
            <li> You guys play too much games with my order. I put all my faith and money into amazon and this is the thanks I did</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove acne like other ones I&#x27;ve bought before</li>
            <li> i got it almost 3 weeks after i placed the order. it&#x27;s sharp and very nice plated silver color. the long one i got is a little bended, but it&#x27;s ok. i use it for taking out the stubborn little tiny white head pimple or acne on my face. i love it..</li>
            <li> Some of the needles were sharp and pointy but some was dull. I ended up have to throw out half of them.</li>
            <li> The concept is nice but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> These are really just needles with a rounded edge at the end.  Not very good. Invest in a tweezerman extractor for real results. This thing just hurts to use.</li>
            <li> So small that I purchased it and my neat freak mother lost it on me, that is a feat in itself.</li>
            <li> Despite the great price, I cannot use this tool because it leaves bruises and gashes in my skin.  Didn&#x27;t want to extract skin along with pimples.</li>
            <li> It is really poor material quality. I don&#x27;t even really want to use it on my skin due to this. I guess I should have payed the 13 bucks for the other one amazon had. Then I might have actually tried using it on myself.</li>
