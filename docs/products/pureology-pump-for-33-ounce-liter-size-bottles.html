            <li>Great price, product and arrived quickly!</li>

            <li>Color is nice and neutral.</li>
            <li>Nice, controllable pump.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; fast delivery</li>
            <li>just make sure it&#x27;s an angle cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had authentic Pureology pumps</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to everyone for sure</li>
            <li>Was concerned based on the other reviews, but these fit my pureology liter bottle just great!  </li>
            <li>They work just fine for what they were bought for.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick!</li>
            <li>Pump fits perfectly, love using it in shower, great for professional or home use, having each a matching large shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Do yourself a HUGE favor and follow the directions given in the package.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want to handle the huge bottle every time I needed it</li>
            <li>Fits well, works well, and I enjoy using the liter size shampoo and conditioner without picking up the bottles....</li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t fit the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The caps fit</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pump that will fit the BreathRX bottle that I bought.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it is working fine...</li>
            <li>They pump smoothly and give just the right amount of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li>This pump is somewhat universal in that it fits tall bottles nicely; but, if your bottle is shorter, you must cut the tube to fit the height.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>my shower looks clean and organized&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>Pretty basic pump, cost effective and works as intended.</li>
            <li>Quick and fast service</li>
            <li>First - obviously you assemble the two pieces they come in (insert the straw bottom into the top piece with the pump).  </li>
            <li>you try to put it in the bottle first, you will experience one of those &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>I almost gave up and ordered another pump to avoid more rigamarole but seller finally came through with a working pump.</li>
            <li>Even a simple item like this is easily found on their site.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier for me to use the large bottles with a pump.</li>
            <li>This pump is a must for the large liter bottles of shampoo and conditioner .  </li>
            <li>I use this with my large bottle of pureology conditioner.  </li>
            <li>They will certainly work until you get about 2/3 of the way through the bottle</li>
            <li>These work fine, but you need to do the following:  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t come close enough to fit my 33 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li>Makes life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient.</li>
            <li>What good is a pump that can only pump out half of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a silly item to review, but it works perfectly and I would definitely buy again if I ever needed to!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t clear like the image shows, but is that really a problem?</li>
            <li>Seems that Amazon has become our one-stop shop for nearly everything.  </li>
            <li>Complete rip off.</li>
            <li>I am using for my pureology 33.8 OZ (As far as I know a 33 OZ bottle does not exist) bottles.</li>
            <li>Not convenient for shower of a shampoo bar as it sticks out too far</li>
            <li>But it was the second one I had to order because the first one didn&#x27;t open.  </li>
            <li>It is a cheap black generic pump.  </li>
            <li>A little long but easy to clip shorter</li>
            <li>The straw is not long enough and the pump won&#x27;t open.</li>

            <li> The straw is not long enough and the pump won&#x27;t open.</li>
            <li> They wre the same color as the cap (purple) and long enough to reach the bottom.</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today and the tube that goes into the bottle is only 5.5 inches long.  </li>
            <li> They are only 6 &amp;#34; long.  </li>
            <li> Stem was a little short for my shampoo bottle and the amount of shampoo that comes out with each pump is such a small amount that I end up pumping it multiple times to get the right amount I need</li>
            <li> and takes a long time to get the credit once you do return them.</li>
            <li> The tube that goes in the bottle was too long</li>
            <li> so I cut it which is not a problem, but the pump itself is 6\\&quot; long and industrial size.</li>
            <li> I worked with the seller and got them to believe me, that the pump wouldn&#x27;t open, and went through 2 or 3 emails with seller to finally get them to send me a pump sold at less than $4.  </li>
            <li> The tube only goes about half way into the bottle.  </li>
            <li> alright however the tube to suck up my shampoo and conditioner was and only half the length that it needed to be which means once I am halfway through these</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Then - BEFORE you put the pump into the bottle -  twist the shaft by holding the little nub on the shaft still, and release the pump.  </li>
            <li> You may need to trim the bottom of the straw a little bit...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> What a WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> well being quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Pump does NOT fit Pureology liter bottles.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> but I would say don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll end up with a mess!</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and find it too difficult to use the regular Pureology shampoo and conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li> I always get the ginormous bottle and it is hard to use in the shower and this pump does the trick</li>
            <li> I use it on a Pureology 33 oz bottle of thick conditioner and have no problems.</li>
            <li> The pureology stuff is really expensive, and it helps me limit waste.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and it does not pay for me to ship them back</li>
            <li> so I had to order it separately which I was not happy about.  </li>
            <li> item arrived broken and unusable</li>
            <li> Then you will get expensive shampoo (or whatever you are using) everywhere while you pull the pump out, wash it off, and try to figure out what&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> very poor packaging.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was concerned based on the other reviews, but these fit my pureology liter bottle just great!  Color is nice and neutral.</li>
            <li> Pump fits perfectly, love using it in shower, great for professional or home use, having each a matching large shampoo and conditioner my shower looks clean and organized&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fits well, works well, and I enjoy using the liter size shampoo and conditioner without picking up the bottles....it helps a lot with portion control. The pureology stuff is really expensive, and it helps me limit waste. One pump is all I need.</li>
            <li> Great price, product and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> The pump works great!</li>
            <li> perfect for pureology</li>
            <li> I realized after I received the product that I had 1/2 gallon bottles. which have a larger opening than the liter bottles.  Will save for later use.</li>
            <li> It works. I have arthritis in my hands and find it too difficult to use the regular Pureology shampoo and conditioner bottles. It&#x27;s easier for me to use the large bottles with a pump.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with my Pureology conditioner.  Works as intended.  No problems. Would purchase again if I ever need another one.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t clear like the image shows, but is that really a problem? They work just fine for what they were bought for.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come close enough to fit my 33 ounce bottle.  The tube only goes about half way into the bottle.  What good is a pump that can only pump out half of the bottle.  Maybe this is mislabeled and meant to go on the 8 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> These work fine, but you need to do the following:  First - obviously you assemble the two pieces they come in (insert the straw bottom into the top piece with the pump).  Then - BEFORE you put the pump into the bottle -  twist the shaft by holding the little nub on the shaft still, and release the pump.  REPEAT - do this BEFORE you put it into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try to put it in the bottle first, you will experience one of those &amp;#34;I keep turning and turning the nozzle and it won&#x27;t pop up&amp;#34; situations, like I did.  Then you will get expensive shampoo (or whatever you are using) everywhere while you pull the pump out, wash it off, and try to figure out what&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> Not what I needed, I was looking for something that was longer. It said it was for these bottles yet they don&#x27;t work. Dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a HUGE favor and follow the directions given in the package.  This pump is somewhat universal in that it fits tall bottles nicely; but, if your bottle is shorter, you must cut the tube to fit the height.  Don&#x27;t just plop the pump in the bottle thinking it&#x27;s made for what you bought (like me).  Take the time to measure and cut if necessary.  Otherwise, you&#x27;ll end up with a mess!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a solid design. I have had 2 of these for about a year, and they still work well.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick! Great deal!</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; fast delivery</li>
            <li> I always get the ginormous bottle and it is hard to use in the shower and this pump does the trick</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on the large bottle of Pureology conditioner! Just what I wanted. I would definitely recommend this item to any Pureology customer.</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today and the tube that goes into the bottle is only 5.5 inches long.  The length of the pump I am currently using is 8 inches.  This pump will only get me about halfway through my 33.8 oz bottles. The description for this product is misleading.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it is working fine...I&#x27;m kinda &amp;#34;pumped&amp;#34; about this deal! You may need to trim the bottom of the straw a little bit...just make sure it&#x27;s an angle cut.</li>
            <li> Way too short as in 2-3 inches from bottom. Will not reach bottom of bottle. Pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect to the 1000ml bottles. Quick and fast service</li>
            <li> I needed this because my product did not come with a pump so I had to order it separately which I was not happy about.  But I didn&#x27;t want to handle the huge bottle every time I needed it so got the pump.  The pump I rate 5 stars.  But it was the second one I had to order because the first one didn&#x27;t open.  I worked with the seller and got them to believe me, that the pump wouldn&#x27;t open, and went through 2 or 3 emails with seller to finally get them to send me a pump sold at less than $4.  I almost gave up and ordered another pump to avoid more rigamarole but seller finally came through with a working pump.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  Makes life so much easier.  They pump smoothly and give just the right amount of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> No issues with this pump. It was perfect for my pureology conditioner since that bottle didnt come with a pump</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do and it fits with the 33 oz Pureology products. It is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Stem was a little short for my shampoo bottle and the amount of shampoo that comes out with each pump is such a small amount that I end up pumping it multiple times to get the right amount I need</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This is not a Pureology Pump.  It is a cheap black generic pump.  What a WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Nice, controllable pump. Have one for shampoo and one for conditioner</li>
            <li> Seems that Amazon has become our one-stop shop for nearly everything.  Even a simple item like this is easily found on their site.  I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> Should have received two, only received one.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, and neither one of them worked!!!</li>
            <li> This pump is a must for the large liter bottles of shampoo and conditioner .  I ordered it the same time as the shampoo so it worked out perfect for me. I would order one extra just in case it would be needed.</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t fit the shampoo. and takes a long time to get the credit once you do return them. should be specific on what size it fits and what size it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product. I received it when they told me I would.It came packaged well being quite heavy. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. It&#x27;s to short for the 33.8 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product and pump!</li>
            <li> Pretty basic pump, cost effective and works as intended. I use this with my large bottle of pureology conditioner.  Recommend for anyone looking to buy a basic pump</li>
            <li> Pump does NOT fit Pureology liter bottles.  Pump was not as pictured.  Complete rip off.</li>
            <li> A little long but easy to clip shorter</li>
            <li> Fits the large Pureology bottles perfectly.</li>
            <li> Seems like a silly item to review, but it works perfectly and I would definitely buy again if I ever needed to!</li>
            <li> The straw is not long enough and the pump won&#x27;t open. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Fits and works perfect!</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read the dimensions.  These are NOT for the liter bottles.  I&#x27;ve had authentic Pureology pumps before that I got from my stylist.  They wre the same color as the cap (purple) and long enough to reach the bottom. They are only 6 &amp;#34; long.  They will certainly work until you get about 2/3 of the way through the bottle then you&#x27;re going to start sucking air.  Literally.  That said, I received them on time and I will use them in another product.  I</li>
            <li> I bought these pumps to use with my 33 ounce shampoo bottles and they are shorter then the ones I bought in the beauty supply store. I am so disappointed and it does not pay for me to ship them back I am very upset I wasted the money on them.</li>
            <li> very poor packaging. item arrived broken and unusable</li>
            <li> Just received my two pumps in the mail. I am using for my pureology 33.8 OZ (As far as I know a 33 OZ bottle does not exist) bottles.The caps fit alright however the tube to suck up my shampoo and conditioner was and only half the length that it needed to be which means once I am halfway through these will no longer be of use.  I will still be using them only because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of a return but I would say don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works great for both the conditioner and shampoo!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and received the item very quickly. Would recommend this product to everyone for sure</li>
            <li> The tube that goes in the bottle was too long so I cut it which is not a problem, but the pump itself is 6\\&quot; long and industrial size. Not convenient for shower of a shampoo bar as it sticks out too far</li>
            <li> The pump is perfect.  Works as expected.  Good price.  I use it on a Pureology 33 oz bottle of thick conditioner and have no problems.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pump that will fit the BreathRX bottle that I bought. And this one is just perfect!</li>
