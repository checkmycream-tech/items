            <li>I first got the Vitamin C Serum, liked it so much I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>The serum went on smoothly and absorbed well, so I had no issues in that respect.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and that gets super oily.  </li>
            <li>I started making my own facial lotions about a year ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps if I had continued to use this serum, my skin would have adjusted, but frankly, it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to find out.  </li>

            <li>I use coconut oil and pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>Still, the lines around my mouth are getting deeper, and I have some lines in my forehead as well, so these were the main areas in which I was interested in trying this</li>
            <li>That has really helped with the breakouts, but every once in a while I still have problems.</li>
            <li>Really like this product a lot.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum is a little more viscose</li>
            <li>I have always had skin that has been oily and tended towards breakouts, but as I have gotten older, I have found a regimen that generally works pretty well for me, and so I have experienced very few blemishes in the past year.  </li>

            <li>After I applied this, my skin felt clean and tight, and I ran around all day without putting on make-up.</li>
            <li>I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  </li>
            <li>At my age, if I have to live with wrinkles or acne, I choose the former!  </li>
            <li>I use it for when I see ongoing blemishes and by the next day I see the blemish clear up!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am 48 years old. I&#x27;ve had dark patches on face since the birth of my third child. I also still have breakouts. I started making my own facial lotions about a year ago. That has really helped with the breakouts, but every once in a while I still have problems. I started using the retinol about a week ago. My face is softer and more smooth and my dark spots are fading. So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> We all know retinol works, but some of them are so harsh. This one is just the right level.  I loved the thickness and silkiness of the serum.  I also like how fast it absorbed into my skin.  I am alternating with vitamin C serum and use Merlot moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> I  see an improvement in my skin after using this product for a short time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Already feel and see a difference is two applications.  Use only three drops. It goes a long way.  Definitely won&#x27;t be without this product.  Would recommend to anyone who is interested in improving the look and feel of your skin.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a couple of weeks now. I have to say that i absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I look years younger. My friends keep asking me what I am using.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This serum is thick and comes out of the dropper as a tiny, clear glob rather than a drop.  It is not oily and absorbs quickly.  I noticed a very slight burning sensation when I applied it to my face, but nothing distracting.  I was expecting the smell to be more neutral, but it has a faint chemical smell.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> very nice will buy again</li>
            <li> Great price.  Great product, makes my skin very soft and youthful looking. I like that the serum is organic. I must say I&#x27;ve only been using the product a few weeks so I&#x27;ve not seen changes in discoloration as of yet but I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll see changes in that also in the future.  I will repurchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I love Tree of Life products. I first got the Vitamin C Serum, liked it so much I ordered this.  They are well packed and arrive promptly.  The Vitamin C Serum is lightweight and cooling to the skin.  I use it on my face, neck and hands.  This serum is a little more viscose and I use it at night, since I read retinol  only works at night. I also use it on my face, neck and hands. I am a young looking middle aged woman and want to keep it that way.  I believe these products may just help.</li>
            <li> NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am in my late 40s, I am more interested in skin care products that assist with aging.  I have always had skin that has been oily and tended towards breakouts, but as I have gotten older, I have found a regimen that generally works pretty well for me, and so I have experienced very few blemishes in the past year.  Still, the lines around my mouth are getting deeper, and I have some lines in my forehead as well, so these were the main areas in which I was interested in trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried retinol products before without any particular success or problems.  I started by applying these serum sparingly, using only a few drops in the evening in the areas noted above.  The serum went on smoothly and absorbed well, so I had no issues in that respect.  Unfortunately, however, after just a couple of days of using this serum, I began experiencing breakouts for the first time in MONTHS--and in the EXACT areas in which I had applied this product.  This was extremely frustrating given that my skin had been clear for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if I had continued to use this serum, my skin would have adjusted, but frankly, it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me to find out.  At my age, if I have to live with wrinkles or acne, I choose the former!  Given this, I would not recommend this product to anyone prone to breakouts, although it may be worth a try for others.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it for when I see ongoing blemishes and by the next day I see the blemish clear up! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a really good serum, it helped with my pore size in just a few days.  It&#x27;s very creamy feeling on the skin, overall I am very pleased with this serum!!!</li>
            <li> Originally, I incorporated it with my antioxidant serum regimen and didn&#x27;t notice anything special.  I chalked it up to Already Treating My Skin to The Best Possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, about a week ago I got lazy, and instead of following up this serum with my antioxidants and then the moisturizer, I just put plenty of this Retinol on and went to bed.  The next night I did that again, and Darn! if I didn&#x27;t see a sleeker-looking surface!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, use it on a freshly-clean face, let it do its thing, without adding anything to your skin for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ve never experienced an irritation.</li>
            <li> Really like this product a lot.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but usually don&#x27;t go out of the house without any.  After I applied this, my skin felt clean and tight, and I ran around all day without putting on make-up.</li>
            <li> I was asked to write a review for the Retinol Serum! I am amazed with this product! It is great! Make sure you use a very good moisturizer after the retinol serum dries. The serum may dry out your skin. I use coconut oil and pure aloe vera gel. My skin is so soft and blemish free! Great product!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was well-packaged.This is an initial purchase. I appreciate that the Retinol Serum 2.5 appears to be quite gentle despite the higher concentration of retinol. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I recently  purchased this Retinol Serum from Tree of Life Beauty. It arrived in perfect condition as described. So far this serum has worked well, leaving my face feeling moist, supple and hydrated. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin, but maybe down the road.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing product, I loved it! Each bottle last about two months. I use it once daily before bed. It&#x27;s probably one of the best skincare products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m a big fan of retinol and despite this being a serum, it never once irritated my skin. I would repurchase this. I was not compensated for this review, nor was I given this product to test. I paid for this product, at full price, with my own money.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this project. I skin seems smoother.</li>
            <li> This serum rocks!  I have seen a difference in my skin in only a few days.  My skin looks youthful and radiant!  I am really happy!</li>
            <li> I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  The serums are my favorite.  And I&#x27;m excited to try the Scar Cream on my acne scars on my face and I want to see if it works for my strech marks on my belly from my prenancies.  I started using all of these products on my belly a couple of days ago to see if they help reduce the appearance of my stretch marks and help the sagging belly skin from my pregnancies as well.  I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  I can almost go out without any face powder cover up now.  My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  Best skin care I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had acne prone skin that has a lot of texture and that gets super oily.  I took accutane as a teenager but I still get hormonal acne and I&#x27;ll be 40 next year!  I started getting age spots as well and deep wrinkels in my forehead (expression lines) that I wasn&#x27;t too happy about on top of the acne.  This whole skin care line is so great and makes my skin look and feel amazing!  I LOVE it and am so glad I found it!</li>
