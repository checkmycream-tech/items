            <li>Great product, absorbs easily, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>She loves it and says that it makes her hair amazing.</li>
            <li>but this was amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and helps with dandruff as well</li>
            <li>I mix up my own pre-shampoo adding some of this coconut oil melted.  </li>
            <li>and I really really liked that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and odorless and makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love Coconut oil...</li>
            <li>I have been using this about 10 days and love it.</li>
            <li>I can see that with continued use it will be even better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I wish someone had told me 50 years ago (okay, told my mother 50 years ago) that this stuff is great for gently hydrating curly hair.</li>
            <li>I am so glad the scent of this is almost non-existent--</li>
            <li>and for most of you that means none</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with leaks, but I am glad it arrived in a sealed bag just in case.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found it works better to put it in while my hair is damp.</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and use if for almost everything.  </li>
            <li>When I run out I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE coconut oil for everything.</li>
            <li>Came fast, works great.</li>
            <li>but Im glad that I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been transitioning for over a year and out of all the oils this one is best for daily use.</li>
            <li>I love coconut and would love to have the smell</li>
            <li>As this was purchased based on someone&#x27;s recommendation I was very happy with the purchase, timely delivery and overall use of this product.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to transitioning but coconut oil will remain part of my hair care because it&#x27;s moisturizing and gives my hear great shine without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>And its great for using it after you take a shower it leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is easy to use for me.</li>
            <li>it is strong smell and grease.</li>
            <li>Hair comes out silky and smooth with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>i enjoy smll of coconut</li>
            <li>but i use this for my massage patrons and it glides over the skin and leaves a smooth, silky feel and glow.</li>
            <li>It has no smell, is light, and isn&#x27;t sticky.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair smooth &amp; shiny when I decide to let it grow out.</li>
            <li>This arrived cracked, which kind of defeated the whole purpose of ordering coconut oil in plastic container.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd order of this oil and it is great for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this particular brand of coconut oil!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good coconut oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good product, it just melts a few minutes if you leave it out for more about fifteen minutes, then it turns into liquid.  </li>
            <li>I started using it as a natural moisturizer during pregnancy and liked it so much that I still use it!</li>
            <li>Melts as it is applied to your face or elsewhere/very economical.</li>
            <li>I love using this stuff because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews but what really convinced me to try this was the one from another product that I had been using that changed its formula and the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was selling for three times the original cost - like $90.00 a jar.  </li>
            <li>It goes right into skin and stays.</li>
            <li>And she was right.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much, soaks not the skin and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft and smooth since I was a teenager and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair except wash it - no coloring,</li>
            <li>This is the exact product description - &amp;#</li>
            <li>You are getting exactly what you&#x27;re paying for, coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair and skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this natural, chemical free moisturizer for hair and skin; my dry, frizzyball hair falls into silky, smooth curls now, and my skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li>When I found this Coconut Oil, my hair was more hydrated from 3 months of trying this and that, but it was still dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that this is PURE coconut oil.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like real coconut oil for hair and skin</li>
            <li>Although it is cheaper going straight through the Cocare website.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need anything vying with my perfume--</li>
            <li>I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>However, the description (multi-pack) on amazon is very misleading...</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Melts extremely fast on skin or lips.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s summer, and I live in the south where it&#x27;s hot as blazes, this arrived in liquid form.</li>
            <li>Way better than any other skin care products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why that works better, but it does, and I can use less when I do that too.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a natural product..</li>
            <li>It really helps leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>my hair, I make sure to rub it into my roots and let sit either overnight or a few hours before washing it out.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine curly hair that is dried out because I wash it too much and color it.  </li>
            <li>However, I live in AZ, if the room heats up it liquifies.  </li>
            <li>I went looking for coconut oil to use as a natural moisturizer for my hair and my skin and this was definitely the right choice.  </li>
            <li>It was solid at first when I bought at the store</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t live in a place cool enough to keep it in solid form - I&#x27;d suggest getting a bottle and pouring it into that.  </li>
            <li>the other product full of coconut oil...</li>
            <li>Who knew washing and conditioning my hair with cheap no-silicone conditioner, and using just a little of this on my shoulder-length curls would make my straight-haired friends</li>
            <li>Oil 100% Natural 7oz, 5 pack&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Plus, I use it for facials and body scrubs and it leaves everything soooo soft.</li>
            <li>i am not opposed to coconut scent but don&#x27;t want competing fragrances clashing after spending good money of expensive perfume.</li>
            <li>and yes i do get a slight scent but not bad.</li>
            <li>And you do t need much so it should go a long way</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin you should really like this for removing makeup and conditioning your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is light enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money and time on conditioners of all kinds, and serums of every brand, etc, etc.</li>
            <li>and it left my hair shine and soft.</li>
            <li>So I bought this because it&#x27;s coconut oil all natural no extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend this for anyone with dry to extra dry skin, worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I was looking for coconut oil that was natural and that it wouldnt make my hair feel dry.</li>

            <li> and this stuff is great for thickening it up and making it workable without getting that \\&quot;product\\&quot; look that is so plasticine and awful.  </li>

            <li> The product is great. I have been using it and it has cleared my skin spots a lot. The only thing is that I have to keep in the fridge so it does not melt down. As using it in liquid form is difficult to apply...</li>
            <li> Sealed but worst packing....&lt;br /&gt;All the other product full of coconut oil... waste lot of time to clear up everything...</li>
            <li> Melted in summer and froze in winter there was no happy medium. Wanted to use in making lip balm not sure what else I could use it for since there&#x27;s not very much in container.</li>
            <li> Good product, it just melts a few minutes if you leave it out for more about fifteen minutes, then it turns into liquid.  Especially if the indoor temperature is at 70 degrees.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and this stuff is great for thickening it up and making it workable without getting that \\&quot;product\\&quot; look that is so plasticine and awful.  Smells nice and helps with dandruff as well</li>
            <li> I use this coconut oil on my face every time I get out of the shower. It absorbs into my skin without leaving it feeling greasy or mask-like, and definitely helps with dryness. Definitely going to repurchase after I run out, but this jar will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I was skeptical at first. The idea of putting oil on my face seemed to be problematic because of my problem skin. I have sometimes bad acne breakouts and winter dry, chapped skin. Using this product as a night time moisturizer has mad a world of difference for my skin. It has 100% turned it around. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> I went looking for coconut oil to use as a natural moisturizer for my hair and my skin and this was definitely the right choice.  It&#x27;s great quality coconut oil, is great for everything, and it shipped very quickly.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good coconut oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like real coconut oil for hair and skin and there&#x27;s no smell.  It goes right into skin and stays. I usually use at night before bedtime and the Jergens coconut cream for day.  I use on hair before blow drying.  Hair comes out silky and smooth with no frizz.  And you do t need much so it should go a long way</li>
            <li> i enjoy smll of coconut but i use this for my massage patrons and it glides over the skin and leaves a smooth, silky feel and glow.</li>
            <li> I love this natural, chemical free moisturizer for hair and skin; my dry, frizzyball hair falls into silky, smooth curls now, and my skin is baby soft! My hubby loves it when I use coconut oil too, lol.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this product is that when it is shipped, especially in the summer, it becomes liquid and leaked all over the place.. when it solidifies it gets these little granules in it.. So I try to buy it in the cooler weather and get the mail as soon as it is delivered..Otherwise I love Coconut oil... It&#x27;s natural and odorless and makes my skin feel wonderful AND you can use this anywhere on the body. (even your hair) I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a natural product.. Thank You</li>
            <li> I mix up my own pre-shampoo adding some of this coconut oil melted.  It really helps leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my eczema &amp; winter dry skin!!!!!  I&#x27;m a convert to coconut oil!  No more RX&#x27;s for me!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews but what really convinced me to try this was the one from another product that I had been using that changed its formula and the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was selling for three times the original cost - like $90.00 a jar.  That reviewer said try this product, it is even better than this expensive stuff.  And she was right.  I have shoulder length fine curly hair that is dried out because I wash it too much and color it.  I have been using this about 10 days and love it. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft and smooth since I was a teenager and didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair except wash it - no coloring, no blow drying back then.  I can see that with continued use it will be even better.  I only rub my fingers over the surface of the product until it melts slightly and apply that small amount to the middle of my hair and the ends.  I also put a small amount on my face after washing it at night and the lines around my eyes and mouth are softening.  Amazing stuff - buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this particular brand of coconut oil!  It has no smell, is light, and isn&#x27;t sticky.  And, my skin feels great when I use it!  I started using it as a natural moisturizer during pregnancy and liked it so much that I still use it!</li>
            <li> FYI- there is not coconut smell with this. It doesn&#x27;t small at all. It would maybe be easier to apply if in a bottle. It can be a little messy having to dip you hand in the jar.</li>
            <li> My mom has me buy this stuff for her all the time. She loves it and says that it makes her hair amazing. I will be trying it out soon. Although it is cheaper going straight through the Cocare website. That is where I buy it from.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product description - &amp;#34;Coconut Oil 100% Natural 7oz, 5 pack&amp;#34;  but when I got the package, there were only two 7 oz jars in the box.  And when I tried to find a way to contact Amazon about this mix up, it was next to impossible.  I am not happy with this order at all because it seems like an obvious case of false advertising!</li>
            <li> This stuff it great! I use it on my skin and hair and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. it&#x27;s coconut oil. Just what I ordered. I realized I could have brought a larger jar or bottle for the same price.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft, I really like it.  I stored it in a linen closet - but it still ended up liquifying in the jar.  If you don&#x27;t live in a place cool enough to keep it in solid form - I&#x27;d suggest getting a bottle and pouring it into that.  The jar is not great once its in liquid form.  I will definitely re-purchase</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  keeps my hair smooth &amp; shiny when I decide to let it grow out. All you need is about a nickel sized amount for hair a little past the shoulders. My hair is also pretty thick so the nickel sized amount still works great.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you should really like this for removing makeup and conditioning your skin.  Melts as it is applied to your face or elsewhere/very economical.</li>
            <li> I wish someone had told me 50 years ago (okay, told my mother 50 years ago) that this stuff is great for gently hydrating curly hair. I have spent so much money and time on conditioners of all kinds, and serums of every brand, etc, etc. Who knew washing and conditioning my hair with cheap no-silicone conditioner, and using just a little of this on my shoulder-length curls would make my straight-haired friends so jealous?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone complained that this didn&#x27;t smell. Well, thank you CocoCare for that! I tried one of those others that did smell. Smelled rancid, and it wasn&#x27;t! Went into the trash after 2 uses! I really don&#x27;t need anything vying with my perfume-- we wear too many scents anyway! I am so glad the scent of this is almost non-existent-- and for most of you that means none (I have a super-sensitive nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s summer, and I live in the south where it&#x27;s hot as blazes, this arrived in liquid form. About 20 minutes in the fridge makes it solid again. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with leaks, but I am glad it arrived in a sealed bag just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found a little goes a long way with this, and the longer you use it, the less you need. When I first started my co-wash journey, my hair was so dry, and worse, just coming off the terrible dryness of winter. My hair was soaking up all oils I put in it like a thirsty desert. When I found this Coconut Oil, my hair was more hydrated from 3 months of trying this and that, but it was still dry. The last 2 months, I&#x27;ve been using CocoCare&#x27;s Coconut Oil, and where I started out using a gob on my long, thick hair, now I use just a little bit. I have found it works better to put it in while my hair is damp. I don&#x27;t know why that works better, but it does, and I can use less when I do that too.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a short time.  I haven&#x27;t seen any skin changes yet.  Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> coconut oil is great for your skin...you will not go wrong with this product...love it...creamy, great for face, arms, legs....try it!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to get this product.  I love the way it feels and use if for almost everything.  When I run out I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product. It&#x27;s not too heavy for my hair.  It is light enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this coconut oil as a hair mask, cuticle cream, facial moisturizer, lip balm and I even scooped some into a smaller container to use in my kitchen to cook with. I will definitely be back to restock once this tub is empty!</li>
            <li> If you are want a coconut oil that is good for your HAIR, I would recommend a food grade product. I don&#x27;t believe that this is PURE coconut oil. Plus, food grade products have a wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> I LOVE coconut oil for everything. Face, hair, body. It does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my face, I put a layer of coconut oil on before I leave the house for work, in 10-15mins it is absorbed into my skin and all day I have a wonderful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, I make sure to rub it into my roots and let sit either overnight or a few hours before washing it out. After I towel dry my hair, I take a tiny tiny bit and rub it into my damp hair than follow up with a bit of blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, I rub over my body and face with caster oil as well. I have had wonderful results and gotten rid of most of my acne and skin problems! No reason for me to spend $$$ on products that leave my skin feeling less than desirable.</li>
            <li> You are getting exactly what you&#x27;re paying for, coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin since I am extremely dry. It is great on the elbows, knees and feet.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I purchased this that&#x27;d I&#x27;d smell like a pina oolada but it&#x27;s unscented. I use it as a moisturizer and it works great.  Coconut oil has been a cure all that I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve found.  The container is sturdy, made it through a thirteen hour flight, and prevents unwanted oil spills in warmer temperatures.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything, hair, skin, nails, and oil pulling!</li>
            <li> I like this product because I always use another brand organic coconut oil (cold press) but I have a problem of  it is strong smell and grease. I understand that this product may refine get out the smell. Therefore, it is easy to use for me. Let see how my skin will improve day after day.</li>
            <li> Came fast, works great. I even put it on the ends of my hair. I like this product very much, soaks not the skin and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.</li>
            <li> Really loved the product, its wonderful on hair and skin, is very light and yes i do get a slight scent but not bad. However, the description (multi-pack) on amazon is very misleading...</li>
            <li> I use it blended with other natural oils for my family&#x27;s hair and skin. It works really well. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver for my chapped lips.  However, I live in AZ, if the room heats up it liquifies.  However, it will go back to solid as well.  Melts extremely fast on skin or lips.</li>
            <li> This arrived cracked, which kind of defeated the whole purpose of ordering coconut oil in plastic container. I was looking for a shallow plastic container that would be easier to use than the typical tall skinny-ish glass jars.  Back to glass for me...</li>
            <li> I was looking for coconut oil that was natural and that it wouldnt make my hair feel dry. So I went and bought this product at a beauty supply store for $7. It was solid at first when I bought at the store but then when I got home it was liquid. If it werent for reading the reviews about this product I would of returned the product and gotten my money but Im glad that I gave this product a chance. I applied it on my hair when it was in a solid form and it left my hair shine and soft. I was using it as a detangler and immediately all the knots were loosing and my hair felt like butter. The only con about this product is that I suggest that you use alittle of this product in your hair because if you use alot and if you go outside in 95degrees weather the product will drip like a jerry curl juice. And its great for using it after you take a shower it leaves your skin soft. I would recommend this product and you buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, howevere I prefer a product that smells like coconut, this does NOT smell like coconut!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of this oil and it is great for your hair. Also good for your skin. It was wrapped well so it wouldn&#x27;t leak either in the heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a skin moisturizer. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price! It arrived fast and my skin looks amazing! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So I bought this because it&#x27;s coconut oil all natural no extra ingredients. I&#x27;ve never used coconut oil before but this was amazing. I finished this size within a month. I used it in my deep conditioner and as a sealant after I put QP moisturizer in my hair. I&#x27;ve been transitioning for over a year and out of all the oils this one is best for daily use. There was no build up and little goes a long way. I&#x27;m still new to transitioning but coconut oil will remain part of my hair care because it&#x27;s moisturizing and gives my hear great shine without looking greasy. Also this coconut oil doesn&#x27;t have a smell and I really really liked that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair and skin feel so soft and smooth. I love using this stuff because it&#x27;s all natural and it smells great.</li>
            <li> does what it should for hair and skin but it does not have a smell. I love coconut and would love to have the smell but this product is goo if you have fragrance intolerance.</li>
            <li> This stuff has done WONDERS for my skin. I use it on my legs after I shave them and I haven&#x27;t gotten bumps/rashes since. Plus, I use it for facials and body scrubs and it leaves everything soooo soft. Way better than any other skin care products I&#x27;ve used. I love it!</li>
            <li> It is not what I thought, I thought it was oil, not solid.  Will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t they tell you it comes solid?</li>
            <li> Great product, absorbs easily, non-greasy. As this was purchased based on someone&#x27;s recommendation I was very happy with the purchase, timely delivery and overall use of this product. A benefit, in my opinion, is lack of scent. i am not opposed to coconut scent but don&#x27;t want competing fragrances clashing after spending good money of expensive perfume. Highly reccommend this for anyone with dry to extra dry skin, worth the money spent.</li>
