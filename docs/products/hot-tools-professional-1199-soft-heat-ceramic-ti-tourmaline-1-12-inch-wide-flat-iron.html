            <li>I had read all of the reviews before purchasing this straightener and have to say that it is really fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>The one they use at my hair salon was $80 (and it is really nice!)</li>
            <li>It seems to straighten ok, but to get the best results</li>
            <li>This straighter would be good for people with medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Good straightener.</li>
            <li>Why I loved it:  1).  </li>
            <li>If you want something GOOD, buy this.</li>
            <li>Just bought this and it is a really good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It may not be as good as a 100 dollar GHD iron, but it straightens my naturaly curly hair, and the ceramic makes it damage my hair</li>
            <li>and I bought them at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for relatively good prices.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and makes great heat!</li>
            <li>The straightener was in excellent shape (just as advertised) and arrived extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>If Hot Tools redesigned this it would be a great product but until then STAY AWAY !!!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t find better!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this hair straightner!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it all the time!</li>
            <li>But this product works amazingly to any kind of hair.</li>
            <li>but it does an amazing job on my hair</li>
            <li>and I really liked it for a while.</li>
            <li>I will admit I did not buy this product from Amazon.com, but I do own this product.  </li>
            <li>Got my hair really nicely done in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I dont personally own this item, but have used it before.</li>
            <li>Good product for straightening hair but too many flaws in the design.</li>
            <li>, THEY KINDLY REFUSED TO REFUND ME</li>
            <li>This is a good straightener for the price but definitely not the best and does have some quirks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and it gives me good results.</li>
            <li>It was very easy and painless.</li>
            <li>Only Buy the Best and The Best Is Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools makes good hair tools!</li>
            <li>Its also about as cheap as you can get a GOOD straightener for.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to manuever and it never gets my hair stuck!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t yet speak about whether the coating on the newest model will also wear off, I do think this is a very good buy for the price and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>And it also has many heat adjustments and settings for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt straighten well mostly</li>
            <li>When my order arrived, I was pleased to discover that there have been some changes to the model that corrected the flaws.  </li>
            <li>I must add I have been straightening my hair for many years (even before it was so fashionable), so I know what I am doing.</li>
            <li>Product is satisfactory since the model I wanted to order is no longer available!</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product for 6 years and recomend it. :)</li>
            <li>The cheapest ceramic one works much better.  </li>
            <li>I love all of this company&#x27;s products and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>and I doubt I will ever find a better one.  </li>
            <li>Works much much better than the one I got off the shelf at wal mart.  </li>
            <li>I have more broken-off hairs now that I ever have in my life.</li>
            <li>Once you get use to using it, you&#x27;ll love it to.</li>
            <li>Medium setting is sufficient for most hair.</li>
            <li>Love the rounded edges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay beginner</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li>So, if you are going to buy it, make sure you don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li>I could not be more satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I am glad that I invested the time and money into finding and purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I have used this model for 10 years.</li>
            <li>Probably one of the best flat iron products on the market for under $50.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed that on top of the FANTASTIC results that I was able to do the entire thing bymyself in about 30-45 minutes, and just to give some backround information, when I go in to get my hair cut</li>
            <li>And I have always loved the Hot Tools Brand of hair tools.</li>
            <li>the 1.5\\&quot; plate size had always been the perfect size for me, even when my hair is long.    </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good iron...</li>
            <li>and it is still works just as good now as it did the first day.  </li>
            <li>I had a nice flipped hairstyle in no time, and the day after, I used it again and got a nice straight do.  </li>
            <li>It work for me and it was worth the $50 investment many years ago!</li>
            <li>Not a chi - but awesome product for the money that was spent.  </li>
            <li>I would still buy one again, due to the great warranty!</li>
            <li>The curved edges of iron make it easy to flip or curl under ends for a versitile hair styling experience.</li>
            <li>And the spring handle makes it as easy to use as a curling iron.</li>
            <li>and because the plates are rounded it is really easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>the hair gets caught easily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as the older models, but still a good value.</li>
            <li>I kept thinking maybe I would get better at handling the thing, but no, it kept right on ripping!    </li>
            <li>This iron works fine</li>
            <li>I have moderately fine hair that is wavy.  </li>
            <li>this iron is fine, if not get the CHI.</li>
            <li>The inch and a half size is just perfect</li>
            <li>Now it is SO straight and SO smooth after using this iron!!  </li>
            <li>This Flat Iron is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>It worked fabulously until about August when it decided it didn&#x27;t want to turn on anymore.</li>
            <li>and I knew it would get my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars because my hair has NEVER been this smooth without spending time and money at a salon.  </li>
            <li>Great on coarse hair and saves time.</li>
            <li>a cheap one from wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>I have ethnic hair and it gives it a silky smooth finish.</li>
            <li>But it makes my hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>The warranty is great, and you definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>CHEAP.</li>
            <li>8 years later, it is just as great as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>I would give the product six stars if it was available......</li>
            <li>The handle design makes it easy to straighten my hair and it can get really hot if I desire, which I love.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use,(even if your not a Beauty Technician,I am not) makes my hair Straight and Shiney.  </li>
            <li>This product would sell for over $50 easy at a Sally Beauty supply, gets very hot and straightens, I don&#x27;t have problems with hair getting stuck in the clamp</li>
            <li>Oh well it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love the iron, it does get really hot.  </li>
            <li>Basically they told me unless the product was still in it&#x27;s original packaging</li>
            <li>Love Hot Tools Brand.</li>
            <li>True, the ceramic coating had pretty much worn off by then, but it still worked good.  </li>
            <li>However, I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li>glad I read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I love my hot tools.  </li>
            <li>The new flat iron works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>The temperature of this iron gets pretty high, so that&#x27;s good for straightening...</li>
            <li>My first one was still working beautifully after a year, so I gave it to my daughter (who was constantly borrowing it) and bought another one for myself.</li>
            <li>, NOT this cheap version of a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, dosent damage hair as much as other hair straightners i&#x27;ve used, and always gives me a nice result!</li>
            <li>This straightner does get hot fast and straightnes my hair nice.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive iron that will last, Hot Tools is a great place to start.</li>
            <li>but this does an equally good job on my hair  considering I only use medium heat (about 5 setting).</li>
            <li>Just having gotten this iron, I love it so much.</li>
            <li>but i really dont want my hair burnt any more than it has to be</li>
            <li>It does warm up really fast and allows you to set the temperature of the flat iron which I thought was really nice.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools Pro. is a GREAT flat iron.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this flat iron, I was really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>the design of the handle made it super easy to use and control, and this was especially useful in straightening the back part of my hair.  </li>
            <li>it does heat up quickly</li>
            <li>My hair comes out very straight and extremely smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, has lasted over a year and not had any problems.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works great &amp; heats fast.</li>
            <li>the very first time i used this the purple coaring started to chip off,</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s so much more - I can really see how hot my straightner is getting and change it</li>
            <li>I used my sister-in-law&#x27;s older version of this flat iron and was very impressed with how silky smooth it left my hair.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron works pretty good</li>
            <li>I even bought the insurance since I did not want to risk them falling apart on me but am happy to say that after 4 years I am still using my little 1/2 incher.</li>
            <li>I ordered this iron and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work but to my surprise it worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>But we were also extremely impressed with the service we received to replace the broken appliance.  </li>
            <li>Just for fun, I thought I&#x27;d try another brand</li>
            <li>Always gives me that salon look worth the money.</li>
            <li>This one is better than  the old one that I wore out.</li>
            <li>It warms up quite fast and the overall quality is good.</li>
            <li>only problem now is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the edges of the plates, other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I personally own the #1199 Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this one anyway, since the price was right</li>
            <li>However, I did complain this to Amazon and they took care of the problem right away, I should be refuned in 10 days or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve regularly bought Hot Tools flat irons, you can&#x27;t beat the price, plus they have a very good warranty.  </li>
            <li>The plastic tips make it east to get a good grip on your hair as you work your way down.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough and leaves my hair nice straight and silky.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast with optional heat degrees.  </li>
            <li>It heated up very fast</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe it was my outlet</li>
            <li>i have used the Hot tools straightener model 3199 which is shown in the picture</li>
            <li>I always reccommend you buy Hot Tools when buyin</li>
            <li>The first one was given to me in 2004 and still works well.  </li>
            <li>it just frys ur hair eve if its not that hot and the plates dont close all the way.</li>
            <li>I planned to continue shopping for a higher end model.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a love-hate relationship with it, but in light of using my roommate&#x27;s CHI for the past two days, I&#x27;ve realized that this Hot Tools iron is quite a nice straightener.    </li>
            <li>and I came across this one from hot tools.</li>
            <li>It has multiple settings and its ceramic, which is so much better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I was going to buy the HAI one until the store I went to didn&#x27;t carry that brand.  </li>
            <li>And I found the Hot Tools 1199v2.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is actually ceramic makes it so much better for your hair then</li>
            <li>Works really well with all types of hair!  </li>
            <li>i love this, my former straightening iron used to frizz my hair on the ends</li>
            <li>and I am so surprised that something that works so well is available for this price.  </li>
            <li>This iron works pretty well in terms of temperature control, but for some reason my hair keeps getting caught in the clamping part.  </li>
            <li>It does as good a job straightening my hair as the Chi, and the clamp grip on it makes it just incredibly easy to handle compared to other flat irons.  </li>
            <li>this is my second flat iron tool, bought the same because ive had very good results with it!</li>
            <li>I noticed that the more costlier flat irons get pretty hot to where it could be damaging.  </li>
            <li>I have hair just past my shoulder and this sized flat iron is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this item after using another Hot Tools flat iron for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 9 months since I purchased this one and the heat still works fine, but the ceramic coating is almost completely off, which is very damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li>And I get all of these features and more with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I guess I thought this flat iron was supposed to be a lot better</li>
            <li>They must not make the iron with that kind of handle anymore as I have ordered from other companies also.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I realized my flat iron was a dinosaur.  </li>
            <li>thats partially due to the handy grip on the end see photo for clarification.</li>
            <li>I loved that product and wanted the exact same, which is what I thought I had here, since it&#x27;s the same product number.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I learned to keep it on the porcelain top of the toilet.  </li>
            <li>the smaller side of the handle is a bit more robust, making the iron much easier to close.    </li>
            <li>though i do agree with everyone who is saying it pulls their hair, it seems if you grab too much hair and put in the inner most area of the straightener that it tugs at your hair and can pull some strands out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would have given it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for my hair getting caught although rarely.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in a salon and it is high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Though the item I received is the wonderful quality that I always find in Hot Tools products, it was totally different from the picture, as the handle is much bigger making it harder to use, and there were no rounded edges as the discription says there is.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is awesome and will straighten my thick, course, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after my cheap conair straightener wouldn&#x27;t heat up any longer, this was a new brand for me and a new design.</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re going to put a certain picture than I SHOULD be getting the product of the picture I see</li>
            <li>It heats up in 2-3 minutes, and has two large ceramic faces so you can straighten a lot of hair at one time.</li>
            <li>And the power switch is not the same as pictured or what the original product has from Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>It has 10 heat settings for fine to coarse hair types.</li>
            <li>It left my hair STRAIGHT, shiny, smooth, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have medium textured curly hair that is very stubborn.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>yet again I can be really fussy about my hair.</li>
            <li>i dont have have really curly hair or anything</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very curly or kinky hair either...</li>
            <li>Thats really it.</li>
            <li>I tried it in all different outlets, the switch would light up when turned on but the iron would never heat up.  </li>
            <li>it shipped fast and I saved about $30.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t stand on the counter very well and tends to roll on its side.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>After I used this, my hair is as straight as I wanted it to be.  </li>
            <li>I had a difficult time finding flat Iron that I liked and after doing my research I purchased this because Hot Tools had a decent reputation and a lot of my friends owned it and loved it.</li>
            <li>This iron straightens the hair great as the other reviews have said but be careful you don&#x27;t use large sections of hair...</li>
            <li>I was trying to replace my old flat iron with a better one</li>
            <li>When it stopped working I naturally ordered the same model because I loved how it worked on my hair and how long it lasted for me.  </li>
            <li>They are of high quality and very durable.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair, but I love to make it completely straight.</li>
            <li>Gets hot enough to really control course or stubborn hair on the first try.  </li>
            <li>not only is it cheap, but it makes my frizzy, thick, and really curly hair very smooth, frizz-free and straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty frizzy and naturally curly, so I love having stick-straight hair even when it is relatively humid outside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact same model of Hot Tools straightener for 6 years.  </li>
            <li>This particular model pulls my hair out if I run my hair through a part that has a gap in it.  </li>
            <li>I need high heat without he risk of damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>As for this hot tools straightener, I find that you have to super press down to really grab the hair</li>
            <li>I looked at this one and it was the same exact iron just with a lower price!  </li>
            <li>I am definately buying the same exact one!</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged, easy tool to hold, and contrary to some of the other reviewer</li>
            <li>To avoid this I use smaller sections of hair at one time and rarely have problems.  </li>
            <li>although i love this straightener, I&#x27;ll be looking into a new one in a few months.</li>
            <li>I sent it back right away</li>
            <li>, it deserves a totally new word just to describe it.  </li>
            <li>We received the new one in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Well, I ordered from BYPLE and got my brand new straightener.  </li>
            <li>yet big enough when you want to do your whole head quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser had used it once on me and it seemed to do a really good job straightening my coarse, thick, wavy (not curly) hair.</li>
            <li>so I purchased a new one at the same time I replace a Hot Tools Hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It is unfortunate since I did spend good money on this and to choose between spending more to replace it or keep using it at the cost of pain to my little head...</li>
            <li>Previously I had a \\&quot;wet-to-style\\&quot; flat iron and cringed every time I heard it sizzle my hair and always wanted a nice flat iron that would straighten my hair on the first time through and save me time.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, those great rounded edges (which I loved) would then be touching the counter, which is bad news on laminate!</li>
            <li>This is the same problem I had with the prior model, but I felt sure that they would have improved them, so I bought a second one.  </li>
            <li>First of all there is a short in the wiring.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked like it was professionally styled!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that I would have bought it off of this website first.  </li>
            <li>This iron works pretty well, the only problem is that it snags your hair at the ends</li>
            <li>I got my first when I was in 8th Grade and have had the same one up till this morning.</li>
            <li>The round barrel makes it easy to style hair under or flipped out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as harsh on the hair and somewhat easy to maneauver.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of a Chi and many other flat irons in its class.</li>
            <li>Though this one is a bit heavier than I expected it really continues to preform will and give me confidence in Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and you have to be careful where you hold it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll be buying another one of these hot tools flat irons.  </li>
            <li>Also too I saw other reviews that said there hair get caught between the plates and the plastic, and it is true.  </li>
            <li>This can easily be avoided with careful use and using smaller sections.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can straighten more than just a half inch of hair at a time is enough for me!</li>
            <li>This iron heats up very quickly and did not burn my thin and freshly relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>I have other Hot Tools products which I really like.</li>
            <li>There is a major design flaw; the seams where the hot plate meets the plastic, there is just enough spacing for strands of hair to get caught.  </li>
            <li>Any of the positive qualities of this flat iron are immediately negated by the fact that your hair will get caught in the edge of the iron where it meets the plastic.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 straighteners as of today and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been a licensed professional hair stylist for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>So, if you can interpret it being the \\&quot;bomb\\&quot; from a 25 year old.  </li>
            <li>With the version I ordered in early 2011, I found that there is no longer a gap between the ceramic plates for my hair to get caught.  </li>
            <li>one of the screws fell out early on causing the two plates to be misaligned when I clamped them together.  </li>
            <li>I usually go to a professional to get my hair styled</li>
            <li>, I have no trouble with hair getting caught in the plates.  </li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for this feature and this was the only one I could found that had a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>, I guess I will have to buy a professional model.</li>
            <li>I still use it, of course with the time it&#x27;s gotten old but still works just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have really thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and this iron did the trick for the most part.</li>
            <li>The flat iron works fairly good, it just alittle big and hard to handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad buy, it&#x27;s just cumbersome and less efficient than others I have used.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and wavy and takes a lot of work to straighten, but this made it very easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and too light.</li>
            <li>, It straightened my hair fast and not only that it did not split and break my hair and left it looking shiny and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Hot Tools Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>As far as people complaining that it damaged their hair I believe that is probably due to them using a heat setting too hot for their hair.  </li>
            <li>The heat is not too hot, but you have to be careful while you are using it.</li>
            <li>It is true that at time a few strands of hair will catch at the hinge or between the plate and plastic.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you have to be careful of it the hottest setting is REALLY hot!  </li>
            <li>It takes only a short time to get hot and it only takes me about 15min to straighten my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>This makes it hard for any hot iron to make it straight in one go.</li>
            <li>I was suprised when it completely cracked open and broke apart.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes pulls hair if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>it is says it is a professional model; however, it does not work and I am back to using my old one, which I will simply replace.</li>
            <li>This is the second Hot Tools flat iron I have purchased ( I dropped the first one quite a few times before it said enough ).</li>
            <li>, it has several unique features I like, including the light-weight European design and the round edges for curling the ends.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>and sometimes a patient friend is willing to spend two and a half hours ironing my hair for me.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron straightens and leaves my hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I have found with the spring hindge feature is you have to be careful to not put too much hair at one time in betwwen plates.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that my hair would sometimes get stuck between the plate and plastic casing, and I\\&quot;d occasionally looks a strand here and there, but maybe they&#x27;ve fixed that since then.</li>
            <li>but I would say it takes about the same amount of time to straighten my hair as with my old flat iron -</li>
            <li>, i had the 2\\&quot; professional ceramic flat iron from the same company and never had any issues with it for about a year, untill it got stepped on and broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on short to long lengths, and my hair is naturally curly and wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is one of the few that effectively straighten my thick, long and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>After years of being a loyal to Hot Tools, it was time to replace my flatiron and decided to upgrade from the 1190 to the 1199 ceramic flat iron, I was quickly disappointed when at first use a chunk of hair was yanked out of my head.  </li>
            <li>I actually have to take a rest half way through using it because my wrist starts to hurt so much.</li>
            <li>Works really well at straightening hair and calming frizz, but it rips out your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful!!!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had read all of the reviews before purchasing this straightener and have to say that it is really fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> The one they use at my hair salon was $80 (and it is really nice!)</li>
            <li> It seems to straighten ok, but to get the best results</li>
            <li> This straighter would be good for people with medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Good straightener.</li>
            <li> Why I loved it:  1).  </li>
            <li> If you want something GOOD, buy this.</li>
            <li> Just bought this and it is a really good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It may not be as good as a 100 dollar GHD iron, but it straightens my naturaly curly hair, and the ceramic makes it damage my hair</li>
            <li> and I bought them at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for relatively good prices.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes great heat!</li>
            <li> The straightener was in excellent shape (just as advertised) and arrived extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> If Hot Tools redesigned this it would be a great product but until then STAY AWAY !!!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t find better!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair straightner!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it all the time!</li>
            <li> But this product works amazingly to any kind of hair.</li>
            <li> but it does an amazing job on my hair</li>
            <li> and I really liked it for a while.</li>
            <li> I will admit I did not buy this product from Amazon.com, but I do own this product.  </li>
            <li> Got my hair really nicely done in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I dont personally own this item, but have used it before.</li>
            <li> Good product for straightening hair but too many flaws in the design.</li>
            <li> , THEY KINDLY REFUSED TO REFUND ME</li>
            <li> This is a good straightener for the price but definitely not the best and does have some quirks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and it gives me good results.</li>
            <li> It was very easy and painless.</li>
            <li> Only Buy the Best and The Best Is Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools makes good hair tools!</li>
            <li> Its also about as cheap as you can get a GOOD straightener for.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to manuever and it never gets my hair stuck!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t yet speak about whether the coating on the newest model will also wear off, I do think this is a very good buy for the price and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> And it also has many heat adjustments and settings for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt straighten well mostly</li>
            <li> When my order arrived, I was pleased to discover that there have been some changes to the model that corrected the flaws.  </li>
            <li> I must add I have been straightening my hair for many years (even before it was so fashionable), so I know what I am doing.</li>
            <li> Product is satisfactory since the model I wanted to order is no longer available!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for 6 years and recomend it. :)</li>
            <li> The cheapest ceramic one works much better.  </li>
            <li> I love all of this company&#x27;s products and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> and I doubt I will ever find a better one.  </li>
            <li> Works much much better than the one I got off the shelf at wal mart.  </li>
            <li> I have more broken-off hairs now that I ever have in my life.</li>
            <li> Once you get use to using it, you&#x27;ll love it to.</li>
            <li> Medium setting is sufficient for most hair.</li>
            <li> Love the rounded edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay beginner</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> So, if you are going to buy it, make sure you don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> I could not be more satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I am glad that I invested the time and money into finding and purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have used this model for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best flat iron products on the market for under $50.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed that on top of the FANTASTIC results that I was able to do the entire thing bymyself in about 30-45 minutes, and just to give some backround information, when I go in to get my hair cut</li>
            <li> And I have always loved the Hot Tools Brand of hair tools.</li>
            <li> the 1.5\\&quot; plate size had always been the perfect size for me, even when my hair is long.    </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a pretty good iron...</li>
            <li> and it is still works just as good now as it did the first day.  </li>
            <li> I had a nice flipped hairstyle in no time, and the day after, I used it again and got a nice straight do.  </li>
            <li> It work for me and it was worth the $50 investment many years ago!</li>
            <li> Not a chi - but awesome product for the money that was spent.  </li>
            <li> I would still buy one again, due to the great warranty!</li>
            <li> The curved edges of iron make it easy to flip or curl under ends for a versitile hair styling experience.</li>
            <li> And the spring handle makes it as easy to use as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> and because the plates are rounded it is really easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> the hair gets caught easily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the older models, but still a good value.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking maybe I would get better at handling the thing, but no, it kept right on ripping!    </li>
            <li> This iron works fine</li>
            <li> I have moderately fine hair that is wavy.  </li>
            <li> this iron is fine, if not get the CHI.</li>
            <li> The inch and a half size is just perfect</li>
            <li> Now it is SO straight and SO smooth after using this iron!!  </li>
            <li> This Flat Iron is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> It worked fabulously until about August when it decided it didn&#x27;t want to turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> and I knew it would get my hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because my hair has NEVER been this smooth without spending time and money at a salon.  </li>
            <li> Great on coarse hair and saves time.</li>
            <li> a cheap one from wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> I have ethnic hair and it gives it a silky smooth finish.</li>
            <li> But it makes my hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> The warranty is great, and you definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> CHEAP.</li>
            <li> 8 years later, it is just as great as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> I would give the product six stars if it was available......</li>
            <li> The handle design makes it easy to straighten my hair and it can get really hot if I desire, which I love.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use,(even if your not a Beauty Technician,I am not) makes my hair Straight and Shiney.  </li>
            <li> This product would sell for over $50 easy at a Sally Beauty supply, gets very hot and straightens, I don&#x27;t have problems with hair getting stuck in the clamp</li>
            <li> Oh well it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love the iron, it does get really hot.  </li>
            <li> Basically they told me unless the product was still in it&#x27;s original packaging</li>
            <li> Love Hot Tools Brand.</li>
            <li> True, the ceramic coating had pretty much worn off by then, but it still worked good.  </li>
            <li> However, I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> glad I read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I love my hot tools.  </li>
            <li> The new flat iron works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> The temperature of this iron gets pretty high, so that&#x27;s good for straightening...</li>
            <li> My first one was still working beautifully after a year, so I gave it to my daughter (who was constantly borrowing it) and bought another one for myself.</li>
            <li> , NOT this cheap version of a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, dosent damage hair as much as other hair straightners i&#x27;ve used, and always gives me a nice result!</li>
            <li> This straightner does get hot fast and straightnes my hair nice.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive iron that will last, Hot Tools is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> but this does an equally good job on my hair  considering I only use medium heat (about 5 setting).</li>
            <li> Just having gotten this iron, I love it so much.</li>
            <li> but i really dont want my hair burnt any more than it has to be</li>
            <li> It does warm up really fast and allows you to set the temperature of the flat iron which I thought was really nice.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools Pro. is a GREAT flat iron.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this flat iron, I was really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> the design of the handle made it super easy to use and control, and this was especially useful in straightening the back part of my hair.  </li>
            <li> it does heat up quickly</li>
            <li> My hair comes out very straight and extremely smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, has lasted over a year and not had any problems.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great &amp; heats fast.</li>
            <li> the very first time i used this the purple coaring started to chip off,</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s so much more - I can really see how hot my straightner is getting and change it</li>
            <li> I used my sister-in-law&#x27;s older version of this flat iron and was very impressed with how silky smooth it left my hair.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron works pretty good</li>
            <li> I even bought the insurance since I did not want to risk them falling apart on me but am happy to say that after 4 years I am still using my little 1/2 incher.</li>
            <li> I ordered this iron and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work but to my surprise it worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> But we were also extremely impressed with the service we received to replace the broken appliance.  </li>
            <li> Just for fun, I thought I&#x27;d try another brand</li>
            <li> Always gives me that salon look worth the money.</li>
            <li> This one is better than  the old one that I wore out.</li>
            <li> It warms up quite fast and the overall quality is good.</li>
            <li> only problem now is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the edges of the plates, other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I personally own the #1199 Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one anyway, since the price was right</li>
            <li> However, I did complain this to Amazon and they took care of the problem right away, I should be refuned in 10 days or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve regularly bought Hot Tools flat irons, you can&#x27;t beat the price, plus they have a very good warranty.  </li>
            <li> The plastic tips make it east to get a good grip on your hair as you work your way down.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough and leaves my hair nice straight and silky.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast with optional heat degrees.  </li>
            <li> It heated up very fast</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe it was my outlet</li>
            <li> i have used the Hot tools straightener model 3199 which is shown in the picture</li>
            <li> I always reccommend you buy Hot Tools when buyin</li>
            <li> The first one was given to me in 2004 and still works well.  </li>
            <li> it just frys ur hair eve if its not that hot and the plates dont close all the way.</li>
            <li> I planned to continue shopping for a higher end model.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a love-hate relationship with it, but in light of using my roommate&#x27;s CHI for the past two days, I&#x27;ve realized that this Hot Tools iron is quite a nice straightener.    </li>
            <li> and I came across this one from hot tools.</li>
            <li> It has multiple settings and its ceramic, which is so much better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> At first I was going to buy the HAI one until the store I went to didn&#x27;t carry that brand.  </li>
            <li> And I found the Hot Tools 1199v2.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is actually ceramic makes it so much better for your hair then</li>
            <li> Works really well with all types of hair!  </li>
            <li> i love this, my former straightening iron used to frizz my hair on the ends</li>
            <li> and I am so surprised that something that works so well is available for this price.  </li>
            <li> This iron works pretty well in terms of temperature control, but for some reason my hair keeps getting caught in the clamping part.  </li>
            <li> It does as good a job straightening my hair as the Chi, and the clamp grip on it makes it just incredibly easy to handle compared to other flat irons.  </li>
            <li> this is my second flat iron tool, bought the same because ive had very good results with it!</li>
            <li> I noticed that the more costlier flat irons get pretty hot to where it could be damaging.  </li>
            <li> I have hair just past my shoulder and this sized flat iron is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after using another Hot Tools flat iron for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 9 months since I purchased this one and the heat still works fine, but the ceramic coating is almost completely off, which is very damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li> And I get all of these features and more with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I guess I thought this flat iron was supposed to be a lot better</li>
            <li> They must not make the iron with that kind of handle anymore as I have ordered from other companies also.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I realized my flat iron was a dinosaur.  </li>
            <li> thats partially due to the handy grip on the end see photo for clarification.</li>
            <li> I loved that product and wanted the exact same, which is what I thought I had here, since it&#x27;s the same product number.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I learned to keep it on the porcelain top of the toilet.  </li>
            <li> the smaller side of the handle is a bit more robust, making the iron much easier to close.    </li>
            <li> though i do agree with everyone who is saying it pulls their hair, it seems if you grab too much hair and put in the inner most area of the straightener that it tugs at your hair and can pull some strands out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would have given it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for my hair getting caught although rarely.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a salon and it is high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Though the item I received is the wonderful quality that I always find in Hot Tools products, it was totally different from the picture, as the handle is much bigger making it harder to use, and there were no rounded edges as the discription says there is.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome and will straighten my thick, course, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after my cheap conair straightener wouldn&#x27;t heat up any longer, this was a new brand for me and a new design.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re going to put a certain picture than I SHOULD be getting the product of the picture I see</li>
            <li> It heats up in 2-3 minutes, and has two large ceramic faces so you can straighten a lot of hair at one time.</li>
            <li> And the power switch is not the same as pictured or what the original product has from Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li> It has 10 heat settings for fine to coarse hair types.</li>
            <li> It left my hair STRAIGHT, shiny, smooth, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have medium textured curly hair that is very stubborn.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> yet again I can be really fussy about my hair.</li>
            <li> i dont have have really curly hair or anything</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very curly or kinky hair either...</li>
            <li> Thats really it.</li>
            <li> I tried it in all different outlets, the switch would light up when turned on but the iron would never heat up.  </li>
            <li> it shipped fast and I saved about $30.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stand on the counter very well and tends to roll on its side.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> After I used this, my hair is as straight as I wanted it to be.  </li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding flat Iron that I liked and after doing my research I purchased this because Hot Tools had a decent reputation and a lot of my friends owned it and loved it.</li>
            <li> This iron straightens the hair great as the other reviews have said but be careful you don&#x27;t use large sections of hair...</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace my old flat iron with a better one</li>
            <li> When it stopped working I naturally ordered the same model because I loved how it worked on my hair and how long it lasted for me.  </li>
            <li> They are of high quality and very durable.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair, but I love to make it completely straight.</li>
            <li> Gets hot enough to really control course or stubborn hair on the first try.  </li>
            <li> not only is it cheap, but it makes my frizzy, thick, and really curly hair very smooth, frizz-free and straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty frizzy and naturally curly, so I love having stick-straight hair even when it is relatively humid outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact same model of Hot Tools straightener for 6 years.  </li>
            <li> This particular model pulls my hair out if I run my hair through a part that has a gap in it.  </li>
            <li> I need high heat without he risk of damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> As for this hot tools straightener, I find that you have to super press down to really grab the hair</li>
            <li> I looked at this one and it was the same exact iron just with a lower price!  </li>
            <li> I am definately buying the same exact one!</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged, easy tool to hold, and contrary to some of the other reviewer</li>
            <li> To avoid this I use smaller sections of hair at one time and rarely have problems.  </li>
            <li> although i love this straightener, I&#x27;ll be looking into a new one in a few months.</li>
            <li> I sent it back right away</li>
            <li> , it deserves a totally new word just to describe it.  </li>
            <li> We received the new one in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Well, I ordered from BYPLE and got my brand new straightener.  </li>
            <li> yet big enough when you want to do your whole head quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser had used it once on me and it seemed to do a really good job straightening my coarse, thick, wavy (not curly) hair.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a new one at the same time I replace a Hot Tools Hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate since I did spend good money on this and to choose between spending more to replace it or keep using it at the cost of pain to my little head...</li>
            <li> Previously I had a \\&quot;wet-to-style\\&quot; flat iron and cringed every time I heard it sizzle my hair and always wanted a nice flat iron that would straighten my hair on the first time through and save me time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, those great rounded edges (which I loved) would then be touching the counter, which is bad news on laminate!</li>
            <li> This is the same problem I had with the prior model, but I felt sure that they would have improved them, so I bought a second one.  </li>
            <li> First of all there is a short in the wiring.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked like it was professionally styled!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that I would have bought it off of this website first.  </li>
            <li> This iron works pretty well, the only problem is that it snags your hair at the ends</li>
            <li> I got my first when I was in 8th Grade and have had the same one up till this morning.</li>
            <li> The round barrel makes it easy to style hair under or flipped out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh on the hair and somewhat easy to maneauver.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of a Chi and many other flat irons in its class.</li>
            <li> Though this one is a bit heavier than I expected it really continues to preform will and give me confidence in Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and you have to be careful where you hold it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll be buying another one of these hot tools flat irons.  </li>
            <li> Also too I saw other reviews that said there hair get caught between the plates and the plastic, and it is true.  </li>
            <li> This can easily be avoided with careful use and using smaller sections.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can straighten more than just a half inch of hair at a time is enough for me!</li>
            <li> This iron heats up very quickly and did not burn my thin and freshly relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> I have other Hot Tools products which I really like.</li>
            <li> There is a major design flaw; the seams where the hot plate meets the plastic, there is just enough spacing for strands of hair to get caught.  </li>
            <li> Any of the positive qualities of this flat iron are immediately negated by the fact that your hair will get caught in the edge of the iron where it meets the plastic.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 straighteners as of today and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been a licensed professional hair stylist for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> So, if you can interpret it being the \\&quot;bomb\\&quot; from a 25 year old.  </li>
            <li> With the version I ordered in early 2011, I found that there is no longer a gap between the ceramic plates for my hair to get caught.  </li>
            <li> one of the screws fell out early on causing the two plates to be misaligned when I clamped them together.  </li>
            <li> I usually go to a professional to get my hair styled</li>
            <li> , I have no trouble with hair getting caught in the plates.  </li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this feature and this was the only one I could found that had a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> , I guess I will have to buy a professional model.</li>
            <li> I still use it, of course with the time it&#x27;s gotten old but still works just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have really thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and this iron did the trick for the most part.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works fairly good, it just alittle big and hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad buy, it&#x27;s just cumbersome and less efficient than others I have used.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy and takes a lot of work to straighten, but this made it very easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and too light.</li>
            <li> , It straightened my hair fast and not only that it did not split and break my hair and left it looking shiny and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> As far as people complaining that it damaged their hair I believe that is probably due to them using a heat setting too hot for their hair.  </li>
            <li> The heat is not too hot, but you have to be careful while you are using it.</li>
            <li> It is true that at time a few strands of hair will catch at the hinge or between the plate and plastic.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be careful of it the hottest setting is REALLY hot!  </li>
            <li> It takes only a short time to get hot and it only takes me about 15min to straighten my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard for any hot iron to make it straight in one go.</li>
            <li> I was suprised when it completely cracked open and broke apart.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes pulls hair if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> it is says it is a professional model; however, it does not work and I am back to using my old one, which I will simply replace.</li>
            <li> This is the second Hot Tools flat iron I have purchased ( I dropped the first one quite a few times before it said enough ).</li>
            <li> , it has several unique features I like, including the light-weight European design and the round edges for curling the ends.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> and sometimes a patient friend is willing to spend two and a half hours ironing my hair for me.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron straightens and leaves my hair soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I have found with the spring hindge feature is you have to be careful to not put too much hair at one time in betwwen plates.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that my hair would sometimes get stuck between the plate and plastic casing, and I\\&quot;d occasionally looks a strand here and there, but maybe they&#x27;ve fixed that since then.</li>
            <li> but I would say it takes about the same amount of time to straighten my hair as with my old flat iron -</li>
            <li> , i had the 2\\&quot; professional ceramic flat iron from the same company and never had any issues with it for about a year, untill it got stepped on and broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on short to long lengths, and my hair is naturally curly and wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is one of the few that effectively straighten my thick, long and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> After years of being a loyal to Hot Tools, it was time to replace my flatiron and decided to upgrade from the 1190 to the 1199 ceramic flat iron, I was quickly disappointed when at first use a chunk of hair was yanked out of my head.  </li>
            <li> I actually have to take a rest half way through using it because my wrist starts to hurt so much.</li>
            <li> Works really well at straightening hair and calming frizz, but it rips out your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful!!!  </li>
            <li> I am buying my second flat iron and I am going to buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This is my second Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> it was often hard to maneuver the flat iron for the first couple of years that I had it.  </li>
            <li> But just this past week I really that the purple ceramic is chipping.</li>
            <li> and it works when my hair is short and or long.  </li>
            <li> They are long lasting and dependable.</li>
            <li> have had this flat iron for ever a year but just started using it.</li>
            <li> The flat iron was bought for my daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron works so well</li>
            <li> We ordered this flat iron for Christmas and it stopped working after 4 or 5 days.  </li>
            <li> but not all of us can dish out $80 for a flat iron...</li>
            <li> I just got my flat iron yesterday.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t wait long enough.</li>
            <li> I had this flat iron once before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron since 2007</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and wavy hair and Hot tools works wonders on it.</li>
            <li> [I lost it :( ] and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different than my old one</li>
            <li> She asked for this as a replacement for the previous one she had of the same item that lasted her much longer than any of the previous hair straighteners</li>
            <li> The first one I had made straightening easy, while this new one is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> The last one I had lasted that long!!!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long to do it.  </li>
            <li> And I have really long hair.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron go hot and stayed hot, but it had a bad odor to it.  </li>
            <li> The one i received is much cheaper and i am not pleased!</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot, it&#x27;s hard to handle and it makes your hair frizz!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because like other reviewers said, you have to be carefull since it does pull hair from time to time.</li>
            <li> but I hope it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Yes, the Kenta has roundes edges too, but not willing to pay $130 for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Be careful you don&#x27;t press it on your hair too long and singe your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin and not very wavy to begin with, but i do have a lot of it, and it takes me under 5 minutes to straighten my hair with this tool.</li>
            <li> and she is not gentle with anything.  </li>
            <li> I really do not think this is a ceramic one...</li>
            <li> I bought this same straightener 4 years ago, and it just broke on me a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I now have a sedu (expensive but worth the while)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because I was SO excited to be getting my flat iron back, but now I&#x27;m considering returning it...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> i mean it still worked and i have pretty intence long curly thick frizzy hair,</li>
            <li> With her model, I noticed a few of the flaws mentioned in other reviews, which are that your hair gets caught on the side of the plate and that you accidentally hit the on/off button in the middle of trying to straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> I also agree with the other reviewers who reported their hair getting caught in this iron.  </li>
            <li> I bought this straightener over 3 1/2 years ago, and it just died the other day.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make your hair silky like other ceramic ones...</li>
            <li> I ended passing this one down to my mom since I did not really like it</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful when putting hair between the plates.</li>
            <li> There are cracks between the ceramic plates and the body of the iron which WILL pull your hair out if you aren&#x27;t very careful.</li>
            <li> We notified Amazon and they immediately sent a new one out with instructions on returning the broken one at no expense to us.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how easily it cracked.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of this</li>
            <li> I have about average length hair</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the money, buy something that won&#x27;t get your hair caught in it.</li>
            <li> it was not worth the 60 bucks at all</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be every now and then while using it my and my daughters hair will catch in something and it pulls and kinda hurts.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m greek, therefore i have thick hair, and ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> I have short, curly and thick hair.</li>
            <li> My previous roommate used it and had the same complaint.  4).  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t turn the heat down.</li>
            <li> It gets tiring after awhile to press down on them.</li>
            <li> I had the bad experience of buying a Conair iron as my first flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for at least four years, maybe five.</li>
            <li> A few reviewers have mentioned that their hair has gotten caught between the plate and the handle - this has happened to me here and there, but it was due to the way I was holding the iron and positioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The two previous straighteners I bought are of the jolbier brand</li>
            <li> I sometimes found little pieces of purple ceramic chips in my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I like the round edges to make it a little stylized.  </li>
            <li> So, for the past few years I have really been unhappy with my extremely curly hair, I can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> the round edges burned a couple of the surfaces I set this on.  </li>
            <li> but when I get impatient my hair gets caught a lot...</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and bought me this a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> And yes, a few strands of my hair do get caught in it sometimes.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stand up to heavy use.</li>
            <li> and then after a few strands my hand starts hurting.</li>
            <li> I asked to get it blow dried</li>
            <li> the cord was always so stiff</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has had trouble with straightners in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought a CHI to replace it, and my hair is so super damaged now, despite using the protective crap they sell ya, my ends are literally falling off.  </li>
            <li> Very annoyed that I wasted $40 trying a different brand!!</li>
            <li> My hair usually gets frizzy by the end of the day but not with this iron.  </li>
            <li> However, I am not sure about its durability</li>
            <li> I try to do small sections</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair and usually takes me around 30-40 minutes with just a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Usually straightening my hair takes over 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair slick and shiny.</li>
            <li> It also has small cracks/crevices along the edges and when I use this product, it pulls strands of hair out of my head that get caught in these</li>
            <li> This flat iron works just as well as the redicoulisly expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I had to get a new one, and I chose this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s survived drops and not very good care on my part.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the only negative in the bunch, but this is my second of these irons and both lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> However I am going to get a new straightener because I am tired of the cord getting twisted around making the device hard to manage and also tired of getting hairs stuck between the plates.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t press hard on your hair, pulling strands out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a common problem or not</li>
            <li> After having such a trusty product for years you can imagine my disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Complained to store</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as effective as the one I bought at CVS on sale for $15.99.  </li>
            <li> Its frizzy and awful and hard to style in a way that looks kempt and clean.  </li>
            <li> so I tried other outlets and got nothing, needless to say I was bummed.</li>
            <li> I have used the \\&quot;chi\\&quot; and other expensive irons too</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that because the ceramic plates are flush to the handle my hair would get caught between the plates and the handle, which would result in a lot of painfully pulled out hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the flat irons with brass plates and it gave terrible results and fried my hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Received a flat iron with bad cord.  </li>
            <li> this product sucks!</li>
            <li> this was always a little awkward, but it still managed to straighten my hair as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> Anything lower is probably worse.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for approximately 2 months and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Trade Secret store in Detroit, Michigan.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it does snag my hair on the sides of the iron a few times but nothing crazy, i&#x27;m not giving it up</li>
            <li> and I threw the plastic cut up packaging away because I wasn&#x27;t expected to get a piece of crap product.  </li>
            <li> DESPITE the foregoing reasons why I hated this flat iron, I would not hesitate to buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product 2.5 years ago and it broke at the base (the plastic bottom) due to heat stress.</li>
            <li> so in that sense I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although i suggest cleaning it because after a few months the ceramic wears away &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Also, often what happens is that the handles lock when pressing down, it gets really annoying.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m sorry, the way straighteners are packaged</li>
            <li> The process is tedious and</li>
            <li> had a solia too, but it was really awkward trying to use.</li>
            <li> it is virtually impossible to get them out of the plastic without cutting it</li>
            <li> the purple ceramic coating started chipping off making it impossible to straighten my hair, not to mention even when  it did work my hair</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird, but I hate it, so here I am again!!</li>
            <li> but I am extremely disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this now.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it annoying.</li>
            <li> Why I hated it:  1).  </li>
            <li> This is very painful and will also pull out your hair.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail and hate it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair smell awful afterward.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This seller is not selling quality products.  Received a flat iron with bad cord.  And the power switch is not the same as pictured or what the original product has from Hot Tools.  I&#x27;m still waiting for return label.</li>
            <li> This product did exactley what I needed it to do, straighten my hair. It takes only a short time to get hot and it only takes me about 15min to straighten my shoulder length hair. I have had no problems with it pulling out my hair.</li>
            <li> This iron works fine and I really liked it for a while. But just this past week I really that the purple ceramic is chipping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has a 1 year warranty but I&#x27;ve tried to find the company&#x27;s website, to no avail.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have about average length hair and it works when my hair is short and or long.  It is small enough to be able to do small pieces yet big enough when you want to do your whole head quickly.  The round barrel makes it easy to style hair under or flipped out.  Heats up quickly and makes great heat!</li>
            <li> I hate to be the only negative in the bunch, but this is my second of these irons and both lasted about a year.  It&#x27;s been 9 months since I purchased this one and the heat still works fine, but the ceramic coating is almost completely off, which is very damaging to the hair.  This is the same problem I had with the prior model, but I felt sure that they would have improved them, so I bought a second one.  I also agree with the other reviewers who reported their hair getting caught in this iron.  For my third iron, I&#x27;m going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> This straightner does get hot fast and straightnes my hair nice. However, my hair gets stuck at the end of the straightner and puts my hair out. This straighter would be good for people with medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this May of 07&#x27;. I had a difficult time finding flat Iron that I liked and after doing my research I purchased this because Hot Tools had a decent reputation and a lot of my friends owned it and loved it. It worked fabulously until about August when it decided it didn&#x27;t want to turn on anymore. At first I thought maybe it was my outlet so I tried other outlets and got nothing, needless to say I was bummed. I don&#x27;t know if this is a common problem or not but I don&#x27;t think I want to chance buying another one</li>
            <li> the product that i received is not the same as the product shown. The one i received is much cheaper and i am not pleased! i have used the Hot tools straightener model 3199 which is shown in the picture but it is not what i received.</li>
            <li> Only Buy the Best and The Best Is Hot Tools. I have been a licensed professional hair stylist for over 10 years. And I have always loved the Hot Tools Brand of hair tools. They are of high quality and very durable. They are long lasting and dependable. I have always used them on myself and customers as well. I personally own the #1199 Flat Iron. I have medium textured curly hair that is very stubborn. I need high heat without he risk of damaging my hair. And I get all of these features and more with this flat iron. I have hair just past my shoulder and this sized flat iron is perfect for me. The #1199 sized iron is perfect for Medium to shorter lengths of hair. The curved edges of iron make it easy to flip or curl under ends for a versitile hair styling experience. And the spring handle makes it as easy to use as a curling iron. Also has protective edges to prevent finger burning. And it also has many heat adjustments and settings for all types of hair. Heats up in seconds for a no wait styling session. The only downside I have found with the spring hindge feature is you have to be careful to not put too much hair at one time in betwwen plates. Otherwise the hair may tangle in the spring. This can easily be avoided with careful use and using smaller sections. I always reccommend you buy Hot Tools when buyin</li>
            <li> I ordered this iron and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work but to my surprise it worked better than I expected. This iron proved to me that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to get a great straightening iron.I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools Flat Iron.  The first one was given to me in 2004 and still works well.  The coating has chipped/worn off so I purchased a new one at the same time I replace a Hot Tools Hairdryer.  This flat iron is awesome and will straighten my thick, course, wavy hair.  It is true that at time a few strands of hair will catch at the hinge or between the plate and plastic.  To avoid this I use smaller sections of hair at one time and rarely have problems.  I like that I can adjust the temperature.  I&#x27;ve used the flat irons with brass plates and it gave terrible results and fried my hair at the same time.  I highly recommend this product and would have given it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for my hair getting caught although rarely.</li>
            <li> She asked for this as a replacement for the previous one she had of the same item that lasted her much longer than any of the previous hair straighteners she&#x27;s used.  So, if you can interpret it being the \\&quot;bomb\\&quot; from a 25 year old.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> Good straightener. Gets very hot, has lasted over a year and not had any problems. However I am going to get a new straightener because I am tired of the cord getting twisted around making the device hard to manage and also tired of getting hairs stuck between the plates. This is a good straightener for the price but definitely not the best and does have some quirks.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a \\&quot;wet-to-style\\&quot; flat iron and cringed every time I heard it sizzle my hair and always wanted a nice flat iron that would straighten my hair on the first time through and save me time. I guess I thought this flat iron was supposed to be a lot better so in that sense I&#x27;m a little disappointed. It does warm up really fast and allows you to set the temperature of the flat iron which I thought was really nice. It&#x27;s a little different than my old one so I&#x27;m still trying to get used to it but I would say it takes about the same amount of time to straighten my hair as with my old flat iron - yet again I can be really fussy about my hair.</li>
            <li> The straightener was in excellent shape (just as advertised) and arrived extremely quickly. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Any of the positive qualities of this flat iron are immediately negated by the fact that your hair will get caught in the edge of the iron where it meets the plastic. The only way to get your hair out is to pull at it, which of course breaks it and damages the hair. Every time I passed it through my hair, it seemed like I&#x27;d lose a hair or two, and of course it hurts, too! Totally not worth the money, buy something that won&#x27;t get your hair caught in it.</li>
            <li> this product sucks! i dont have have really curly hair or anything but it doesnt straighten well mostly it just frys ur hair eve if its not that hot and the plates dont close all the way.</li>
            <li> I used my sister-in-law&#x27;s older version of this flat iron and was very impressed with how silky smooth it left my hair.  My hair is very thick and wavy and takes a lot of work to straighten, but this made it very easy.  With her model, I noticed a few of the flaws mentioned in other reviews, which are that your hair gets caught on the side of the plate and that you accidentally hit the on/off button in the middle of trying to straighten your hair.  I decided to buy this one anyway, since the price was right and I knew it would get my hair smooth and shiny.  I planned to continue shopping for a higher end model.    When my order arrived, I was pleased to discover that there have been some changes to the model that corrected the flaws.  With the version I ordered in early 2011, I found that there is no longer a gap between the ceramic plates for my hair to get caught.  They also moved the on/off switch to be located on the cord so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn the iron off while using it.  Additionally, the cord now rotates around the end to help prevent tangling and the smaller side of the handle is a bit more robust, making the iron much easier to close.    While I can&#x27;t yet speak about whether the coating on the newest model will also wear off, I do think this is a very good buy for the price and would highly recommend it.  I decided to buy one for my mom as well and she loves it, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener over 3 1/2 years ago, and it just died the other day.  I&#x27;ve had a love-hate relationship with it, but in light of using my roommate&#x27;s CHI for the past two days, I&#x27;ve realized that this Hot Tools iron is quite a nice straightener.    Why I loved it:  1).  It left my hair STRAIGHT, shiny, smooth, and manageable.  I&#x27;ve used it on short to long lengths, and my hair is naturally curly and wavy and frizzy.  This performs at the same level as my roommate&#x27;s $250 Chi.    2).  the design of the handle made it super easy to use and control, and this was especially useful in straightening the back part of my hair.  It was also lightweight....much lighter and easier to use than the 2\\&quot; Chi.  3).  the rounded edges were great for curling my hair under.  4).  the 1.5\\&quot; plate size had always been the perfect size for me, even when my hair is long.    Why I hated it:  1).  It did snag my hair between the plates and the casing quite often.  2).  one of the screws fell out early on causing the two plates to be misaligned when I clamped them together.  this was always a little awkward, but it still managed to straighten my hair as I wanted it to.  3).  the cord was always so stiff it was often hard to maneuver the flat iron for the first couple of years that I had it.  My previous roommate used it and had the same complaint.  4).  the ceramic coating wore off after about a year.  I sometimes found little pieces of purple ceramic chips in my hair.  5).  the round edges burned a couple of the surfaces I set this on.  I learned to keep it on the porcelain top of the toilet.  I would never leave it on acrylic or formica surfaces.    DESPITE the foregoing reasons why I hated this flat iron, I would not hesitate to buy it again.  It does as good a job straightening my hair as the Chi, and the clamp grip on it makes it just incredibly easy to handle compared to other flat irons.  Plus, it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost of a Chi and many other flat irons in its class.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace my old flat iron with a better one and I came across this one from hot tools. My hairdresser had used it once on me and it seemed to do a really good job straightening my coarse, thick, wavy (not curly) hair. IT WILL STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR! You won&#x27;t have much left in the back anymore because of the design flaws. The plates are set into the plastic handle and there is just enough room in between the handle and plate to catch a chunk of hair , especially when working on parts of your head you cannot see like the back. &lt;br /&gt;The hair will not come out and you must pull the torture device from your head ripping and shreading your hair. I must add I have been straightening my hair for many years (even before it was so fashionable), so I know what I am doing. No amount of practice or years of experience will help you out of this one.  If Hot Tools redesigned this it would be a great product but until then STAY AWAY !!! I am going to cough up $ 100 plus for a chi! ciao.</li>
            <li> There are several problems with this product.  First of all there is a short in the wiring.  The on/off switch is one of those knobs that you twist and there is a short so it doesn&#x27;t always work.  Also too I saw other reviews that said there hair get caught between the plates and the plastic, and it is true.  I lose alot of hair everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works fairly good, it just alittle big and hard to handle.  It gets very hot and you have to be careful where you hold it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had this flat iron for ever a year but just started using it. About my 3rd time the handle broke off by just me sqeezing it!! Called company and with out reciecpt they will not replace!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITS JUNK!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product is satisfactory since the model I wanted to order is no longer available!</li>
            <li> The flat iron was bought for my daughter for Christmas.  She is extremely happy with it.  The straightness and shininess of her hair are second to none.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works so well, it deserves a totally new word just to describe it.  It doesn&#x27;t press hard on your hair, pulling strands out and the ends are rounded so it wont pull your hair out that way either and so its easier to curl the ends.  It has multiple settings and its ceramic, which is so much better for your hair.  Its also about as cheap as you can get a GOOD straightener for.  Anything lower is probably worse.  If you want something GOOD, buy this.</li>
            <li> I just bought this iron and it is the greatest one I have ever used.  I usually go to a professional to get my hair styled but I wanted this one to use in between visits.  At first I was going to buy the HAI one until the store I went to didn&#x27;t carry that brand.  I looked at this one and it was the same exact iron just with a lower price!  I was a little skeptical at first because of this but by skepticism went out the window when I used it.  My hair looked like it was professionally styled!  My hair usually gets frizzy by the end of the day but not with this iron.  It even curls your hair!  I had a nice flipped hairstyle in no time, and the day after, I used it again and got a nice straight do.  This iron heats up very quickly and did not burn my thin and freshly relaxed hair.  It even has grooves on the outside of the iron that act as a comb when you turn it to curl the ends of your hair.  I am very happy with this product.  The only thing I wish is that I would have bought it off of this website first.  I paid $50 at the beauty supply store.  Oh well it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> i had this item for about 1 1/2 months until it broke.  the purple ceramic coating started chipping off making it impossible to straighten my hair, not to mention even when  it did work my hair kept getting caught in it.  and because the plates are rounded it is really easy to burn yourself.  do not buy this product. it was not worth the 60 bucks at all</li>
            <li> this is a great flatiron. there are some reviews that say it makes there hair frizzy, or dryed out. no, it doesn&#x27;t! it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re not using a heat protector. use a heat protector reguardless of what flatiron you are using. you need it so you don&#x27;t damage your hair. i&#x27;m greek, therefore i have thick hair, and ringlet curls. sort of like those irish trinity dancers. it works wonders for me. i love it! also, it is the same one my stylist uses on me. the product arrived on time, and in great condition.</li>
            <li> We ordered this flat iron for Christmas and it stopped working after 4 or 5 days.  We notified Amazon and they immediately sent a new one out with instructions on returning the broken one at no expense to us.  We received the new one in a couple of days.  The new flat iron works wonderfully.  We highly recommend it to others.  But we were also extremely impressed with the service we received to replace the broken appliance.  It was very easy and painless. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because my hair has NEVER been this smooth without spending time and money at a salon.  My hair has gained the nick name \\&quot;poodle poof\\&quot; because it is so curly-frizzy-out of control.  Now it is SO straight and SO smooth after using this iron!!  HAPPY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> Hot Tools Pro. is a GREAT flat iron.  The price was within my budget.  It heats up very fast with optional heat degrees.  Very easy to use,(even if your not a Beauty Technician,I am not) makes my hair Straight and Shiney.  I even got compliments the very next day at home and at work!  For the price you can&#x27;t find better!</li>
            <li> this is my second flat iron tool, bought the same because ive had very good results with it! Ive been using this product for 6 years and recomend it. :)</li>
            <li> I have moderately fine hair that is wavy.  This flat iron straightens and leaves my hair soft and shinny.  I bought this product 2.5 years ago and it broke at the base (the plastic bottom) due to heat stress. Keep in mind that my daughter used it also and she is not gentle with anything.  As far as people complaining that it damaged their hair I believe that is probably due to them using a heat setting too hot for their hair.  I am buying my second flat iron and I am going to buy this one again.</li>
            <li> The picture of the iron is different than what is sent.  They must not make the iron with that kind of handle anymore as I have ordered from other companies also.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have used this model for 10 years. Lasts about 3 years each with daily use.</li>
            <li> I would NEVER recommend this item to anyone.  I have had it for approximately 2 months and it no longer works. JUNK JUNK JUNK!</li>
            <li> This is the second Hot Tools flat iron I have purchased ( I dropped the first one quite a few times before it said enough ). Though this one is a bit heavier than I expected it really continues to preform will and give me confidence in Hot Tools products.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I realized my flat iron was a dinosaur.  The one they use at my hair salon was $80 (and it is really nice!) but not all of us can dish out $80 for a flat iron... so I looked for something similar.  And I found the Hot Tools 1199v2.  Works great for the money!!</li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot, it&#x27;s hard to handle and it makes your hair frizz!  I had to use my $10 ceramic straightener on my hair after using this one!  The cheapest ceramic one works much better.  I really do not think this is a ceramic one...it doesn&#x27;t make your hair silky like other ceramic ones...I don&#x27;t have very curly or kinky hair either...but after using this one my hair looked that way!</li>
            <li> This iron works pretty well, the only problem is that it snags your hair at the ends, I guess your hair gets caught between the ceramic and the plastic...The temperature of this iron gets pretty high, so that&#x27;s good for straightening...I think it&#x27;s a pretty good iron...</li>
            <li> I sttill have it and it works perfectly. I love all of this company&#x27;s products and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully!  Gets hot enough to really control course or stubborn hair on the first try.  No going over and over the same piece of hair! Hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged, easy tool to hold, and contrary to some of the other reviewer, I have no trouble with hair getting caught in the plates.  My first one was still working beautifully after a year, so I gave it to my daughter (who was constantly borrowing it) and bought another one for myself.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best flat iron products on the market for under $50.  I think I paid around $25 for it.  Great on coarse hair and saves time.</li>
            <li> I will admit I did not buy this product from Amazon.com, but I do own this product.  This is by far the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned and I doubt I will ever find a better one.  The handle design makes it easy to straighten my hair and it can get really hot if I desire, which I love.  My hair is always perfect because of this iron.  The fact that it is actually ceramic makes it so much better for your hair then a cheap one from wal-mart.  I bought this product in a salon and it is high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair straightner! It is easy to use, dosent damage hair as much as other hair straightners i&#x27;ve used, and always gives me a nice result! I got my first when I was in 8th Grade and have had the same one up till this morning. I am now a sophomore in college, and my 8th grade hair straightner just stopped working now! I am definately buying the same exact one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for at least four years, maybe five. It&#x27;s survived drops and not very good care on my part. It broke two days ago so I went on amazon looking for another hair straightener. I have thin, fine hair, but I love to make it completely straight. Just for fun, I thought I&#x27;d try another brand so I bought the BaByliss pro brand. Got it in the mail and hate it! It&#x27;s small and too light. I know that sounds weird, but I hate it, so here I am again!! This is a great product. Very annoyed that I wasted $40 trying a different brand!!</li>
            <li> This iron is great. It has 10 heat settings for fine to coarse hair types. I have ethnic hair and it gives it a silky smooth finish. I have used the \\&quot;chi\\&quot; and other expensive irons too but this does an equally good job on my hair  considering I only use medium heat (about 5 setting). Just having gotten this iron, I love it so much. However, I am not sure about its durability but I hope it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron is pretty awesome. The only problem I had is sometimes my hair gets caught and pulls. Thats really it. It gets hot enough and leaves my hair nice straight and silky. I have extremely thick and wavy hair and Hot tools works wonders on it. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron at Ulta and although it straightens my hair it does not give it that salon look. If you are looking to just get by between salon visits this iron is fine, if not get the CHI.</li>
            <li> Love the iron, it does get really hot.  But it makes my hair smooth and shiny and it doesn&#x27;t take long to do it.  Works much much better than the one I got off the shelf at wal mart.  Always gives me that salon look worth the money.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great &amp; heats fast. My only complaint would be every now and then while using it my and my daughters hair will catch in something and it pulls and kinda hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact same model of Hot Tools straightener for 6 years.  The last one I had lasted that long!!! When it stopped working I naturally ordered the same model because I loved how it worked on my hair and how long it lasted for me.  Well, I ordered from BYPLE and got my brand new straightener.  Everything was great.  Then about 2 weeks later it just stopped working.  I tried it in all different outlets, the switch would light up when turned on but the iron would never heat up.  After having such a trusty product for years you can imagine my disappointment.  I contacted BYPLE to see what could be done about this obviously faulty product.  Basically they told me unless the product was still in it&#x27;s original packaging I was out of luck.  Well I&#x27;m sorry, the way straighteners are packaged it is virtually impossible to get them out of the plastic without cutting it and I threw the plastic cut up packaging away because I wasn&#x27;t expected to get a piece of crap product.  Thoroughly irritated with their lack of customer service.</li>
            <li> This iron straightens the hair great as the other reviews have said but be careful you don&#x27;t use large sections of hair...the hair gets caught easily. I try to do small sections but when I get impatient my hair gets caught a lot...I have more broken-off hairs now that I ever have in my life. I am currently looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is my second Flat Iron. Hot Tools makes good hair tools! This one is better than  the old one that I wore out. Once you get use to using it, you&#x27;ll love it to.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this. it shipped fast and I saved about $30. I can finally style my bangs. Love Hot Tools Brand.</li>
            <li> I have got the curliest hair possible. Apart from being curly, my hair has a lot of volume too. This makes it hard for any hot iron to make it straight in one go. But this product works amazingly to any kind of hair.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and bought me this a few years ago.  I use it daily and it is still works just as good now as it did the first day.  The only thing you have to be careful of it the hottest setting is REALLY hot!  Be careful you don&#x27;t press it on your hair too long and singe your hair.  Medium setting is sufficient for most hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my cheap conair straightener wouldn&#x27;t heat up any longer, this was a new brand for me and a new design. it straightens my hair the best of any straightener i ever had (and I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch). though i do agree with everyone who is saying it pulls their hair, it seems if you grab too much hair and put in the inner most area of the straightener that it tugs at your hair and can pull some strands out. I&#x27;ve learned to prevent that but it annoying. although i love this straightener, I&#x27;ll be looking into a new one in a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Trade Secret store in Detroit, Michigan. Only used twice and my hair burned. Complained to store and they said they cannot do anything. Stuck with $80 dollar tool. I do not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> Although this straightener did straighten my hair, it would also rip it out, sometimes 20+ hairs at a time.  My hair would get caught where the plates join the plastic and also in the hinge.  Ouch!  I kept thinking maybe I would get better at handling the thing, but no, it kept right on ripping!    It also doesn&#x27;t stand on the counter very well and tends to roll on its side.  Unfortunately, those great rounded edges (which I loved) would then be touching the counter, which is bad news on laminate!</li>
            <li> I bought this same straightener 4 years ago, and it just broke on me a few months ago.  True, the ceramic coating had pretty much worn off by then, but it still worked good.  I bought a CHI to replace it, and my hair is so super damaged now, despite using the protective crap they sell ya, my ends are literally falling off.  And it doesn&#x27;t have variable settings so I can&#x27;t turn the heat down. So I&#x27;ll be buying another one of these hot tools flat irons.  My only problem is that my hair would sometimes get stuck between the plate and plastic casing, and I\\&quot;d occasionally looks a strand here and there, but maybe they&#x27;ve fixed that since then.</li>
            <li> I had read all of the reviews before purchasing this straightener and have to say that it is really fantastic!!! Straightens my hair wonderfully!!! My hair is pretty frizzy and naturally curly, so I love having stick-straight hair even when it is relatively humid outside.</li>
            <li> i think that this is the best iron that i&#x27;ve ever used. not only is it cheap, but it makes my frizzy, thick, and really curly hair very smooth, frizz-free and straight. I would recommend this product to anyone. And yes, a few strands of my hair do get caught in it sometimes. However, I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Though the item I received is the wonderful quality that I always find in Hot Tools products, it was totally different from the picture, as the handle is much bigger making it harder to use, and there were no rounded edges as the discription says there is.</li>
            <li> While straightening, your hair will become caught in between the  purple ceramic piece and the steel. This is very painful and will also pull out your hair.</li>
            <li> I just got my flat iron yesterday. It worked well. I didnt have any issues with my hair getting stuck in it at all. I just a product to protect my hair, so that may help. I recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> Works really well at straightening hair and calming frizz, but it rips out your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful!!!  The warranty is great, and you definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth. Although i suggest cleaning it because after a few months the ceramic wears away &#x3D;( doesn&#x27;t stand up to heavy use. so send in that warranty, i forgot to for mine! I now have a sedu (expensive but worth the while) had a solia too, but it was really awkward trying to use.</li>
            <li> Just bought this and it is a really good product for the price. It warms up quite fast and the overall quality is good. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because like other reviewers said, you have to be carefull since it does pull hair from time to time. Got my hair really nicely done in about 10 minutes. I have a LOT of hair and usually takes me around 30-40 minutes with just a blow dryer. Love the rounded edges. I looked everywhere for this feature and this was the only one I could found that had a reasonable price. Yes, the Kenta has roundes edges too, but not willing to pay $130 for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had the bad experience of buying a Conair iron as my first flat iron. It was so bad I had to get a new one, and I chose this! I am very happy with my choice. It may not be as good as a 100 dollar GHD iron, but it straightens my naturaly curly hair, and the ceramic makes it damage my hair less!Also, it has several unique features I like, including the light-weight European design and the round edges for curling the ends.&lt;BR&gt;I do not know how durable this product is because I got it recently, but I hope it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This straightener is one of the few that effectively straighten my thick, long and curly hair.  Usually straightening my hair takes over 45 minutes.  With this straightener I can get it done in 10 - 15 minutes.  And I have really long hair.  The inch and a half size is just perfect and I like the round edges to make it a little stylized.  I would recommend this to anyone who has had trouble with straightners in the past.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works really well with all types of hair!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron works pretty good, I have really thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and this iron did the trick for the most part. My only complaint is that because the ceramic plates are flush to the handle my hair would get caught between the plates and the handle, which would result in a lot of painfully pulled out hair.</li>
            <li> i love this, my former straightening iron used to frizz my hair on the ends but this one doesn&#x27;t.  it makes my hair slick and shiny. I have noticed it does snag my hair on the sides of the iron a few times but nothing crazy, i&#x27;m not giving it up</li>
            <li> I dont personally own this item, but have used it before. My cousin has it and I sometimes iron my hair with it. It works well and gets the job done, however my hair always gets caught in it and almost always I cant get it out without having to rip my hair apart. You have to be very careful when putting hair between the plates. Also, I dont like the design of the handle. It gets tiring after awhile to press down on them. Also, often what happens is that the handles lock when pressing down, it gets really annoying. Good product for straightening hair but too many flaws in the design.</li>
            <li> I like the temperature settings that this product features. The temperature settings allow me to share this product with someone of a different hair type. I have not burned myself yet, thats partially due to the handy grip on the end see photo for clarification. Hope you buy the product as it was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 straighteners as of today and this is by far my least favorite. I bought 1/2 inch, 1 inch and then this one. I would have to say that I find the 1/2 inch the easiest to use. The two previous straighteners I bought are of the jolbier brand and I bought them at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for relatively good prices. I even bought the insurance since I did not want to risk them falling apart on me but am happy to say that after 4 years I am still using my little 1/2 incher. As for this hot tools straightener, I find that you have to super press down to really grab the hair and then after a few strands my hand starts hurting. I ended passing this one down to my mom since I did not really like it and she needed one. It&#x27;s not a bad buy, it&#x27;s just cumbersome and less efficient than others I have used. If you are just learning how to straighten your hair or if you want to gift this to your teenage sister then go ahead and buy it. It&#x27;s an okay beginner but there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> Not a chi - but awesome product for the money that was spent.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The flat iron go hot and stayed hot, but it had a bad odor to it.  I read the package and it said there would be an odor and it would go away.  The odor with mine didn&#x27;t go away. Maybe I didn&#x27;t wait long enough.</li>
            <li> THEY DONT DISCLOSE THE RESTOCKING FEE ON THE PRODUCT DETAIL PAGE.  WHEN I TRIED TO RETURN THIS ITEM, THEY CHARGED THE FEE AND WHEN I POINTED OUT THAT IT WASNT DISCLOSED ON THE DETAIL PAGE, THEY REFERENCED ME TO THE &amp;#34;LINKED&amp;#34; PAGE WHERE IT WAS DISCLOSED.  NO MATTER WHAT I SAID, THEY KINDLY REFUSED TO REFUND ME THE 20% RESTOCKING FEE.  THIS IS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  BUYER BEWARE...........</li>
            <li> I got this product and when I opened it I realized this was going to be to big and bulky for me. I have short, curly and thick hair. I sent it back right away and I never did recieve my refund. However, I did complain this to Amazon and they took care of the problem right away, I should be refuned in 10 days or so. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; results.</li>
            <li> I had this flat iron once before [I lost it :( ] and LOVED it. But I guess they changed the design of it and now it just looks and feels.. CHEAP. If they&#x27;re going to put a certain picture than I SHOULD be getting the product of the picture I see, NOT this cheap version of a good flat iron. I&#x27;m really disappointed because I was SO excited to be getting my flat iron back, but now I&#x27;m considering returning it...</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener in the spring of 2005. 8 years later, it is just as great as the day I bought it. It heats up in 2-3 minutes, and has two large ceramic faces so you can straighten a lot of hair at one time. My hair is pretty thin and not very wavy to begin with, but i do have a lot of it, and it takes me under 5 minutes to straighten my hair with this tool. My hair comes out very straight and extremely smooth and shiny. The purple coloring on the faces has worn off over the years, but never in my hair. The plastic tips make it east to get a good grip on your hair as you work your way down. My hair has never been burned or pulled out by this tool in all the time I&#x27;ve had it. It work for me and it was worth the $50 investment many years ago!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this flat iron, I was really happy with it.  It&#x27;s not as harsh on the hair and somewhat easy to maneauver.  However, the iron accidentally slipped out of my hand when I was using it and dropped onto the RUG in my bathroom.  I was suprised when it completely cracked open and broke apart.  I was shocked to see how easily it cracked.  I don&#x27;t believe the material it is made out of is durable. So, if you are going to buy it, make sure you don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> Very good product, does the job well!  Sometimes pulls hair if you&#x27;re not careful.  Great value for your money.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I would give the product six stars if it was available......So, for the past few years I have really been unhappy with my extremely curly hair, I can&#x27;t stand it.  Its frizzy and awful and hard to style in a way that looks kempt and clean.  Once in a while I straighten my hair,  When I go into the salon to get my hair trimmed I asked to get it blow dried and sometimes a patient friend is willing to spend two and a half hours ironing my hair for me.  The process is tedious and frankly something I would not choose to do.  This straightner is the BEST straightner I have ever used!!!! It heated up very fast, It straightened my hair fast and not only that it did not split and break my hair and left it looking shiny and soft feeling.  I was very impressed that on top of the FANTASTIC results that I was able to do the entire thing bymyself in about 30-45 minutes, and just to give some backround information, when I go in to get my hair cut they tell me that I have enough hair on my head for three people.  I could not be more satisfied with this product and I am so surprised that something that works so well is available for this price.  I am glad that I invested the time and money into finding and purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I like the size and shape of this product, however it did not seem to get to the 450 degrees it said it would.  It also has small cracks/crevices along the edges and when I use this product, it pulls strands of hair out of my head that get caught in these and it happens EVERY time.  It seems to straighten ok, but to get the best results, I guess I will have to buy a professional model.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It&#x27;s really easy to use and it gives me good results. After I used this, my hair is as straight as I wanted it to be.  The heat is not too hot, but you have to be careful while you are using it.</li>
            <li> After years of being a loyal to Hot Tools, it was time to replace my flatiron and decided to upgrade from the 1190 to the 1199 ceramic flat iron, I was quickly disappointed when at first use a chunk of hair was yanked out of my head.  There is a major design flaw; the seams where the hot plate meets the plastic, there is just enough spacing for strands of hair to get caught.  It is unfortunate since I did spend good money on this and to choose between spending more to replace it or keep using it at the cost of pain to my little head...</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! The fact that I can straighten more than just a half inch of hair at a time is enough for me! But there&#x27;s so much more - I can really see how hot my straightner is getting and change it, it&#x27;s easy to manuever and it never gets my hair stuck! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like this iron because of the width and the rounded edge of the plates. I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore so I bought 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron like 7 years ago! I still use it, of course with the time it&#x27;s gotten old but still works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem now is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the edges of the plates, other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> There are cracks between the ceramic plates and the body of the iron which WILL pull your hair out if you aren&#x27;t very careful. I even let a couple of friends try it to see if it was just me...it wasn&#x27;t. It pulled their hair out too. It works well enough except for that. I would return if I had gotten it at a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve regularly bought Hot Tools flat irons, you can&#x27;t beat the price, plus they have a very good warranty.  This particular model pulls my hair out if I run my hair through a part that has a gap in it.  I would still buy one again, due to the great warranty!</li>
            <li> This flat iron works just as well as the redicoulisly expensive ones. I love this product and use it all the time!</li>
            <li> the very first time i used this the purple coaring started to chip off, i mean it still worked and i have pretty intence long curly thick frizzy hair, but i really dont want my hair burnt any more than it has to be, i had the 2\\&quot; professional ceramic flat iron from the same company and never had any issues with it for about a year, untill it got stepped on and broke.</li>
            <li> This product would sell for over $50 easy at a Sally Beauty supply, gets very hot and straightens, I don&#x27;t have problems with hair getting stuck in the clamp</li>
            <li> This iron is perfect if you want to straighten your hair at a lower temperatures.  I noticed that the more costlier flat irons get pretty hot to where it could be damaging.  This iron works pretty well in terms of temperature control, but for some reason my hair keeps getting caught in the clamping part.  Using this device requires you to pay extra extra attention and time to keep from your hair getting caught.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good price and it does its job.</li>
            <li> This product does not straighten my hair and tends to simply burn it (even on lower settings) and cause damage.  It is not nearly as effective as the one I bought at CVS on sale for $15.99.  I decided to upgrade to protect my hair and b/c it is says it is a professional model; however, it does not work and I am back to using my old one, which I will simply replace.</li>
            <li> glad I read the reviews first.  I love my hot tools.  it does heat up quickly but it does an amazing job on my hair and I couldnt be happier with it!  and what a great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron since 2007 and it is still doing a great job.  It leaves my hair silky and shiny and does not damage my hair.  A few reviewers have mentioned that their hair has gotten caught between the plate and the handle - this has happened to me here and there, but it was due to the way I was holding the iron and positioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive iron that will last, Hot Tools is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after using another Hot Tools flat iron for many years. I loved that product and wanted the exact same, which is what I thought I had here, since it&#x27;s the same product number. Not so. this product is designed differently with a completely different dial for the temp, and the handle is also different. The first one I had made straightening easy, while this new one is HORRIBLE. I actually have to take a rest half way through using it because my wrist starts to hurt so much. I don&#x27;t know what it is that they&#x27;ve done differently but I am extremely disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the older models, but still a good value.</li>
            <li> The straightener smells like burning plastic when you turn it on.  Makes your hair smell awful afterward.  Not what I expected.  I have other Hot Tools products which I really like. Disappointed.  Would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
