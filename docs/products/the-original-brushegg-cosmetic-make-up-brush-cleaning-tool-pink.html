            <li>Great for eye brushes.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>and they were just totally clean and perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Effectively assists me in my MU brush and sponge cleaning.</li>
            <li>A great way to clean your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Works good to get in my brushes clean!</li>
            <li>I like the top edge part</li>
            <li>Best for smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>Makes the pain of cleaning the brush much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this egg.</li>
            <li>Love it for easy cleaning..</li>
            <li>But i still like the product easy to bring and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but then I saw one of my favorite makeup artists use this to clean their brushes</li>
            <li>I just hold it in my hand for use, find this more comfortable than placing 2 fingers in the available opening.</li>
            <li>My hand did start to cramp up because I have so many brushes to clean but a solution is to hold the egg in the palm of my hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...</li>
            <li>All in all this was a huge miss for me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and much better than paying $40</li>
            <li>if work great give my brushes a deep cleaning</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this item but just felt it could have been designed and manufactured so much better.  </li>
            <li>but it does get all my brushes clean.</li>
            <li>Love it, ordering was a breeze and it arrived quickly, and not to mention since using it my face complexion has cleared up sooo much!</li>
            <li>This is really an incredible little invention.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li>My old lip brush is good as new too.</li>
            <li>It absolutely cuts the times it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!  </li>
            <li>Makes brush cleaning super fast</li>
            <li>it cleans the brushed better</li>
            <li>If u have a gazillion brushes and need deep cleaning better to just get those gloves cleaning thingy for brushes..</li>
            <li>This makes cleaning my bushes go SO much faster and easier!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This works very well!</li>
            <li>it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is good for cleaning small makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I used to just wash them over and over and over until the water ran clean, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and clean them in no time!  </li>
            <li>It is a very inexpensive product that does what it should.</li>
            <li>Makes cleaning my brushes so much easier.</li>
            <li>I bought this much cheaper elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I really like it made washing my brushes faster and you can see all the makeup come off your brushes.</li>
            <li>However, I do not find this to clean big brushes that well.</li>
            <li>they all looked like new!</li>
            <li>But if u just need a decent cleaning the brush egg will do.</li>
            <li>It is made of decent rubber and does look like the image.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things, this cleans them thoughtfully with any makeup cleaner.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
            <li>but no matter what I did they would never get fully clean, there would always still be some product stuck down in between the hairs</li>
            <li>It cut my time in half and my brushes are ridiculously clean.</li>
            <li>The grooves are much too deep for the job.  </li>
            <li>that I find myself cleaning my brushes more often without the old hesitation of it once being an arduous task.</li>
            <li>Yes it is way too small to fit over two fingers.  </li>
            <li>I washed all of my brushes last night, big and small, and I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>It gets into the brush for small brushes just fine,  The small brushes go over the ridges really well.</li>

            <li> Love it for easy cleaning.. I just dropped a star bcoz I wish I was a tad bigger.. I like the top edge part it cleans the brushed better but bas limited space.. Best for smaller brushes. But if u just need a decent cleaning the brush egg will do. If u have a gazillion brushes and need deep cleaning better to just get those gloves cleaning thingy for brushes.. But i still like the product easy to bring and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend I have the aqua one. It is a very inexpensive product that does what it should. The only trick is you have to apply cleaner a lot because it will spill off the sides of the egg. Just takes some maneuvering.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this item but just felt it could have been designed and manufactured so much better.  Yes it is way too small to fit over two fingers.  I will try using it in the palm of my hand as others have suggested.  Also it is very thick and inflexible.  The grooves are much too deep for the job.  But the most annoying thing I found was that it is very difficult to get the brush egg itself clean after use.  I now have eyeliner residue all over the device and really don&#x27;t like having to scrub and waste my makeup remover to attempt to get the stains off.  And those deep, inflexible grooves I mentioned make it very difficult to get in there and clean it out.  All in all this was a huge miss for me.  Too much trouble to return it.  Wish I had just splurged on the Sigma sink mat version instead.</li>
            <li> It used to take me forever to wash my foundation brush! I have tried every different way to give my make up brushes a thorough cleaning by hand but no matter what I did they would never get fully clean, there would always still be some product stuck down in between the hairs and I would get so frustrated but then I saw one of my favorite makeup artists use this to clean their brushes and I immediately went on Amazon to buy one. And let me tell you, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! This makes cleaning my bushes go SO much faster and easier! And the 1st time I used it I washed a bunch of different brushes to see how well it cleaned my foundation, powder, concealer, eyeliner, and eyeshadow brushes and when all my brushes were dry the next morning they all looked like new! There was absolutely no product left over in any of my bushes and they were just totally clean and perfect. This is really an incredible little invention.</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes cleaning my brushes so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Neatest idea ever to help with cleaning makeup brush. Makes the pain of cleaning the brush much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes brush cleaning super fast that I find myself cleaning my brushes more often without the old hesitation of it once being an arduous task. I just hold it in my hand for use, find this more comfortable than placing 2 fingers in the available opening.</li>
            <li> Definitely overpriced. I bought this much cheaper elsewhere.  It is made of decent rubber and does look like the image. It is good for cleaning small makeup brushes. However, I do not find this to clean big brushes that well. It does not get into the brush that well for big brushes. It gets into the brush for small brushes just fine,  The small brushes go over the ridges really well. I wish they had a cleaner for big makeup brushes.  I would buy this at a cheaper price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, ordering was a breeze and it arrived quickly, and not to mention since using it my face complexion has cleared up sooo much!</li>
            <li> Works good to get in my brushes clean!</li>
            <li> Love this egg. Makes cleaning brushes faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Great for eye brushes. Harder to use in my larger face brushes but it does get all my brushes clean. My hand did start to cramp up because I have so many brushes to clean but a solution is to hold the egg in the palm of my hand and my hand doesn&#x27;t cramp.</li>
            <li> This works very well! It&#x27;s small, but it does the job. I used it on an eyeliner brush with white bristles. I thought it was permanently stained. The bristles are now white just like when I bought the brush. My old lip brush is good as new too. It&#x27;s a little too small for my big kabuki brushes, but this is an amazing little product. I just put it in the palm of my hand. Definitely recommend. Shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to give it a try. I wanted to know if it worked because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $40 on the sigma glove. I washed all of my brushes last night, big and small, and I am in love with this. It cut my time in half and my brushes are ridiculously clean. Definitely worth it and much better than paying $40</li>
            <li> Effectively assists me in my MU brush and sponge cleaning.</li>
            <li> A great way to clean your makeup brushes. I&#x27;ve tried other things, this cleans them thoughtfully with any makeup cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like it made washing my brushes faster and you can see all the makeup come off your brushes. My only complaint is that I wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I had NO idea that there was an invention to help wash makeup brushes until I received one of these with a makeup brush that I ordered!  NOW I wonder how I ever lived without it.  It absolutely cuts the times it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!  I used to just wash them over and over and over until the water ran clean, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and clean them in no time!  I am very impressed and very happy!  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, but does the trick.</li>
            <li> I was thinking bout getting the gloves but when I seen this I though I would get this Cuz it was smaller nd if work great give my brushes a deep cleaning</li>
