            <li>It may be my all time favorite color that I currently own.  </li>
            <li>First of all, Gelish is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Smoky grayish blue is the best description I can give.</li>
            <li>My experience, is, that Harmony brand is more durable, than others I tried.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with Gelish polishes that it probably isn&#x27;t healthy.</li>
            <li>but not boring.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Gelish colors.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>polish seems to shrink more than others when curing.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite fall/winter</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love</li>
            <li>Michelle Obama wore a gray/lavender polish during Obama&#x27;s 2012 campaign that I fell in love with.</li>
            <li>Fell in love and ordered it off of Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>There are specks of sparkle/glitter, but to see them I have really get close and be in good lighting.</li>
            <li>The Jet Set was pretty and fashionable; I really love the color going into the colder months!</li>
            <li>Use it like a nail polish, has no drying time, and clean the top coat with rubbing alcohol to make it shine.</li>
            <li>The shade is a beautiful deep gray with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to love it!  </li>
            <li>Great color for fall, kind of a very dark purplish gray.  </li>
            <li>Put your topcoat on and cure, and it should come out smooth.</li>
            <li>I saw this color on a gelish color blog where people submit colors in indoor and outdoor light.  </li>
            <li>I love this color, but this is the first Gelish polish that I&#x27;ve had that has significant shrinkage before curing.</li>
            <li>My friend loved it so much when she saw me wear it that it made her get the whole gel manicure setup</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it&#x27;s a good color if you&#x27;re just looking for something different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great polish  -- and if you want dark gray -- great color.  </li>
            <li>It is actually a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a really pretty and unique color.</li>
            <li>Always Google the colors first to see if u like them!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite gelish color.</li>
            <li>Inside or in dim lighting, the color is a purple/gray and has more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>is just right</li>
            <li>I can finally use dark colors, and they look perfect for 7-10 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As is true with most Gelish colors, the shade of the nail polish does not match the actual color on your nails.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Grey/blue color with tiny tiny lil shimmers of purple in certain lights!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve gotta move quick to make sure that covers your entire nail.</li>
            <li>Nobody else will see the sparkle and you probably will not notice it at first either.</li>
            <li>so much depth!  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments in the last two days!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to make your coats extra thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pretty color</li>
            <li>In different lights it will look more plum or more grey.</li>
            <li>Definitely NOT the color pictured, it&#x27;s actually more grey and looks a little purplish in bright light.  </li>
            <li>Although this polish did not completely recreate her look (this polish is much darker), I still enjoyed this color.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>This one is a beautiful dark gray with micro purple shimmer that can only be seen up close and in direct sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I cure all my colors (dark &amp; light) for the same amount of time and this one seems to pull back from the tips and near the cuticles more than the light colors.  </li>
            <li>- I actually thought it was black because of the name when I bought it, but it&#x27;s a really good shade.</li>
            <li>It is a medium grey with a bluish-lavender undertone and purple shimmer in the light.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect color, not bright and in your face like some other colors,</li>
            <li>In full sunlight, it has a little glitter (like the glitter that shows up in car paint in full sun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont know if the seller sent me an older bottle or if this color is just thicker</li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous grey meets dark purple, or something.</li>
            <li>Still very pretty but different from pic.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Gelish brand to anyone.</li>
            <li>It is a deep grey that looks purple in the right light.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, also - no wrinkling or rippling which happens with some other colors.</li>
            <li>While the color is more of a dark greyish lavender instead of blue, it is still pretty.  </li>
            <li>Like other gellish polish, it is quite shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not my light as all my other products have no problems.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something with more blue or purple undertones, and this isn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, but not the blue that it looks like on the website.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered the Hot Rod Red from Gelish and I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>I love it, but still looking for that dark blue.</li>
            <li>Super cute color looks dark grey in pics but has a tiny tint of a deep plum color while in lighting.</li>
            <li>in the right light it looks like a deep/dark gray, while in other lights it looks to be a dark lavenderish color.</li>
            <li>The sparkle is only noticeable if you are really inspecting the polish.</li>
            <li>Even though I cap off all of my nails with each coat, I still see the white of my nail at the very tip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Subdued and classy.</li>
            <li>You could be fine with just one coat, but I usually do two anyway (see picture).</li>
            <li>However, it is a pretty shade of gray, taking on different colors in different lighting.</li>
            <li>The color sometimes looks like a plain gray and sometimes looks like a rich purple-gray.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a medium gray with super tiny pink sparkles or irridecense.</li>
            <li>I really like this grey</li>
            <li>I thought this color was a dark navy blue, but it looks more like a medium grey.</li>
            <li>It may be user error; I&#x27;ve  only used this color once so far.</li>
            <li>Despite the advice of other reviews, I hoped the color would be as is depicted, more of a deep, dark blue.</li>
            <li>Dark reds and browns work with my skin tone really well, also</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt like a little investment to get the first nail polish set and the UV lamp, but it paid off in only 2 applications, and now I have saloon nails all the times.</li>
            <li>I usually love the Gelish polishes but for some reason this one is very thick and does not last very long.</li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> The actual color of this is a plum grey color.</li>
            <li> I decided to apply 3 coats of this polish, because after only 2 it didn&#x27;t seem &#x27;dark&#x27; enough.   </li>
            <li> Grey meets</li>
            <li> /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color</li>
            <li> It looks like a matte medium grey with just a touch of purple undertones.</li>
            <li> deep purples and other jewel tones.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a dark blue and that is what I THOUGHT i was getting.</li>
            <li> Outside or in fluorescent lighting, it takes on a deeper shade of grey and you notice a subtle blue and purple shimmer finish.</li>
            <li> If I had just seen the color swatch off of here I would not have expected this color.</li>
            <li> It is a basic dark gray -- not really close to black.  </li>
            <li> I have yellow undertones to my skin, dark brown hair, and green eyes.  </li>
            <li> At first it goes on thin and uneven</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something different than plain black but still flattering to my (pale white) skin tone.</li>
            <li> some reason, this shade does come out a bit thicker than some of the other ones.</li>
            <li> navy meets dark purple....</li>
            <li> This is a soft dusty purple color.</li>
            <li> Looks grey.&lt;br /&gt;Far from black.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color.  </li>
            <li> A dark grey with faint purple micro glitter.  </li>
            <li> finally a real black.</li>
            <li> It is actualy dark gray with faint sparlkes.</li>
            <li> I realize that color sounds disgusting, but it&#x27;s actually really pretty, IMO.  </li>
            <li> There are also very subtle purple sparkles in it that you can see in sunlight.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin tone, which makes me really sad.  </li>
            <li> Put on in thin layers, and cure between coats - you wont have any problems with wrinkleing or un-even curing!</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> Love the color! Smoky grayish blue is the best description I can give. Very tiny bluish/purple specks of sparkle. The sparkle is only noticeable if you are really inspecting the polish. Nobody else will see the sparkle and you probably will not notice it at first either. But after close inspection you will see the specs of color. It definitely adds dimension to the color.</li>
            <li> My experience, is, that Harmony brand is more durable, than others I tried. Use it like a nail polish, has no drying time, and clean the top coat with rubbing alcohol to make it shine. I can finally use dark colors, and they look perfect for 7-10 days.&lt;br /&gt;It felt like a little investment to get the first nail polish set and the UV lamp, but it paid off in only 2 applications, and now I have saloon nails all the times.</li>
            <li> While the color is more of a dark greyish lavender instead of blue, it is still pretty.  But, not the color shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  This one is a beautiful dark gray with micro purple shimmer that can only be seen up close and in direct sunlight.  One of my favorites! Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Great color for fall, kind of a very dark purplish gray.  I was happy with the application and didn&#x27;t have problems with wrinkling or shrinking during curing. Looks great with a glitter fade too!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with Gelish polishes that it probably isn&#x27;t healthy. They have wonderful colors and this is no exception. This color looks NOTHING like the stock photo. It is a gorgeous grey meets dark purple, or something. It is the perfect color, not bright and in your face like some other colors, (Shake It Till You Samba, I still love you!) but not boring. In the summer I like to do brighter colors because I can get away with it, but this is my go to color in the fall, winter, and spring. LOVE. IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could only pick one color nail polish, it would be this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, Gelish is the best gel polish, excellent quality as always.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. While yes, it is not the color pictured on the web it is a nifty color. Grey meets navy meets dark purple.... in the right light it looks like a deep/dark gray, while in other lights it looks to be a dark lavenderish color. There are specks of sparkle/glitter, but to see them I have really get close and be in good lighting. All in all reminds me of looking at the night sky on a cloudy night... so much depth!  Like other gellish polish, it is quite shinny and smooth. I decided to apply 3 coats of this polish, because after only 2 it didn&#x27;t seem &#x27;dark&#x27; enough.   I&#x27;ve been very pleased!</li>
            <li> I usually love the Gelish polishes but for some reason this one is very thick and does not last very long. I only get a week out of it and then it starts peeling off. I dont know if the seller sent me an older bottle or if this color is just thicker but I was disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> This color is gorgeous.  I have gotten so many compliments in the last two days!  The color sometimes looks like a plain gray and sometimes looks like a rich purple-gray.  Even my husband said he loved the color!  And that says it all!  Honestly, GET THIS COLOR.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Gelish colors.  Definitely NOT the color pictured, it&#x27;s actually more grey and looks a little purplish in bright light.  I realize that color sounds disgusting, but it&#x27;s actually really pretty, IMO.  I have short nails and medium-dark skin and I just love it.  In full sunlight, it has a little glitter (like the glitter that shows up in car paint in full sun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish seems to shrink more than others when curing.  I cure all my colors (dark &amp; light) for the same amount of time and this one seems to pull back from the tips and near the cuticles more than the light colors.  Even though I cap off all of my nails with each coat, I still see the white of my nail at the very tip.  It may be user error; I&#x27;ve  only used this color once so far.</li>
            <li> I really do love this color. As is true with most Gelish colors, the shade of the nail polish does not match the actual color on your nails. That said, it is a really pretty and unique color. It is a deep grey that looks purple in the right light. There are also very subtle purple sparkles in it that you can see in sunlight. It&#x27;s one of my favorite fall/winter colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, this shade does come out a bit thicker than some of the other ones. You could be fine with just one coat, but I usually do two anyway (see picture). Be sure to make your coats extra thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, even if you do get some rippling, don&#x27;t worry about it. Put your topcoat on and cure, and it should come out smooth.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite gelish color. I bring it with me to nail salons just in case they don&#x27;t have it. The shade is a beautiful deep gray with a hint of purple.</li>
            <li> I really like this grey - I actually thought it was black because of the name when I bought it, but it&#x27;s a really good shade.</li>
            <li> First of all, Gelish is a great product.  I can keep my manicure almost perfect for two weeks, and I love it.  Jet Set went on perfectly, cured just the way it was supposed to.  It is a medium grey with a bluish-lavender undertone and purple shimmer in the light.  It&#x27;s a really pretty color and I really wanted to love it!  Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin tone, which makes me really sad.  I have yellow undertones to my skin, dark brown hair, and green eyes.  Dark reds and browns work with my skin tone really well, also deep purples and other jewel tones.  I think it&#x27;s the blue undertone that doesn&#x27;t work.  Hopefully this helps someone trying to decide!</li>
            <li> Put on in thin layers, and cure between coats - you wont have any problems with wrinkleing or un-even curing! Beautiful Grey/blue color with tiny tiny lil shimmers of purple in certain lights!</li>
            <li> good product,nice price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like to use it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color is just right&lt;br /&gt;i love gelish&lt;br /&gt;happy buyer</li>
            <li> I wanted a dark blue and that is what I THOUGHT i was getting. The color is pretty, but not the blue that it looks like on the website. I have noticed that almost every color is not what it looks like online.</li>
            <li> Despite the advice of other reviews, I hoped the color would be as is depicted, more of a deep, dark blue. It is not that color. However, it is a pretty shade of gray, taking on different colors in different lighting. Inside or in dim lighting, the color is a purple/gray and has more of a matte finish. Outside or in fluorescent lighting, it takes on a deeper shade of grey and you notice a subtle blue and purple shimmer finish. I love it, but still looking for that dark blue. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I really like this color. At first it goes on thin and uneven but after two coats it looks good. It&#x27;s a medium gray with super tiny pink sparkles or irridecense.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but this is the first Gelish polish that I&#x27;ve had that has significant shrinkage before curing. You&#x27;ve gotta move quick to make sure that covers your entire nail.</li>
            <li> Super cute color looks dark grey in pics but has a tiny tint of a deep plum color while in lighting. Stays on for up to three weeks I didn&#x27;t have any peeling up with this polish!</li>
            <li> Nice color... finally a real black. Takes a couple coats but looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t have the blue-ish tint the picture portrays. It is actualy dark gray with faint sparlkes. Still very pretty but different from pic.</li>
            <li> Michelle Obama wore a gray/lavender polish during Obama&#x27;s 2012 campaign that I fell in love with. Although this polish did not completely recreate her look (this polish is much darker), I still enjoyed this color. It&#x27;s something different than plain black but still flattering to my (pale white) skin tone. I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it&#x27;s a good color if you&#x27;re just looking for something different.</li>
            <li> Gelish polish is awesome -- no complaints about the quality, consistency, or durability of this product.  That said, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color.  It is a basic dark gray -- not really close to black.  I didn&#x27;t see the purple and blue undertones that others describe.  I want to like it, but it didn&#x27;t look very good on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great polish  -- and if you want dark gray -- great color.  I was expecting something with more blue or purple undertones, and this isn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I saw this color on a gelish color blog where people submit colors in indoor and outdoor light.  Fell in love and ordered it off of Amazon.  If I had just seen the color swatch off of here I would not have expected this color. It may be my all time favorite color that I currently own.  A dark grey with faint purple micro glitter.  My friend loved it so much when she saw me wear it that it made her get the whole gel manicure setup just so she could wear this polish.</li>
            <li> Looks grey.&lt;br /&gt;Far from black.</li>
            <li> I would not order this product again, I have double and tripled the cure time and it just will not set!  It is not my light as all my other products have no problems.</li>
            <li> Lovely color. Always Google the colors first to see if u like them!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Gelish brand to anyone. This is the brand my salon used when I would have my nails shellac&#x27;ed there. Now that I do it on my own, I&#x27;m very happy and proud to say this brand has held up and given me beautiful nails even done by myself! The Jet Set was pretty and fashionable; I really love the color going into the colder months! I&#x27;ve just ordered the Hot Rod Red from Gelish and I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> The actual color of this is a plum grey color. In different lights it will look more plum or more grey. It is the closest to mauve color in the gelish line I&#x27;ve found so far. Nice color and like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought this color was a dark navy blue, but it looks more like a medium grey. It is actually a very pretty color. It is NOT on the blue side. It looks like a matte medium grey with just a touch of purple undertones.</li>
            <li> This is a soft dusty purple color. Subdued and classy. Goes on easy, also - no wrinkling or rippling which happens with some other colors.</li>
