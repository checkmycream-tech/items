            <li>But, I couldn&#x27;t find a good nighttime moisturizer that wouldnt break me out.  </li>

            <li>Love this oil!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Nice dewy complexion and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>After researching for replacements on Amazon I stumbled on this product,  For about 1/2 the price you receive 60 ml of product (that I liked)  </li>
            <li>Love it and glad I found a more affordable option!!</li>
            <li>I love this, and I love that it is Organic!  </li>
            <li>Overall I found this to be a great product with a really great price.</li>
            <li>great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging/Acne cleanser, which helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>I love this oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will surely recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make it more oily</li>
            <li>Hydrates and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not so sure about the claims of &amp;#34;fast absorption&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It remained oily for most of my waking hours with a not-so-pleasent herbal smell that takes about 15mins to fade.</li>
            <li>and Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this and slather it on my face every night.  </li>
            <li>In love.</li>
            <li>This oil, which is 100% pure unrefined Marajuca oil, leaves my skin incredibly hydrated, smooth and breakout free.</li>
            <li>OK to buy if you are just looking for a light oil for the face but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just amazed on how good this oil works, really.</li>
            <li>I also love that I am not using skin care products full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Erases fine lines from around the eye and mouth.  </li>
            <li>and letting it sink into my skin, I use a light coating of the oil all over my face as a moisturizer before I go to bed .</li>
            <li>but I only use it at night over my moisturizer and it works great...</li>
            <li>I give this oil a 5 star because it is all natural and it is good quality.</li>
            <li>I originally used Tarte because of a sample I received</li>
            <li>Been using this for over a week now and it has been a great moisturizer for my very dry skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li>Using four pumps a day with the winter season in full bloom.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase the full size Tarte Maracuja oil</li>
            <li>I got the Tarte oil as a sample from a Sephora.com order and fell in love with it, but couldn&#x27;t see spending that much money on 2 oz. of product.  </li>
            <li>Not bad of an oil</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on high end oils when this one is the best you can buy for a lot less!&lt;br</li>
            <li>A product well worth buying.</li>
            <li>so makes it all worth.</li>
            <li>I read up about the properties of maracuja oils and found this product to be by far the most economical choice for my first try at the somewhat reverse logic of applying oil onto my oily face.</li>
            <li>I like the Maracuja oil even better than the Argon oil because it absorbs better and has less of an oily feel after applying it.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the top does not come off.</li>
            <li>I use it at night time every night since last one month and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>So, looking around for a substitute, I didn&#x27;t wanna just order from an all-natural company whose products are marketed to be used for many different things.  </li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with fresh, dewy skin, not bad for an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; lady in her early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Good oil, lightly scented, nice texture, helped keep my skin moisturizer in the cold weather!</li>
            <li>It seems as good as the more expensive product from Tarte.</li>
            <li>something costs more, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs quickly onto my face, and I think has helped keep it clear.  </li>
            <li>dont see my fine lines and light red discoloration scars totally disapearing, but I bet this oil help keep them at bay!  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes for it to fully soak into my skin, but I kind of just take this as an opportunity to give myself a mini face massage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So already these two attributes make this oil a better choice by far, especially when you factor in how high the price is for</li>
            <li>It does gives little greasy feel while you apply it but later its all good.</li>
            <li>Sounds scary, works great.</li>
            <li>after using this for a few days, I can tell this oil is much better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used passionfruit seed oil for almost a year now, normally I buy from Sephora paying $50 for 2 oz.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not because of the quality, it&#x27;s because my skin is highly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely illogical to me.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I use 1 pump of the oil on my face after I wash my face at night and in the morning my skin feels really soft.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and seems to do the same thing as the Tarte oil, maybe better.  </li>
            <li>That proved extremely quick absorption on my very dry legs and toe nails, no oily feeling after application and my toe nails have since been so much healthier than when I applied all those other nail supplements to keep it from flaking.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly the same as the more expensive one from T**te.</li>
            <li>Upon further research I found out that Tarte&#x27;s oil is REFINED which completely baffles me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally leave reviews</li>
            <li>One week of applying it every night, I see effects of a more supple skin surface, increased maintenance of hydration under my makeup throughout the day (no, I didn&#x27;t change moisturizers) and a decreased redness of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive brands in my opinion but far less expensive.</li>

            <li> I like the product and it does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I initially didn&#x27;t like the smell and was hesitant to use it, but after a while I got used to the smell and now it does not really bother me.</li>
            <li> Last weeks&#x27;s acne scabs seem to be healing faster than usual, evening out my complexion and no new acne/pimples so far.</li>
            <li> What do you do when you get to the bottom of the bottle with only a little left?</li>
            <li> Garden Age Defy essential Oil blend for a little extra oomph&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Side note, I ran out of body moisturizer and decided to try the oil on my legs and usually dry toe nails.</li>
            <li> Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja oil has no real smell to it, this one does</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my old acne scars have slowly been fading away since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> The only small gripe I have with this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> but I do not know how to describe it other than it is odd.</li>
            <li> With the Tarte oil I feel I have to use at least 2 1/2 dropper fulls to evenly distribute, but with this oil I only need one!</li>
            <li> I was reffered to Tartes brand of maracuja oil, but at $40+ for half the size and theirs is NOT orgranic, I researched other options, and found this ASDM 4ou Orgnic for $25!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it day and night for about a month and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the pump as it keeps the product air tight</li>
            <li> Even my acne scarring (hyper pigmentation) has lighten up a little.</li>
            <li> waste your money on Tarte.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I received a sample of the Tarte Maracuja Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne in the past and use this oil liberally.</li>
            <li> I think this oil maybe fake not real maracuja.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping to diminish my acne scars and seems to heal any hormonal pimples that pop up at least 4 times quicker than without using it, and doesn&#x27;t leave scars.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, buy an unrefined oil instead.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with alot of acne scars and bad complexion due to irregular sleep patterns/diet etc.</li>
            <li> I was getting really bad cheek acne that popped up out of nowhere and was almost in tears as to what to do about it.  </li>
            <li> I bought the ADSM brand hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I love this oil on my skin.  After applying whatever product I happen to be using on my face (retinol, hyaluronic, etc.) and letting it sink into my skin, I use a light coating of the oil all over my face as a moisturizer before I go to bed . I wake up in the morning with fresh, dewy skin, not bad for an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; lady in her early 70&#x27;s.  It also works well on my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a week now and it has been a great moisturizer for my very dry skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. I also have very sensitive skin and it has not irritated me at all!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same as the more expensive one from T**te. I compared them and found no difference. I like the Maracuja oil even better than the Argon oil because it absorbs better and has less of an oily feel after applying it. I use the Argon oil on my body and the Maracuja on my face. This makes for a very nice combo.</li>
            <li> This oil soaked in and did appear to be greasy. Made for a great base for&lt;br /&gt;Makeup. Have only used for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery! Good quality and package. I have used it for a month. 100% satisfaction! I will surely recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li> This product erases the sign of aging, it rehydrates  and plumps up your skin.  Erases fine lines from around the eye and mouth.  A product well worth buying.</li>
            <li> Just like tarte but affordable for those that can&#x27;t splurge. Love it, will repurchase over and over! I have oily acne prone skin and use this as my night moisturizer with no issues. Wake up with brighter, revived, youthful skin. Truly a miracle oil.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it does go a long way. The only problem is that the top does not come off. What do you do when you get to the bottom of the bottle with only a little left?</li>
            <li> I give this oil a 5 star because it is all natural and it is good quality. I had a reaction to it. It&#x27;s not because of the quality, it&#x27;s because my skin is highly sensitive. I gave it to my mother and she likes it!</li>
            <li> The price point is great. I&#x27;ve had acne in the past and use this oil liberally. No breakouts. Nice dewy complexion and absorbs well. I&#x27;ve also used argan oil but I find this works just as good. Using four pumps a day with the winter season in full bloom. I also recommend the oil cleansing method. Sounds scary, works great. Trust me, I&#x27;ve been on Accutane twice.</li>
            <li> I recently received a delixe sample of the Tarte Marajuca oil and had been using it nightly. While it&#x27;s helped my skin retain moisture it hasn&#x27;t moisturized as well as its claims suggest. Upon further research I found out that Tarte&#x27;s oil is REFINED which completely baffles me! Why spend an arm and a leg on a refined oil?!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to see what the difference is and let me tell you, the difference is great. This oil, which is 100% pure unrefined Marajuca oil, leaves my skin incredibly hydrated, smooth and breakout free. With the Tarte oil I feel I have to use at least 2 1/2 dropper fulls to evenly distribute, but with this oil I only need one! So already these two attributes make this oil a better choice by far, especially when you factor in how high the price is for Tarte&#x27;s!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on Tarte. Seriously, buy an unrefined oil instead. I can&#x27;t imagine Tarte&#x27;s oil retaining all the benefits of Marajuca oil. It&#x27;s completely illogical to me.&lt;br /&gt;Even after using this for a few days, I can tell this oil is much better for my skin. Just bc something costs more, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a month now and it is AMAZING!! I have oily skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make it more oily AND it helps with blemishes. I don&#x27;t generally leave reviews but I had to for this!</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  Hydrates and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been using tarte oils for over two years andi can say this is nothing like it in face I think this oil maybe fake not real maracuja. This made my face oily and didn&#x27;t even hydrate it! Don&#x27;t buy I use it for my hair not and its ok for the hair not great!!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing but make me break out. I use caster oil, almond oil on my skin you name it. This felt too oily, never got absorb and just made me break out. I use it on my hair now so I can get rid of product. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Good oil, lightly scented, nice texture, helped keep my skin moisturizer in the cold weather! I like the pump as it keeps the product air tight</li>
            <li> I was concerned about another raters mention of smell to this oil and I have a sensitive nose. It seems as good as the more expensive product from Tarte.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with alot of acne scars and bad complexion due to irregular sleep patterns/diet etc. I read up about the properties of maracuja oils and found this product to be by far the most economical choice for my first try at the somewhat reverse logic of applying oil onto my oily face. One week of applying it every night, I see effects of a more supple skin surface, increased maintenance of hydration under my makeup throughout the day (no, I didn&#x27;t change moisturizers) and a decreased redness of my acne scars. Last weeks&#x27;s acne scabs seem to be healing faster than usual, evening out my complexion and no new acne/pimples so far. Basically, my skin feel healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I&#x27;m not so sure about the claims of &amp;#34;fast absorption&amp;#34;. That didn&#x27;t happen on my face. It remained oily for most of my waking hours with a not-so-pleasent herbal smell that takes about 15mins to fade. It is not unbearable oiliness and I do wake up to a supple and oil-absorbed face in the morning so makes it all worth. Side note, I ran out of body moisturizer and decided to try the oil on my legs and usually dry toe nails. That proved extremely quick absorption on my very dry legs and toe nails, no oily feeling after application and my toe nails have since been so much healthier than when I applied all those other nail supplements to keep it from flaking. I guess the pores on the legs, nails and face are different? *shrugs*</li>
            <li> A few months ago I received a sample of the Tarte Maracuja Oil. I loved it. I wanted to purchase the full size Tarte Maracuja oil but I could not justify spending $46 for 1.7oz (50ml) at the time I wanted it. After researching for replacements on Amazon I stumbled on this product,  For about 1/2 the price you receive 60 ml of product (that I liked)  After about a month of using it I really like it. To me, it feels just like Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja oil. The only small gripe I have with this product is the smell.Tarte&#x27;s Maracuja oil has no real smell to it, this one does but I do not know how to describe it other than it is odd. I initially didn&#x27;t like the smell and was hesitant to use it, but after a while I got used to the smell and now it does not really bother me. I use 1 pump of the oil on my face after I wash my face at night and in the morning my skin feels really soft. I also noticed that my old acne scars have slowly been fading away since I started using this product.  Overall I found this to be a great product with a really great price. I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this works with me. It does gives little greasy feel while you apply it but later its all good. I use it at night time every night since last one month and it works like magic. I saw dramatically improved result on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this, and I love that it is Organic!  I was reffered to Tartes brand of maracuja oil, but at $40+ for half the size and theirs is NOT orgranic, I researched other options, and found this ASDM 4ou Orgnic for $25!  and Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly onto my face, and I think has helped keep it clear.  I am in my 30&#x27;s and i do break out occasionally.  I have been using it day and night for about a month and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;I dont see my fine lines and light red discoloration scars totally disapearing, but I bet this oil help keep them at bay!  I also use this with one drop of Poofy Orgranics Frankinsence Essential Oil or Edens Garden Age Defy essential Oil blend for a little extra oomph&lt;br /&gt;I order the Poofy EO&#x27;s from: http://www.poofyorganics.com/DollfacePoofies&lt;br /&gt;and the Edens Garden Age Defy essential Oil blend from here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I9KKUDA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18</li>
            <li> great product for a very reasonable price. Just as good as the more expensive brands in my opinion but far less expensive. Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used passionfruit seed oil for almost a year now, normally I buy from Sephora paying $50 for 2 oz.  I thought I tried this as it was cheaper.  Not bad of an oil but it&#x27;s not passionfruit.  OK to buy if you are just looking for a light oil for the face but know that this is not passionfruit oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff n great customer service</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I originally used Tarte because of a sample I received and I lived it but could not justify the hefty price tag. I bought the ADSM brand hoping I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed and I wasn&#x27;t! I have combination acne prone skin and was leery about using oil as a moisturizer. Best decision ever! I have actually had less pimples and my skin feels soft and supple. I also love that I am not using skin care products full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was getting really bad cheek acne that popped up out of nowhere and was almost in tears as to what to do about it.  I took my butt to Sephora and started using the Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging/Acne cleanser, which helped tremendously!! But, I couldn&#x27;t find a good nighttime moisturizer that wouldnt break me out.  I got the Tarte oil as a sample from a Sephora.com order and fell in love with it, but couldn&#x27;t see spending that much money on 2 oz. of product.  $46?!?!?  So, looking around for a substitute, I didn&#x27;t wanna just order from an all-natural company whose products are marketed to be used for many different things.  I wanted something comparable to Tarte&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and seems to do the same thing as the Tarte oil, maybe better.  It&#x27;s helping to diminish my acne scars and seems to heal any hormonal pimples that pop up at least 4 times quicker than without using it, and doesn&#x27;t leave scars.  I&#x27;m in love with this and slather it on my face every night.  Also, my skin is no longer oily since using this!! Love it and glad I found a more affordable option!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but I like it so far. It takes a few minutes for it to fully soak into my skin, but I kind of just take this as an opportunity to give myself a mini face massage.&lt;br /&gt;After it soaks in it leaves my skin soft and moisturized. My makeup goes on well over it, and stays well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil! I tried the Tarte maracuja oil and I don&#x27;t think that one is as good as this one! Don&#x27;t waste your money on high end oils when this one is the best you can buy for a lot less!&lt;br /&gt;No pimples for over a month now! I&#x27;m just amazed on how good this oil works, really. I have very oily skin but I only use it at night over my moisturizer and it works great... Even my acne scarring (hyper pigmentation) has lighten up a little. In love. I will be repurchasing as soon as I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
