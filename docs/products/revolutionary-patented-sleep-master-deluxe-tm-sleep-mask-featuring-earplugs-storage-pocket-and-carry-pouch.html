            <li>Love the mask it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>Thank you Sleep Master Deluxe!</li>

            <li>It is absolutely the best sleep mask ever.</li>
            <li>It gave me nice sleep。</li>
            <li>I have the original version and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>does a good job of blocking out light.</li>
            <li>two things, though:&lt;br /&gt;-it is sort of hot, best worn on cool</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a very comfortable mask.</li>
            <li>I sleep better</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable and most effective I have used.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE my sleep.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the finer things in life.</li>
            <li>The fabric on this mask is silky and feels PHENOMENAL while on.</li>
            <li>I have had better sleep masks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very useful!</li>
            <li>Having ear plugs handy in the little pocket of the mask is the greatest.</li>
            <li>I loved mine so much</li>
            <li>do not feel pressure on my eye, easy to wash and easy to carry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(while comfortable) is satin which means it snags easily</li>
            <li>Also it is completely comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It was immediately comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Cushioning comfortable on eyes and face though .</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>It stays in place and keeps the light out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>This is even true if someone turns on the overhead light.</li>
            <li>My first one being 6 or 7 years ago!  </li>
            <li>It blocks out ALL light, plus puts a nice little damper on sound even without wearing earplugs.</li>
            <li>I also sleep on my back front and side and have found the mask to be more than comfortable in all positions.</li>
            <li>Super soft, blocks out all of the light... does what it needs to</li>
            <li>The pocket is a great idea--Now I&#x27;ll never have to worry about searching under my bed for the one missing earplug!</li>
            <li>Completely blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable (even after long periods of time).&lt;br /&gt;Totally blocks out all light even when turning upon one&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>far i consider it not bad</li>
            <li>99.99% certain</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and have used a sleep mask much of the time.</li>
            <li>This is a tiny version of it and doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This really beats the airline issued sleep sets.</li>
            <li>I live it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high price to pay for a sleep mask, but I&#x27;ve been using and washing the one I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li>(Actually, I think my dog has been eating them since I rarely locate the lost ones.)</li>
            <li>So actually it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>and it still looks and works like new.</li>
            <li>And I am even more thrilled to see it now comes with a little pouch and a secret earplugs stash</li>
            <li>Blocks all the light and drastically cuts down on the noise.</li>
            <li>Also the nose area has a lot of gapping, which allows light to go up into your eyes when lying down.  </li>
            <li>The entire thing is satin, so it slips right off in the back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a major world traveler (been to over 60 countries)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is now the 5th or 6th Sleep Master eye mask I&#x27;ve purchased. My first one being 6 or 7 years ago!  I&#x27;ve bought one for my mom, sister, girlfriend,  and 3 for myself as I&#x27;ve lost or destroyed them over the years but never from a fault in the production! I am such an incredibly light weight pain in the a** sleeper and suffer terrible insomnia and this mask is literally the only thing that helps me sleep. Without this ridiculously mask on my face, I am certainly not sleeping. And I am even more thrilled to see it now comes with a little pouch and a secret earplugs stash hideout.&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote, I have a tiny head and so do all the people who received these as gifts so I cannot speak for those with larger heads. I also sleep on my back front and side and have found the mask to be more than comfortable in all positions.</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering this mask. It is absolutely the best sleep mask ever. We travel a lot and always carry the same condo/cabin kit so I&#x27;m adding this mask to my kit so I&#x27;ll never forget it again. The other two I keep at home. When I wash one I use the other while it&#x27;s drying. I can&#x27;t do without this mask. I sleep better and it&#x27;s wonderful for when I get migraines. Completely blocks out all light. Add in earplugs and helps migraines. Also it is completely comfortable to wear. I thought it would be claustrophobic when I received the first one. There was really no adjustment period. It was immediately comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and have used a sleep mask much of the time. This is the most comfortable and most effective I have used. It is meant to also cover the ears. Using this on a plane with a noise cancelling ear plugs were held in well.</li>
            <li> do not feel pressure on my eye, easy to wash and easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;so far i consider it not bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a major world traveler (been to over 60 countries) and I LOVE my sleep. Plus I love the finer things in life. The fabric on this mask is silky and feels PHENOMENAL while on. It blocks out ALL light, plus puts a nice little damper on sound even without wearing earplugs. I loved mine so much I bought another one for my dad, who thinks it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li> does a good job of blocking out light. two things, though:&lt;br /&gt;-it is sort of hot, best worn on cool nights.&lt;br /&gt;-the headband does not stretch, so making it tight enough that it doesn&#x27;t slip off and loose enough for comfort can be a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;i chose this product because so many sleep masks use an elastic band that is stiff and irritating.</li>
            <li> Slides down your head during the night . Prefer standard eye mask with elastic back. Cushioning comfortable on eyes and face though .</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable (even after long periods of time).&lt;br /&gt;Totally blocks out all light even when turning upon one&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;Best sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried to date (and I&#x27;ve tried multiple highly rated masks in the past).</li>
            <li> Love the mask it works wonderful. Blocks all the light and drastically cuts down on the noise. It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I do not like the color and the material. In my opinion it lacks quality. I have had better sleep masks</li>
            <li> I had been using the Sleep Master for years now. I went to buy another and found this one with the pocket and pouch. The pocket is a great idea--Now I&#x27;ll never have to worry about searching under my bed for the one missing earplug! (Actually, I think my dog has been eating them since I rarely locate the lost ones.) It&#x27;s a high price to pay for a sleep mask, but I&#x27;ve been using and washing the one I&#x27;ve had for years and it still looks and works like new. I figure I would have gone through about 5 or 6 of the cheaper kind in that time frame, and this one I do KNOW works great. So actually it&#x27;s well worth the price-- And now just think of all the money I&#x27;ll save on earplugs-- I guess I&#x27;ll have to spend it on chew toys for the dog. Thank you Sleep Master Deluxe!</li>
            <li> The entire thing is satin, so it slips right off in the back.  Also the nose area has a lot of gapping, which allows light to go up into your eyes when lying down.  I returned this product.</li>
            <li> I have the original version and it&#x27;s great.  This is a tiny version of it and doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I have bought two now and suggest this product to others.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I think I have tried just about every mask out there and this is the best in my opinion. No elastic to wear out. Extremely comfortable. Great at blocking any light-no leakage. The only downside is the fabric (while comfortable) is satin which means it snags easily but that&#x27;s just a cosmetic issue and doesn&#x27;t affect the functioning. 99.99% certain I will never use another brand</li>
            <li> Super soft, blocks out all of the light... does what it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it every night at home, and I take it with me whenever I travel. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to sleeping without it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It gave me nice sleep。</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very useful!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I live it!</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to go to sleep with the TV flickering in the dark. My other half has to have TV to go to sleep. This is a very comfortable mask. It stays in place and keeps the light out of your eyes. This is even true if someone turns on the overhead light. Having ear plugs handy in the little pocket of the mask is the greatest. This really beats the airline issued sleep sets.</li>
