            <li>the shape is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Good for beginners!!!</li>
            <li>The guide works great on the bottom lid</li>
            <li>Great makeup applicator</li>
            <li>This is great for the outline of you eyeliner .</li>
            <li>It is a great helpful tool</li>
            <li>The item came in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good fit for my hand.  </li>
            <li>I hope you have better luck with this product.</li>
            <li>Cool idea!</li>
            <li>I had seen it advertised in many books and was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get here but the price was great!</li>
            <li>Before I purchased the item, it would have been great to know that there is no English on the packaging and one may need an interpreter.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to place on my face and</li>
            <li>Ladies must try this product if you are tired of the line not coming out perfect</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is simple to use and although the directions are written in an Asian language the directions have pics and are fairly self-explanatory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it certainly is what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>and i have to hold it taught to get a decent line.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I will when I have a little more time to experiment with my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that if you have trouble putting eyeliner inside your eye on the waterline this tool is probably not something you would need since you can get to that area of your eye much more easily by just using your fingers to pull down or lift up your lid.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has two sides to it, a light and deep for different looks.  </li>
            <li>The idea is good, but it is very difficult for someone who wears glasses to use without help from another person.</li>

            <li> There are instructions on the package, but the instructions are written in a foreign language, Chinese maybe.</li>
            <li> So no thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the material that its made of was too hard, but it just didn&#x27;t have enough bend</li>
            <li> thought this would help me line my eyes in the am, soooo not worth the money.</li>
            <li> also ruins pencil/mech liners..</li>

            <li> I have trouble with my hands shaking</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just getting back into wearing makeup and I never used eyeliner before - I also have bad eyesight - which makes it slightly harder to use but not exceptionally</li>
            <li> It is too thick and does not work well.</li>
            <li> I could not use it--too thick and awkward</li>
            <li> Was used and dirty ,not happy</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s alright, but the instructions are in Chinese. It didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>

            <li> There are instructions on the package, but the instructions are written in a foreign language, Chinese maybe. Before I purchased the item, it would have been great to know that there is no English on the packaging and one may need an interpreter. The guide works great on the bottom lid but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it on the upper lid.</li>
            <li> Great makeup applicator</li>
            <li> The item came in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use and although the directions are written in an Asian language the directions have pics and are fairly self-explanatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just getting back into wearing makeup and I never used eyeliner before - I also have bad eyesight - which makes it slightly harder to use but not exceptionally so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that if you have trouble putting eyeliner inside your eye on the waterline this tool is probably not something you would need since you can get to that area of your eye much more easily by just using your fingers to pull down or lift up your lid.</li>
            <li> thought this would help me line my eyes in the am, soooo not worth the money. kinda shotty and i have to hold it taught to get a decent line. also ruins pencil/mech liners..</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t managed to learn how to use it tbh</li>
            <li> Ladies must try this product if you are tired of the line not coming out perfect then u must give this a try cause it helps out!!</li>
            <li> Cool idea! Works pretty well. I have trouble with my hands shaking and I spend forever trying to put on mascara. This does help.</li>
            <li> Havent used it yet because the directions are in Chinease or Manderin. They should have sent in English..I cant read that!!!!!</li>
            <li> I could not use it--too thick and awkward</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product. I had seen it advertised in many books and was excited to get it. It is too thick and does not work well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but it certainly is what I was expecting.  Comfortable to place on my face and the shape is perfect.  It&#x27;s also a good fit for my hand.  I like the fact that it has two sides to it, a light and deep for different looks.  The price couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but I can&#x27;t get this to work for me.  I watched a video on you tube and I still can&#x27;t  make it work for me.  I hope you have better luck with this product.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for the outline of you eyeliner . Also to do your eyelashes . It is a great helpful tool</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here but the price was great! I can apply eyeliner without making a mess now.</li>
            <li> The idea is good, but it is very difficult for someone who wears glasses to use without help from another person.</li>
            <li> It may work on a different type of eyelid, but I didn&#x27;t get the results that I was looking for. I don&#x27;t know if it was the material that its made of was too hard, but it just didn&#x27;t have enough bend you could work with for your eyeliner. So no thanks.</li>
            <li> Was used and dirty ,not happy</li>
