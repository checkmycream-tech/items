            <li>The smell is actually pretty good (it did not bother me) and it simply works.&lt;br /&gt;*item purchased at a discount in return for my 100% honest feedback</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This facial toner works wonderfully. I just received it about 5 days ago and have been using it ever since in conjunction with the Swiss Botany Mandelic Acid Facial Cleansing Gel and I am so pleased. My skin has cleared and brightened and is so smooth. This toner is strong for my sensitive skin with the glycolic acid but it is so worth it!!!!!!!!! It minimizes my pores and really cleans my pores.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the products or Swiss Botany and I let my mom use this one. After two weeks of using it, her face somehow has a nice glow and it&#x27;s been clearing her dark spots a bit. Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> As with all Swiss Botany products, I am having greater than expected results. All of their products, when used together, will give you such nice skin. Your skin will look younger. The toner is good at removing all dirt and makeup from your face. It helps unclog pores and you will love how fresh your face will feel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love ALL of the products that Swiss Botany produces and look forward to their new innovations. The presentation, feel, smell and effectiveness of the products are top notch.</li>
            <li> Great toner.  Feels good on my skin, not sticky after application, and rebalances pH after washing.</li>
            <li> I have been reviewing a few of the many Swiss Botany products and I have become a HUGE fan.  Never disappointed and highly recommended to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: This toner has helped in minimizing my large pores.  Plus has given my skin a nice glow without a oily shine.  I use this both morning and night WITHOUT fear of it drying out my skin.  Just love the feeling that it&#x27;s super clean.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use this as well as the whitening mask.  I recommend these products. I did receive this product at a discounted price for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I was surprised for the money how big the bottle was that came! A good product in a good size. I usually don&#x27;t use toner but I love all the other products I have purchased from swiss botany. I feel this product works well and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel overly dried out. I feel like it gets everything off my face that I missed while cleansing since I&#x27;m usually in a hurry while doing that. I&#x27;ll be reordering soon!</li>
            <li> Great Toner!  Haven&#x27;t used a toner in years but with this toner-I&#x27;m loving it!  You feel refreshed &amp; like you are doing your skin a favor.  I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  I will keep using this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner in years and now that I am using the Swiss Botany toner, I&#x27;m trying to figure out why I stopped using one.  My face feels extra clean and I like the AHA/BHA that gives my skin the refinement that it needs.  I really like this product and I&#x27;m back to using a toner again.  Worth noting: Swiss Botany is a cruelty free product which is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I like that this toner includes AHA; I feel a little sting sometimes, so I know it has that acid in it.  It&#x27;s effective in making my skin feel cleaner.  Not sure about the PH balance though.</li>
            <li> I love this Swiss Botany Purifying Facial Toner!  I am a beauty blogger so I test out an obscene amount of products and I have been testing out a few Swiss Botany products lately and I have been super impressed!&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 years old with oily and blemish prone skin.  I also suffer from Melasma (hyperpigmentation).  I have been using this Toner in addition to the Swiss Botany Mandelic Acid Facial Cleansing Gel &amp; Micropolish Cleansing Exfoliator and I love the results!  I love that this Toner contains AHA/BHA which is one of my favorite ingredients in a toner because it helps slough off dead skin cells and it deeps cleans pores.  The other ingredients in the Toner help soothe and balance out my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This Swiss Botany Purifying Facial Toner combined with the Swiss Botany Mandelic Acid Facial Cleansing Gel &amp; Micropolish Cleansing Exfoliator  is a &amp;#34;Dream Team&amp;#34; of products!  I would highly recommend any or all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary or at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> Love love love. I use it every morning and night. It&#x27;s such an awesome toner. It&#x27;s my favorite !</li>
            <li> This honestly the only toner that has ever worked for me, and coming from a side where breakouts are just around the corner. This toner is gentle but I can feel the cleanliness. It has not irritated my skin what so ever. My skin feels hydrated not shriveled to give the affect of toned  tight skin, but real toned skin and hydrated and confortable which are awsome. THE BIGGEST AND BEST PART ABOUT THIS PRODUCT WHERE NO OTHER TONER HAS HELPED ME AND IM TALKING SOME EXPENSIVE EUROPEAN STUFF. THIS HAS HELPED WITH THE REDUCTION OF SIZE IN PORES AND I BELIVE THE MORE I CONTINUE TO USE IT THE SMALLER THE RESULT...Haha ..talking about my PORES of course. As long as Swiss Botany produces quality products that work and don&#x27;t just claim to. They will have my loyalty. They have it now , keep up the good work Swiss Botany Team! Used combined with the other products in the Swiss line up it a powerful thing.</li>
            <li> So, as a toner, this stuff is perfectly adequate. It does it&#x27;s job. However, it smells! Oh it smells! It smells like I&#x27;m wiping nail polish remover on my face!</li>
            <li> Leaves you skin feeling clean but not dry. Pores are looking smaller after using it a few days.</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial toner that does not dry out my skin.  If I wash my face and don&#x27;t get all the dirt/makeup/grime from the day off, I know that this toner will do the trick for any residual stuff left on my face.  It just makes you feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works, it will get ALL the dirt and grime off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin feel nice and tight afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to make you glow! :)&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty strong and sometimes it stings a little, though I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impressions: Great toner, does the job. Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was purchased at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> another great product from Swiss Botany!  love it</li>
            <li> This toner feels very clean after applied and smells great! Since I have oily skin and it works so perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This toner has helped the pores on my face visibly smaller. It is very strong and effective. After using it for a week, I have noticed my skin has become clearer and looks visibly softer. Another thing I love about this product is that I have had less breakouts than ever!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like it, feels great!</li>
            <li> Honest review. I have very oily skin. I haven&#x27;t found anything to help. Got a coupon to order this along with the Mandel Acid Facial wash.  After using them I didn&#x27;t have to blot my face free from oil at all, even with makeup on. It also preps my face before applying makeup. I use it at night and in the morning. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I love love love this toner. This is my new to-go toner and since I got it, it has dramatically reduced breakouts and future breakouts on this face of mine. Whenever I extracted a pimple/blackhead, I sealed it with this toner; I can feel the minor &#x27;burn&#x27; at first, which is a great sign to me because this means that it&#x27;s killing the bacteria and the next day, the pimple&#x27;s size reduced dramatically. After I wash my face (including all the other steps such as exfoliating and putting a mask on), I apply this toner all over my face and it also tightens the appearance of my pores. The smell is actually pretty good (it did not bother me) and it simply works.&lt;br /&gt;*item purchased at a discount in return for my 100% honest feedback</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing! it has made my pores visibly smaller and makes my face look fresh. I use it every night after taking my make up off, and I truly can say you can see a dramatic difference in your skin. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very potent toner, yet not harsh.  I used this immediately after I had used the Swiss Botany exfoliator and it did not even sting...  ;-)</li>
