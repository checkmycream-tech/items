    <ol>
            <li>Coppertone is perfect for my skin, including my face and head.</li>
            <li>Smells great too and non greasy!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t best Coppertone.</li>
            <li>to 15 gave me the best tan in NYC.</li>
            <li>best price at Amazon, of course.</li>
            <li>Works great, been using for years....</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t pleasant coming out of the bottle either.</li>
            <li>Feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Good tanning lotion</li>
            <li>the fragance is nice but not too strong and the non greasy formula is great!</li>
            <li>Used this at the OBX in 80+  weather and did not burn but still got a nice bronze, however, I did reapply periodically because this one is an &amp;#34;8.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best sunblock out there!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to be able to get it via the internet.</li>
            <li>I go to Amazon more and more for items like this.</li>
            <li>It gives me the most even tan of any product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Whatever ultra adhesive skin waterproofing and perfume chemical is in this cannot be healthy.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Coppertone?</li>
            <li>and i just love it.</li>
            <li>Love this coppertone tanning lotion because it&#x27;s non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It still has that clean, &amp;#34;original Coppertone scent&amp;#34; too!</li>
            <li>on smoothly</li>
            <li>Light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Well, first I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product smells NOTHING like the original Coppertone tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Was glad to find the SPF 8  still available and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It will protect you from the sun for a few hours and produce a good tan while being kind to your skin.</li>
            <li>This is the new [2013] lotion and it covers better then the 2012</li>
            <li>This is a very mild lotion that absorbs fast and</li>
            <li>Good stuff, just like the old stuff, but new packaging.</li>
            <li>Despite it only being spf 8, I never get burned with this stuff and it helps give me a nice tan.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews...</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I buy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most sunscreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Especially the spray on kind.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for working all day in the hot sun, but working on your tan.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li>I bought it to take it to my vacation, it was the first time trying it</li>
            <li>And for my skin, I only really apply it once and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>this lotion gives me protection and a lovely golden color that I can&#x27;t get from any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I felt strong enough about this to take the time and say...</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and can&#x27;t use the super high spf lotions that the stores are full of.</li>
            <li>There were large patches on my skin uncovered by the lotion, no matter how much I tried to rub it in.</li>
            <li>There is nothing like the original smell of Coppertone...brings us back to the 1960&#x27;s and the beach...LOVE it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was not old either, the product came out and went on smooth.</li>
            <li>I did not get the classic scent as pictured.  </li>
            <li>You want to make this right...send me the classic scent as pictured...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel greasy after applying and it provides all the sun protection you&#x27;ll need (unless you have very sensitive skin or live on equator!).</li>
            <li>I used to live in Hawaii and this was my sunscreen of choice.</li>
            <li>Now I live in California near Santa Cruz.</li>
            <li>and i cant seem to wash the smell off of the clothing despite numerous, thorough hand washes in very soapy water.</li>
            <li>I know this can happen on wet skin, but with this lotion it happened on dry, clean skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mean light sunscreen.  </li>

            <li> This is the new [2013] lotion and it covers better then the 2012 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> This one has a scent. Used this at the OBX in 80+  weather and did not burn but still got a nice bronze, however, I did reapply periodically because this one is an &amp;#34;8.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Well, first I love the fragrance. Coppertone smells like summer to me. Then there is the sunscreen factor....this lotion gives me protection and a lovely golden color that I can&#x27;t get from any other product I&#x27;ve tried. This is a staple in my beach bag. Light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used Coppertone for years!  It gives me the most even tan of any product.  It still has that clean, &amp;#34;original Coppertone scent&amp;#34; too!</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically because of the &amp;#34;Classic Coppertone&amp;#34; scent, as the Coppertone website indicates in the product description.  This product smells NOTHING like the original Coppertone tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Love it. Can&#x27;t best Coppertone. Using number 8 and working my&lt;br /&gt;way to 15 gave me the best tan in NYC. You can&#x27;t find number 8&lt;br /&gt;on the shelves anymore. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin.  Remember this is not a sun screen, but a tanning lotion.  It will protect you from the sun for a few hours and produce a good tan while being kind to your skin. Not recommended for working all day in the hot sun, but working on your tan.</li>
            <li> It advertises that it is the &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; Scent when it is not.  The bottle does not even match what I received.</li>
            <li> Coppertone Tanning Lotion, Non-greasy, I wouldn&#x27;t order it again, because it did dry out my skin.  But it did help keep me from burning.</li>
            <li> This lotion was difficult to apply, in the sense that it &amp;#34;curdled&amp;#34; (fault of a better word) and didn&#x27;t stick to the skin. There were large patches on my skin uncovered by the lotion, no matter how much I tried to rub it in. I know this can happen on wet skin, but with this lotion it happened on dry, clean skin. I was not able to use, and threw it away after a few attempts. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Whatever ultra adhesive skin waterproofing and perfume chemical is in this cannot be healthy. This crap has made both my wetsuit and boardshorts smell horrible and i cant seem to wash the smell off of the clothing despite numerous, thorough hand washes in very soapy water. $8 dollar sunscreen seems to have cost an extra $350 in ruined gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not old either, the product came out and went on smooth. The smell wasn&#x27;t pleasant coming out of the bottle either.</li>
            <li> Works great, been using for years....best price at Amazon, of course.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Coppertone?</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just like the old stuff, but new packaging.</li>
            <li> 1) The company uses animals for testing.&lt;br /&gt;2) The ingredients are not what you wish to have on your skin: Active Ingredients: Octinoxate (7%), Oxybenzone (2%).

            <li> This is absolutely the best sunblock out there!  You don&#x27;t feel greasy after applying and it provides all the sun protection you&#x27;ll need (unless you have very sensitive skin or live on equator!).</li>
            <li> Amazon is putting a picture of one product, yet sending a different one.  I did not get the classic scent as pictured.  I rarely write reviews...I felt strong enough about this to take the time and say...shame on you Amazon!  You want to make this right...send me the classic scent as pictured...that is what I paid for!</li>
            <li> Was glad to find the SPF 8  still available and at a reasonable price.  Will definitely order more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years now. This is the only kind I buy. It is non greasy, goes on well, and lasts a while. And for my skin, I only really apply it once and it lasts most of the day. Works well with all the watersports, surfing, wakeboarding, jet skiing, swimming, snorkeling... I used to live in Hawaii and this was my sunscreen of choice. Now I live in California near Santa Cruz. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find SPF 8, at least where I live.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s nice to be able to get it via the internet.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most sunscreen&#x27;s. Especially the spray on kind. This is a very mild lotion that absorbs fast and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a ton of time at the pool during the summer and typically only have to re-apply 2x a day (being out for 6 or so hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it to take it to my vacation, it was the first time trying it and i just love it. the fragance is nice but not too strong and the non greasy formula is great!</li>
            <li> Good tanning lotion er.. I mean light sunscreen.  Well done copper tone!</li>
            <li> Love this coppertone tanning lotion because it&#x27;s non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t see an expiration date, though which is why I give 4 stars.</li>
