            <li>THE PRICE (VERY CHEAP) THANKS!! : )</li>
            <li>Strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a strong alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li>Not so strong or light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS 100% ORIGINAL..</li>
            <li>IT COMES IN ITS ORIGINAL CASE AND</li>
            <li>IT is not,,,, It is the Real Deal! :):</li>
            <li>If your looking for an original no-fruity perfume this is it.</li>
            <li>However, the smell reminds me of clean laundry.</li>
            <li>SO YOU CAN USE THIS FOR COOL DAYS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>I would describe it as a sweet and uplifting scent.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh &amp; clean &amp; I often get compliments wearing it.</li>
            <li>and it showed up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good</li>
            <li>The product is genuine and works very well.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because I feel it&#x27;s a quality perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume smell.</li>
            <li>This size was great and should last until next year!</li>
            <li>Much smaller bottle in the mall cost more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t exactly describe what it smells like.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I love Curve and especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>Scent is good but doesn&#x27;t even last enough for you to leave the bed room to the living room.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large for the price.  </li>
            <li>buyer beware, this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>I saw this at Marshall&#x27;s today for $19.99 but $25 for the big bottle with free shipping</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really beat that.  </li>
            <li>I really like this perfume when my wife wears this.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff in high school, and I still buy it!</li>
            <li>and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Decent price</li>
            <li>I live in Venezuela.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was normal, with no drawbacks, as it should be, absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it since high school and have always gotten complements.</li>
            <li>It will last a long time, but I will by more when i run out.</li>
            <li>My mom loves this perfume and it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>At least once a day someone comments on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly alcohol, and there&#x27;s very little perfume content in this bottle.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle, should last a long time.</li>
            <li>My wife can use only certain perfumes and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very feminine odor and last quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Not the real perfume,  fragrance is different</li>
            <li>Still sucks cuz it wasn&#x27;t here in time for christmas, however I&#x27;m just glad they are replacing it for me.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S LIGHT NOT STRONG</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size of the bottle and thought I was getting a smaller one than actually showed up!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny; about half of what the stores charge for this.</li>
            <li>The purchase was as expected but the sprayer mechanism doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume directly from Amazon and not a third party seller.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered I questioned if this was the real Curve that I had purchased in the past, and after I received it I found out that it is actually the real perfume.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this perfume at other stores for about $30.00, or a little more, but only received half the amount compared to this bottel from Amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> buyer beware, this is not the real deal. It&#x27;s mostly alcohol, and there&#x27;s very little perfume content in this bottle. It&#x27;s a fake, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> So nice to purchase and have delivered....my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance and I love it.  Decent price and it showed up fairly quickly. I go through 3-4 bottles per year so this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love Curve and this is a large bottle which make is a very good value.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume at other stores for about $30.00, or a little more, but only received half the amount compared to this bottel from Amazon.  Before I ordered I questioned if this was the real Curve that I had purchased in the past, and after I received it I found out that it is actually the real perfume.  Great deal, you go Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed the Curve by Liz Claiborne.  The size of the bottle for the price was a very good.</li>
            <li> I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED I JUST PURCHASED THIS PERFUME AND IT IS 100% ORIGINAL.. IT COMES IN ITS ORIGINAL CASE AND EVERYTHING.. I WILL DEFINETLY ORDER MORE :) ONE HAPPY CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Curve by Liz Claiborne for 10 years.  It&#x27;s a great scent and not too strong.  I get compliments about how nice I smell every time I wear it.  It&#x27;s the best.  I saw this at Marshall&#x27;s today for $19.99 but $25 for the big bottle with free shipping is still a really good deal.</li>
            <li> Love it, great pricing and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Kind of a go to fragrance!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order perfume online because I have seen many reviews where the consumer says that it was a fake.  This is definitely the real thing.  I was also shocked by how gigantic the bottle was for the price.  I have been wearing Curve for probably ten years and I usually by the 3.4oz bottle at Walgreens for the same price as this 6.8oz bottle.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good amount for the price. Smells nice too. However, the smell reminds me of clean laundry. I was wanting something a little different, a little younger. Still smells pretty good though. Curve smells better in the men cologne to me.</li>
            <li> My wife can use only certain perfumes and this is one of them.  She loves it.  She recommends it to others.  So, I am recommending it here to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey guys, try it for your wife.  She could love it, too!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Great price. Much smaller bottle in the mall cost more. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments. Huge bottle, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> this perfume came really in perfect shape, is original and smell incredible. i recommend this perfume. i was fascinated when my girl put it on. THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> Got this for each, my wife and daughter.  They loved their gifts.  I have nothing other to say then I LOVE IT!!!!!!! Came NIB in a protected shipping box.  Will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent, and the price was much better than at the stores. It will last a long time, but I will by more when i run out.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!!!! My only product I use!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say this BUT I almost decided not to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I want to be truthful and let everyone know the price is unbelievable!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you think it is water downed IT is not,,,, It is the Real Deal! :):):)&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is I hope it does NOT sell out!&lt;br /&gt;Yes I Love it. Yes I Love Amazon! Said and done. ENJOY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell great price came fast. Eould buy again. The ladies love it.would recommend and would buy again. Stay up player..........</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for the size you&#x27;re getting! I get crazy compliments over the smell of this perfume! It wears for HOURS!!!! The best and ONLY one I will ever ever ever use!!! Great packaging as well! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go to perfume for everyday wear. I have been wearing it since high school and have always gotten complements. It&#x27;s a very fresh, clean fragrance. Strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> this is the ony perfume i buy.  it is a VERY good price, considering a tiny bottle in walmart is like $15.  this bottle lasts me almost a year, usually.  can&#x27;t really beat that.  and it smells amazing.  :)</li>
            <li> This perfume takes me back, it reminds me of my Mom. And the price is awesome fro the size of this bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;thanks :)</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> It fades away like 3 mins after it has been sprayed. Scent is good but doesn&#x27;t even last enough for you to leave the bed room to the living room. i have been buying a lot of curve cologne, this one was bought as a gift for my wife, she liked the smell and i did too, but the duration was one hell of a problem. i am so disappointed in the curve products on here. the prices are great though and delivery is always on time.in a nut shell, it sucked.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I live in Venezuela.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was normal, with no drawbacks, as it should be, absolutely recommended. The product fulfilled expectations</li>
            <li> SMELL GOOD IT&#x27;S LIGHT NOT STRONG AS IT USE TO BE SO YOU CAN USE THIS FOR COOL DAYS</li>
            <li> It smells great and comes in a large size if you purchase the 6.8 oz. It&#x27;s a very feminine odor and last quite a bit. It&#x27;s also inexpensive which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large for the price.  It smells wonderful.  I use it all the time.  Not very strong, though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size of the bottle and thought I was getting a smaller one than actually showed up! So, for the price it was a bargain!</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume,  fragrance is different</li>
            <li> Great value for the price but the perfume had a bit of an alcohol smell too it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny; about half of what the stores charge for this. The product is genuine and works very well.</li>
            <li> Yes, ladies. this could happen to you too. I really like this perfume when my wife wears this. I have bought this product for several years now.</li>
            <li> The purchase was as expected but the sprayer mechanism doesn&#x27;t work very well so it can be tricky to spray.</li>
            <li> Best price you will find anywhere on Curve. Twice the size and cheaper than any of the big stores.</li>
            <li> Not the same scent I fell in love with a few years ago, smelled similar to stale beer.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter, it&#x27;s her signature scent and getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> It smells like Gap heaven, Very nice.  Beautiful color and scent! Can&#x27;t wait to try Curve Crush when i&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> Another of her favorites, very nice, fairly priced and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this perfume and it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find it in stores. This size was great and should last until next year!</li>
            <li> I find the scent to be a citrusy fragrant. It&#x27;s fresh and light.  I might be in my fifty&#x27;s but don&#x27;t want to smell like my grandmother and this does&#x27;t.  This is a Liz Claiborne product so if you like her clothing line you&#x27;ll love her line of perfumes..</li>
            <li> Wife loves was exactly what she wanted  smells great. She&#x27;s happy I am Happy. Would buy again after she finishes the bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivery on time</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  At least once a day someone comments on how nice I smell.  This is a great price on the perfume and is offered on prime !!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff in high school, and I still buy it! I love this stuff because I feel it&#x27;s a quality perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume smell. It doesn&#x27;t have that floral smell either. I can&#x27;t exactly describe what it smells like. I just love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I never paid attention to sizes...I assumed this was this size I had been getting at the store for the same price....nope! This bottle is ginormous!!</li>
            <li> This has been a go to for years.  It smells fresh &amp; clean &amp; I often get compliments wearing it.</li>
            <li> got this for a Christmas gift smells great and she loves it did  recommend to all women great gift to girlfriend  or wife</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s OK. Doesn&#x27;t look authentic but I keep buying as ladies in my family likes it. Not so strong or light.</li>
            <li> It has a strong alcohol smell.  I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> usually dont vote a 5..but no reason not to. IM STOKED...this has been one of my fav. perfumes forever &amp; needed replaced!! smells just likes its meant...long lasting...not overpowering...&amp; receives compliments!  sells &amp; ships from amazon..so trust it arrives quickly!! GREAT VALUE...this size is tester size not sold in stores...in stores you might get a bottle half as big...same cost. #ALL AROUND WINNING</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Great price.  Hihgly recommended.  This was a great product at a great price.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas.  UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn&#x27;t here in time for christmas, however I&#x27;m just glad they are replacing it for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks! I like it! Great size great price! Might have to spray it during the day for the scent to last. Might be a little diluted.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE EL PRODUCTO, TAL COMO ESTABA DESCRITO, MUY CUMPLIDO CON EL TIEMPO DE ENTREGA Y ESTOY FELIZ CON LA COMPRA</li>
            <li> Curve By Liz Claiborne For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray...I&#x27;ve only worn this fragrance for years...I&#x27;m so afraid they will discontinue it...</li>
            <li> Love this fragrence and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores anymore.  So happy to have found it here online - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> BEST BUY ON AMAZON FOR CURVE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE THAT FRESH SMELL DURING THE WARM SUMMER EVENINGS  ON A DATE OR AT THE WINERY... :) &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;I GRABBED TWO BOTTLES</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume directly from Amazon and not a third party seller. This perfume smells really nice. I would describe it as a sweet and uplifting scent. I have been wearing this perfume since 1996.  When I received my perfume, I was happy to find that it was completely authentic and smelled just the same as when I wore it many years ago. It is the real deal! I was also happy that I purchased this large bottle of perfume at a really great price.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE IT SMELL REALLY WONDERFUL!! I LOVE IT! THE SIZE IS BIGGER FOR THE PRICE (VERY CHEAP) THANKS!! : )</li>
            <li> I love Curve and especially at this price.  Item was as described and shipped on time only toko 2 days to get it</li>
            <li> This has a sophisticated smell that I just love! If your looking for an original no-fruity perfume this is it. This bottle will last for like 10 to 11 months. I just bought this one and the last time I purchased one was in March of 2012. I still have a little left from the bottle from March and I use it 5 to 6 days a week with about 3 to 4 sprays.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on this size of the product. I would definetely buy it again when I run out!</li>
