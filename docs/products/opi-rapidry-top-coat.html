    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the greatest.</li>
            <li>It does seem to work best with OPI polish.    </li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;d do best to just throw the bottle away and go buy something cheaper.</li>
            <li>Especially great as I nanny and paint the little&lt;br /&gt;Girls</li>
            <li>This works perfectly.</li>
            <li>whereas before I applied the polish, the manicure was fairly perfect.  </li>
            <li>A homegrown mani-pedi nail treatment can be just as great as a salon one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>OPI always has excellent quality polishes.</li>
            <li>It does speed up the drying time, protects your nail polish, and all in all makes your nails look beautiful!</li>

            <li>Good for a couple uses, but then gets all goopy.</li>
            <li>It was really a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit more time than just the Rapidry spray, but adds a great finish.  </li>

            <li>My nails are always nice and shiny -</li>
            <li>The best part is how fast it dries..</li>
            <li>but it covers everything and makes it nice and glossy.</li>
            <li>I would recommed this product for any one who does their own nails.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, I can paint my nails, add this top coat and be out the door quickly!</li>
            <li>I have used it three times and each time seemed like it made my polish chipped very easily.</li>
            <li>And I have done my nails for many years and have tried many products!</li>
            <li>Glad to find this product, just love to us it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best in the topcoat which I used far.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>It is by far the best top coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I found that if I keep it in a cool place (refridgerator is good)</li>
            <li>Nice top coat and quick!</li>
            <li>It is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love.</li>
            <li>I prefer Nail Aid&#x27;s Collagen Nail top coat at this point, and it dries almost as rapidly.</li>
            <li>I paid $8 for a bottle of this, and have to say I probably could have gotten better quality for $3.</li>
            <li>I love OPI polish</li>
            <li>I LOVE this top coat.</li>
            <li>I love the OPI</li>
            <li>I will def buy more of this polish.</li>
            <li>I love this and will most definately buy it again.</li>
            <li>Cant think of a better brand.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The rapidry top coat I hadn&#x27;t notices before</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>if I haden&#x27;t used a top coat at all.  </li>
            <li>:) i am glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li>i say more</li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>and I did end up using most of it....</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish</li>
            <li>Thought this was a nail polish top coat</li>
            <li>As soon as you applied the top coat bubbles come as well in mayor quantity...</li>
            <li>Salon use it and the price it more affordable than any store around here.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.</li>
            <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a top coat</li>
            <li>Simply the best I love this product by OPI.</li>
            <li>I loved this top coat at first.</li>
            <li>But this rapid dry top coat is the best!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and the shine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly it drys !</li>
            <li>This is a great top coat and strong finish on top of regular nail polish!</li>
            <li>It does wonders for keeping your mani/pedi nice, crack and peel free with a great shine for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the regular OPI top coat, so I purchased the Rapidry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to OPI which smell strong, but this smells vile even hours after applying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great it works and generally dries your nails within 2 min or less.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind waiting, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>With 3 girls in the house, we go through it quickly!</li>
            <li>I think it was easy to apply and left a very nice and smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I am a huge OPI fan and buy primarily OPI polish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and it works fabulously...</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t deserve to carry the OPI label, to be honest.  </li>
            <li>plus I can paint before bed and wake up in the morning to smooth perfection.</li>
            <li>Having nice looking nails have really improved my emotional/mental outlook on my return to reclaiming my life.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping honest seller.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for this amazing site.</li>
            <li>It has all of the shine and durability of all the other great OPI top coats.</li>
            <li>This nail polish DID dry fast (within two minutes), with lots of shine and a perfect smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Always works great and lasts long!!</li>
            <li>I noticed that each nail was full of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>I have scrubbed a sink full of dishes and my nail polish did not chip.</li>
            <li>Within six hours the whole top coat on one of my nails flaked off as a sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>this is a great fast dry top coat, super shiny, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Super fast and shine top coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with all of my other opi polish.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, keeps nails hard and helps keep polish nice for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>The product came quick.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for when I do a quick touch up on my manicure.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product along with nail polish and it is super.  </li>
            <li>It dries really fast and goes on smooth to give my nails a  smooth and sleek shine.</li>
            <li>I love using OPI Rapidry Top Coat for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>but instead a quick drying spray.  </li>
            <li>Every woman hates it when you&#x27;ve taken the time to give yourself the perfect manicure and mess it up with touching something 30 minutes later.  </li>
            <li>OPI is simply a great brand and this topcoat dries in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This one is very quick drying and very glossy.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted for years and years (I&#x27;d say about 8!)</li>
            <li>I have tried many topcoats before (including sally hansen and OPI rapid dry spray) and I have had the most success with this.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth dries fast and lasts.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price ...   </li>
            <li>It comes with clear instructions in the box, not that most people will need them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I would suggest many many different quick dry top coats before this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that issue with most other top coats</li>
            <li>Drys nails quickly and leaves them very protected and shiny!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it before, but if it is like any other OPI product it will be good.</li>
            <li>The OPI Rapidry had no staying power and all of the polish peeled right off including the colored polish below.</li>
            <li>Nice product, exactly the same as the one in the beauty salon.</li>
            <li>I like how fast is, special</li>
            <li>I always used to get knicks and bumps after painting my nails, but after using this topcoat, I can&#x27;t remember the last time my at-home mani looked less than perfect</li>
            <li>It dried very quickly and my nails were nice and shiny for days.  </li>
            <li>I really love OpI nail polish in general.</li>
            <li>Drys quick and fast</li>
            <li>It does what it says - drys very fast.</li>
            <li>I love all opi nail polish, but this top coat is a little thicker than most for a quick dry, and is much more likely to leave the air bubbles in your nails.</li>
            <li>The Rapidry is a great combination, but as one reviewer says, it does get harder to use when the bottle is more than half gone.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had this happen with a topcoat or a quick dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>Although I bought OPI exclusively for years as I LOVE the quality of their polish, I tried another brand and have found my dream quick dry.</li>
            <li>I always used a quick dry top coat on my manicures, in fact I won&#x27;t do a manicure without it.  </li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m going over a dark color I can see it staining the brush as I go, and I have to clean the brush when I&#x27;m done, which is a hassle especially since the finish is not that great.</li>
            <li>so I decided to give this a try despite the higher price.  </li>
            <li>The next time I tried it, I waited a full five minutes and it still removed layers of polish (I had two coats applied - no base coat).  </li>
            <li>I noticed several reviews stating that this top coat leaves streaks in the nail polish color when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OPI was always my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; polish and using it with the topcoat and spray has made my nails pretty, shiny and chip-resistant.  </li>
            <li>but I find my nails chip sooner than if I use a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>This product dries so fast!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my youngest sister and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>But I have recently discovered a better product called vinylux.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I consistently refill this product in my polish kit.</li>
            <li>Whenever I am thinking of purchasing something I always check with amazon.com first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ones.</li>
            <li>First time I used this product.  </li>
            <li>Great for finishing up your nails with a professional look in half the drying time.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s as much as I can rate right now.</li>
            <li>No hair dryer or cold water needed just the top coat works great.</li>
            <li>I would have to go over the top coat with a different one if I wanted really shiny</li>
            <li>This top coat greatly extends the life my manicure or pedicure and dries the nail polish crazy fast.</li>
            <li>When you first use it , it really does get the job done.</li>
            <li>I love this Rapid dry- topcoat, it does what it says.</li>
            <li>After an hour or two, I decided to apply the OPI rapid dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>I dont have a lot of time to wait for my nail polish to dry which is why I love this product.</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve noticed is that the quick dry top coats usually dont give you as much of a glossy look as normal top coats, but this one is very shiny!</li>
            <li>Dries fast and stays shiny.</li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t use the whole bottle</li>
            <li>This really did work, stopped any smudges when i was in a rush.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle of this free when I bought two regular OPI polishes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight, for example, I applied two coats of regular polish, and one of my regular top coat (more on that later).  </li>
            <li>Thats really all I have to say about it.</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than from a salon.  </li>
            <li>This product really speaks for its self.</li>
            <li>It really works as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It spread reasonably well and the texture and consistency were what I&#x27;d expect for a product of this type.  </li>
            <li>It really dries to the touch in 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Its very shiny</li>
            <li>Very costly.</li>
            <li>biggest problem I have is that if you attempt to use a normal sized coat on top of your polish, the top coat&#x27;s thickness, in conjunction with the brush, ruins the actual manicure!  </li>
            <li>One quick coat of this quick dry</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is that I don&#x27;t think this is quite as shiny as the Seche Vite quick dry topcoat.  </li>
            <li>I love using this products especially when I want my nails to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>it make my nail polish lasts more than with any other usual top coat!</li>
            <li>I am usually very happy with OPI nail products but this rapid dry sucks!</li>
            <li>I tried it, and it makes the polish stay on long, gives a nice shiny effect, and helps make the polish dry very fast.</li>
            <li>last problem is that it honestly doesn&#x27;t dry itself, or the under layers, as fast as it thinks it does.  </li>
            <li>I paint my own nails usually once a week.</li>
            <li>Without the smudge..no other rapid dry works as good as this ..</li>
            <li>Be careful, because it thickens easily.</li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s not cheap or available at drugstores, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the money or time</li>
            <li>I wind up having noticeable marks on my nails where application of the top coat actually removed my regular polish.  </li>
            <li>That stuff is super hard but comes off easily with remover.</li>
            <li>This quick dry really does work.  </li>
            <li>Drying is early, and the luster is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I have noticed I get a few more days with out chipping as well.  </li>
            <li>You can actually Touch your nails right after...</li>
            <li>it really does dry right away</li>
            <li>Considering this is an OPI product, I was expecting for it to live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li>, it has never bubbled on me, and it even helps the undercoats dry quickly as well..  </li>
            <li>, it has never bubbled on me, and it even helps the undercoats dry quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>My usual top coat dries faster and allows me to use and touch my nails within about</li>
            <li>so busy all day , this is for you !</li>
            <li>I tried this topcoat for the first time last night</li>
            <li>Other quick dry top coats don&#x27;t stay shiny for long.</li>
            <li>No other rapid dry nail polish has worked this quickly.</li>
            <li>Wife says that she loves this product because it does dry very quickly and that her paint job lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I put it over some dark, thick polish (Strange Beautiful, which I hadn&#x27;t used before) and I think it helped the polish dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>Only use it if you&#x27;re really in a rush.</li>
            <li>It dries your nails completely in minutes.</li>
            <li>Probably one of my least favorite things from OPI that I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li>wow  </li>
            <li>i would recommend it to anyone who wants to do their nails at the last minute and avoid smudging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this same nail polish last for nearly two weeks with a different top coat, but with this it didn&#x27;t even last two days.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it as my nails started to dry</li>
            <li>Never had my Nails dry so fast!  </li>
            <li>I love OPI products and use them exclusively but; this Rapid Dry Top Coat was a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li>I use over all of my other nail polishes and the coat works well and does dry quickly!</li>
            <li>I was hoping this OPI Rapidry Topcoat would not peel right off like all of the other brands of quick dry polishes I have tried before, but I decided to purchase a regular OPI topcoat at the same time just in case.  </li>
            <li>It really dries faster than all the others I tried, including Drip Dry.</li>
            <li>It does, however, dry fast.</li>
            <li>Using a thick coat inevitably leads to air bubble formation underneath the top coat, again ruining my manicure.  </li>
            <li>so when my nail polish started doing the same thing, I tried the OPI fast Dry clear coat and it worked!</li>
            <li>your manicure will last a week, and that&#x27;s on natural nails!</li>
            <li>It dried my nails quickly while providing an extra clear coat of polish.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m generally even slower with this process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but idk if it really works to make the manicure last long.</li>
            <li>You should always allow a few minutes in between coats of nail polish and should not press down with the brush when applying this top coat.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s harder for them to sit still long enough for a regular top coat to dry.  </li>
            <li>However, it started chipping within the first half hour.</li>
            <li>Cloudy and does not dry quickly, just runs past the nail onto the skin surrounding.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to severe respiratory problems I can no longer have a salon mani-pedi due to fumes.  </li>
            <li>The first couple times it happened, I just assumed I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the regular polish to dry.  </li>
            <li>HAVE USED OPI QUICK DRY TOP COAT FOR  YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the greatest.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work best with OPI polish.    </li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;d do best to just throw the bottle away and go buy something cheaper.</li>
            <li> Especially great as I nanny and paint the little&lt;br /&gt;Girls</li>
            <li> This works perfectly.</li>
            <li> whereas before I applied the polish, the manicure was fairly perfect.  </li>
            <li> A homegrown mani-pedi nail treatment can be just as great as a salon one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> OPI always has excellent quality polishes.</li>
            <li> It does speed up the drying time, protects your nail polish, and all in all makes your nails look beautiful!</li>
            <li> This tope coat is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy!</li>

            <li> Good price for a product</li>
            <li> Good for a couple uses, but then gets all goopy.</li>
            <li> It was really a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit more time than just the Rapidry spray, but adds a great finish.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> My nails are always nice and shiny -</li>
            <li> The best part is how fast it dries..</li>
            <li> but it covers everything and makes it nice and glossy.</li>
            <li> I would recommed this product for any one who does their own nails.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, I can paint my nails, add this top coat and be out the door quickly!</li>
            <li> I have used it three times and each time seemed like it made my polish chipped very easily.</li>
            <li> And I have done my nails for many years and have tried many products!</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product, just love to us it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the best in the topcoat which I used far.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> It is by far the best top coat I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I found that if I keep it in a cool place (refridgerator is good)</li>
            <li> Nice top coat and quick!</li>
            <li> It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love.</li>
            <li> I prefer Nail Aid&#x27;s Collagen Nail top coat at this point, and it dries almost as rapidly.</li>
            <li> I paid $8 for a bottle of this, and have to say I probably could have gotten better quality for $3.</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat.</li>
            <li> I love the OPI</li>
            <li> I will def buy more of this polish.</li>
            <li> I love this and will most definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> Cant think of a better brand.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The rapidry top coat I hadn&#x27;t notices before</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> if I haden&#x27;t used a top coat at all.  </li>
            <li> :) i am glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li> i say more</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> and I did end up using most of it....</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish</li>
            <li> Thought this was a nail polish top coat</li>
            <li> As soon as you applied the top coat bubbles come as well in mayor quantity...</li>
            <li> Salon use it and the price it more affordable than any store around here.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a top coat</li>
            <li> Simply the best I love this product by OPI.</li>
            <li> I loved this top coat at first.</li>
            <li> But this rapid dry top coat is the best!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and the shine is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly it drys !</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat and strong finish on top of regular nail polish!</li>
            <li> It does wonders for keeping your mani/pedi nice, crack and peel free with a great shine for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the regular OPI top coat, so I purchased the Rapidry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to OPI which smell strong, but this smells vile even hours after applying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great it works and generally dries your nails within 2 min or less.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind waiting, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> With 3 girls in the house, we go through it quickly!</li>
            <li> I think it was easy to apply and left a very nice and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I am a huge OPI fan and buy primarily OPI polish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and it works fabulously...</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t deserve to carry the OPI label, to be honest.  </li>
            <li> plus I can paint before bed and wake up in the morning to smooth perfection.</li>
            <li> Having nice looking nails have really improved my emotional/mental outlook on my return to reclaiming my life.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping honest seller.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for this amazing site.</li>
            <li> It has all of the shine and durability of all the other great OPI top coats.</li>
            <li> This nail polish DID dry fast (within two minutes), with lots of shine and a perfect smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Always works great and lasts long!!</li>
            <li> I noticed that each nail was full of bubbles.  </li>
            <li> I have scrubbed a sink full of dishes and my nail polish did not chip.</li>
            <li> Within six hours the whole top coat on one of my nails flaked off as a sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> this is a great fast dry top coat, super shiny, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Super fast and shine top coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with all of my other opi polish.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps nails hard and helps keep polish nice for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> The product came quick.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for when I do a quick touch up on my manicure.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with nail polish and it is super.  </li>
            <li> It dries really fast and goes on smooth to give my nails a  smooth and sleek shine.</li>
            <li> I love using OPI Rapidry Top Coat for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> but instead a quick drying spray.  </li>
            <li> Every woman hates it when you&#x27;ve taken the time to give yourself the perfect manicure and mess it up with touching something 30 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> OPI is simply a great brand and this topcoat dries in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This one is very quick drying and very glossy.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted for years and years (I&#x27;d say about 8!)</li>
            <li> I have tried many topcoats before (including sally hansen and OPI rapid dry spray) and I have had the most success with this.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth dries fast and lasts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price ...   </li>
            <li> It comes with clear instructions in the box, not that most people will need them.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest many many different quick dry top coats before this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that issue with most other top coats</li>
            <li> Drys nails quickly and leaves them very protected and shiny!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it before, but if it is like any other OPI product it will be good.</li>
            <li> The OPI Rapidry had no staying power and all of the polish peeled right off including the colored polish below.</li>
            <li> Nice product, exactly the same as the one in the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> I like how fast is, special</li>
            <li> I always used to get knicks and bumps after painting my nails, but after using this topcoat, I can&#x27;t remember the last time my at-home mani looked less than perfect</li>
            <li> It dried very quickly and my nails were nice and shiny for days.  </li>
            <li> I really love OpI nail polish in general.</li>
            <li> Drys quick and fast</li>
            <li> It does what it says - drys very fast.</li>
            <li> I love all opi nail polish, but this top coat is a little thicker than most for a quick dry, and is much more likely to leave the air bubbles in your nails.</li>
            <li> The Rapidry is a great combination, but as one reviewer says, it does get harder to use when the bottle is more than half gone.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had this happen with a topcoat or a quick dry top coat.  </li>
            <li> Although I bought OPI exclusively for years as I LOVE the quality of their polish, I tried another brand and have found my dream quick dry.</li>
            <li> I always used a quick dry top coat on my manicures, in fact I won&#x27;t do a manicure without it.  </li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m going over a dark color I can see it staining the brush as I go, and I have to clean the brush when I&#x27;m done, which is a hassle especially since the finish is not that great.</li>
            <li> so I decided to give this a try despite the higher price.  </li>
            <li> The next time I tried it, I waited a full five minutes and it still removed layers of polish (I had two coats applied - no base coat).  </li>
            <li> I noticed several reviews stating that this top coat leaves streaks in the nail polish color when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OPI was always my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; polish and using it with the topcoat and spray has made my nails pretty, shiny and chip-resistant.  </li>
            <li> but I find my nails chip sooner than if I use a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> This product dries so fast!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my youngest sister and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> But I have recently discovered a better product called vinylux.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I consistently refill this product in my polish kit.</li>
            <li> Whenever I am thinking of purchasing something I always check with amazon.com first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different ones.</li>
            <li> First time I used this product.  </li>
            <li> Great for finishing up your nails with a professional look in half the drying time.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s as much as I can rate right now.</li>
            <li> No hair dryer or cold water needed just the top coat works great.</li>
            <li> I would have to go over the top coat with a different one if I wanted really shiny</li>
            <li> This top coat greatly extends the life my manicure or pedicure and dries the nail polish crazy fast.</li>
            <li> When you first use it , it really does get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this Rapid dry- topcoat, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> After an hour or two, I decided to apply the OPI rapid dry top coat.  </li>
            <li> I dont have a lot of time to wait for my nail polish to dry which is why I love this product.</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve noticed is that the quick dry top coats usually dont give you as much of a glossy look as normal top coats, but this one is very shiny!</li>
            <li> Dries fast and stays shiny.</li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t use the whole bottle</li>
            <li> This really did work, stopped any smudges when i was in a rush.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this free when I bought two regular OPI polishes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight, for example, I applied two coats of regular polish, and one of my regular top coat (more on that later).  </li>
            <li> Thats really all I have to say about it.</li>
            <li> The price was much lower than from a salon.  </li>
            <li> This product really speaks for its self.</li>
            <li> It really works as described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It spread reasonably well and the texture and consistency were what I&#x27;d expect for a product of this type.  </li>
            <li> It really dries to the touch in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Its very shiny</li>
            <li> Very costly.</li>
            <li> biggest problem I have is that if you attempt to use a normal sized coat on top of your polish, the top coat&#x27;s thickness, in conjunction with the brush, ruins the actual manicure!  </li>
            <li> One quick coat of this quick dry</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is that I don&#x27;t think this is quite as shiny as the Seche Vite quick dry topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I love using this products especially when I want my nails to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> it make my nail polish lasts more than with any other usual top coat!</li>
            <li> I am usually very happy with OPI nail products but this rapid dry sucks!</li>
            <li> I tried it, and it makes the polish stay on long, gives a nice shiny effect, and helps make the polish dry very fast.</li>
            <li> last problem is that it honestly doesn&#x27;t dry itself, or the under layers, as fast as it thinks it does.  </li>
            <li> I paint my own nails usually once a week.</li>
            <li> Without the smudge..no other rapid dry works as good as this ..</li>
            <li> Be careful, because it thickens easily.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s not cheap or available at drugstores, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the money or time</li>
            <li> I wind up having noticeable marks on my nails where application of the top coat actually removed my regular polish.  </li>
            <li> That stuff is super hard but comes off easily with remover.</li>
            <li> This quick dry really does work.  </li>
            <li> Drying is early, and the luster is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I have noticed I get a few more days with out chipping as well.  </li>
            <li> You can actually Touch your nails right after...</li>
            <li> it really does dry right away</li>
            <li> Considering this is an OPI product, I was expecting for it to live up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> , it has never bubbled on me, and it even helps the undercoats dry quickly as well..  </li>
            <li> , it has never bubbled on me, and it even helps the undercoats dry quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> My usual top coat dries faster and allows me to use and touch my nails within about</li>
            <li> so busy all day , this is for you !</li>
            <li> I tried this topcoat for the first time last night</li>
            <li> Other quick dry top coats don&#x27;t stay shiny for long.</li>
            <li> No other rapid dry nail polish has worked this quickly.</li>
            <li> Wife says that she loves this product because it does dry very quickly and that her paint job lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I put it over some dark, thick polish (Strange Beautiful, which I hadn&#x27;t used before) and I think it helped the polish dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> Only use it if you&#x27;re really in a rush.</li>
            <li> It dries your nails completely in minutes.</li>
            <li> Probably one of my least favorite things from OPI that I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> wow  </li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone who wants to do their nails at the last minute and avoid smudging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same nail polish last for nearly two weeks with a different top coat, but with this it didn&#x27;t even last two days.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it as my nails started to dry</li>
            <li> Never had my Nails dry so fast!  </li>
            <li> I love OPI products and use them exclusively but; this Rapid Dry Top Coat was a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use over all of my other nail polishes and the coat works well and does dry quickly!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this OPI Rapidry Topcoat would not peel right off like all of the other brands of quick dry polishes I have tried before, but I decided to purchase a regular OPI topcoat at the same time just in case.  </li>
            <li> It really dries faster than all the others I tried, including Drip Dry.</li>
            <li> It does, however, dry fast.</li>
            <li> Using a thick coat inevitably leads to air bubble formation underneath the top coat, again ruining my manicure.  </li>
            <li> so when my nail polish started doing the same thing, I tried the OPI fast Dry clear coat and it worked!</li>
            <li> your manicure will last a week, and that&#x27;s on natural nails!</li>
            <li> It dried my nails quickly while providing an extra clear coat of polish.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m generally even slower with this process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but idk if it really works to make the manicure last long.</li>
            <li> You should always allow a few minutes in between coats of nail polish and should not press down with the brush when applying this top coat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s harder for them to sit still long enough for a regular top coat to dry.  </li>
            <li> However, it started chipping within the first half hour.</li>
            <li> Cloudy and does not dry quickly, just runs past the nail onto the skin surrounding.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to severe respiratory problems I can no longer have a salon mani-pedi due to fumes.  </li>
            <li> The first couple times it happened, I just assumed I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the regular polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> HAVE USED OPI QUICK DRY TOP COAT FOR  YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> It also takes a little longer than Seche Vite to dry, but still reasonably fast.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t protect the polish for long and clings to it.</li>
            <li> Saves my nails designs in a life style where sitting still for polish to dry isn&#x27;t possible.  </li>
            <li> Probably does not last as long as the long dry products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thinner side as far as formula goes</li>
            <li> It dries extremely fast to a glass like hard shine.</li>
            <li> It provides a thin first coat and a glossy second coat.</li>
            <li> Instant dry!!</li>
            <li> Hope these two last as long as the other did</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps with the tough polishes that dont dry fast enough !</li>
            <li> Nails didn&#x27;t dry any faster with this on it.</li>
            <li> It applies smooth, shines like crazy, and actually dries within the minute it claims to.  </li>
            <li> B0002RUMIG OPI Rapid Dry Spray 4oz]].  </li>
            <li> It does dry the polish faster</li>
            <li> theres no time waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> after 5 minutes your nails fill completely dry</li>
            <li> and my nails are dry.</li>
            <li> down to the last drop!</li>
            <li> I use it after 2 coats of polish in combination with the Drip Dry drops and my mani ia gry in lass than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> it does dry rapidly!.</li>
            <li> My nails perfectly dry in seconds!</li>
            <li> My nails dry faster and harder.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this type of base coat for sure!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my toes and no more knicks in my polish because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li> - I used it over butter London &amp;#34;Fairy Lights&amp;#34; and got little edge chips the next morning.  </li>
            <li> but this was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had nail art stickers (self-adhesive) on a few nails and this went on in a thick enough layer that I almost can&#x27;t feel the stickers if I run my fingers over them, but it still dried in a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent getting it.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> It works like a charm - nails dry in less than 30 mins.</li>
            <li> You do have to remember to let the color dry for a couple of minutes before applying it, or the brush could mess up the color.</li>
            <li> It did chip the next day after application, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would applied over an OPI polish</li>
            <li> No more worry about messing up recently painted nails.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the quality exhibited in their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will also buy other OPI products as well.</li>
            <li> The reason I recommend it over Seche Vite is due to the shrinking.</li>
            <li> My nails are now completely dry within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I work with my hands alot and two coats of polish with a good base coat under this stays for at least a week.</li>
            <li> but I am an average woman use my hands often...</li>
            <li> and this kinda ruins your polish.</li>
            <li> However, about halfway down the bottle, it started ruining my manicure by turning into a film that covered the polish.</li>
            <li> No more waiting for hours for your nails to dry.</li>
            <li> but it is NOT quick drying.  </li>
            <li> Your nails will be completely dry and hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> top coat, however, is a real disappointment, and I would be furious</li>
            <li> Any attempt to apply a thin coat leads to the aforementioned polish removal, or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> before it dried out.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> However, that does not mean I have to have awful nails thanks to an OPI team of this Rapidry Topcoat</li>
            <li> I keep thinking that I got a bad bottle or something and buy it again, only to have the same thing happen each time.</li>
            <li> I was tired of waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> This product was a little thick and not sure it worked as well as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> One thing that really ruined this stuff for me is that it picsked up the polish color so bad.</li>
            <li> It gets irritating because my nail polish dulls within the week, whereas, I have not had this problem with cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless half bottle and a new bottle I bought as a backup before the first one went bad.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that it requires at least two coats.</li>
            <li> OPI, please note all the negative reviews and fix the formula.</li>
            <li> What this means is that in order to avoid removing, and ruining, your polish, you have to apply a really thick coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed that towards the bottom of the bottle it has gotten thick and gloppy.</li>
            <li> it will not get thick or gloppy.</li>
            <li> Although with time (if you dont use it a lot) it gets extremely thick and goopy .</li>
            <li> Not good for my nails.</li>
            <li> Combined with the opi natural base coat</li>
            <li> I hate sitting around waiting for my nails to dry</li>
            <li> Very thin and poor consistency.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any OPI product.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> bad product...</li>
            <li> I also use it as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I like this base coat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I splurged on this at Ulta, and it is the worst nail product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest. If I don&#x27;t put this over my color, my color virtually never drys. My mother was the same way. I&#x27;ve always painted my nails so when my nail polish started doing the same thing, I tried the OPI fast Dry clear coat and it worked! I was so happy.</li>
            <li> Nice product, exactly the same as the one in the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> I am a huge OPI fan and buy primarily OPI polish so I decided to give this a try despite the higher price.  The first time I used it as my nails started to dry I noticed that each nail was full of bubbles.  I have NEVER had this happen with a topcoat or a quick dry top coat.  I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The product came quick.  It&#x27;s a Xmas gift for my daughter (on her wish list) so that&#x27;s as much as I can rate right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love. For a while, the Rapidry works great. But halfway through the bottle, it starts getting gloppy and makes spider web-like threads when you use it. And because it&#x27;s not cheap or available at drugstores, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the money or time I spent getting it. Although I bought OPI exclusively for years as I LOVE the quality of their polish, I tried another brand and have found my dream quick dry. Now I use Sally Hansen Insta-Dry in the red bottle. It&#x27;s affordable and it works fabulously... down to the last drop!</li>
            <li> Helps nail polish last for 2-3 days without chipping. Dries fast and stays shiny.</li>
            <li> The Rapidry is a great combination, but as one reviewer says, it does get harder to use when the bottle is more than half gone.  It takes a bit more time than just the Rapidry spray, but adds a great finish.  Even if I don&#x27;t use the whole bottle it&#x27;s worth the price ...   It does seem to work best with OPI polish.    Arrived in good time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the regular OPI top coat, so I purchased the Rapidry. I use it after 2 coats of polish in combination with the Drip Dry drops and my mani ia gry in lass than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> It did chip the next day after application, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would applied over an OPI polish - I used it over butter London &amp;#34;Fairy Lights&amp;#34; and got little edge chips the next morning.  Maybe over the same brand polish it wouldn&#x27;t - I will try that and see.  I prefer Nail Aid&#x27;s Collagen Nail top coat at this point, and it dries almost as rapidly.</li>
            <li> I paid $8 for a bottle of this, and have to say I probably could have gotten better quality for $3. It does not protect the polish at all. I&#x27;ve had this same nail polish last for nearly two weeks with a different top coat, but with this it didn&#x27;t even last two days. Think I&#x27;d do best to just throw the bottle away and go buy something cheaper.</li>
            <li> This really did work, stopped any smudges when i was in a rush.  But the smell is just so overpoweringly toxic.  I&#x27;m used to OPI which smell strong, but this smells vile even hours after applying.  Definitely couldn&#x27;t cook that night, i might have poissoned myself.  Only use it if you&#x27;re really in a rush.</li>
            <li> Nails didn&#x27;t dry any faster with this on it.</li>
            <li> Almost every product I have purchased that is O.P.I. has been wonderful but this top coat takes the cake. This Top coat is the best of all the top coats I use with wonderful sheen and great drying time.</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish so I decided to give this a try.  I was hoping this OPI Rapidry Topcoat would not peel right off like all of the other brands of quick dry polishes I have tried before, but I decided to purchase a regular OPI topcoat at the same time just in case.  The OPI Rapidry had no staying power and all of the polish peeled right off including the colored polish below. Stick with the regular OPI topcoat!</li>
            <li> I love this Rapid dry- topcoat, it does what it says. i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Never had my Nails dry so fast!  No more worry about messing up recently painted nails.  Especially great as I nanny and paint the little&lt;br /&gt;Girls Hands and it&#x27;s harder for them to sit still long enough for a regular top coat to dry.  No hair dryer or cold water needed just the top coat works great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat. It dries your nails completely in minutes. It has all of the shine and durability of all the other great OPI top coats. I have scrubbed a sink full of dishes and my nail polish did not chip.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly. Just what I was looking for when I do a quick touch up on my manicure. I tried it on my toes and no more knicks in my polish because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li> This nail polish DID dry fast (within two minutes), with lots of shine and a perfect smooth texture. However, it started chipping within the first half hour. All I was doing was painting my toenails, so that shouldn&#x27;t have happened. Within six hours the whole top coat on one of my nails flaked off as a sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top coats are supposed to make your nail polish last longer, so this is pretty pointless.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this free when I bought two regular OPI polishes.  I love the OPI polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat, however, is a real disappointment, and I would be furious had I paid the regular $12.00 retail for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I have is that if you attempt to use a normal sized coat on top of your polish, the top coat&#x27;s thickness, in conjunction with the brush, ruins the actual manicure!  I wind up having noticeable marks on my nails where application of the top coat actually removed my regular polish.  The first couple times it happened, I just assumed I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the regular polish to dry.  The next time I tried it, I waited a full five minutes and it still removed layers of polish (I had two coats applied - no base coat).  What this means is that in order to avoid removing, and ruining, your polish, you have to apply a really thick coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads us to our next problem.  Using a thick coat inevitably leads to air bubble formation underneath the top coat, again ruining my manicure.  Any attempt to apply a thin coat leads to the aforementioned polish removal, or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, for example, I applied two coats of regular polish, and one of my regular top coat (more on that later).  After an hour or two, I decided to apply the OPI rapid dry top coat.  Now I have bubbles all over my nails, whereas before I applied the polish, the manicure was fairly perfect.  The bubbling is not an isolated problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last problem is that it honestly doesn&#x27;t dry itself, or the under layers, as fast as it thinks it does.  My usual top coat dries faster and allows me to use and touch my nails within about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially given the price tag on this one, I would skip it.  It really doesn&#x27;t deserve to carry the OPI label, to be honest.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the quality exhibited in their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, try Sally Hansen Mega Shine.  It applies smooth, shines like crazy, and actually dries within the minute it claims to.  It leaves no streaks (and actually seems to self-correct streak mistakes I have made), it has never bubbled on me, and it even helps the undercoats dry quickly as well..  It leaves no streaks (and actually seems to self-correct streak mistakes I have made), it has never bubbled on me, and it even helps the undercoats dry quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I paint my own nails usually once a week. I have tried many topcoats before (including sally hansen and OPI rapid dry spray) and I have had the most success with this. I have noticed that towards the bottom of the bottle it has gotten thick and gloppy. But I don&#x27;t care. I will def buy more of this polish. My nails are always nice and shiny - plus I can paint before bed and wake up in the morning to smooth perfection.</li>
            <li> It gives a shiny finishing to the nails, I like it. Be careful, because it thickens easily.</li>
            <li> OPI is the only brand I use! I love this product! Thats really all I have to say about it.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! I tried it, and it makes the polish stay on long, gives a nice shiny effect, and helps make the polish dry very fast. Will buy this product again once I run out!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of RapiDry. My first one lasted for years and years (I&#x27;d say about 8!) before it dried out. I don&#x27;t know if it bonds as well with non-OPI colors since I only use it with OPI. It definitely reduces drying time and helps it harden faster. You do have to remember to let the color dry for a couple of minutes before applying it, or the brush could mess up the color. I also use it as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I noticed several reviews stating that this top coat leaves streaks in the nail polish color when you apply it. When used properly it does not leaves streaks. You should always allow a few minutes in between coats of nail polish and should not press down with the brush when applying this top coat. It comes with clear instructions in the box, not that most people will need them. This top coat greatly extends the life my manicure or pedicure and dries the nail polish crazy fast. Does exactly what it says. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. It dries quickly. I think it was easy to apply and left a very nice and smooth finish. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t protect the polish for long and clings to it. This makes it easier to peel away the polish after a day or so. It could simply be the polish I used underneath which was a M.A.C. color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with nail polish and it is super.  My nails dry faster and harder.  The price was much lower than from a salon.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Thanks to severe respiratory problems I can no longer have a salon mani-pedi due to fumes.  However, that does not mean I have to have awful nails thanks to an OPI team of this Rapidry Topcoat teamed with [[ASIN:B0002RUMIG OPI Rapid Dry Spray 4oz]].  Even the Illinois heat and humidity have proven no competition to this dyamic duo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI was always my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; polish and using it with the topcoat and spray has made my nails pretty, shiny and chip-resistant.  I have been using them since May and it is now the middle of June.  Having nice looking nails have really improved my emotional/mental outlook on my return to reclaiming my life.  A homegrown mani-pedi nail treatment can be just as great as a salon one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> OPI always has excellent quality polishes. this is a great fast dry top coat, super shiny, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does dry the polish faster but I find my nails chip sooner than if I use a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is by far the best top coat I have ever tried. And I have done my nails for many years and have tried many products! It dries extremely fast to a glass like hard shine. I work with my hands alot and two coats of polish with a good base coat under this stays for at least a week. I found that if I keep it in a cool place (refridgerator is good) it will not get thick or gloppy.</li>
            <li> Great product as advertised. Fast shipping honest seller. This product dries so fast! I was amazed. It provides a thin first coat and a glossy second coat. Great for finishing up your nails with a professional look in half the drying time.</li>
            <li> I love all opi nail polish, but this top coat is a little thicker than most for a quick dry, and is much more likely to leave the air bubbles in your nails.</li>
            <li> I really love OpI nail polish in general. But this rapid dry top coat is the best! It dries really fast and goes on smooth to give my nails a  smooth and sleek shine. I love this and will most definately buy it again. I will also buy other OPI products as well. This product really speaks for its self. Its definately quality nail polish.  Cant think of a better brand. This dries my nails in under a minute. So i always use this when I go to the nailshop instead of the ones they have there.</li>
            <li> I love using OPI Rapidry Top Coat for several reasons.  It does speed up the drying time, protects your nail polish, and all in all makes your nails look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Drying is early, and the luster is very good.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best in the topcoat which I used far.</li>
            <li> Super fast and shine top coat I like how fast is, special if you&lt;br /&gt;are so busy all day , this is for you !</li>
            <li> Every woman hates it when you&#x27;ve taken the time to give yourself the perfect manicure and mess it up with touching something 30 minutes later.  This tope coat is perfect.  It really works as described.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever!!! This was a gift for my youngest sister and she absolutely loves it!  Great product and awesome quality.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS A GODSEND. I always used to get knicks and bumps after painting my nails, but after using this topcoat, I can&#x27;t remember the last time my at-home mani looked less than perfect</li>
            <li> I hate sitting around waiting for my nails to dry and this solves that problem.  Probably does not last as long as the long dry products but I always have my hands in water or digging in the garden so maybe it would last longer if I didn&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It dries quickly and the shine is amazing.  I will buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.. You can actually Touch your nails right after...Without the smudge..no other rapid dry works as good as this .. Love it..</li>
            <li> It is great. Goes on smooth dries fast and lasts. Extends your polish. It didn&#x27;t change the color of my polish.  Recommended it to friends to also bought it and now like it also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great it works and generally dries your nails within 2 min or less.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the girl on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your prompt business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Wishes,&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly J. Owen</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, keeps nails hard and helps keep polish nice for a couple weeks.  But I have recently discovered a better product called vinylux.  I purchase it at my salon, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s on amazon.  That stuff is super hard but comes off easily with remover.</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> Saves my nails designs in a life style where sitting still for polish to dry isn&#x27;t possible.  And I have noticed I get a few more days with out chipping as well.  :)</li>
            <li> Good price for a product I already had a satisfactory experience with.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  OPI never disappoints.</li>
            <li> This product was a little thick and not sure it worked as well as I thought it would.  I have contacted the seller and will probably get a replacement to try.</li>
            <li> I tried this topcoat for the first time last night and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I put it over some dark, thick polish (Strange Beautiful, which I hadn&#x27;t used before) and I think it helped the polish dry quickly.  I was done with my nails in maybe 20-25 minutes (I&#x27;m generally even slower with this process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It spread reasonably well and the texture and consistency were what I&#x27;d expect for a product of this type.  I had nail art stickers (self-adhesive) on a few nails and this went on in a thick enough layer that I almost can&#x27;t feel the stickers if I run my fingers over them, but it still dried in a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is that I don&#x27;t think this is quite as shiny as the Seche Vite quick dry topcoat.  However, it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and I&#x27;m so Happy that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work i felt like it chipped faster plus it would make my nail polish bubble</li>
            <li> The best top coat I have found!  Drys nails quickly and leaves them very protected and shiny!</li>
            <li> It does wonders for keeping your mani/pedi nice, crack and peel free with a great shine for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> the producto that I recieve is not an opi product is a copy</li>
            <li> I loved this top coat at first. It really dries faster than all the others I tried, including Drip Dry. However, about halfway down the bottle, it started ruining my manicure by turning into a film that covered the polish. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless half bottle and a new bottle I bought as a backup before the first one went bad.</li>
            <li> I am usually very happy with OPI nail products but this rapid dry sucks! I&#x27;ve been doing my nails for over 32 years so I know what to do and how to use a product. This stuff starts to peel within a couple hours. If you don&#x27;t wash your hands, get dressed, get into your pocket book, zip your jeans etc. then I guess it would hold up but I am an average woman use my hands often...bad product...BOOOO OPI!</li>
            <li> I started using OPI nail polish when there was a sale on and haven&#x27;t stopped using it since. The rapidry top coat I hadn&#x27;t notices before so was using a different brand. When I saw this on Amazon I was so happy! My nails are now completely dry within a few minutes. No other rapid dry nail polish has worked this quickly.</li>
            <li> Received it today and took it with me to the nail salon.  Love it.  It really dries to the touch in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with all of my other opi polish.  I splurged on this at Ulta, and it is the worst nail product I&#x27;ve tried.  Not only does it smell atroucious-I think it&#x27;s loaded with formeldahyde-It actually makes my polish chip off faster than if I haden&#x27;t used a top coat at all.  Total junk.  I think I&#x27;ll return it to the store today.</li>
            <li> When you first use it , it really does get the job done. Its very shiny and it dries your polish within minutes!! Although with time (if you dont use it a lot) it gets extremely thick and goopy . and this kinda ruins your polish. Wish it didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Considering this is an OPI product, I was expecting for it to live up to its reputation. However, I noticed that it requires at least two coats. One coat disappears in maybe 3 days and two coats lasts about a week. It gets irritating because my nail polish dulls within the week, whereas, I have not had this problem with cheaper brands. It does, however, dry fast. Nonetheless, I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again. I have used it three times and each time seemed like it made my polish chipped very easily. It also flakes off.</li>
            <li> it does dry rapidly!. theres no time waiting for my nails to dry. :) i am glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li> it works!!! need i say more but i must to meet the word quota. after 5 minutes your nails fill completely dry</li>
            <li> Great price! Great product</li>
            <li> Good for a couple uses, but then gets all goopy. I keep thinking that I got a bad bottle or something and buy it again, only to have the same thing happen each time.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I can paint my nails, add this top coat and be out the door quickly! With 3 girls in the house, we go through it quickly!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat. It works like a charm - nails dry in less than 30 mins. I consistently refill this product in my polish kit.</li>
            <li> I like this base coat. The best part is how fast it dries.. I will continue to buy this type of base coat for sure!</li>
            <li> I was tired of waiting for nail polish to dry. I purchased this product before locally. Very costly. Found it on Amazon while searching for another nail product. I could buy three with what it would cost me locally for one. Excellent product. Thanks Amazon for this amazing site. Whenever I am thinking of purchasing something I always check with amazon.com first.</li>
            <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
            <li> I love using this products especially when I want my nails to dry quickly. One quick coat of this quick dry and my nails are dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for me. Probably one of my least favorite things from OPI that I&#x27;ve tried....and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of OPI stuff. One thing that really ruined this stuff for me is that it picsked up the polish color so bad. I don&#x27;t have that issue with most other top coats but if I&#x27;m going over a dark color I can see it staining the brush as I go, and I have to clean the brush when I&#x27;m done, which is a hassle especially since the finish is not that great. I would have to go over the top coat with a different one if I wanted really shiny nails.&lt;br /&gt;I dunno. I don&#x27;t hate it and I did end up using most of it....but I would suggest many many different quick dry top coats before this one.</li>
            <li> I love OPI products and use them exclusively but; this Rapid Dry Top Coat was a complete disappointment. Very thin and poor consistency. Cloudy and does not dry quickly, just runs past the nail onto the skin surrounding.  OPI, please note all the negative reviews and fix the formula.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product, just love to us it!  Hope these two last as long as the other did</li>
            <li> HAVE USED OPI QUICK DRY TOP COAT FOR  YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS. IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I always used a quick dry top coat on my manicures, in fact I won&#x27;t do a manicure without it.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with any OPI product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no shrinking that happens with this top coat! It&#x27;s a little on the thinner side as far as formula goes but it covers everything and makes it nice and glossy. It also takes a little longer than Seche Vite to dry, but still reasonably fast. The reason I recommend it over Seche Vite is due to the shrinking. With Seche, I have noticeable line at the tip of my nail. With this one, nothing. The polish stays all the way to the tips.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish but this was a huge disappointment. It made my nail polish chip off. I&#x27;ll stick with the Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat from the drugstore. Better and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Nice top coat and quick!</li>
            <li> Thought this was a nail polish top coat but instead a quick drying spray.  Besides the miscommunication it works great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all... Wasted money. As soon as you applied the top coat bubbles come as well in mayor quantity... Sorry but this is s***!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have and I use it with every manicure and pedicure I do. Very good investment.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it drys !&lt;br /&gt;It helps with the tough polishes that dont dry fast enough !&lt;br /&gt;Great product ! Will purchase again .</li>
            <li> I would recommed this product for any one who does their own nails.  It works really great. Drys quick and fast</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat and strong finish on top of regular nail polish! I love it!</li>
            <li> I chose this because a friend had it and suggested it.  It does what it says - drys very fast.</li>
            <li> wow  this works great  would buy again</li>
            <li> Best top coat that I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried many different ones. This one is very quick drying and very glossy. what I&#x27;ve noticed is that the quick dry top coats usually dont give you as much of a glossy look as normal top coats, but this one is very shiny! Love it!</li>
            <li> This polish is awesome! Apply it to your nails and let sit for 5 minutes..Your nails will be completely dry and hard as a rock. No more waiting for hours for your nails to dry. Everyone should buy this!</li>
            <li> its OPI- what else can I say? Always works great and lasts long!! Salon use it and the price it more affordable than any store around here.</li>
            <li> I use over all of my other nail polishes and the coat works well and does dry quickly! I swear by any OPI product!</li>
            <li> OPI is simply a great brand and this topcoat dries in less than 5 minutes. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to do their nails at the last minute and avoid smudging</li>
            <li> It works exactly as I had hoped it would!!!!  PERFECT!!!!!  Just what I wanted and needed.  Rapidry????  Instant dry!! and a great top coat!</li>
            <li> Dries out fast!!!!!@@@</li>
            <li> Love this top coat. I think it&#x27;s the best top coast opi makes!  Combined with the opi natural base coat your manicure will last a week, and that&#x27;s on natural nails!</li>
            <li> Not good for my nails.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it before, but if it is like any other OPI product it will be good. Everything I have used from this company has been.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a top coat but it is NOT quick drying.  If you don&#x27;t mind waiting, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This quick dry really does work.  It&#x27;s a necessity for the perfect finish.</li>
            <li> Great! This actually does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  It dried my nails quickly while providing an extra clear coat of polish.  I would recommend this polish to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it. it really does dry right away but idk if it really works to make the manicure last long.</li>
            <li> great product! as good as i thought! it make my nail polish lasts more than with any other usual top coat!</li>
            <li> First time I used this product.  It was really a good purchase.  It dried very quickly and my nails were nice and shiny for days.  Other quick dry top coats don&#x27;t stay shiny for long.</li>
            <li> Wife says that she loves this product because it does dry very quickly and that her paint job lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My nails perfectly dry in seconds! Simply the best I love this product by OPI. Can&#x27;t have a manicure without it!</li>
            <li> A must have for any nail polish lover. Covers well, drys very quickly and is a great product from OPI!</li>
            <li> I dont have a lot of time to wait for my nail polish to dry which is why I love this product. It dries the polish and leaves your nails shiny.</li>
