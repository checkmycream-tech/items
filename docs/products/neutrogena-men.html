            <li>I had heard good things about Neutrogena&#x27;s Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion, and the reviews on Amazon indicates that it is really good, but I&#x27;m throwing mine away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good too.</li>
            <li>It does a good job revitalizing razor burned skin and keeps off dryness all day.</li>
            <li>and it smells good as well.</li>
            <li>Love this soothing cream, feels great after a nice shave.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this lotion on my husband!  </li>
            <li>but I honestly think this product could compare well with anything out there.          </li>
            <li>I use the Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion, and literally every time I use it my wife tells my I smell nice.</li>
            <li>good price need a better description if i had any thing to say</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think after shaving for 15 years I&#x27;d have some kind of better grasp on the situation</li>
            <li>After a good shave this lotion keeps you comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this saving lotion, good feel</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent, provides a nice feel after a shave, and is definitely nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Ordering in this 4-pack from Amazon is easy and convenient and beats having to run out to the grocery store to get more!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and the smell is pleasant and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>very light film, not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion after I shave for many years.  </li>
            <li>I was really happy with the smoother outcome, but the razorburn was intense.  </li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>B003NSPOF2 Neutrogena Triple Protect Face Lotion for Men, SPF 20, 1.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], my face hasn&#x27;t looked better.</li>
            <li>It is cheap compared to some of the more boutique after shaves and I think it smells nice without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought in bulk since I don&#x27;t have a job now.  </li>
            <li>I have purchase many and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 3 years now, and it is the best thing next to an unaffordable Swiss alternative</li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena shave/post shave products more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>WHAT MORE COULD YOU</li>
            <li>I have used various after shave balm products and I think that this is the best one for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly more viscous than most others, which is great for me (but may not suit all skin types) as it really soothes my skin.</li>
            <li>...this sure doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me.  </li>
            <li>And so much better than those alcohol based after shave lotions.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feel on my face after I shave.</li>
            <li>I am pleased at the results I have with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe on the face</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I bought more than just one and plan to buy many more.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It seems that my shaves are even smoother, but that&#x27;s probably because my skin just feels better.</li>
            <li>I ordered more than I needed, and gave a couple of boxes to friends of mine.  </li>
            <li>, I just want to shave again, so I can put more on&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love it now since I use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is a very unique product that fits somewhere between a balm, a lotion and a toner.</li>
            <li>It is greasy, a sure sign of a cheap lotion, and has a smell.  </li>
            <li>Another great one I came across in my trials is a natural body wash made with tea tree</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter has loved this stuff and complimented me on how smooth and nice my face smells.  </li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>I love this product it feels just great and calming after my regular shave.</li>
            <li>I use this both before and after shaving and it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>It has a strong cologne scent that just does not make sense to me.</li>
            <li>so you get are get a strong cologne scent for 2-3 hours after applying it.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best lotion for use after a shave.</li>
            <li>Odor is strong and smells like cheap aftershave...</li>
            <li>I could easily see this package lasting a year making it a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So to buy it in a larger quantity is great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth a baby&#x27;s butt when I use this stuff after shaving.</li>
            <li>, this goes on smoothly AND soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li>This also contains witch hazel, a great alcohol-free astringent known for its irritation-soothing properties, especially when coupled with aloe.</li>
            <li>bought it primarily to moisturize my under-beard skin when my beard had grown out to 1/2&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I use a Norelco electric razor and have tried many different lotion and alcohol based after shaves, but this is superior to all.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells GREAT and makes my face feel tingly and smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell too, I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>Okay, first I am the wife of the man who wears this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still able to use the Neutrogena on top of it though so I can prevent doing more damage the next day.</li>
            <li>I am happy that Amazon was able to send me a few boxes!  </li>
            <li>They have a cool touch and quite soothing after a shave.</li>
            <li>With light, sensitive skin, this is hands down the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else \\&quot;cools\\&quot; my face as quickly as this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it...from a woman&#x27;s perspective :)</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, although the primary benefit is a clean feeling after application, with no greasy residue or itchy, dry results.    </li>
            <li>Normally a lot of aftershave products cause more burning sensation but this one, even though it&#x27;s scented, does not.</li>
            <li>It actually smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing my skin and preventing the harsh after affects of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I found myself shaving twice a week to avoid it, but even that was only kind of working.  </li>
            <li>usually spend 6x as much on an Aveda product with a more pleasant scent...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re applying it right under you nose</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the first time I applied it and have enjoyed it every since.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how long this lasts, too.  </li>
            <li>my husband is hesitant to try new products, but he seems to really enjoy this one.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and break-out easily with razor burn but since using this and/or</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel great, especially when using daily, even in the driest of climates.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and smooth after using this lotion.</li>
            <li>And it has a clean, fresh scent and not the overwhelming perfume odors of other products.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores and works great after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin prone to bumps, and this product keep my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>even though more is needed to properly moisturize my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pack of 4 on Amazon could easily last a year or more.</li>
            <li>but still this balm makes your face feel soft and comfortable after a shave.</li>
            <li>me, but that is exactly what it did.  </li>
            <li>It IS, however, a clean, crisp, masculine soap smell and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li>I have used many post-shaving lotions over the years, but this particular product has improved my skin condition more than any other product by far.  </li>
            <li>I would expect the after shave lotion did better job of killing germs and bacteria to prevent minor infections.    </li>
            <li>but you will certainly make a positive impression on those close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He says he can&#x27;t smell it after he puts it on, so it obviously doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell to it.  </li>
            <li>A LITTLE DAB MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN &amp; FRESH!!</li>
            <li>It is a little too effective to be a whole-face lotion</li>
            <li>Bottom line Anthony is a rip off and charges way too much for their name brand products.</li>
            <li>I really like this product from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does work very well for eliminating razor burn/bumps.</li>
            <li>but I have had my daughter and friends say how much they do NOT like the smell.</li>
            <li>It really helps, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>B009FT5QBU Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil]].</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s oil based it&#x27;s got a drying agent that helps heal existing wounds much faster than a lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>The package came on time and was not broken or damaged.  </li>
            <li>But found it to much like hand cream leaving my face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much a longer beard dries your skin out (enough to cause a very fine dandruff, apparently).  </li>
            <li>Frankly, other than the soothing fragrant and the refreshing feel, it didn&#x27;t protect my skin.  </li>
            <li>I must admit this stuff works really good not to mention it has many of the same ingredients as the expensive products like Anthony logistics.</li>
            <li>It has become nearly impossible to find it in stores, and I was very happy to find it on here at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena lotion has helped eliminate a decent amount of my post-shaving blemishes and burn.</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin after shaving, this works so welll!</li>
            <li>And, having a few on hand makes me feel I can dabb on a little extra, which I am sure is good protection for my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>had to return four tubes I had bought with high expectations.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re shaving challenged like me, I highly suggest trying both.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for this sort of use.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and not very greasy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the right product for me.</li>
            <li>The post shave cream is good, but feels less fresh and the effect of it did not seen to last for longer than few hours.</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments from more than a dozen girls in the last few months commenting specifically how much they like the smell.</li>
            <li>I also still have about a quarter of the first bottle left after 4 months.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time about half an hour ago, and right now I want to claw my neck off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Cleanser, Rainbath Refreshing Shower Gel, Pore Refining Skin Toner, but this defense post shave lotion simply did not live up to Neutrogena&#x27;s standard.</li>
            <li>Soothes the skin, completely takes away irritation.</li>
            <li>So far I have never had any problem nether with the delivery or with the contact of what I purchased</li>
            <li>Expected it to make me feel fresh even after 6 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 6 years ago, I stopped using shaving cream and went strictly to dry shaving (hot water).  </li>
            <li>I thought nothing of it really, it felt a bit dry</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way, so just one tube will last many months.  </li>
            <li>I use this lotion after shaving and as a general purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li>just started with the whole wet shaving thing (badger brush, shave bowl, safety razor, and shave soap)and</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this lotion to this who suffer from razor burn or just want to moisture during dry months.</li>
            <li>Who wants an aftershave that burns afterwards and makes you skin dry later</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of how much razor burn I get I&#x27;ve filtered through a lot of other products.</li>
            <li>I wet shave with an EJ DE89l and Israeli Super Platinums about every other day.</li>
            <li>First I tried upping the amount of the lotion I used, but that had only a slight delaying effect.</li>
            <li>It completely soothes the face from the razor and protects from dry skin throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He has coarse facial hair, and this lotion really helps cut down on razor burn after shaving.</li>

            <li> It is greasy, a sure sign of a cheap lotion, and has a smell.  </li>
            <li> Another great one I came across in my trials is a natural body wash made with tea tree</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has loved this stuff and complimented me on how smooth and nice my face smells.  </li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> I love this product it feels just great and calming after my regular shave.</li>
            <li> I use this both before and after shaving and it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> It has a strong cologne scent that just does not make sense to me.</li>
            <li> so you get are get a strong cologne scent for 2-3 hours after applying it.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lotion for use after a shave.</li>
            <li> Odor is strong and smells like cheap aftershave...</li>
            <li> I could easily see this package lasting a year making it a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So to buy it in a larger quantity is great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth a baby&#x27;s butt when I use this stuff after shaving.</li>
            <li> , this goes on smoothly AND soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li> This also contains witch hazel, a great alcohol-free astringent known for its irritation-soothing properties, especially when coupled with aloe.</li>
            <li> bought it primarily to moisturize my under-beard skin when my beard had grown out to 1/2&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I use a Norelco electric razor and have tried many different lotion and alcohol based after shaves, but this is superior to all.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells GREAT and makes my face feel tingly and smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell too, I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Okay, first I am the wife of the man who wears this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still able to use the Neutrogena on top of it though so I can prevent doing more damage the next day.</li>
            <li> I am happy that Amazon was able to send me a few boxes!  </li>
            <li> They have a cool touch and quite soothing after a shave.</li>
            <li> With light, sensitive skin, this is hands down the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else \\&quot;cools\\&quot; my face as quickly as this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it...from a woman&#x27;s perspective :)</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, although the primary benefit is a clean feeling after application, with no greasy residue or itchy, dry results.    </li>
            <li> Normally a lot of aftershave products cause more burning sensation but this one, even though it&#x27;s scented, does not.</li>
            <li> It actually smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of moisturizing my skin and preventing the harsh after affects of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I found myself shaving twice a week to avoid it, but even that was only kind of working.  </li>
            <li> usually spend 6x as much on an Aveda product with a more pleasant scent...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re applying it right under you nose</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the first time I applied it and have enjoyed it every since.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how long this lasts, too.  </li>
            <li> my husband is hesitant to try new products, but he seems to really enjoy this one.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and break-out easily with razor burn but since using this and/or</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great, especially when using daily, even in the driest of climates.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and smooth after using this lotion.</li>
            <li> And it has a clean, fresh scent and not the overwhelming perfume odors of other products.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores and works great after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin prone to bumps, and this product keep my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> even though more is needed to properly moisturize my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pack of 4 on Amazon could easily last a year or more.</li>
            <li> but still this balm makes your face feel soft and comfortable after a shave.</li>
            <li> me, but that is exactly what it did.  </li>
            <li> It IS, however, a clean, crisp, masculine soap smell and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I have used many post-shaving lotions over the years, but this particular product has improved my skin condition more than any other product by far.  </li>
            <li> I would expect the after shave lotion did better job of killing germs and bacteria to prevent minor infections.    </li>
            <li> but you will certainly make a positive impression on those close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He says he can&#x27;t smell it after he puts it on, so it obviously doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell to it.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE DAB MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN &amp; FRESH!!</li>
            <li> It is a little too effective to be a whole-face lotion</li>
            <li> Bottom line Anthony is a rip off and charges way too much for their name brand products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does work very well for eliminating razor burn/bumps.</li>
            <li> but I have had my daughter and friends say how much they do NOT like the smell.</li>
            <li> It really helps, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> B009FT5QBU Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil]].</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s oil based it&#x27;s got a drying agent that helps heal existing wounds much faster than a lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> The package came on time and was not broken or damaged.  </li>
            <li> But found it to much like hand cream leaving my face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much a longer beard dries your skin out (enough to cause a very fine dandruff, apparently).  </li>
            <li> Frankly, other than the soothing fragrant and the refreshing feel, it didn&#x27;t protect my skin.  </li>
            <li> I must admit this stuff works really good not to mention it has many of the same ingredients as the expensive products like Anthony logistics.</li>
            <li> It has become nearly impossible to find it in stores, and I was very happy to find it on here at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena lotion has helped eliminate a decent amount of my post-shaving blemishes and burn.</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin after shaving, this works so welll!</li>
            <li> And, having a few on hand makes me feel I can dabb on a little extra, which I am sure is good protection for my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> had to return four tubes I had bought with high expectations.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re shaving challenged like me, I highly suggest trying both.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for this sort of use.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and not very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the right product for me.</li>
            <li> The post shave cream is good, but feels less fresh and the effect of it did not seen to last for longer than few hours.</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments from more than a dozen girls in the last few months commenting specifically how much they like the smell.</li>
            <li> I also still have about a quarter of the first bottle left after 4 months.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time about half an hour ago, and right now I want to claw my neck off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Cleanser, Rainbath Refreshing Shower Gel, Pore Refining Skin Toner, but this defense post shave lotion simply did not live up to Neutrogena&#x27;s standard.</li>
            <li> Soothes the skin, completely takes away irritation.</li>
            <li> So far I have never had any problem nether with the delivery or with the contact of what I purchased</li>
            <li> Expected it to make me feel fresh even after 6 hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 6 years ago, I stopped using shaving cream and went strictly to dry shaving (hot water).  </li>
            <li> I thought nothing of it really, it felt a bit dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, so just one tube will last many months.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion after shaving and as a general purpose moisturizer.</li>
            <li> just started with the whole wet shaving thing (badger brush, shave bowl, safety razor, and shave soap)and</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this lotion to this who suffer from razor burn or just want to moisture during dry months.</li>
            <li> Who wants an aftershave that burns afterwards and makes you skin dry later</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of how much razor burn I get I&#x27;ve filtered through a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> I wet shave with an EJ DE89l and Israeli Super Platinums about every other day.</li>
            <li> First I tried upping the amount of the lotion I used, but that had only a slight delaying effect.</li>
            <li> It completely soothes the face from the razor and protects from dry skin throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He has coarse facial hair, and this lotion really helps cut down on razor burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lotion is high and it seems to work well in terms of keeping my skin moisturized, however, after a little while a pimple or two will pop up in the spots that I use the lotion on.</li>
            <li> I take a long time to upgrade (ain&#x27;t broke and all that), so last year I finally ditched my 2-razor shaver</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a coarse, quick-growing beard, so I&#x27;m used to a little bit of post-shave itchiness.  </li>
            <li> To this day, if I forget to use it (I shave in the shower, apply this stuff a couple minutes later), my face feels dry and poopy that day.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going back to a lotion that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> At the same time, I also started having very dry skin throughout the day on my face (nose, forehead area) that would bother me through the day.  </li>
            <li> I found the small cuts often developed into acne problem the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I know about this quality long time ago.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in most stores that usually caring it only have it sparactically.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it makes razor burn go away entirely, but it gets closer than any other product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> If I shaved every other day I would imagine it would last about 2-3 months per bottle</li>
            <li> I also find that I can get away with using a very minimal amount of lotion meaning this pack of 4 will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve always used \\&quot;Nivea For Men For Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> With other products, my neck in particular would have a slight rash and small red bumps after shaving.  </li>
            <li> and it does work as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had a few marks disappear from my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena shaving cream for a few years now, currently deployed</li>
            <li> It is very masculine, yet subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost four months now and shave on average of every 1.5 days.</li>
            <li> As time progressed, it got worse and worse, and the itching started earlier and earlier until finally, it would itch all day except the hour or two after taking a bath.  </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t care less what they call it.  </li>
            <li> a result, I apply less...</li>
            <li> After almost 2 months (winter months) use I am about half way through a bottle.</li>
            <li> California products or Jack Black.</li>
            <li> My face seems to be smoother and I have noticed less irritation.</li>
            <li> It has the shave-soothing properties of a balm and won&#x27;t leave your face feeling \\&quot;buttery\\&quot; like some lotions do, but it does have moisturizing properties to it and is thicker than typical balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly getting razor burn on my face due to poor technique.</li>
            <li> It has lasted me a few months now.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin with a very tough and fast-growing beard.  </li>
            <li> This deal is much less expensive than buying the same amount at the grocery store or connivence store.</li>
            <li> (I use a small amount of baby oil as well in the shower), it has been almost an addiction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past two months.</li>
            <li> Instead of using this lotion, now I use liquid bandage to prevent bacteria from getting into small cuts and stop them from bleeding.    </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ll try it again once or twice, but I&#x27;m not confident.</li>
            <li> items are small but since it&#x27;s four of them should take some time until finished.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in store.</li>
            <li> He has used this product at least 2 years and I order it in bulk to keep a supply</li>
            <li> For a guy who hates to shave, I can at least look forward to slapping this on my face at the end.</li>
            <li> I order for the availablity, but I am not happy about the price.</li>
            <li> Also weird - it comes out as a moisturizer-like consistency, not a liquid like after shaves.  </li>
            <li> Every time that I shave, I get all over my face those awful red marks, but since I started using this post shave lotion, I got nothing, I would recomend 100%</li>
            <li> I have the worst possible combination for razor burn:  </li>
            <li> I finish with a cold water rinse and this lotion and have no plans to change that.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, my skin began it itch like crazy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> But this is just downright painful</li>
            <li> This cream is a real disappointment.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best after shave lotion out there. I have very sensitive skin prone to bumps, and this product keep my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  It is difficult to find in most stores that usually caring it only have it sparactically. So to buy it in a larger quantity is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years now.  It is hard to find in stores and works great after shaving.  I order for the availablity, but I am not happy about the price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not too greasy or too oily.  This helps with razor burns after shaving and I even use it as a moisturizer on the days I don&#x27;t shave.  A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Okay, first I am the wife of the man who wears this lotion.  With that said, from a woman&#x27;s perspective, let me just say YUMMY!  I LOVE the smell of this lotion on my husband!  He says he can&#x27;t smell it after he puts it on, so it obviously doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell to it.  but when I hug him or kiss him I can definitely smell it and it smells oh so good!  Highly recommend it...from a woman&#x27;s perspective :)</li>
            <li> Good product and it does work as expected.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using for years......very sensitive skin after shaving, this works so welll!</li>
            <li> I must admit this stuff works really good not to mention it has many of the same ingredients as the expensive products like Anthony logistics. I compared Neutrogena razor defense post shave lotion a $5 purchase to Anthony logistics aftershave balm a $20 purchase. Both products are the same size 2.5 oz. The following ingredients are the same in both products.    -Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E),   -Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C),   -Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A),   -Allantoin   -Witch Hazel (Hamamelis Virginiana)   -Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Extract,     Bottom line Anthony is a rip off and charges way too much for their name brand products. You can buy four Neutrogena post shave lotions for the same price you would pay for one Anthony aftershave.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion after I shave for many years.  It does a great job of moisturizing my skin and preventing the harsh after affects of shaving.  It leaves my face smooth and the smell is pleasant and not too strong.  My 12 year old daughter has loved this stuff and complimented me on how smooth and nice my face smells.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This cream is a real disappointment.  It is greasy, a sure sign of a cheap lotion, and has a smell.  When will these producers learn that men like \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products?  I buy cologne when I want a scent...  I prefer L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s men&#x27;s Post shave lotion with #15 SPF.</li>
            <li> I take a long time to upgrade (ain&#x27;t broke and all that), so last year I finally ditched my 2-razor shaver an went with the newfangled 6-razor Gillette.  I was really happy with the smoother outcome, but the razorburn was intense.  I found myself shaving twice a week to avoid it, but even that was only kind of working.  I mentioned it to a friend who recommended this stuff because he had the same product.  It weirded me out that it doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;after shave\\&quot; anywhere, but it stopped the razorburn so I couldn&#x27;t care less what they call it.  To this day, if I forget to use it (I shave in the shower, apply this stuff a couple minutes later), my face feels dry and poopy that day.  Also weird - it comes out as a moisturizer-like consistency, not a liquid like after shaves.  But again, it works so whatever.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Like others, I find this product to be the best out there. Nothing else \\&quot;cools\\&quot; my face as quickly as this. I have sensitive skin and break-out easily with razor burn but since using this and/or [[ASIN:B003NSPOF2 Neutrogena Triple Protect Face Lotion for Men, SPF 20, 1.7 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], my face hasn&#x27;t looked better. It is cheap compared to some of the more boutique after shaves and I think it smells nice without being greasy. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger longer than 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great deal I&#x27;m glad I bought in bulk since I don&#x27;t have a job now.  It has lasted me a few months now.</li>
            <li> Excelent product!!! Every time that I shave, I get all over my face those awful red marks, but since I started using this post shave lotion, I got nothing, I would recomend 100%</li>
            <li> I really like this product from Neutrogena.  The lotion is light and not very greasy.  It soothes post-shave skin without clogging up pores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  From plush hotels to the sandstorms of Iraq/Kuwait, this product has come through for me perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 6 years ago, I stopped using shaving cream and went strictly to dry shaving (hot water).  At the same time, I also started having very dry skin throughout the day on my face (nose, forehead area) that would bother me through the day.  Once I started using this product (I use a small amount of baby oil as well in the shower), it has been almost an addiction.  It completely soothes the face from the razor and protects from dry skin throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product enthusiastically.</li>
            <li> I wet shave with an EJ DE89l and Israeli Super Platinums about every other day. I finish with a cold water rinse and this lotion and have no plans to change that.  You can spend a lot of money on shaving gear but I honestly think this product could compare well with anything out there.          Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve always used \\&quot;Nivea For Men For Sensitive Skin After Shave Extra Soothing Balm\\&quot; but it is too heavily scented for me to like it that much, even though it gets the job done. I had heard good things about Neutrogena&#x27;s Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion, and the reviews on Amazon indicates that it is really good, but I&#x27;m throwing mine away.  I&#x27;ve used this product for the past two months. After two weeks, my skin began it itch like crazy by the end of the day. I thought nothing of it really, it felt a bit dry but I wasn&#x27;t concerned. As time progressed, it got worse and worse, and the itching started earlier and earlier until finally, it would itch all day except the hour or two after taking a bath.  First I tried upping the amount of the lotion I used, but that had only a slight delaying effect. Then I tried exfoliating before shaving every day, something I hadn&#x27;t done it years. It had no effect. Finally I began using this product multiple times a day to try to stave off itchiness, but it&#x27;s not working. Finally, today I&#x27;ve had enough. I got into work this morning, and my face was itching, and when I scratched it, my skin peeled.  That&#x27;s it Neutrogena, I&#x27;m going back to a lotion that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soothing cream, feels great after a nice shave. I have purchase many and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work very well for eliminating razor burn/bumps. My skin looks smooth a baby&#x27;s butt when I use this stuff after shaving. It has a strong cologne scent that just does not make sense to me. You&#x27;re applying it right under you nose so you get are get a strong cologne scent for 2-3 hours after applying it. Please Neutrogena, stop with the cologne scent with all of your men&#x27;s car products!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells GREAT and makes my face feel tingly and smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li> highly recommended. one of the best after shaves you can use.&lt;br /&gt;no smell and it  is anti alergic. been using it for a couple of years</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great, especially when using daily, even in the driest of climates. I have been using this for 3 years now, and it is the best thing next to an unaffordable Swiss alternative</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena shave/post shave products more than 10 years. Work great. Soothes the skin, completely takes away irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after shave lotion for years and have found it to be the best combination of non-greasy and moisturizing of any of the brands I have tried.  Ordering in this 4-pack from Amazon is easy and convenient and beats having to run out to the grocery store to get more!</li>
            <li> I love it. I know about this quality long time ago. And at this price is very good. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Odor is strong and smells like cheap aftershave... I would prefer no odor to this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I apply less... even though more is needed to properly moisturize my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually spend 6x as much on an Aveda product with a more pleasant scent... looks like I&#x27;ll be switching back.</li>
            <li> Literally every time I shave I use the Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion, and literally every time I use it my wife tells my I smell nice. WHAT MORE COULD YOU POSSIBLY WANT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good too.</li>
            <li> With light, sensitive skin, this is hands down the best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use a Norelco electric razor and have tried many different lotion and alcohol based after shaves, but this is superior to all.  The smell is nice, although the primary benefit is a clean feeling after application, with no greasy residue or itchy, dry results.    With other products, my neck in particular would have a slight rash and small red bumps after shaving.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Razor Defense aftershave, my post-shave mornings have been a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have used various after shave balm products and I think that this is the best one for the price.  It is slightly more viscous than most others, which is great for me (but may not suit all skin types) as it really soothes my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only post shave lotion my husband uses and he swears it reduces his shave rash.  He has used this product at least 2 years and I order it in bulk to keep a supply</li>
            <li> I have the worst possible combination for razor burn:  sensitive skin with a very tough and fast-growing beard.  This lotion works like nothing else has for me.  I won&#x27;t say it makes razor burn go away entirely, but it gets closer than any other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how long this lasts, too.  A little goes a very long way, so just one tube will last many months.  The pack of 4 on Amazon could easily last a year or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a tube of the after shave lotion.  Frankly, other than the soothing fragrant and the refreshing feel, it didn&#x27;t protect my skin.  I found the small cuts often developed into acne problem the next morning.  I would expect the after shave lotion did better job of killing germs and bacteria to prevent minor infections.    Instead of using this lotion, now I use liquid bandage to prevent bacteria from getting into small cuts and stop them from bleeding.    There must be after shave lotions that do actually work.  Try something else, I&#x27;m a fan of Neutrogena&#x27;s products.  I&#x27;ve used their Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Cleanser, Rainbath Refreshing Shower Gel, Pore Refining Skin Toner, but this defense post shave lotion simply did not live up to Neutrogena&#x27;s standard.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent price!</li>
            <li> ...this sure doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me.  I used it for the first time about half an hour ago, and right now I want to claw my neck off.  I have sensitive skin and a coarse, quick-growing beard, so I&#x27;m used to a little bit of post-shave itchiness.  But this is just downright painful - I&#x27;ll try it again once or twice, but I&#x27;m not confident.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in store. We finally decided to check on Amazon! And yes we found a great deal and my husband loved it! I will continue to order this product</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost four months now and shave on average of every 1.5 days. No bumps when used with a merkur razor / feather blades and proraso shave soap. I have gotten compliments from more than a dozen girls in the last few months commenting specifically how much they like the smell. I also still have about a quarter of the first bottle left after 4 months. If I shaved every other day I would imagine it would last about 2-3 months per bottle</li>
            <li> I agree with others. The product works great.. but I have had my daughter and friends say how much they do NOT like the smell.</li>
            <li> All my purchases was always on time and to my expectation. So far I have never had any problem nether with the delivery or with the contact of what I purchased</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. He has coarse facial hair, and this lotion really helps cut down on razor burn after shaving. It has become nearly impossible to find it in stores, and I was very happy to find it on here at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> For a guy who hates to shave, I can at least look forward to slapping this on my face at the end. It really helps, and isn&#x27;t greasy. And so much better than those alcohol based after shave lotions.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion after shaving and as a general purpose moisturizer. It does a good job revitalizing razor burned skin and keeps off dryness all day. My skin is very soft and smooth after using this lotion. I also find that I can get away with using a very minimal amount of lotion meaning this pack of 4 will last me quite a while. After almost 2 months (winter months) use I am about half way through a bottle. I could easily see this package lasting a year making it a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this lotion is great. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I applied it and have enjoyed it every since.  It is very masculine, yet subtle and not overpowering. Everyone in the room won&#x27;t know you just walked in but you will certainly make a positive impression on those close to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this lotion to this who suffer from razor burn or just want to moisture during dry months.</li>
            <li> This is essential to every man&#x27;s bathroom cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all sorts of aftershave creams, balms, gels, and splashes; this is the only one that truly soothes my face and encourages rapid healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started with the whole wet shaving thing (badger brush, shave bowl, safety razor, and shave soap)and I don&#x27;t get facial irritation like I used to but still this balm makes your face feel soft and comfortable after a shave. Also, if you happen to nick yourself, this stuff doesn&#x27;t sting- it instead soothes and helps your cut disappear by the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now the scent. I LOVE the scent. It isn&#x27;t musky, it isn&#x27;t sporty, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering. It IS, however, a clean, crisp, masculine soap smell and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> my husband is hesitant to try new products, but he seems to really enjoy this one.  He only shaves once a week, but it religious about using this after each shave.  There is not a noticeable smell and it doesn&#x27;t give him acne.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent, provides a nice feel after a shave, and is definitely nice on the skin. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Who wants an aftershave that burns afterwards and makes you skin dry later on?&lt;br /&gt;Not me, but that is exactly what it did.  The glowing reviews are sorely misleading.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return four tubes I had bought with high expectations.  I recommend Baxter&lt;br /&gt;of California products or Jack Black.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel on my face after I shave. And, having a few on hand makes me feel I can dabb on a little extra, which I am sure is good protection for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am pleased at the results I have with this product.  My face seems to be smoother and I have noticed less irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly getting razor burn on my face due to poor technique. You&#x27;d think after shaving for 15 years I&#x27;d have some kind of better grasp on the situation but I just don&#x27;t. The Neutrogena lotion has helped eliminate a decent amount of my post-shaving blemishes and burn. Normally a lot of aftershave products cause more burning sensation but this one, even though it&#x27;s scented, does not. It actually smells pretty good as well. I sometimes don&#x27;t even put cologne on because I prefer the smell of the Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of how much razor burn I get I&#x27;ve filtered through a lot of other products. Another great one I came across in my trials is a natural body wash made with tea tree oil-[[ASIN:B009FT5QBU Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil]]. It&#x27;s safe on the face but since it&#x27;s oil based it&#x27;s got a drying agent that helps heal existing wounds much faster than a lotion or cream. It relieves the pain almost instantly and has my skin back to normal in about 5 hours on average. I&#x27;m still able to use the Neutrogena on top of it though so I can prevent doing more damage the next day. Great combination and if you&#x27;re shaving challenged like me, I highly suggest trying both.</li>
            <li> I love this product it feels just great and calming after my regular shave. It has a nice smell too, I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I have used many post-shaving lotions over the years, but this particular product has improved my skin condition more than any other product by far.  And it has a clean, fresh scent and not the overwhelming perfume odors of other products.  That&#x27;s why I bought more than just one and plan to buy many more.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lotion for use after a shave. Instantly cools irritated skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. The skin soaks it up very nice. After a good shave this lotion keeps you comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> great quality. very light film, not oily at all. tones, moistures and heals skin well.</li>
            <li> SUPER!!!!,  A LITTLE DAB MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN &amp; FRESH!!, THE BOSS ( WIFE ), LOVES IT, WHAT DO WE GUYS STRIVE FOR???  :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this saving lotion, good feel and it smells good as well. I use this both before and after shaving and it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> As stated above, this lotion gave me acne. The quality of the lotion is high and it seems to work well in terms of keeping my skin moisturized, however, after a little while a pimple or two will pop up in the spots that I use the lotion on.</li>
            <li> The post shave cream is good, but feels less fresh and the effect of it did not seen to last for longer than few hours. Expected it to make me feel fresh even after 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Yeah, for years I&#x27;ve used the alcohol based aftershave.  YOW!&lt;br /&gt;Now, this goes on smoothly AND soothes my skin.  I&#x27;ve actually had a few marks disappear from my face.  It seems that my shaves are even smoother, but that&#x27;s probably because my skin just feels better.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! I&#x27;ve been using this post-shave lotion for years.  Definitely the right product for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for several years.  They have a cool touch and quite soothing after a shave.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique product that fits somewhere between a balm, a lotion and a toner. It has the shave-soothing properties of a balm and won&#x27;t leave your face feeling \\&quot;buttery\\&quot; like some lotions do, but it does have moisturizing properties to it and is thicker than typical balms. This also contains witch hazel, a great alcohol-free astringent known for its irritation-soothing properties, especially when coupled with aloe. I use it every morning after an electric shave. Not bad!</li>
            <li> Will last for about 80-100 shaving....items are small but since it&#x27;s four of them should take some time until finished.</li>
            <li> did great showed up as advertised no problems good price need a better description if i had any thing to say</li>
            <li> This lotion is great at re-hydrating your face after shaving.  It is a little too effective to be a whole-face lotion (it makes it look like your face is so moist that you appear to be sweating), but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it primarily to moisturize my under-beard skin when my beard had grown out to 1/2&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34;.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much a longer beard dries your skin out (enough to cause a very fine dandruff, apparently).  This stuff did a great job at solving that problem.  Highly recommended for this sort of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena shaving cream for a few years now, currently deployed I did not bring enough with me.  I am happy that Amazon was able to send me a few boxes!  I ordered more than I needed, and gave a couple of boxes to friends of mine.  One was happy to quote &amp;#34;it feels so good, I just want to shave again, so I can put more on&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This deal is much less expensive than buying the same amount at the grocery store or connivence store. The package came on time and was not broken or damaged.  I am looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> I like it.  But found it to much like hand cream leaving my face feeling greasy.  I love it now since I use it in the shower.  I put it on my face and wash it last while showering.</li>
