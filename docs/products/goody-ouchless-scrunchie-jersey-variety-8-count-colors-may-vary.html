            <li>SCRUNCGIES AND GREAT COLORS</li>
            <li>but it does a great job of keeping your hair in place without pulling or breaking your hair.  </li>
            <li>These are great scrunchies:  </li>
            <li>Looked cute on all the girls at our totally awesome 80&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li>The trend has been towards bright colored T-shirts and sleeveless</li>
            <li>and I have always loved them.</li>
            <li>Excellent elasticity , great colors and fantastic fit</li>
            <li>My wife really liked all of the colors and the price was good for the number of scrunchies that you get.</li>
            <li>but cost is good and color variation is nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em, use &#x27;em almost every day, never a pulled hair!</li>
            <li>Great colors, very bold.</li>
            <li>Great quality and fit.</li>
            <li>10yo daughter makes her own ponytails with ease.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Glad the scrunchie has made a comeback; good price and shipping time; would buy again.</li>
            <li>She liked the colors a lot.</li>
            <li>These also are just the perfect size, and are very soft and interesting with the pattern of the fabric.</li>
            <li>The colors are so very mild and nice,  I will be ordering a lot more as I use them every day</li>
            <li>we love them</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call these &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34;, but they are better than rubber bands.</li>
            <li>you will love them.</li>
            <li>Many colors.</li>
            <li>I love the color assortment because it&#x27;s easy to find a scrunchie to go with almost any outfit.</li>
            <li>These little scrunchies are perfect.</li>
            <li>These are so comfortable to wear and they hold your hair in place so well.</li>
            <li>Since this came in the colors I was hoping they&#x27;d be, I ordered another set (I always lose one that shows up eventually and its so cheap to have backups of these colors).</li>
            <li>cheap &amp; small...not like the original scruncies</li>
            <li>just have to get over the whole 80&#x27;s prejudice!  :)</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Nice, bright colors, and great size--not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and most importantly, they do not snag my hair.</li>
            <li>Good variety of colors and should last quite a while.</li>
            <li>perfect size for thin hair</li>
            <li>Colorful and quality assortment of scrunchies for our 1980&#x27;s party.</li>
            <li>soft and cute just like the picture</li>
            <li>I like to wear it in a pony tail, so thought these would be good since I&#x27;ve used other Goody scrunchies.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this a couple days before Christmas for my girlfriend, and it came at just the right time the day before Christmas.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find bold colors much anymore.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and exactly as described</li>
            <li>The colors vary but are a little bright for my tastes.</li>
            <li>Goody and another manufacturer make Scrunchies that last more than a decade.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love these so much that I wonder how I made it o long without them.  </li>
            <li>, they work really well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Hey they hold your hair up very well.</li>
            <li>Straight hair, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Very stretchy and affordable price.</li>
            <li>Very excite.</li>
            <li>I wind until I am ready to knit.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the pink one!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, blond hair.</li>
            <li>and it kind of pulled at individual strands because the elastic was stretched close to its maximum.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for long hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that there should have been a nice bright red one instead of 2 navy blue.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and stretchy.</li>
            <li>They stay in place and are very soft.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought, but I like them very much.</li>
            <li>If you have more than a small amount of hair, they probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>They are by far the easiest to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li>I use them to gently hold the balls of yarn</li>
            <li>But if you have hair like I do (thin and fine)</li>
            <li>I can actually wrap them around my ponytail three times  and it is a gentle wrap versus a tight hold.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Holds thick, curly hair very well.  </li>
            <li> These are soft and thick enough that they don&#x27;t hurt your hair, but don&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;stuck in the 80&#x27;s&amp;#34; either.</li>

            <li> I would describe the material as a thick jersey t-shirt material.  </li>
            <li> Rubber bands are too harsh and damage expensive cashmere, merino and mohair fibers.</li>
            <li> None have broken, not have become faded or worn.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the quality of these scrunchies...</li>
            <li> I got sick of it which led me on the search for scrunchies.</li>

            <li> Arrived super fast and exactly as described</li>
            <li> These are so comfortable to wear and they hold your hair in place so well. Could wear to bed as well as during the day; great product!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the quality of these scrunchies... I just received different colors than shown?</li>
            <li> I have been using Scrunchie for decades. Goody and another manufacturer make Scrunchies that last more than a decade. I always want my hair pulled back when exercising. You can&#x27;t find bold colors much anymore. I have no idea why. The trend has been towards bright colored T-shirts and sleeveless (strap) tops. Since this came in the colors I was hoping they&#x27;d be, I ordered another set (I always lose one that shows up eventually and its so cheap to have backups of these colors).</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, Fast Delivery! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great bands that you just can&#x27;t find in the store anymore. Thank You!</li>

            <li> Colorful and quality assortment of scrunchies for our 1980&#x27;s party.</li>
            <li> Very soft and stretchy. Great colors, very bold. Looked cute on all the girls at our totally awesome 80&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li> They are scrunchies they do there job and work.  The colors vary but are a little bright for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Used these for an 80&#x27;s party</li>
            <li> These are perfect. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I love these so much that I wonder how I made it o long without them.  The colors are so very mild and nice,  I will be ordering a lot more as I use them every day</li>

            <li> Excellent elasticity , great colors and fantastic fit</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple days before Christmas for my girlfriend, and it came at just the right time the day before Christmas. They are all she ever uses and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I like these, they work really well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Hey they hold your hair up very well. I have had these type forever and I have always loved them.</li>
            <li> Holds thick, curly hair very well.  Straight hair, not so much.  Scrunchie slides off gradually in a short time.  Definitely ouchless though. 10yo daughter makes her own ponytails with ease.</li>
            <li> All have held up well with a lot of use. Good variety of colors and should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call these &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34;, but they are better than rubber bands. My hair is very, very thick, very fine, and half way down my back. I like to wear it in a pony tail, so thought these would be good since I&#x27;ve used other Goody scrunchies.  These are smoother than the ones I had, but they do get tangled in my hair, so I&#x27;m still cleaning up after the human Afghan Hound in the house - me!  I love the color assortment because it&#x27;s easy to find a scrunchie to go with almost any outfit.</li>
            <li> cheap &amp; small...not like the original scruncies</li>
            <li> Great quality and fit. Fabulous for long hair.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked all of the colors and the price was good for the number of scrunchies that you get.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Glad the scrunchie has made a comeback; good price and shipping time; would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are the only hair ties that do not get tangled in my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  They are by far the easiest to put in and take out.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Very stretchy and affordable price. My favorite is the pink one! Wear it all the time now that 90&#x27;s stuff is coming back!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife who loves the less sturdy ones to use up around the house.  Have not used them yet but cost is good and color variation is nice.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser advised me to get these to prevent hair breakage.  I was not wanting to revisit the 80&#x27;s but it does a great job of keeping your hair in place without pulling or breaking your hair.  Does what it was designed to do. . . just have to get over the whole 80&#x27;s prejudice!  :)</li>
            <li> My wife bought these.  She has thick hair and she had to work hard for the second wrap around on her pony tail and it kind of pulled at individual strands because the elastic was stretched close to its maximum.  She has used others brand \\&quot;scrunchies\\&quot; without this problem. She didn&#x27;t see anything indicating size for this product, but I guess they do not all come in the same size.  She liked the colors a lot.</li>
            <li> soft and cute just like the picture</li>
            <li> These are great scrunchies:  Nice, bright colors, and great size--not too big, not too small.  My only complaint is that there should have been a nice bright red one instead of 2 navy blue.  Maybe two!  Otherwise, perfect.</li>
            <li> These also are just the perfect size, and are very soft and interesting with the pattern of the fabric. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend and she uses them everyday! None have broken, not have become faded or worn. Great fabric, great product! If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy! We are both happy!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, blond hair. The &amp;#34;no-snag&amp;#34; elastics I&#x27;ve been using for my daily ponytail cause breakage and rip my hair out. I got sick of it which led me on the search for scrunchies. These little scrunchies are perfect. They are small and inconspicuous.  I can actually wrap them around my ponytail three times  and it is a gentle wrap versus a tight hold. They stay in place and are very soft. I can sleep with one in my hair as well. I would describe the material as a thick jersey t-shirt material.  If you have more than a small amount of hair, they probably won&#x27;t work for you. But if you have hair like I do (thin and fine) you will love them.</li>
            <li> Many colors. Very excite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for hair.  I use them to gently hold the balls of yarn I wind until I am ready to knit.  Rubber bands are too harsh and damage expensive cashmere, merino and mohair fibers.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, but I like them very much.</li>
            <li> These are soft and thick enough that they don&#x27;t hurt your hair, but don&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;stuck in the 80&#x27;s&amp;#34; either. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s gentile enough to keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and most importantly, they do not snag my hair.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em, use &#x27;em almost every day, never a pulled hair!</li>
