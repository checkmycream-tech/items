            <li>We appreciate being able to buy them online now!</li>
            <li>Bobby pins; this is the kind of hairpin I have always used, when I use any.  </li>
            <li>so i was thrilled to get them.</li>
            <li>They are a pewtery silver which is ok for some parts of my hair.</li>
            <li>Silver pins just blend better.  </li>
            <li>Mom felt that these were cheaply made since they are straight on the bottom, and not curved to lay comfortably against your scalp.  </li>
            <li>These are very hard to find at the local stores, so it was nice be able to get these as an add on for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>they are a  neutral color of silvery gray that would be fine in gray, white, and in-bewteen colors.</li>
            <li>They are fine from a functional standpoint, but they are very dark gray, not the light gray as pictured.</li>
            <li>I really like the color.</li>
            <li>And they work very well.</li>
            <li>I am on a quest for light gray or silver bobby pins, and these are definitely not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>they hold very well.</li>
            <li>They pretty nearly match mom&#x27;s hair color.  </li>
            <li>Even though I have grey hair, I still like to do fun hairstyles that need bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>I wanted some bobby pins that worked / blended a little better with blond hair than the traditional brown ones.</li>
            <li>I took a chance that these might really be like those I found locally that truly are silver.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m old and gray now, these gray ones will serve well.</li>
            <li>They were never easy to find locally, but have gotten even more challenging of late.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t find grey ones in the stores where i live at</li>
            <li>Bought them for my 75 year old grey haired mom.  </li>
            <li>OMG My life is now complete that I have found grey  hair pins!</li>

            <li> OMG My life is now complete that I have found grey  hair pins!</li>
            <li> My mother loves using bobby pins, but since her hair has gone almost entirely silver/grey she prefers using grey or silver bobby pins.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, grey Bobbie pins for my grey hair.</li>
            <li> I was almost giving up on finding grey hair accessories, but you had them.  </li>
            <li> These are invisible in grey hair!</li>
            <li> Not worth the postage to return them.</li>
            <li> I now no longer look like I have black streaks in my hair from wearing the other bobby pins!</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t seem to find locally anymore.</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are a very ugly medium gray color that doesn&#x27;t blend very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find silver bobby pins.</li>

            <li> Perfect for my costume. They are a steely gray, btw.</li>
            <li> I took a chance that these might really be like those I found locally that truly are silver. They are a pewtery silver which is ok for some parts of my hair. Silver pins just blend better.  Too bad I can&#x27;t seem to find locally anymore.</li>
            <li> These are just bobby pins.  They hold the hair in place.  They pretty nearly match mom&#x27;s hair color.  She likes them.  &#x27;Nuf said.</li>

            <li> Very happy to find grey/silver bobby pins for my greay hair.  Now no one can tell that I&#x27;m pinned up.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother who has white, white hair.  These bobby pins are a very ugly medium gray color that doesn&#x27;t blend very well at all.  Mom felt that these were cheaply made since they are straight on the bottom, and not curved to lay comfortably against your scalp.  Not worth the postage to return them.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, grey Bobbie pins for my grey hair.</li>

            <li> Not good quality. Very flimsy. You want a Bobby pin that&#x27;s gonna hold. These do not. I would not recommend buying these ones.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find silver Bobbi pins , and I looked!  Having turned gray, and loving it, these pins are wonderful !</li>
