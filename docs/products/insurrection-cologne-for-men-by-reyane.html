            <li>It is one of the most sensual colognes for men on the market.</li>
            <li>The scent of this cologne is interestingly spicy with notes of cinnamon, but also warm and sweet smelling as well.  </li>
            <li>I received it in good condition and it was exactly what i was looking for...</li>

            <li>Smell so fresh and soft very good perfume, price compare @</li>
            <li>still want to be cautious in the amount of Insurrection you put on, but they make it easy for you with a convenient spray.  </li>
            <li>It started out strong and I thought I was going to regret it immediately.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, its sweet, light, and clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet smell which I like a lot better than the powdery/perfumey ones.  </li>
            <li>Best ever hands down. ...</li>
            <li>It has great longevity and moderate projection but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I want the original quality to be sustained.</li>
            <li>so you will smell unique.</li>
            <li>Unique scent but not for me.</li>
            <li>While this wasn&#x27;t exactly a \\&quot;great\\&quot; deal, it most certainly introduced me to what has now become my favorite cologne of all time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a sweet manly smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Insurrection is sweet, no doubt about that.</li>
            <li>very good cologne i will buy again in the near future</li>
            <li>Quick service and delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle which is great for my allergies and it still is able to catch the attention of the ladies.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and it last all day long in the body and a lot of more time in clothes</li>
            <li>Awesome and last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this fragrance delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>Insurrection has my vote for all-time favorite men&#x27;s cologne, and for a stubborn old set-in-his-ways goat like me, that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I know that I&#x27;m not crazy.  </li>
            <li>, a men&#x27;s cologne.\\&quot; Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as is a sweet aromatic scent of sweet fruits, intense vanilla, amber and woody notes</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>This is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments wearing this cologne, especially from my wife who chose it for me originally.</li>
            <li>Think of sweet young guy meets sophisticated older gentleman.</li>
            <li>i love the scent very sexy and last long like me</li>
            <li>I used to love it; but after a few months it was just okay</li>
            <li>Nice perfume which last for that price really.</li>
            <li>who knows, maybe they&#x27;ll be spraying the last of the bottle at my very own funeral one day (okay, okay, that was bad... give a guy a break :)</li>
            <li>I use Insurrection with Curve, and the smell is unbearably intoxicating (in my case, for the first hour or so).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what this fragrance stands for.</li>
            <li>I am not kidding it happened to me the day I wore this cologne for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is also similar to Cuba Paris Prestige cologne but with more longevity.</li>
            <li>My wife first bought this for me about two years ago as a gift.</li>
            <li>First saw and smelled this at a kiosk at a mall.</li>
            <li>I am interested in its ingredients.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy --and frequently adorn myself with-- the tangy-sweet citrus aroma of Obsession and the Oceanic breeze of Reaction, my new Alltime Favorite is the candy-like but brilliantly wild and rebellious fragrance of Insurrection.</li>
            <li>its in between smells old sometimes smells good and its making my nose so dry</li>
            <li>But the appeal to Insurrection is the pleasant, but not overwhelming smell.  </li>
            <li>In 2004, I discovered the sweet aroma of Insurrection at one of those local merchant events that you pay a few bucks to get inside for some great deals.  </li>
            <li>Has a classy and unique smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product, about ten years ago when I was in high school</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>It is also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely LOVES this cologne and I get complimented on it often.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Went straight to the trash...lesson learned about buying cologne online.</li>
            <li>Being a fragrance lover (or addict, take your pick), I&#x27;ll purchase at times based off reviews I read, or the fact that a fragrance contains similar, yet also different notes from fragrances I already own and like.  </li>
            <li>If you want a truly unmistakable and unique cologne, look no further.  </li>
            <li>and you are good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seriously like bottled unicorn tears.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing smelling cologne for a unbelievable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually you can get it for half that of better on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that there are too many varieties and marketers now and as such, adulteration has crept into this product I suppose.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is the real thing or an irregular blend of the top quality seller.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a common smell</li>
            <li>WILL BE WEARING THIS WHEN I&#x27;M AN OLD MAN!</li>
            <li>the price is excellent, you not going to be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I was getting rave reviews when I first purchased this cologne from the mall last year.</li>
            <li>Insurrection, in other words is true revolution in the hall of perfumes.  </li>
            <li>mom wore when I was like 8 years old</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t completely disagree.  </li>
            <li>They will not however discount the colognes on the second and bottom shelves too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve counted myself as an die-hard Obsession Man, a fellow who, upon receiving any other \\&quot;masculine fragrance\\&quot; in his Christmas stocking, would smile graciously, thank the gift-giver, and then promptly deliver the bottle to the nearest Salvation Army donation bin.  </li>
            <li>It is subtle and not overpowering as most men&#x27;s colognes tend to be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell other that \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; but it is certainly not crisp or refreshing or anything like that</li>
            <li>A sweet scent smells a little feminine to me</li>
            <li>I used to wear it back in High School.</li>
            <li>Is very similar to one million but much better dry down.</li>
            <li>it is a very weak Cologne I have buy it in the past from different outlets and it was perfect</li>
            <li>Insurrection is a sweet cologne and a few users have complained that it&#x27;s so sweet, it may be considered feminine.</li>
            <li>It starts out mildly vanillic-sweet, then is supposed to dry down to \\&quot;woods\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Mature smell but not old.</li>
            <li>So usually a pretty young female tells you she can discount it up to 35% usually costing you about $40 after the discount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but rather a dull sweet smell that simply doesn&#x27;t seem to align with what a man should smell like.      </li>
            <li>COMPARED TO OTHER HIGH PRICED SCENTS.</li>
            <li>Dangerous for a married man but safe for a single one!</li>
            <li>Good and bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> very good cologne i will buy again in the near future</li>
            <li> Quick service and delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle which is great for my allergies and it still is able to catch the attention of the ladies.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it last all day long in the body and a lot of more time in clothes</li>
            <li> Awesome and last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> Insurrection has my vote for all-time favorite men&#x27;s cologne, and for a stubborn old set-in-his-ways goat like me, that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I know that I&#x27;m not crazy.  </li>
            <li> , a men&#x27;s cologne.\\&quot; Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as is a sweet aromatic scent of sweet fruits, intense vanilla, amber and woody notes</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> This is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments wearing this cologne, especially from my wife who chose it for me originally.</li>
            <li> Think of sweet young guy meets sophisticated older gentleman.</li>
            <li> i love the scent very sexy and last long like me</li>
            <li> I used to love it; but after a few months it was just okay</li>
            <li> Nice perfume which last for that price really.</li>
            <li> who knows, maybe they&#x27;ll be spraying the last of the bottle at my very own funeral one day (okay, okay, that was bad... give a guy a break :)</li>
            <li> I use Insurrection with Curve, and the smell is unbearably intoxicating (in my case, for the first hour or so).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what this fragrance stands for.</li>
            <li> I am not kidding it happened to me the day I wore this cologne for the first time.</li>
            <li> It is also similar to Cuba Paris Prestige cologne but with more longevity.</li>
            <li> My wife first bought this for me about two years ago as a gift.</li>
            <li> First saw and smelled this at a kiosk at a mall.</li>
            <li> I am interested in its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy --and frequently adorn myself with-- the tangy-sweet citrus aroma of Obsession and the Oceanic breeze of Reaction, my new Alltime Favorite is the candy-like but brilliantly wild and rebellious fragrance of Insurrection.</li>
            <li> its in between smells old sometimes smells good and its making my nose so dry</li>
            <li> But the appeal to Insurrection is the pleasant, but not overwhelming smell.  </li>
            <li> In 2004, I discovered the sweet aroma of Insurrection at one of those local merchant events that you pay a few bucks to get inside for some great deals.  </li>
            <li> Has a classy and unique smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product, about ten years ago when I was in high school</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> It is also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely LOVES this cologne and I get complimented on it often.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Went straight to the trash...lesson learned about buying cologne online.</li>
            <li> Being a fragrance lover (or addict, take your pick), I&#x27;ll purchase at times based off reviews I read, or the fact that a fragrance contains similar, yet also different notes from fragrances I already own and like.  </li>
            <li> If you want a truly unmistakable and unique cologne, look no further.  </li>
            <li> and you are good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seriously like bottled unicorn tears.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing smelling cologne for a unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually you can get it for half that of better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that there are too many varieties and marketers now and as such, adulteration has crept into this product I suppose.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the real thing or an irregular blend of the top quality seller.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a common smell</li>
            <li> WILL BE WEARING THIS WHEN I&#x27;M AN OLD MAN!</li>
            <li> the price is excellent, you not going to be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was getting rave reviews when I first purchased this cologne from the mall last year.</li>
            <li> Insurrection, in other words is true revolution in the hall of perfumes.  </li>
            <li> mom wore when I was like 8 years old</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t completely disagree.  </li>
            <li> They will not however discount the colognes on the second and bottom shelves too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve counted myself as an die-hard Obsession Man, a fellow who, upon receiving any other \\&quot;masculine fragrance\\&quot; in his Christmas stocking, would smile graciously, thank the gift-giver, and then promptly deliver the bottle to the nearest Salvation Army donation bin.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle and not overpowering as most men&#x27;s colognes tend to be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell other that \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; but it is certainly not crisp or refreshing or anything like that</li>
            <li> A sweet scent smells a little feminine to me</li>
            <li> I used to wear it back in High School.</li>
            <li> Is very similar to one million but much better dry down.</li>
            <li> it is a very weak Cologne I have buy it in the past from different outlets and it was perfect</li>
            <li> Insurrection is a sweet cologne and a few users have complained that it&#x27;s so sweet, it may be considered feminine.</li>
            <li> It starts out mildly vanillic-sweet, then is supposed to dry down to \\&quot;woods\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Mature smell but not old.</li>
            <li> So usually a pretty young female tells you she can discount it up to 35% usually costing you about $40 after the discount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but rather a dull sweet smell that simply doesn&#x27;t seem to align with what a man should smell like.      </li>
            <li> COMPARED TO OTHER HIGH PRICED SCENTS.</li>
            <li> Dangerous for a married man but safe for a single one!</li>
            <li> Good and bad</li>
            <li> Exotically romantic, a charmer of sort because of its long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> the Cologne do not last long when you spray it on it only stays for minutes</li>
            <li> Usually about 3%  is as much as they will go on say Polo or Boss.</li>
            <li> Awsome smell, last long</li>
            <li> And it last a long time.</li>
            <li> The drydown is definitely odd and immediately reminded me of a vanillic (kinda old lady like) feminine scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will keep buying Insurrection as long as they keep making it.  </li>
            <li> fragrance lasts long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It been really long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it takeing so long</li>
            <li> I inadvertently bought one - the single bottle (NOT FROM AMAZON)</li>
            <li> I must  note that as an ardent user of this perfume, there is a slight reduction in its present quality in view of what I know of it over the long years</li>
            <li> It is certainly not something that I would like to smell like, and I haven&#x27;t received a single compliment on it</li>
            <li> I got this because it has received such positive reviews, but I fail to see why.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different and &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; smelling, but I always get tons of compliments from the ladies and from my woman when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the attention that I expected based on the reviews</li>
            <li> This is a subtle, masculine scent.</li>
            <li> That is not exactly the sort of compliment that I was hoping for with a cologne.      </li>
            <li> Mix Insurrection with your other favorites to create intoxicating combinations.</li>
            <li> compared to my other colognes.</li>
            <li> Definitely smells like a very expensive cologne even though very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later he told me a story about a woman standing behind him at the grocery store line making obvious sniffing sounds.  </li>
            <li> Using this method, I generally like roughly 4/5 fragrances I blind buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I do not think you will be dissapointed if you are debating on purchasing this little gem.</li>
            <li> Something is missing.</li>
            <li> There are few men&#x27;s colognes I like.  </li>
            <li> Trust me you will not go unnoticed.</li>
            <li> The scent was not remotely accurate, either.  </li>
            <li> Frankly 1 star is being liberal, it deserves 1/2 star, found the design very uncomfortable to use and moreover the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long, will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance blind (a big 3.4 oz.)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, who usually spends close to $60 for it.</li>
            <li> I have used Insurrection for almost 10 years now, it still smells the same, still got that nostalgic smell.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing).  </li>
            <li> And Im not good at desribing scents, so cant help u there.</li>
            <li> It has some of the same vanilla base notes of Pi(another one of my favorites on men) and the scent lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It is what it is, and being somebody who appreciates fragrances, I give the benefit of the doubt instead of saying a fragrance is worthless or not worth wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I never do it for fragrances costing anything over the $20 limit... as to not feel as guilty if it doesn&#x27;t work out...</li>
            <li> while making a weird face.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thinking about what attire or event I would wear it would be a casual dinner with the wife or a luncheon  or even a day trip to the mall.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of blind buying...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price too!</li>
            <li> mad a payment for it</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a bad sign.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, that sounds reeeaaaallly, really bad, I know.  </li>
            <li> Too bad can&#x27;t hide my wedding ring.</li>
            <li> I recieved it as a gift; I thought I was going to hate it.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE purchase!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son love this and I must admit it does smell terrific!  Nicely priced too.</li>
            <li> I do not like at all.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance blind (a big 3.4 oz.) off Amazon for about $20 bucks.  I have a bad habit of blind buying... haha... but I never do it for fragrances costing anything over the $20 limit... as to not feel as guilty if it doesn&#x27;t work out... lol.  Being a fragrance lover (or addict, take your pick), I&#x27;ll purchase at times based off reviews I read, or the fact that a fragrance contains similar, yet also different notes from fragrances I already own and like.  Using this method, I generally like roughly 4/5 fragrances I blind buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, I feel I can layer this fragrance with others to achieve acceptable results, but on it&#x27;s own merit, I don&#x27;t quite \\&quot;feel\\&quot; this fragrance.  And that&#x27;s a bad sign.  It starts out mildly vanillic-sweet, then is supposed to dry down to \\&quot;woods\\&quot;.  The drydown is definitely odd and immediately reminded me of a vanillic (kinda old lady like) feminine scent my friends mom wore when I was like 8 years old (I&#x27;m 32 now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another fragrance review forum, someone who didn&#x27;t like this fragrance likened it to something you would wear at a funeral or when you walked into a funeral home.  Indeed, that sounds reeeaaaallly, really bad, I know.  However, I can&#x27;t completely disagree.  I would counter that it&#x27;s a scent to wear to church, which I did recently when my nephew had his baptism.  By no means do I feel this is a \\&quot;night out\\&quot; or \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; vanilla-woods scent.  It is what it is, and being somebody who appreciates fragrances, I give the benefit of the doubt instead of saying a fragrance is worthless or not worth wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually going to keep this fragrance in my wardrobe to wear to any church-related function.  The truth is I will probably never run out of this cologne... who knows, maybe they&#x27;ll be spraying the last of the bottle at my very own funeral one day (okay, okay, that was bad... give a guy a break :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the attention that I expected based on the reviews but it is a good smell.</li>
            <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said before?  Insurrection has my vote for all-time favorite men&#x27;s cologne, and for a stubborn old set-in-his-ways goat like me, that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve counted myself as an die-hard Obsession Man, a fellow who, upon receiving any other \\&quot;masculine fragrance\\&quot; in his Christmas stocking, would smile graciously, thank the gift-giver, and then promptly deliver the bottle to the nearest Salvation Army donation bin.  Then along came Insurrection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I still enjoy --and frequently adorn myself with-- the tangy-sweet citrus aroma of Obsession and the Oceanic breeze of Reaction, my new Alltime Favorite is the candy-like but brilliantly wild and rebellious fragrance of Insurrection.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend last year.  A few weeks later he told me a story about a woman standing behind him at the grocery store line making obvious sniffing sounds.  He turned around and she asked \\&quot;I must know what you are wearing so I can buy it for my husband\\&quot; and he told her Insurrection.  I don&#x27;t know why this scent isn&#x27;t more popular.  It has some of the same vanilla base notes of Pi(another one of my favorites on men) and the scent lasts all day.  It is also reasonably priced. I do not think you will be dissapointed if you are debating on purchasing this little gem.</li>
            <li> I got this because it has received such positive reviews, but I fail to see why.  It has a feminine \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell, but it doesn&#x27;t even smell that good.  It is certainly not something that I would like to smell like, and I haven&#x27;t received a single compliment on it so I know that I&#x27;m not crazy.  One of my friends even said \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell\\&quot;  while making a weird face.  That is not exactly the sort of compliment that I was hoping for with a cologne.      I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell other that \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; but it is certainly not crisp or refreshing or anything like that but rather a dull sweet smell that simply doesn&#x27;t seem to align with what a man should smell like.      I would look elsewhere</li>
            <li> After catching this fragrance on a stranger at a bar, I asked him what he was wearing and he told me \\&quot;Insurrection.\\&quot; After a search on the internet I was able to find and purchase it for my husband. I was not disappointed as it has become his favorite fragrance and mine! It is subtle and not overpowering as most men&#x27;s colognes tend to be. And, at this price, it is a great buy as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I get compliments in the scent.</li>
            <li> Insurrection is a sweet cologne and a few users have complained that it&#x27;s so sweet, it may be considered feminine. Mix Insurrection with your other favorites to create intoxicating combinations. I use Insurrection with Curve, and the smell is unbearably intoxicating (in my case, for the first hour or so). Consider this a &amp;#34;foundation cologne&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best fragrance out for any gentlemen. Is very similar to one million but much better dry down. It&#x27;s a very good fragrance for any season.. I only had for one day and I will tell you is already top my list of over 50 colognes. Think of sweet young guy meets sophisticated older gentleman. That&#x27;s exactly what this fragrance stands for.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the real thing or an irregular blend of the top quality seller. Something is missing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, who usually spends close to $60 for it. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere until I came across it on here. The price was great, the bottle is big, and it smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> Awsome smell, last long</li>
            <li> Girls will talk to you not because you are handsome but you smell insanely good. I am not kidding it happened to me the day I wore this cologne for the first time. Since that day everyone is asking me (mostly girls) what are you wearing. Too bad can&#x27;t hide my wedding ring.</li>
            <li> I am a woman who loves wearing men&#x27;s cologne. I receive TONS of compliments when wearing this. My coworkers love it, men love it, it is hilarious. I have truly been stopped on the street, on the bus and on the train by men and women asking \\&quot;What perfume are you wearing?\\&quot; I love the reaction that they have on their face when I tell them \\&quot;Insurrection, a men&#x27;s cologne.\\&quot; Worth it for the price. I will always have a bottle nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, let me add that the scent lasts throughout the day. Say, I put it on at 730am, it fades away about 6 pm.</li>
            <li> Has a sweet manly smell. Ladies will love it and be all over you lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I really liked my purchase and the timely shipping. I received it in good condition and it was exactly what i was looking for...</li>
            <li> I have used Insurrection for almost 10 years now, it still smells the same, still got that nostalgic smell. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price too!</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FAVORITE COLOGNES OF ALL TIMES! EVERY TIME I WEAR THIS! I GET ASKED THE ALMIGHTY QUESTION, &amp;#34;UMMMM...WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?&amp;#34; AND MY REPLY IS ALWAYS &amp;#34;I JUST GOT OUT THE SHOWER BABY!&amp;#34; LOL LOVE THIS SMELL! WILL BE WEARING THIS WHEN I&#x27;M AN OLD MAN!</li>
            <li> I love Insurrection. I buy it for my husband all the time. He gets so many compliments about it....and it&#x27;s not a common smell so he is always being asked about it.</li>
            <li> In 2004, I discovered the sweet aroma of Insurrection at one of those local merchant events that you pay a few bucks to get inside for some great deals.  While this wasn&#x27;t exactly a \\&quot;great\\&quot; deal, it most certainly introduced me to what has now become my favorite cologne of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all and especially like fragrances such as Obsession.  But the appeal to Insurrection is the pleasant, but not overwhelming smell.  It&#x27;s a sweet smell which I like a lot better than the powdery/perfumey ones.  Blech!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still want to be cautious in the amount of Insurrection you put on, but they make it easy for you with a convenient spray.  About 2-3 pumps is all it takes and my wife goes bonkers over it, too!  WOO HOO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying Insurrection as long as they keep making it.  I cannot recommend this cologne highly enough to you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I used to wear it back in High School. The ladies love it. I&#x27;d encourage you to buy! Great gift for the hubby or your boyfriend!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling cologne. I used to love it; but after a few months it was just okay compared to my other colognes. If I could I would give it 4.5 stars. And Im not good at desribing scents, so cant help u there. But its not overpowering, but if u put enough on it can stay on you and last (which I personally) and not smell like your overdoing it.</li>
            <li> Best ever hands down. ...</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it last all day long in the body and a lot of more time in clothes</li>
            <li> Insurrection, in other words is true revolution in the hall of perfumes.  This is a cologne that I have used for over fifteen years to this day. It is so alluring, pleasant and makes a strong statement on your personality and presence at any occasion you wear it to. Exotically romantic, a charmer of sort because of its long lasting fragrance. My only regret is that there are too many varieties and marketers now and as such, adulteration has crept into this product I suppose.  I inadvertently bought one - the single bottle (NOT FROM AMAZON) last month (April 2015)  that turned out to be Insurrection in name but not in quality and fragrance. You may recall I just bought two packs of the Gift cologne set which I found okay. I must  note that as an ardent user of this perfume, there is a slight reduction in its present quality in view of what I know of it over the long years I have used it to date. I want the original quality to be sustained.</li>
            <li> Worked great fix my problem</li>
            <li> If you want a truly unmistakable and unique cologne, look no further.  I switched to Insurrection about four years ago and I doubt if I will ever replace it.  The scent of this cologne is interestingly spicy with notes of cinnamon, but also warm and sweet smelling as well.  My girlfriend absolutely LOVES this cologne and I get complimented on it often.  About 2-3 pumps of this stuff and you are good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seriously like bottled unicorn tears.  Tears of joy that is.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years...very happy with price and shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a subtle, masculine scent. Definitely smells like a very expensive cologne even though very inexpensive. For the price and the class and longevity, I would almost give this a 5 star but I save 5 stars for 100% satisfaction. So 4 is good :) This one is not very common scent so you will smell unique. Got some compliments on this one. Going into the often-used-cologne list!</li>
            <li> Smell so fresh and soft very good perfume, price compare @ the mall or any store the price is excellent, you not going to be disappointed with this purchase. Love it</li>
            <li> very good cologne i will buy again in the near future</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go......compliments. Mature smell but not old. The youngins need to leave this to the 30 somethings. Quick service and delivery.</li>
            <li> Great buy fast shipping</li>
            <li> very very nice pleasant to the nose you really like to smell this one soft and quant experience always pleasant</li>
            <li> This is my second go around...he really love it! He said it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product, about ten years ago when I was in high school I purchased this product from a Cologne store in the Palm Beach County mall for $150. So when I saw it on Amazon for $17 I had to have it.</li>
            <li> i love the scent very sexy and last long like me yeah baby &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I like this item Insurrection for men, and the price very good, I recommend this item to any one 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I like this cologne quite a bit. It has great longevity and moderate projection but is not overpowering. I would compare it favorably to Paco Rabanne One MIllion. It is also similar to Cuba Paris Prestige cologne but with more longevity. I would describe it as is a sweet aromatic scent of sweet fruits, intense vanilla, amber and woody notes</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> It is very good .i like it</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing</li>
            <li> My  husband loves this and this is his second Insurrection! I got him this as a back up! Such a wonderful smell!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of insurrection. It&#x27;s subtle which is great for my allergies and it still is able to catch the attention of the ladies. It&#x27;s a win/win.</li>
            <li> This is amazing smelling cologne for a unbelievable price. Well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Love this cologne on me and so does my wife!</li>
            <li> the best ever ,i will be getting more. Thanks.</li>
            <li> There are few men&#x27;s colognes I like.  I cannot like the smell of Polo or the like (I think that it&#x27;s called a &#x27;woodsy&#x27; scent).&lt;br /&gt;  I have bought this cologne before. I would put this one after Paul Sebastian and Obsession (nothing compares to the smell of Paul, though, and I mean nothing).  I like the smell of Insurrection.  Nothing is better than smelling a nice and clean man! Enough said.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> This is Real good and smell good</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it.. Not too over powering.</li>
            <li> My wife first bought this for me about two years ago as a gift. I have been hooked since then. I get complimented on how good I smell wherever I go. Awesome cologne, great price!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it on me. ENOUGH SAID</li>
            <li> Frankly 1 star is being liberal, it deserves 1/2 star, found the design very uncomfortable to use and moreover the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long, will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> smells very nice. a must have perfume.</li>
            <li> I recieved it as a gift; I thought I was going to hate it. It started out strong and I thought I was going to regret it immediately. NO!&lt;br /&gt;It mellows out into this sweet/dark vanilla/tobacco-ie/choco-mocha/powdery scent. I like it; the ladies seem to like it. Today my co-worker said I smell delicious. So drop the $20; you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume which last for that price really.</li>
            <li> The product is great the service was good very well satisfied with the product and the service thank you.</li>
            <li> bought it for my dad as a Christmas present.. He LOVES this cologne and has not been able to find it anywhere. I look forward to seeing his reaction when he gets it.</li>
            <li> Great service and delivery! I absolutely love this scent and my woman digs it on me! It&#x27;s a little different and &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; smelling, but I always get tons of compliments from the ladies and from my woman when I wear it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> A sweet scent smells a little feminine to me but I love it and can&#x27;t stop smelling myself.</li>
            <li> 5820 Millbank rd apt A&lt;br /&gt;Columbus Oh 43229</li>
            <li> I get more compliments wearing this cologne, especially from my wife who chose it for me originally.</li>
            <li> First saw and smelled this at a kiosk at a mall. They have a trick in that colognes like this and your various Lomani fragrances with the decorative bottles are deeply discounted they say. So usually a pretty young female tells you she can discount it up to 35% usually costing you about $40 after the discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually you can get it for half that of better on Amazon. They will not however discount the colognes on the second and bottom shelves too much. Usually about 3%  is as much as they will go on say Polo or Boss. So its a steal at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insurrection is sweet, no doubt about that. And it last a long time. Silage is good and that&#x27;s good because this is a fragrance that wouldn&#x27;t serve you if it came off too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;  that s what silage means how it lights up a room.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just enough to let them know its you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about what attire or event I would wear it would be a casual dinner with the wife or a luncheon  or even a day trip to the mall. Trust me you will not go unnoticed. I am interested in its ingredients. Will research it shortly.</li>
            <li> The sprayer broke shortly after opening it.  The scent was not remotely accurate, either.  TERRIBLE purchase!  Went straight to the trash...lesson learned about buying cologne online.</li>
            <li> I was getting rave reviews when I first purchased this cologne from the mall last year.Now,I haven&#x27;t heard a thing</li>
            <li> Good and bad its in between smells old sometimes smells good and its making my nose so dry</li>
            <li> the Cologne do not last long when you spray it on it only stays for minutes it is a very weak Cologne I have buy it in the past from different outlets and it was perfect</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon and Seller! Y&#x27;all have managed to wow me with another great purchase! Arrived as scheduled without fault. The product itself comes in a neat bottle and box. I love the scent, its sweet, light, and clean!</li>
            <li> Got this in my line-up !!! Very good for the price</li>
            <li> Awesome and last for a very long time.  The price was wonderful and the bottle is very nice looking. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> With Insurrection on everybody stops to ask me &#x27;You smell good, what do you have on?&#x27; ... and with confidence I say Insurrection. ..</li>
            <li> It has no Vanilla or woody notes..I was led to and tricked into buying something that smells like baby powder. ..I want my money back..and learn what woody and vanilla smell like....</li>
            <li> This is worth buying. ..fragrance lasts long.</li>
            <li> MY BROTHER-LAW LOVE&#x27;S HIS COLOGNE  AND WANT TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS SON&#x27;S..</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> Unique scent but not for me.</li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t get my stuff yet&lt;br /&gt;It been really long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can u tell me what I have to do to get that&lt;br /&gt;I mad a payment for it&lt;br /&gt;N it takeing so long</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SOFT UNOFFENSIVE SCENT FOR MEN. SIZE IS PERFECT, LASTS A LONG TIME.  EXCELLENT&lt;br /&gt;VALUE COMPARED TO OTHER HIGH PRICED SCENTS.</li>
            <li> Has a classy and unique smell.</li>
            <li> It is one of the most sensual colognes for men on the market.It smells great and the Ladies love the soft but manly scents there is</li>
            <li> This is a execellent deal. If you go to the mall you have to twice price and spend gas for the commute. This work for whatever means. Dangerous for a married man but safe for a single one!</li>
