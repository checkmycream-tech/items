            <li>The bottle size was a nice size, I like the scent of Shea Butter, so I decided to try this scent in Jergens lotion</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>kind made by jergins.  </li>
            <li>I liked it too</li>
            <li>Now you (Amazon) do and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>have found this lotion works best when it has been kept warm by sitting on a heater/house radiator or in direct sunlight.  </li>
            <li>, this  was just ok,  </li>
            <li>I even bought a bottle for my mom and she is in love with it as well.  </li>

            <li>it better be F-ing</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be buying from them until Amazon comes out with a better deal.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing the skin is of utmost importance to maintain a youthful, healthy skin appearance.  </li>
            <li>and I have been able to use the product since that time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a definite staple for me because it&#x27;s the best at immediately hydrating my skin and giving it a glow without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>so many leave on your hands.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>What I loved about Jergens and this lotion was how they kept their advertised ingredients toward the top and really delivered for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same lovely warm smell that I just loved.</li>
            <li>This a very good lotion, it is refreshing to the skin when rubbed in this is not&lt;br /&gt;Oiley like lots of other lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is very good for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, drys fast, and it leaves a nice aroma as well as some radiance like the label states.</li>
            <li>Both are staples in my house and are great daily moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original or this scent.</li>
            <li>Oily, but great for really dry skin.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be a good product overall.  </li>
            <li>but this is my absolute favorite  </li>
            <li>This Shea butter lotion is fantastic and I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li>This abated rather quickly however</li>
            <li>Really softens the skin - I find the scent quite overwhelming at first</li>
            <li>Just loved the fragrance of jergen&#x27;s and the moisture it provides to the skin through out the day, it would never let the skin go dry.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again, and Shea Butter does have its benefits, but I don&#x27;t think Jergens quite got it right yet with this formula.</li>
            <li>However in the winter it soaks right in and does not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>At one time, Amazon did not have this particular size available for Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li>This could be me being incredibly picky and unreasonable, but as a life-long Jergens user and the Shea Butter lotion becoming my all time favorite, I am certainly disappointed.</li>
            <li>but I do advise people with allergies and sinus problems to be aware of the possibility this may happen to them also.</li>
            <li>Personally, the consistency seems more watery to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong scent which is nice, and it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal especially since this has 25% more for even less than the regular sized bottle</li>
            <li>While this is almost as good as their Ultra Healing formula, it leans a little on the greasy side at first which is a major downside for me.  </li>
            <li>It really softens and moisturizes without feeling greasy or coming off on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin and have tried many different brands and formulas of lotion</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of it, and will truly purchase more in the future!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed they pushed the cocoa and mango ingredients lower on the list more than likely to cut corners, and this could be why the way it feels isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>If you like this particular brand of Jergens Shea Butter, buy it.</li>
            <li>sure to exfoliate as that helps slough off dead skin.</li>
            <li>I have begun a new S &amp; S subscription.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I ran out of my big bottle and decided to try Nivea Smooth Sensation.</li>
            <li>I am more sensitive to  perfume in lotions, but this product is gentle and not overwhelming, it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>but this is a little more thick and better for winter.</li>
            <li>How long have I looked to find a nongreasy, lightly scented lotion that actually absorbs into the skin without leaving a film.  </li>
            <li>It is used as a moisturizer in the cosmetic industry and has been said to have certain anti-inflammatory effects although I personally have no scientific proof of this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and I never have ashy knees or elbows.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I used the original Jergens when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase especially if it continues to soak in well even when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside.</li>
            <li>I struggle with dry skin in the winter and this really helps.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product because it really does moisturize your dry skin all day.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that moisturises my skin and leaves me soft, but it is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>As far as the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; this lotion is supposed to give after continuous and daily use, I just don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only used one bottle so far</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have chronic sinus problems and did have a problem with this product when I first used it manifested by a sinus headache and slight vertigo.  </li>
            <li>did give it at least 2 stars (I actually wanted to give it a 2.5) because it does at least hydrate fairly well</li>
            <li>My hands get very dry and cracked here in the Arizona high country, especially in the winter, and I don&#x27;t like that greasy residue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions - eucerin, curel, etc and a common solution people with dry skin have is they use these heavy lotions (high oil content) when they should use water-based lotions to moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

            <li> Not quite as thick as my long-time lotion, but a very good, less expensive</li>
            <li> The shipment came on the last day it was due</li>
            <li> last bottle of lotion was the firm and tone</li>
            <li> I also tend to get small bumps (not pimples) on my upper arms when my skin is to dry.  </li>
            <li> If I use this at night just once daily it will usually keep my hands protected  throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still less than what you&#x27;d pay at CVS, Walgreens, Duane Reade, etc.</li>
            <li> I work in retail/food service and lately the climate has been dry so between the air and the harsh cleaning products used at work, my hands and arms would crack.</li>
            <li> I hate when companies change things that are fine to begin with.</li>
            <li> This product contains Shea butter which is a fatty acid that comes from the nut of fruit taken from the Shea tree of Africa.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if it will be to heavy for summer use yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a few reviews already on lotions, so check my past reviews written.  </li>
            <li> , the shea butter remains toward the top, and isn&#x27;t the worst lotion out there.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and immediately switched back to my old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have even skipped a time or two and it was not too bad as compared to when I&#x27;d be using lubriderm or olay brands I could never skip or I&#x27;d feel tight and have a powdery look especially on my shins and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply it every morning and it isn&#x27;t greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> get me wrong - eucerin, curel, etc for sealing already moisturized skin, but your body needs to be moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can really go wrong with this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions - eucerin, curel, etc and a common solution people with dry skin have is they use these heavy lotions (high oil content) when they should use water-based lotions to moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong - eucerin, curel, etc for sealing already moisturized skin, but your body needs to be moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is the price - you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to exfoliate as that helps slough off dead skin. A simple solution of olive oil and sugar works wonders - preferably brown sugar or extra-fine sugar.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! Jergens Shea Butter Lotion NEVER DISAPPOINTS!! From the moment you apply it on your skin, it STAYS all day without dryness or irritation!!! I can&#x27;t get enough of it, and will truly purchase more in the future!!!</li>

            <li> I have pretty dry skin and have tried many different brands and formulas of lotion and I have to say this is my absolute favorite.  It really softens and moisturizes without feeling greasy or coming off on your clothes.  I even bought a bottle for my mom and she is in love with it as well.  Highly recommend this lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency seems like the same product I&#x27;ve purchased before in the stores, but the scent seems off somehow and is offensive to me.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever! I always buy Jergens healing lotion, but now that this has come on the market, it is my lotion of choice.</li>
            <li> Really softens the skin - I find the scent quite overwhelming at first when I apply it though, thus the removal of one star.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it makes my skin so nice and smooth, its a keeper I love it...try it I bet you eill love it too.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. It smells great and last a good while even after washing your hands The lotion absorbs in your skin immediately. This is very good for extremely dry skin. I sent my niece some as one of her birthday gifts and she raves about it too. I used the original Jergens when I was a little girl. Jergens is a quality product. Try it for yourself. I am sure you will agree.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and scent</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife and daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Was a gift ( an order ) from a friend living in Spain to bring with me on a visit there.&lt;br /&gt;Since I carried it from US to Spain it better be F-ing good.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it.</li>
            <li> Oily, but great for really dry skin. I sleep with my legs lotioned up.</li>
            <li> While this is almost as good as their Ultra Healing formula, it leans a little on the greasy side at first which is a major downside for me.  I&#x27;ve written a few reviews already on lotions, so check my past reviews written.  A non-greasy feeling is key to me.  As far as the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; this lotion is supposed to give after continuous and daily use, I just don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this lotion works best when it has been kept warm by sitting on a heater/house radiator or in direct sunlight.  The thicker concentration of this formula makes it come out of the bottle slower.  Buy it in a pump bottle if you can.  The heated lotion also gives my hands an added treat.  I&#x27;d buy it again, and Shea Butter does have its benefits, but I don&#x27;t think Jergens quite got it right yet with this formula.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jergens Shea Butter for years. Recently, I ran out of my big bottle and decided to try Nivea Smooth Sensation. I was very disappointed and immediately switched back to my old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the most affordable shea butter and it works! It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling like the Nivea lotion did.</li>
            <li> Just loved the fragrance of jergen&#x27;s and the moisture it provides to the skin through out the day, it would never let the skin go dry.</li>
            <li> This a very good lotion, it is refreshing to the skin when rubbed in this is not&lt;br /&gt;Oiley like lots of other lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li> How long have I looked to find a nongreasy, lightly scented lotion that actually absorbs into the skin without leaving a film.  This Shea butter lotion is fantastic and I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> You can really go wrong with this product. I struggle with dry skin in the winter and this really helps. I apply it every morning and it isn&#x27;t greasy or too thick. It has a pleasant smell that lasts all day! My skin feels great and it doesn&#x27;t make me itchy. I am more sensitive to  perfume in lotions, but this product is gentle and not overwhelming, it leaves my skin soft. I recommend this product because it really does moisturize your dry skin all day.</li>
            <li> The shipment came on the last day it was due so that&#x27;s why I rated it a 4 star. Otherwise I love the lotion and would recommend it to family too!</li>
            <li> I work in retail/food service and lately the climate has been dry so between the air and the harsh cleaning products used at work, my hands and arms would crack. I use this lotion immediately after taking a shower and sometimes before bedtime if I feel like I need that extra \\&quot;umph\\&quot; for my skin. It&#x27;s non greasy, drys fast, and it leaves a nice aroma as well as some radiance like the label states. I absolutely love this product. Walmart has been selling the 26.5 FL OZ bottles in packages of 2 for $14.54. I will be buying from them until Amazon comes out with a better deal.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years along side with Jergens Ultra Moisturizer. Both are staples in my house and are great daily moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that moisturises my skin and leaves me soft, but it is not heavy or oily. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I find this to be a good product overall.  I do have one comment to people with chronic sinus problems and multiple  allergies to various cosmetics.  This product contains Shea butter which is a fatty acid that comes from the nut of fruit taken from the Shea tree of Africa.  It is used as a moisturizer in the cosmetic industry and has been said to have certain anti-inflammatory effects although I personally have no scientific proof of this. Moisturizing the skin is of utmost importance to maintain a youthful, healthy skin appearance.  I have chronic sinus problems and did have a problem with this product when I first used it manifested by a sinus headache and slight vertigo.  This abated rather quickly however and I have been able to use the product since that time.  It is a wonderful product but I do advise people with allergies and sinus problems to be aware of the possibility this may happen to them also.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and smells nice. It&#x27;s not a strong scent which is nice, and it fades quickly.  I have only used one bottle so far and I purchased this in the winter, so I do not know if it will be to heavy for summer use yet.  However in the winter it soaks right in and does not leave a greasy feel.  My skin feels soft and I never have ashy knees or elbows. I also tend to get small bumps (not pimples) on my upper arms when my skin is to dry.  This lotion  takes care of that. I use it after my shower. I have even skipped a time or two and it was not too bad as compared to when I&#x27;d be using lubriderm or olay brands I could never skip or I&#x27;d feel tight and have a powdery look especially on my shins and knees.&lt;br /&gt;My last bottle of lotion was the firm and tone kind made by jergins.  I liked it too but this is a little more thick and better for winter. I will repurchase especially if it continues to soak in well even when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Jergens Shea Butter lotion for quite some time. It&#x27;s been a definite staple for me because it&#x27;s the best at immediately hydrating my skin and giving it a glow without being greasy. I also truly loved the cocoa type of smell. I found it to be incredibly soothing and lovely. That is, until they changed the formula. Personally, the consistency seems more watery to me. I&#x27;ve noticed they pushed the cocoa and mango ingredients lower on the list more than likely to cut corners, and this could be why the way it feels isn&#x27;t the same. The smell also seems off. It&#x27;s not the same lovely warm smell that I just loved. This could be me being incredibly picky and unreasonable, but as a life-long Jergens user and the Shea Butter lotion becoming my all time favorite, I am certainly disappointed. I hate when companies change things that are fine to begin with. What I loved about Jergens and this lotion was how they kept their advertised ingredients toward the top and really delivered for the price. But now I think I&#x27;m going to have to move on from this brand, which is a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it at least 2 stars (I actually wanted to give it a 2.5) because it does at least hydrate fairly well, the shea butter remains toward the top, and isn&#x27;t the worst lotion out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens since I was in my teens I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as my long-time lotion, but a very good, less expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this lotion again after first-time usage.</li>
            <li> The best lotion jergens has to offer in my opinion. Been using it for years. Leaves you feeling moisturized not greasy. Everyone that I get to try it, loves it!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! It&#x27;s so creamy and smells warm and delicious. Awesome size too.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  Non-sticky.  Absorbs well.  Skin feels soft.  Good value re price and amount per container.  Well-designed container.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and cracked here in the Arizona high country, especially in the winter, and I don&#x27;t like that greasy residue so many leave on your hands. If I use this at night just once daily it will usually keep my hands protected  throughout the day. I only find this with Jergens w/Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have three bottles of another lotion that&#x27;s very good but this is my absolute favorite  At one time, Amazon did not have this particular size available for Subscribe &amp; Save (I checked).  Now you (Amazon) do and I am thrilled.  I have begun a new S &amp; S subscription.  Please keep it up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I am African American and It&#x27;s great for my dry skin. Leaves it soft and smooth! Will recommend this to anyone! 😀</li>
            <li> If you like this particular brand of Jergens Shea Butter, buy it. It&#x27;s a great deal especially since this has 25% more for even less than the regular sized bottle and it&#x27;s still less than what you&#x27;d pay at CVS, Walgreens, Duane Reade, etc.</li>
