            <li>I don&#x27;t find it a wintry scent because it&#x27;s too refreshing, so will keep it for warmer days.</li>

            <li>It has a nice, fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Whenever I wear it, which is pretty much all through the summer, I get sooooooooooo many compliments of how good I smell.</li>
            <li>The description is accurate.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I liked the bar soap so much.</li>
            <li>I was on vacation in Santa Barbara, CA and had the fortunate opportunity to sample this scent...</li>
            <li>This female cologne smells great, unique non-manufactured smell.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh &amp; clean, love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the clean fresh smell that lingers.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous, fresh smell that lasts!</li>
            <li>It is herbal, fresh, and clean!</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful natural scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of OK mixed in with my lotions, though, so that&#x27;s how I have used it this summer.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fragrance but is almost like Febreze Gain scent.</li>
            <li>The description makes it sound like it is a crisp and light fragrance, which it is not.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>If you like a clean, fresh scent, try it.</li>
            <li>Sooo clean, fresh and revitalizing....</li>
            <li>scent is unisex, fresh, clean, woodsy, and citrusy too.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and all many of the products of the same scent-</li>
            <li>It does smell just like the lotion and is great when first applied, but it does not stick with you very long.  </li>
            <li>Such a refreshing scent!</li>
            <li>so light and pure......</li>
            <li>It smells crisp, clean and fresh, and helps revive me any time I spray it on.</li>
            <li>Thymes Eucalyptus cologne has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It is so fresh.</li>
            <li>Right up there with Fresh&#x27;s Lemon Sugar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t buy it right then.  </li>
            <li>Love this unique, subtle and fresh eucalyptus scent which I&#x27;ve not been able to find in stores in Portland, OR.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The product is exactly as it is advertised.  </li>
            <li>At first thought, you might think this will smell like</li>
            <li>Really would not reccommend it for that reason.  </li>
            <li>This is an overpowering fragrance and very perfumy.  </li>
            <li>However, the bar smells much truer to the description.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly told how good I smell, not only by people I know, but by total strangers I pass on the street.</li>
            <li>This product has masculine overtones with a crisp and flattering scent that generates compliments every time it is worn.</li>
            <li>The scent is so fresh and clean and last ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li>It is so much better than wearing a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but the bottle had a small spider suspended in the liquid.  </li>
            <li>Product is very hard to find, and I was able to purchase it with a click of a button, and at a decent price!</li>
            <li>I hate overpowering fragrances and this one is wonderful, but wish it was made a bit stronger to last longer.</li>
            <li>Next time I will either buy it right there and then or write the name down</li>

            <li> A little too lemon-y.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and also not overly feminine.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t to heavy and can be worn for every day or at the office.</li>
            <li> This has a slight medicinal smell to it, not sure why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because they did refund my money as I was not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but this is the stinkiest, most disgusting thing I have ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> I want a cologne that stays on at least half the day!</li>
            <li> However the cologne smells terrible very chemical like nothing like the other products.</li>
            <li> It honestly is very bad, I am so disappointed, it kind of smells like a cheep floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> This smells really artificial.</li>
            <li> Greatly disappointed, smells like a lysol wipe</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a stronger eucalyptus base.</li>
            <li> Nasty.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Thymes Eucalyptus scent. Ever since I&#x27;ve tried it I fell in love! Sooo clean, fresh and revitalizing....phenomenal scent!! Literally, I could drink the bottle...that&#x27;s how much I love this smell lol.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I liked the bar soap so much. However, the bar smells much truer to the description. This has a slight medicinal smell to it, not sure why.

This product has masculine overtones with a crisp and flattering scent that generates compliments every time it is worn. It isn&#x27;t to heavy and can be worn for every day or at the office. I absolutely love it and all many of the products of the same scent- the soap and hand lotion, specifically.</li>

I attempted to go back to purchase it and never did.  I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about the scent even when I returned home.  I found it on Amazon and I am so pleased I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is unisex, fresh, clean, woodsy, and citrusy too.  It literally makes me feel good when I spray it on!&lt;br /&gt;This scent ranks as one of my top 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this is the stinkiest, most disgusting thing I have ever smelled.  It is nothing like Eucalyptus which I loved.  It smells like a sweaty man in a smoky bar.  Nasty.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent, as well as the lotion &amp; body wash for years.  It has a nice, fresh scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I sampled a Eucalyptus Cologne when I was vacationing on Cape Cod and loved it but didn&#x27;t get the manufacturer&#x27;s name.  I bought this one thinking that it was the same - no so.  This one is ok.  Next time I will either buy it right there and then or write the name down so I can purchase it on line.</li>
            <li> Have used for years and love it, they changed the formula over a year ago, still good but not as good as the original</li>
            <li> Gotta try this scent...it&#x27;s lovely!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this scent, Eucalyptus,  before and I love it.  It is so fresh. I honestly feel that it clears my head.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product in the hopes that it would resemble the smell of Eucalyptus essential oil. Greatly disappointed, smells like a lysol wipe</li>
            <li> The fragrence is very light n earthy n has a clean scent! When u shower with the soap&lt;br /&gt;n use the body lotion with the spray...oh la la!!!!</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing scent! Delivery, packaging, quality - all great!</li>
            <li> I love the scent!!  Very fresh and soothing!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but the bottle had a small spider suspended in the liquid.  Money was reimbursed.</li>
            <li> My signature sent....love it!</li>
            <li> This female cologne smells great, unique non-manufactured smell. It doesn&#x27;t overpower, very pleasant and even. This has been around for some time and for good reason, you won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the smell!</li>
