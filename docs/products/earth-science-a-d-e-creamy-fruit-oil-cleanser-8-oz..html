            <li>Great for a winter face wash.  </li>

            <li>I love this cleanser!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful scent; love using it on my face.  </li>
            <li>Being a vegan, it can at times be a struggle to find fairly priced cruelty-free beauty</li>
            <li>I initially loved everything about this cleanser: the ingredient list, consistency, size, price, etc.</li>
            <li>My face feels good after using it.</li>
            <li>It did a fairly good job at removing my makeup</li>
            <li>(to be fair i have not met a cleanser yet that can remove it all)  </li>
            <li>I still do a good half-minute tent-rubbing it on my nose so it can dissolve the gunk.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love it too!</li>
            <li>It also makes an amazing makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>But, if you follow the instructions your face will feel amazing</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and wonderful to the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like Juice Beauty Cleansing Gel and Cerave cleansers (both the foaming and cream cleanser are wonderful!)</li>
            <li>A nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent too.</li>
            <li>I did not like the scent it smelled kind of like plastic</li>
            <li>Rinse it off with warm water and a cloth.  </li>
            <li>Creamy and effective</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for these kind of make up cleaning stuff.  </li>
            <li>So thrilled.</li>
            <li>PLEASANT SMELLING AND EASY</li>
            <li>I love love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the texture, it rinses off easily and takes off make up without a hitch!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, and you can feel good about supporting a company that is vegan and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>This great facial cleanser works at dissolving the sebaceous gunk in enlarged pores as well as an almond oil cleaning, but is more pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for over 10 years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>FOLLOW WITH YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li>Really love this line.</li>
            <li>And I love the fact that it&#x27;s ph balanced.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and</li>
            <li>but this may become my favorite as I age and may run into more dryness.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at a local health food store and I am fairly impressed.</li>
            <li>was so pleased to find it here.  </li>
            <li>50 something and skin is radiant and lovely.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the reasonable price as well.  </li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>really pleased I took the chance with this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE my Dr Bronner&#x27;s miracle</li>
            <li>but my face needed a bit more help this winter.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use it and can&#x27;t go a day without it, it just feels so lovely.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Safe and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Whether it does a great job of cleaning all by itself, I can&#x27;t really say because I&#x27;m in the habit of removing a lot of my makeup with an olive oil/tea tree oil mix before I shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised to be able to remove makeup, but I have found that I have to use a makeup remover before I use this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very clean, but never irritated.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser--light, creamy, gets the oil and dirt off and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This is the most economical effective creamy cleanser I know of.  </li>
            <li>It seemed more like a light burn.</li>
            <li>So, this product is a great natural alternative to cream cleansers, IF you aren&#x27;t allergic to soy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective at removing dirt/makeup that there is nothing on my cotton ball when I use toner right after.</li>
            <li>But I scar easily</li>
            <li>The sent is very mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever tried and I appreciate the decent price and good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought this at Whole Foods and loved it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for sensitive mature skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser that removes all of your foundation.  </li>
            <li>I like the clarity one better right now</li>
            <li>LEAVES FACE FEELING SMOOTH  AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of creamy cleansers I have tried, it feels light on my skin and leaves it feeling truly clean.</li>
            <li>gentle and hydrating; excellent for dry, aging skin</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t really love it until after 2 weeks of using it when I realized I was using it incorrectly at first.</li>
            <li>So, when I found this product, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>It has a barely detectable scent, which is good for me.  </li>
            <li>balanced(my skin look more radiant and smooth), since using this my face has been clear from pimples :)</li>
            <li>It never got my face completely clean</li>
            <li>I recently started using this line of products, and I am really enjoying nice results on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years now, it has kept my skin clean and</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t feel that my skin was clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It feels almost like a watery lotion but rinses completely clean from your face.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>and this does a good job removing it without using a makeup remover prior.</li>
            <li>I love how soothing and gentle it is.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest finding it in a store, that way you can be sure you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love the mild scent, and the product is gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li>I heard that switching to an oil-based cleanser could cause an initial break out but later you&#x27;ll have perfect skin.</li>
            <li>I also use Earth Science&#x27;s toner, and it is tremendously helpful getting my lotion to absorb without drying up or leaving me greasy.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and I like the brand.</li>
            <li>I WILL BE A LOYAL CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is nice and gentle, but it doesn&#x27;t cleanse as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
            <li>how light and gentle this creamy cleanser feels but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the make-up off my face well.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>and this was pretty good for the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li>I love this natural cleanser!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s by far in my opinion the best cleanser out there particularly for semi to dry skin types.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have used many high-end cleansers that don&#x27;t work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>When I read the ingredients and saw that Soybean Oil was listed as a top ingredient it became clear.</li>
            <li>i love the mask the company offers, but not the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for nearly a year now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product, I decided to buy pretty much their whole line of skin care.</li>
            <li>and I always had dirt/makeup on my cotton ball when using toner right after washing.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the ingredients are non-toxic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered the absolute best and most gentle way to exfoliate my skin: a rounded teaspoon of diatomaceous earth and one squirt of this creamy cleanser, mixed and spread on face in little circles.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice too, light and slightly fruity.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive &amp; dry skin!</li>
            <li>It rinses off completely with warm water on a wash cloth, and rinses completely from the cloth.  </li>
            <li>It was very gentle and moisturizing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new face wash because my face wasn&#x27;t too happy with my last one, which was a natural creamy cleanser also.</li>
            <li>Once I started doing it this way, my skin really transformed!</li>
            <li>I am a Texas Longhorn cattle rancher and work in the hot Texas sun so caring for my skin can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>(yes, really!)</li>
            <li>After trying many facial cleansers, I have stayed with this one for a while now.</li>
            <li>The gel works better and that is what I will order next time.</li>
            <li>Light but cleanses completely.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many and always come back to this one, does not leave residue on face.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for years, even my mom loves it and asks me to get some more when I go back to my country.</li>
            <li>I love this facial wash because i can use it as a moisturizer  </li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim at Whole Foods: I wish I&#x27;d tried it sooner!</li>
            <li>this product makes me feel actually clean but still soft and not stripped.</li>
            <li>My face is clean, but soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I for one am delighted to have a cleansing moisturizer to introduce to my \\&quot;nether\\&quot;, I suppose someone could be allergic and should experiment on a small scale first</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my sensitive skin and works well to clean the makeup away.</li>
            <li>Use it a couple times a week and your skin will always be fresh and new.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use this on dry skin and then rinse.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li>The good aspects of the cleanser are that it has not irritated my sensitive skin, the smell is pleasant, and it does leave my skin soft, but for removing cosmetic residue, especially water proof or other long wear makeup, this product will not work for that,unfortunately.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty easy maintenance in the summer but in the winter can get really dry; I&#x27;ve had no problems with dryness since I started using this.</li>
            <li>It is so creamy and rich with a slight natural fruit  aroma another thing I really love</li>
            <li>It will remove eye makeup and is is gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I really prefer unscented products for almost anything (I will never understand scented deodorant....).</li>
            <li>This is a no-nonsense, no-frills, no-suds, no-fragrance (that I could detect) creamy cleanser that was gentle to my face and also removed makeup/mascara.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser works really well for me.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is so creamy and gentle yet washes off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>And Whole Foods always runs out of it</li>
            <li>It cleans very well and no irritation to my skin after.</li>
            <li>i really want it to like it but returned it.</li>
            <li>But this creamy formula does not remove much of my make up.</li>
            <li>But the gel is gentle anyway</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend buying it from this seller, because I don&#x27;t believe these are real Earth Science products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I highly reommend this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so creamy and so gentle</li>
            <li>and i have normal skin with occasional very mild breakouts ( 1-3 pimples at a time )consisting  </li>
            <li>I have been using the sweet almond oil moisturizer also by Earth Science for several years now, since I read a skincare specialist recommend almond oil for skin brightening effects.</li>
            <li>What I can smell is a slight apricot - it could use more even.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin clean and soft, never dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has tried them all.</li>
            <li>Also highly recommended:</li>
            <li>Since it is sometimes difficult to purchase in my area, I&#x27;m so happy that it is being offered here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Acne prone, sensitive and very fussy skin.</li>
            <li>What I notice it does not cause my skin to breakout because is natural, it is very moisturizing, it keeps my complexion</li>
            <li>So far I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The entire line of Earth Science products are well worth using.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your face, but it&#x27;s left feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t do the job and will likely slide right off.  </li>
            <li>I will echo what the other reviewers have stated, that it&#x27;s a good reminder to apply the cleanser on dry skin (don&#x27;t wet your face with water first), and then rinse with water.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to soy and soy products (even so-called sensitive Aveeno&#x27;s soy-based line is a no-go for me...</li>
            <li>One of my girl friends is a licensed esthitician with an emphasis on natural products and she highly recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li>I found this made my skin very soft not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t break out from this!</li>
            <li>After years of searching for a face wash that would take off my makeup but also make my skin feel moisturized and soft, I found it!  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser is mild and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>But after just one use it was clear this wasnt the cleanser for me.</li>
            <li>Then use a wet washcloth to lightly exfoliate and rinse at the same time, followed by a splash of water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely moisturized and my skin tone is evening out...</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so soft after using that I don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Makes you skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to really like this as a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I am 22 years old</li>
            <li>, it removes eye make or foundation effortless, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural</li>
            <li>Old blemishes are healing faster, too.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not many out there for this price that have so few artificial/hazardous ingredients, while still successfully cleaning pores.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using other Earth Science products, facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>While I recommend this particular cleanser, as well as their entire line of products, I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing it from this seller.</li>
            <li>I find it to be the only thing that is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was an allergic reaction, as there were no other signs of that.</li>
            <li>After two days of use I have noticed that my skin is not as dry and tight after washing, and blackheads are fading quickly!</li>
            <li>So, I decided to give this one a try based on the positive reviews on it and other products they make.</li>
            <li>Not only is is reasonably priced but it lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and have been recently transitioning to national products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils but at the same time your skin will feel refreshed and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Dry enough for most regular cleansers to strip it off the little oil it has.</li>
            <li>They use high quality ingredients that don&#x27;t dry or tighten your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to wash at least couple of times to get totally clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and removes the most gruesome eye makeup with a warm cloth.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well and does not dry out your skin, nor does it leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to being dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I have normal to dry skin with occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have weird skin- sensitive, and combination dry with a few oily spots, and break out super easy.</li>
            <li>Extremely sensitive, but so dry on my cheeks, extra oily t zone,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Being a vegan, it can at times be a struggle to find fairly priced cruelty-free beauty</li>
            <li> I initially loved everything about this cleanser: the ingredient list, consistency, size, price, etc.</li>
            <li> My face feels good after using it.</li>
            <li> It did a fairly good job at removing my makeup</li>
            <li> (to be fair i have not met a cleanser yet that can remove it all)  </li>
            <li> I still do a good half-minute tent-rubbing it on my nose so it can dissolve the gunk.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it too!</li>
            <li> It also makes an amazing makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> But, if you follow the instructions your face will feel amazing</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and wonderful to the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like Juice Beauty Cleansing Gel and Cerave cleansers (both the foaming and cream cleanser are wonderful!)</li>
            <li> A nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent it smelled kind of like plastic</li>
            <li> Rinse it off with warm water and a cloth.  </li>
            <li> Creamy and effective</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for these kind of make up cleaning stuff.  </li>
            <li> So thrilled.</li>
            <li> PLEASANT SMELLING AND EASY</li>
            <li> I love love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the texture, it rinses off easily and takes off make up without a hitch!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and you can feel good about supporting a company that is vegan and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> This great facial cleanser works at dissolving the sebaceous gunk in enlarged pores as well as an almond oil cleaning, but is more pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for over 10 years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> but I love this product.</li>
            <li> FOLLOW WITH YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li> Really love this line.</li>
            <li> And I love the fact that it&#x27;s ph balanced.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and</li>
            <li> but this may become my favorite as I age and may run into more dryness.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at a local health food store and I am fairly impressed.</li>
            <li> was so pleased to find it here.  </li>
            <li> 50 something and skin is radiant and lovely.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the reasonable price as well.  </li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> really pleased I took the chance with this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE my Dr Bronner&#x27;s miracle</li>
            <li> but my face needed a bit more help this winter.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use it and can&#x27;t go a day without it, it just feels so lovely.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Safe and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Whether it does a great job of cleaning all by itself, I can&#x27;t really say because I&#x27;m in the habit of removing a lot of my makeup with an olive oil/tea tree oil mix before I shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised to be able to remove makeup, but I have found that I have to use a makeup remover before I use this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very clean, but never irritated.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser--light, creamy, gets the oil and dirt off and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This is the most economical effective creamy cleanser I know of.  </li>
            <li> It seemed more like a light burn.</li>
            <li> So, this product is a great natural alternative to cream cleansers, IF you aren&#x27;t allergic to soy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so effective at removing dirt/makeup that there is nothing on my cotton ball when I use toner right after.</li>
            <li> But I scar easily</li>
            <li> The sent is very mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever tried and I appreciate the decent price and good ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Originally bought this at Whole Foods and loved it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for sensitive mature skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser that removes all of your foundation.  </li>
            <li> I like the clarity one better right now</li>
            <li> LEAVES FACE FEELING SMOOTH  AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of creamy cleansers I have tried, it feels light on my skin and leaves it feeling truly clean.</li>
            <li> gentle and hydrating; excellent for dry, aging skin</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t really love it until after 2 weeks of using it when I realized I was using it incorrectly at first.</li>
            <li> So, when I found this product, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> It has a barely detectable scent, which is good for me.  </li>
            <li> balanced(my skin look more radiant and smooth), since using this my face has been clear from pimples :)</li>
            <li> It never got my face completely clean</li>
            <li> I recently started using this line of products, and I am really enjoying nice results on my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years now, it has kept my skin clean and</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t feel that my skin was clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It feels almost like a watery lotion but rinses completely clean from your face.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> and this does a good job removing it without using a makeup remover prior.</li>
            <li> I love how soothing and gentle it is.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest finding it in a store, that way you can be sure you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love the mild scent, and the product is gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li> I heard that switching to an oil-based cleanser could cause an initial break out but later you&#x27;ll have perfect skin.</li>
            <li> I also use Earth Science&#x27;s toner, and it is tremendously helpful getting my lotion to absorb without drying up or leaving me greasy.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and I like the brand.</li>
            <li> I WILL BE A LOYAL CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is nice and gentle, but it doesn&#x27;t cleanse as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
            <li> how light and gentle this creamy cleanser feels but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the make-up off my face well.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> and this was pretty good for the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li> I love this natural cleanser!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s by far in my opinion the best cleanser out there particularly for semi to dry skin types.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have used many high-end cleansers that don&#x27;t work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> When I read the ingredients and saw that Soybean Oil was listed as a top ingredient it became clear.</li>
            <li> i love the mask the company offers, but not the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for nearly a year now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product, I decided to buy pretty much their whole line of skin care.</li>
            <li> and I always had dirt/makeup on my cotton ball when using toner right after washing.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the ingredients are non-toxic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered the absolute best and most gentle way to exfoliate my skin: a rounded teaspoon of diatomaceous earth and one squirt of this creamy cleanser, mixed and spread on face in little circles.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice too, light and slightly fruity.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive &amp; dry skin!</li>
            <li> It rinses off completely with warm water on a wash cloth, and rinses completely from the cloth.  </li>
            <li> It was very gentle and moisturizing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new face wash because my face wasn&#x27;t too happy with my last one, which was a natural creamy cleanser also.</li>
            <li> Once I started doing it this way, my skin really transformed!</li>
            <li> I am a Texas Longhorn cattle rancher and work in the hot Texas sun so caring for my skin can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> (yes, really!)</li>
            <li> After trying many facial cleansers, I have stayed with this one for a while now.</li>
            <li> The gel works better and that is what I will order next time.</li>
            <li> Light but cleanses completely.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many and always come back to this one, does not leave residue on face.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, even my mom loves it and asks me to get some more when I go back to my country.</li>
            <li> I love this facial wash because i can use it as a moisturizer  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim at Whole Foods: I wish I&#x27;d tried it sooner!</li>
            <li> this product makes me feel actually clean but still soft and not stripped.</li>
            <li> My face is clean, but soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I for one am delighted to have a cleansing moisturizer to introduce to my \\&quot;nether\\&quot;, I suppose someone could be allergic and should experiment on a small scale first</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my sensitive skin and works well to clean the makeup away.</li>
            <li> Use it a couple times a week and your skin will always be fresh and new.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use this on dry skin and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> The good aspects of the cleanser are that it has not irritated my sensitive skin, the smell is pleasant, and it does leave my skin soft, but for removing cosmetic residue, especially water proof or other long wear makeup, this product will not work for that,unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty easy maintenance in the summer but in the winter can get really dry; I&#x27;ve had no problems with dryness since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It is so creamy and rich with a slight natural fruit  aroma another thing I really love</li>
            <li> It will remove eye makeup and is is gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I really prefer unscented products for almost anything (I will never understand scented deodorant....).</li>
            <li> This is a no-nonsense, no-frills, no-suds, no-fragrance (that I could detect) creamy cleanser that was gentle to my face and also removed makeup/mascara.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser works really well for me.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is so creamy and gentle yet washes off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> And Whole Foods always runs out of it</li>
            <li> It cleans very well and no irritation to my skin after.</li>
            <li> i really want it to like it but returned it.</li>
            <li> But this creamy formula does not remove much of my make up.</li>
            <li> But the gel is gentle anyway</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying it from this seller, because I don&#x27;t believe these are real Earth Science products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I highly reommend this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so creamy and so gentle</li>
            <li> and i have normal skin with occasional very mild breakouts ( 1-3 pimples at a time )consisting  </li>
            <li> I have been using the sweet almond oil moisturizer also by Earth Science for several years now, since I read a skincare specialist recommend almond oil for skin brightening effects.</li>
            <li> What I can smell is a slight apricot - it could use more even.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin clean and soft, never dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has tried them all.</li>
            <li> Also highly recommended:</li>
            <li> Since it is sometimes difficult to purchase in my area, I&#x27;m so happy that it is being offered here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Acne prone, sensitive and very fussy skin.</li>
            <li> What I notice it does not cause my skin to breakout because is natural, it is very moisturizing, it keeps my complexion</li>
            <li> So far I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The entire line of Earth Science products are well worth using.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your face, but it&#x27;s left feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t do the job and will likely slide right off.  </li>
            <li> I will echo what the other reviewers have stated, that it&#x27;s a good reminder to apply the cleanser on dry skin (don&#x27;t wet your face with water first), and then rinse with water.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to soy and soy products (even so-called sensitive Aveeno&#x27;s soy-based line is a no-go for me...</li>
            <li> One of my girl friends is a licensed esthitician with an emphasis on natural products and she highly recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> I found this made my skin very soft not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t break out from this!</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a face wash that would take off my makeup but also make my skin feel moisturized and soft, I found it!  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser is mild and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> But after just one use it was clear this wasnt the cleanser for me.</li>
            <li> Then use a wet washcloth to lightly exfoliate and rinse at the same time, followed by a splash of water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely moisturized and my skin tone is evening out...</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so soft after using that I don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes you skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves it soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to really like this as a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I am 22 years old</li>
            <li> , it removes eye make or foundation effortless, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural</li>
            <li> Old blemishes are healing faster, too.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not many out there for this price that have so few artificial/hazardous ingredients, while still successfully cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using other Earth Science products, facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> While I recommend this particular cleanser, as well as their entire line of products, I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing it from this seller.</li>
            <li> I find it to be the only thing that is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was an allergic reaction, as there were no other signs of that.</li>
            <li> After two days of use I have noticed that my skin is not as dry and tight after washing, and blackheads are fading quickly!</li>
            <li> So, I decided to give this one a try based on the positive reviews on it and other products they make.</li>
            <li> Not only is is reasonably priced but it lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and have been recently transitioning to national products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils but at the same time your skin will feel refreshed and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Dry enough for most regular cleansers to strip it off the little oil it has.</li>
            <li> They use high quality ingredients that don&#x27;t dry or tighten your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to wash at least couple of times to get totally clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and removes the most gruesome eye makeup with a warm cloth.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well and does not dry out your skin, nor does it leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to being dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I have normal to dry skin with occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have weird skin- sensitive, and combination dry with a few oily spots, and break out super easy.</li>
            <li> Extremely sensitive, but so dry on my cheeks, extra oily t zone,</li>
            <li> It is incredibly gentle and cleans your face without making it feel dry, tight, or &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of</li>
            <li> this 8oz bottle will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need a full pump because of the thick consistency whether you wet your face or not.</li>
            <li> After finally reading the directions on the back, I noticed you have to apply it to DRY skin and cleanse your skin dry and then rinse off or wipe off with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Definitely read the directions - apply to DRY skin, then either rinse off or removed w/wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> and this cleanser leaves me skin feeling smooth and moisturized instead of tight and dry like any other face wash I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done them all, the expensive, the cheap, foam, the gels, everything-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and avoid harsh cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this as long as i can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS THEY KEEP MAKING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> you have somewhat of a dry skin, give it a try, you&#x27;ll have found a life long keeper if it works for you.</li>
            <li> You can use it dry without wetting your face too.</li>
            <li> It cleanses well, removes makeup, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat of a dry skin, not too dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry it one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans well without leaving my face dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I have really really really really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I cannot emphasize how dry my skin is.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is in the dry side during the winter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I actually accumulate significantly less oil on my face during the day when I&#x27;m using this than with any other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t feel the same on my skin, it was too harsh and made my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I try to use only natural products that don&#x27;t have nasty chemical ingredients in them.</li>
            <li> I have severe acne problems and am on a few different prescriptions for them.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from Whole Foods, but since they stopped carrying this line, I&#x27;ve been forced to find it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and my face had broken out, which tells me it&#x27;s definitely not the same product that I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking my rating down a star due to the possibility of this type of reaction, though I never had any problems with it when I immediately rinsed.</li>
            <li> I wear black makeup (mascara, shadow, and eyeliner)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out</li>
            <li> been using this facial wash for approximately 3 months.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cleanser!! However I didn&#x27;t really love it until after 2 weeks of using it when I realized I was using it incorrectly at first. After finally reading the directions on the back, I noticed you have to apply it to DRY skin and cleanse your skin dry and then rinse off or wipe off with a wash cloth. Once I started doing it this way, my skin really transformed! It&#x27;s completely moisturized and my skin tone is evening out...it also totally removes makeup. Love it!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I try to use only natural products that don&#x27;t have nasty chemical ingredients in them. I was looking for a new face wash because my face wasn&#x27;t too happy with my last one, which was a natural creamy cleanser also. It never got my face completely clean and I always had dirt/makeup on my cotton ball when using toner right after washing. So, I decided to give this one a try based on the positive reviews on it and other products they make. I am so happy with it, and so is my face! No break outs since using this cleanser. I put it on (not using any water) and rub it in, letting it sit for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. It&#x27;s so effective at removing dirt/makeup that there is nothing on my cotton ball when I use toner right after. It leaves my face so soft after using that I don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer. I am so pleased with this product, I decided to buy pretty much their whole line of skin care. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so I all I know is it works for me and I have weird skin- sensitive, and combination dry with a few oily spots, and break out super easy.</li>
            <li> I am a Texas Longhorn cattle rancher and work in the hot Texas sun so caring for my skin can be a challenge.  I have used this cleanser for over 10 years and absolutely love it.  It will remove eye makeup and is is gentle on my skin.  A girl has to look good, even when working cattle!</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and wonderful to the skin. Makes you skin so soft.  I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t break out from this!</li>
            <li> I love love this product! I alternate between using this and Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil face wash (if I have a breakout) but it is a dynamic duo. I&#x27;ve done them all, the expensive, the cheap, foam, the gels, everything- but I love this product. I have combination skin that freaks out with everything. Extremely sensitive, but so dry on my cheeks, extra oily t zone, ect- this product makes me feel actually clean but still soft and not stripped. You can use it dry without wetting your face too. It also makes an amazing makeup remover. HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has tried them all.</li>
            <li> PLEASANT SMELLING AND EASY ON THE FACE, THIS CLEANSER DOES IT ALL AT A GREAT PRICE! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANY AGE. LEAVES FACE FEELING SMOOTH  AND CLEAN. FOLLOW WITH YOUR FAVORITE MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li> Being a vegan, it can at times be a struggle to find fairly priced cruelty-free beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is an absolutely brilliant face cleanser! I have very sensitive skin that is prone to being dry and this cleanser leaves me skin feeling smooth and moisturized instead of tight and dry like any other face wash I have used in the past. It lathers well and removes makeup like a champ. I have and will continue to repurchase this product. Thank you Earth Science!!</li>
            <li> I really like this! I finally found a cleanser that cleans but doesn&#x27;t strip my face of all the oils. It leaves it soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout. Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently started using this line of products, and I am really enjoying nice results on my skin.  I have sensitive/aging AND acne-prone skin (yes, really!), and this product is great.  I use it with my clarisonic.  It leaves my skin very clean, but never irritated.  I&#x27;ve had a noticeable boost in my skin&#x27;s moisture content without any breakouts.  I am very happy I tried this line.</li>
            <li> I initially loved everything about this cleanser: the ingredient list, consistency, size, price, etc. But after just one use it was clear this wasnt the cleanser for me. I broke out like crazy and my skin constantly tingled. I heard that switching to an oil-based cleanser could cause an initial break out but later you&#x27;ll have perfect skin. But I scar easily so thats not an option. I&#x27;ll just stick to water-based cleansers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I have been using non-stop for four years. Since it is sometimes difficult to purchase in my area, I&#x27;m so happy that it is being offered here on Amazon.  I have sensitive skin and have used many high-end cleansers that don&#x27;t work as well as this one.  My face is clean, but soft and moist. Really love this line.</li>
            <li> but since we don&#x27;t have a bidet in The US, sometimes there is a moisture deficit in the region that we are constantly rubbing paper on. I for one am delighted to have a cleansing moisturizer to introduce to my \\&quot;nether\\&quot;, I suppose someone could be allergic and should experiment on a small scale first but for me I find this counter -irritating not irritating at all but very soothing.</li>
            <li> So far I love it! It removes all dirt and makeup at the end of the day without leaving behind any film and not drying at all. My face feels good after using it. And I love the fact that it&#x27;s ph balanced. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the scent. It&#x27;s pretty strong and I really prefer unscented products for almost anything (I will never understand scented deodorant....). It doesn&#x27;t linger, but it is there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve even used it as just a moisturizer when in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! It cleanses well, removes makeup, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. One caveat: if it gets in your eyes it can sting a bit (but not badly enough to stop me from removing eye makeup with it). My skin is pretty easy maintenance in the summer but in the winter can get really dry; I&#x27;ve had no problems with dryness since I started using this. And don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; part scare you away--I actually accumulate significantly less oil on my face during the day when I&#x27;m using this than with any other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve tried. Also highly recommended: Earth Science Almond-Aloe Facial Moisturizer Fragrance-Free.  Update: DON&#x27;T leave this on your face for any length of time! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but when I decided to let it sit on my face for a couple of minutes one day, I ended up with terrible redness and sensitivity that lasted well into the next day. I don&#x27;t think it was an allergic reaction, as there were no other signs of that. It seemed more like a light burn. I&#x27;m knocking my rating down a star due to the possibility of this type of reaction, though I never had any problems with it when I immediately rinsed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so creamy and moisturizing.  Great for a winter face wash.  The smell is nice too, light and slightly fruity.  Washes off well and leaves no residue.  I wear black makeup (mascara, shadow, and eyeliner) and this does a good job removing it without using a makeup remover prior. Now, I&#x27;m just patiently waiting for the Earth Science toner to get here in the mail from amazon.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and avoid harsh cleansers.  So, when I found this product, I was excited.  I love the scent and how light and gentle this creamy cleanser feels but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the make-up off my face well.  I have to wash at least couple of times to get totally clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great creamy lotion cleanser for all skin. Unfortunately for me, after using this for a few weeks I noticed little red bumps everywhere on my face. When I read the ingredients and saw that Soybean Oil was listed as a top ingredient it became clear. I am highly allergic to soy and soy products (even so-called sensitive Aveeno&#x27;s soy-based line is a no-go for me...I can ONLY use their oat-based line of products). So, this product is a great natural alternative to cream cleansers, IF you aren&#x27;t allergic to soy. Otherwise, stay away! I really like Juice Beauty Cleansing Gel and Cerave cleansers (both the foaming and cream cleanser are wonderful!) Otherwise, Earth Science is a great company!</li>
            <li> This is a no-nonsense, no-frills, no-suds, no-fragrance (that I could detect) creamy cleanser that was gentle to my face and also removed makeup/mascara.  Just what I wanted, at a price I couldn&#x27;t pass by.  I plan to purchase it again and have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> A nice cleanser.  I like the clarity one better right now but this may become my favorite as I age and may run into more dryness.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat of a dry skin, not too dry. Dry enough for most regular cleansers to strip it off the little oil it has. This cleanser works really well for me. My skin&#x27;s best friend! Doesn&#x27;t dry it one bit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years now, it has kept my skin clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;If you have somewhat of a dry skin, give it a try, you&#x27;ll have found a life long keeper if it works for you.</li>
            <li> After trying many facial cleansers, I have stayed with this one for a while now. Unlike a lot of creamy cleansers I have tried, it feels light on my skin and leaves it feeling truly clean. This cleanser is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used on my dry sensitive skin. Love the texture, it rinses off easily and takes off make up without a hitch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  They use high quality ingredients that don&#x27;t dry or tighten your skin.  The entire line of Earth Science products are well worth using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to really like this as a facial cleanser.  It has a barely detectable scent, which is good for me.  What I can smell is a slight apricot - it could use more even.  I use it every day and like it.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this at Whole Foods and loved it. The cleanser is so creamy and gentle yet washes off my eye makeup. I highly recommend it and Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
            <li> This has become my go to face wash. Cleans well without leaving my face dry or oily. Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I have really really really really dry skin.  I cannot emphasize how dry my skin is.  I also have sensitive skin and have been recently transitioning to national products.  I picked this up at a local health food store and I am fairly impressed. It did a fairly good job at removing my makeup but I still used a bit of coconut oil to remove the rest of my waterproof eyeliner. (to be fair i have not met a cleanser yet that can remove it all)  It was very gentle and moisturizing on my skin.  I did not like the scent it smelled kind of like plastic but it&#x27;s not enough to put me off.  I will continue to use this and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser is mild and moisturizing.  I would recommend it for anyone.  It has a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> This is the most economical effective creamy cleanser I know of.  And Whole Foods always runs out of it so&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased to find it here.  Not only is is reasonably priced but it lasts quite a long time.  I use it once daily&lt;br /&gt;and I only need to replace it every 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. 50 something and skin is radiant and lovely.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for sensitive mature skin. It cleans very well and no irritation to my skin after. I was happy with the reasonable price as well.  I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser--light, creamy, gets the oil and dirt off and washes off easily. I&#x27;ll buy it again if they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 of these. Acne prone, sensitive and very fussy skin. Love love it is not drying or irritating.</li>
            <li> i got this product and used it twice. i really want it to like it but returned it. i love the mask the company offers, but not the cleanser. very thin and i didn&#x27;t feel that my skin was clean after using it. sorry.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My Son has bought it for me for years and now I&#x27;m buying it for my Daughter.  She loves it also</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product. I have been using this procduct for a while. I will be using this as long as i can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent; love using it on my face.  Enjoy using other Earth Science products, facial moisturizer.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have dry, sensitive skin. This product cleans well, even make-up, without leaving an oily residue. I love this brand. Great, organic, inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This great facial cleanser works at dissolving the sebaceous gunk in enlarged pores as well as an almond oil cleaning, but is more pleasant to use.  I still do a good half-minute tent-rubbing it on my nose so it can dissolve the gunk.  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s; I understand the pore problem comes with age.  This great cleanser takes care of the problem.  It rinses off completely with warm water on a wash cloth, and rinses completely from the cloth.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased I took the chance with this product.  I will buy it again when my supply gets low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/28/15 addition:  I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for nearly a year now and still love it.  I&#x27;ve discovered the absolute best and most gentle way to exfoliate my skin: a rounded teaspoon of diatomaceous earth and one squirt of this creamy cleanser, mixed and spread on face in little circles.  Rinse it off with warm water and a cloth.  Amazing!  Use it a couple times a week and your skin will always be fresh and new.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is in the dry side during the winter. I LOVE my Dr Bronner&#x27;s miracle soap- it is still my &#x27;everything else&#x27; soap- but my face needed a bit more help this winter. This cleanser moisturizes my skin without leaving my T zone oily and the smell doesn&#x27;t upset my fragrance-sensitive sinuses. The price is right, and the ingredients are non-toxic. I also use Earth Science&#x27;s toner, and it is tremendously helpful getting my lotion to absorb without drying up or leaving me greasy.</li>
            <li> Creamy and effective cleanser - I love how soothing and gentle it is.  I will be reordering when I get low on this product.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and I like the brand. But this creamy formula does not remove much of my make up. It leaves my foundation and powder on my face. This brand also makes a gel cleanser that is similar. The gel works better and that is what I will order next time. I wanted the cream because it looked gentler. But the gel is gentle anyway</li>
            <li> I have severe acne problems and am on a few different prescriptions for them. My doctor suggested that I use Cetaphil face wash daily but after looking in to it I saw a few nasty ingredients that I avoid in my skin products. (Parabens!) One of my girl friends is a licensed esthitician with an emphasis on natural products and she highly recommended this product to me. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and absolutely love it! It is incredibly gentle and cleans your face without making it feel dry, tight, or &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; of it&#x27;s natural oils but at the same time your skin will feel refreshed and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s so moisturizing. Because of my Epidou prescription I&#x27;m prone to getting flaky scaly skin and this cleanser is the only one that will wash off my make up, grease, and dirt without exasperating the flakes or causing additional dryness.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;creamy cleanser&amp;#34; not a soap! This product does NOT lather. It feels almost like a watery lotion but rinses completely clean from your face. It will not bubble or give you suds but it cleans all the same.</li>
            <li> I keep reordering this.  It&#x27;s terrific for all skin types.  It&#x27;s creamy and removes the most gruesome eye makeup with a warm cloth.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely read the directions - apply to DRY skin, then either rinse off or removed w/wet wash cloth.  I have dry skin and this was pretty good for the middle of winter.  Removes eye makeup especially well.  Smells nice, and you can feel good about supporting a company that is vegan and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a face wash that would take off my makeup but also make my skin feel moisturized and soft, I found it!  It is truly the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever tried and I appreciate the decent price and good ingredients.  My husband and I both use it and can&#x27;t go a day without it, it just feels so lovely. It doesn&#x27;t dry your face, but it&#x27;s left feeling super clean and soft. I will echo what the other reviewers have stated, that it&#x27;s a good reminder to apply the cleanser on dry skin (don&#x27;t wet your face with water first), and then rinse with water. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t do the job and will likely slide right off.  But, if you follow the instructions your face will feel amazing after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have normal to dry skin with occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years after my Mom told me about it.  Love it.  Light but cleanses completely.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever.  Have tried many and always come back to this one, does not leave residue on face.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, even my mom loves it and asks me to get some more when I go back to my country. Love the mild scent, and the product is gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> I found this made my skin very soft not greasy. The sent is very mild. Just make sure you use this on dry skin and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I keep using this product as my go-to morning cleanser. There&#x27;s not many out there for this price that have so few artificial/hazardous ingredients, while still successfully cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and i have normal skin with occasional very mild breakouts ( 1-3 pimples at a time )consisting  been using this facial wash for approximately 3 months. What I notice it does not cause my skin to breakout because is natural, it is very moisturizing, it keeps my complexion balanced(my skin look more radiant and smooth), since using this my face has been clear from pimples :)and since i been using it it has helped fade my acne scars.I love this facial wash because i can use it as a moisturizer  (as a moisturizer it is a too greasy for me maybe i will try it in the winter)  or I could wash it off and follow up with a moisturizer, it removes eye make or foundation effortless, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural so I know will nourish my skin and keep away break outs. It is so creamy and rich with a slight natural fruit  aroma another thing I really love is this 8oz bottle will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need a full pump because of the thick consistency whether you wet your face or not.AS LONG AS THEY KEEP MAKING THIS PRODUCT I WILL BE A LOYAL CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years, and I love it. I find it to be the only thing that is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin. I usually buy it from Whole Foods, but since they stopped carrying this line, I&#x27;ve been forced to find it elsewhere. I don&#x27;t recommend buying it from this seller, because I don&#x27;t believe these are real Earth Science products. This cleanser isn&#x27;t supposed to have any fragrance, but the one I received had a very heavy, perfume-y fragrance that is pretty disgusting. It also didn&#x27;t feel the same on my skin, it was too harsh and made my skin feel dry. I used it at night and the next morning I woke up and my face had broken out, which tells me it&#x27;s definitely not the same product that I&#x27;ve been using.  Also the pump was broken and I had to unscrew it just to get some of the cleanser out. While I recommend this particular cleanser, as well as their entire line of products, I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing it from this seller. I would suggest finding it in a store, that way you can be sure you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> Current user of product. Safe and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product to wash my face.  The texture is creamy, not foamy.  It does not foam.  Whether it does a great job of cleaning all by itself, I can&#x27;t really say because I&#x27;m in the habit of removing a lot of my makeup with an olive oil/tea tree oil mix before I shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I highly reommend this! Great for sensitive &amp; dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser that removes all of your foundation.  Leaves your skin clean and soft, never dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is nice and gentle, but it doesn&#x27;t cleanse as much as I would like. It&#x27;s advertised to be able to remove makeup, but I have found that I have to use a makeup remover before I use this. The good aspects of the cleanser are that it has not irritated my sensitive skin, the smell is pleasant, and it does leave my skin soft, but for removing cosmetic residue, especially water proof or other long wear makeup, this product will not work for that,unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s super creamy and I even use it to remove eye make up.  It&#x27;s so creamy and so gentle it&#x27;s by far in my opinion the best cleanser out there particularly for semi to dry skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this natural cleanser! It is gentle on my sensitive skin and works well to clean the makeup away.</li>
            <li> Tried this on a whim. Cleans well and does not dry out your skin, nor does it leave an oily residue. Nice.</li>
            <li> gentle and hydrating; excellent for dry, aging skin</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and I have been looking for these kind of make up cleaning stuff.  It works great and not damage my skin.  I love this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim at Whole Foods: I wish I&#x27;d tried it sooner! After two days of use I have noticed that my skin is not as dry and tight after washing, and blackheads are fading quickly! Old blemishes are healing faster, too. So thrilled. I use it this way: rinse skin with lukewarm water, apply cleanser, rubbing in circular motion all over the face and neck. Then use a wet washcloth to lightly exfoliate and rinse at the same time, followed by a splash of water. I have been using the sweet almond oil moisturizer also by Earth Science for several years now, since I read a skincare specialist recommend almond oil for skin brightening effects. Love it too!</li>
