            <li>The sink/faucet adaptor works great</li>
            <li>happy with this</li>
            <li>But all in all this is a great idea for washing hair and if it had been longer, would have worked well to use in bathtub.</li>
            <li>It was great, just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It was great for my friend&#x27;s dog</li>

            <li>To be able to wash my hair in the sink would be marvelous.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!The quality very good</li>
            <li>The hose is 48 inches, a good length for supplying water to all corners of the sink.  </li>
            <li>It would be good also for washing</li>
            <li>Hose arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that would be a good thing - preventing leaks, but</li>

            <li>It stays on my faucet and it has good water flow/pressure.</li>
            <li>The connector fit perfectly and didn&#x27;t leak!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>i got this for my mom to make it easy for her to wash and rinse her hair very handy</li>
            <li>I brought this set for my brother-in-law, so he can start his own business.</li>
            <li>, however it worked on any sink , I use it for wash my Cat , it is handy tool</li>
            <li>great dogs love this more then before then with the cup</li>
            <li>and then the top portion has come undone...cheap and would have paid more for a more substantial one that would have lasted!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and its functional too.</li>
            <li>I needed to wash my 2 year old daughters hair and this is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>I tried to replace it, fix it, do whatever I could to get it to work, but it is a very cheaply made piece of plastic that just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Attaches to the faucet as easily as it says it will and just a handy item to have around any home.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit most faucets!</li>
            <li>I like this items very much!!!</li>
            <li>If it stayed on better, it would be a convenient product.</li>
            <li>this is ok</li>
            <li>I was all dressed up in my bib, a product I like better and better.  </li>
            <li>So much better than a cup</li>
            <li>and he enjoys it much better.</li>
            <li>so my mom could sit but better than nothing</li>
            <li>And so fare he love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of faucet it would fit.</li>
            <li>We bought this in hopes of being able to bathe our dog with ease in the tub.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just need a better place to put it.</li>
            <li>My daughters Barbie dolls have better quality than this.</li>
            <li>but with some fixing it&#x27;s usable. :)</li>
            <li>Granted, I use this this item more often than not.</li>
            <li>It now looks cute and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The seller should have mentioned the maximum fitting diameter for the fitting.</li>
            <li>This product was just okay.  </li>
            <li>It covers more area.</li>
            <li>We use it to bathe our dogs and it works better than a pitcher to rinse them.</li>
            <li>I read that it fits \\&quot;most\\&quot; tub faucets, I could never see it fitting a tub faucet.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to use it in tub when bathing the dog.</li>
            <li>It is designed to fit this type of a faucet!</li>
            <li>it really works great very easy to hook up and use very good quality also real easy to clean and store until further use</li>
            <li>It is easy to connect to the faucet and very easy to disconnect.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>How excited I was to be receiving this \\&quot;faucet-to-shower\\&quot; converter!  </li>
            <li>It looks cheap but OK for the price paid.</li>
            <li>It installs in seconds and comes off easily as well.  </li>
            <li>Easy and efficient, a \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I think of that\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>and even though it kind of leaks it still has good water pressure and works well enough to keep.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>Once attached it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to give the dog a bath, and it did fine.</li>
            <li>Also as a bonus, this is little guy is great for cleaning the shower walls and the kitchen sink to boot!</li>
            <li>great concept, too short a hose...</li>
            <li>Got this product primarily for bathing our chihuahua in the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li>cheap made.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I am suspicious of those 5star reviews, because this didn&#x27;t fit on ANY faucet in this house.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit in any of my faucets: kitchen, bathroom, outdoor.</li>
            <li>The item is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>so I would probably give it the lowest rating even if it did fit the faucets.  </li>
            <li>The faucet attachment fit on a utility sink in our laundry room without any problems.  </li>
            <li>item is made out of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>the hole didn&#x27;t fit my faucet at all.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too rigid &amp; way cheap</li>
            <li>cheap and doesn&#x27;t stay connected to faucet.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit my faucet, gave to my sis</li>
            <li>this one fit.  </li>
            <li>Would return it if it wouldnt be more effort that its worth.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit the faucet</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this in my laundry sink, but the adapter doesn&#x27;t fit all faucet nozzles.</li>
            <li>Made out of cheap plastic and made in China.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my faucet.....</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit on my faucet.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my sink faucet</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my faucet</li>
            <li>but I decided to be cheap</li>
            <li>We have a square one and it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I felt so refreshed after that mini-shower; I finally knew how great my dog feels after his showers.</li>
            <li>Try as I would, I could not put the spray part on to head so that it fit and wouldn&#x27;t spray the floor,</li>
            <li>Using a pitcher is more time consuming and the temp isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>This hose attachment is very useful, as I can push the faucet to the side and aim the spray wherever I need it.</li>
            <li>I have small foster dogs, and this is perfect in helping me wash them in the sink.</li>
            <li>This gadget is great when you have to leave  conditioner in your hair long after you&#x27;re finished  showering.  </li>
            <li>It seemed a simple solution at a good price and it works fine although there is just a bit of water leakage around the connector.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheaply made  </li>
            <li>The ONLY GOOD thing I can say about this item is that it fit over the utility sink faucet.</li>
            <li>Use this to clean my permanent furnace filters.</li>
            <li>It looked like something from the dollar store and didn&#x27;t fit any of my faucets, but at $8, it wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed when I got it, because it was no where close to fitting.</li>
            <li>It was fine the first month I bought it</li>
            <li>I can quickly attach the hose to my laundry tub in the garage and give my 18 lb.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>It didnt slip off while using it, and it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>then it broke as the front plastic on the head get lose and had to fix it with super glue</li>
            <li>If you put the water pressure on too high it will pop off; but we are able to get adequate pressure while keeping the tube in place.</li>
            <li>it dosen&#x27;t look very pretty</li>
            <li>The faucet fitting is of better material but will not fit anything more than 2cm in diameter.</li>
            <li>its a pretty cheap product</li>
            <li>After a few moments of spraying, the hose would fly off.  </li>
            <li>Among the items that absorbed some of this water was a package of storage boxes I just bought from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not think it was worth returning.</li>
            <li>Hooked it up to my sink faucet, turned on the water, and the spray section, where the water comes out, popped right out.  </li>
            <li>Fits neatly on the faucet and looks right.</li>
            <li>And the hose is is just the right length.</li>
            <li>Im sure it would fit a sink faucet as long as it is a newer one</li>
            <li>Great idea but did not fit over my faucet!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>While washing my dog, the fitting came off the faucet multiple times.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to all friends and family members who are interested in using this for their pets or for themselves.</li>
            <li>There are 257 apartments in my building, and each has  kitchen and bathroom faucets exactly like mine.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my years of buying from Amazon, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to return something.</li>
            <li>The Lowes guy knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Fits the faucet but blows off with any pressure or hot water.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took some effort but is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Also, pushing it on much further than they are will also make it work better.</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to order it instead of listening to those low star</li>
            <li>The first time we used it the sprinkler head fell off.  </li>
            <li>This product works well until you turn on the hot water and then every time it falls off, Bought this item so my mother in law could wash her hair without bending over the tub</li>
            <li>Should have sent it back, but I figured some one in the family might be able to use it.,</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>I gave it only 4 stars because I feel they could have used a slightly better hose on the product; not one that wants to kink all of the time.</li>
            <li>Do not buy waste of money made soooooo cheap and doesn&#x27;t even  fit to my  kitchen sink !</li>
            <li>Please look for one that has threads to screw on to a faucet or that has positive reviews on attaching to bathroom or kitchen faucets.</li>
            <li>I live in apt and have had problems in the past finding a kitchen sink hose that will fit on them.  </li>
            <li>Within a month, I had turned all my showers into closets (I put all my rare, collectable Beanie Babies in my new closet), and I bought a Faucet-to-Shower Converter for all of the faucets in the house.</li>
            <li>I think people need to wet the attachment a bit first, then it will slide on much better.</li>
            <li>I use this in the kitchen for washing large pots and pans, since my kitchen sink doesn&#x27;t have one built in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would certainly recommend it to anyone who has a sink without a spray attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wish the shower head was done better as it is cheap plastic that will not last long</li>
            <li>Cost a few dollars more than this, however, works SO much better and will last a LOT longer because it is a much higher quality item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, I grouped it with some other items for free shipping to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit any faucet very well (our faucets are all standard); fell off or became a geyser as soon as the water was turned on.</li>
            <li>If anyone out there is looking for a reasonably priced item to give them this capability - then I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Even if it fit over the tap, the hose is too short.</li>
            <li>Item is cheap and pops off the spigot unless water pressure on low.</li>
            <li>I have to leave it running the whole time</li>
            <li>Item is very cheaplyh constructed, made in china which produces inferior products.  </li>
            <li>Attaches to faucet through a rubber coupling that fits most sinks.</li>
            <li>This device didn&#x27;t fit any of my current faucets.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit any of the 3 different faucets</li>
            <li>Just fold it and its convenient for a fast wash and go</li>
            <li>It is a cheap flimsy plastic hose that doesn&#x27;t even unravel properly</li>
            <li>I returned it as a defective item...because it really is.</li>
            <li>Save your money and go to a hardware store to buy a real faucet attachment.</li>
            <li>I worry about where to store it, mold, leakage, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>I spent more time readjusting the faucets after I had to shut them and reattach the hose.  </li>
            <li>My cats are much happier taking baths now.</li>
            <li>so I figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out of much money.  </li>
            <li>is very flexible and</li>
            <li>I thought this item worked VERY well.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with it, and it looks and feels very durable.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and looks like materials were probably only about 10 cents.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much pressure for this to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually used some Zebra pattern duct tape to secure the perimeter of the troublesome areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The plastic tube material is cheap and of the same material as disposable drinking straws.</li>
            <li>we have found this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of getting it ready to return.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>you do need one of the old style faucets from years ago for it to fit right properly.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get this to fit on faucet high enough to try to clamp or wire it on.  </li>
            <li>It still makes it a whole lot easier to wet down or rinse a soapy dog who isn&#x27;t all that happy about getting a bath to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Going by the material and quality, this product is realistically not worth more than a dollar or two.</li>
            <li>If you run HOT watter at too high of pressure through it, the plastic will get soft and it will come off.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I wish it had a quick spray on/off.  </li>
            <li>So I took a quick shower (only washing my hair)</li>
            <li>It is a high quality item</li>
            <li>If water pressure is too high, the faucet cover starts to spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not have high expectations.  </li>
            <li>Then the part that attaches to the faucet came off when the water pressure was to high...</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to help me bathe my little Yorkie Terriers. :)</li>
            <li>Other residents have converter hoses and water purifiers that are easily attached to their faucets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap and works as expected.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>
            <li>Like the oblong shape better than the round head I used to have.</li>
            <li>This falls right off the faucet, and when I finally pushed it up and used a rubber band to hold it in place, it backed up my faucet which is now leaking.   </li>
            <li>I had the shampoo out, right next to my dishwashing detergent.  </li>
            <li>this is fine for occasional use, but if I had to use it regularly I would probably pick something else.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to use it to for my new born.</li>
            <li>The seller should specify that its mainly for old faucets, it doesn&#x27;t work with newer wider versions.</li>
            <li>the hose is made of cheap plastic and the connector did not fit in my faucet which is pretty standard faucet  </li>
            <li>Grill certainly won&#x27;t snap back in place if it is a snap fastener.</li>
            <li>We have an old 1940s tub</li>
            <li>All day, at work, I was fixed on that sink shower.</li>
            <li>came early , easy to use for small dog bathing</li>
            <li>I read all of the negative reviews, however I ordered this item anyway - partially because I didn&#x27;t see many other options available out there.</li>
            <li>From the first try it didnt stay on faucet, it keeps slipping.</li>
            <li>This shower converter doesn&#x27;t fit my round sink faucet or the traditional bath tub faucet.</li>
            <li>The only downside to it is that the part that fits over the faucet comes off if you turn the pressure up too high as it only slips on.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit ANY faucet,,, pretty much useless,,, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>This barely fits over my thumb, there is no way to put it on a kitchen or bathroom faucet, nevermond a bathtub faucet.  </li>
            <li>It does not fit my standard sink nor does it appear to be flexible enough to fit anything else.  </li>
            <li>should be an old smaller one.</li>
            <li>Wow only hits the tip of the iceberg.</li>
            <li>and though the service is great - ontime delivery and follow up - it is a useless product, hands down.</li>
            <li>Was a very small opening to fit onto the faucet and it would not go on to the kitchen faucet</li>
            <li>I bought it to attach to a utility sink to bathe my two small Chihuahuas, and during the first use, pinprick holes developed in the hose and it started gushing water from the sides of the hose itself.  </li>
            <li>My wife thinks I&#x27;m a little bit loony now, but I am saving so much water, plus we can all shower in our clothes now!</li>
            <li>The fitting is so rigid it won&#x27;t flex enough to fit onto faucet thus making this product totally worthless.</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t find any faucets that are less than 2cm anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li>Not pleased, very cheap and did not fit my sink.</li>
            <li>My kitchen has a pretty small sink, and it&#x27;s often hard to fit big pans in under the faucet to rinse them.</li>
            <li>Flat spray head came completely off with only moderate water pressure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comical really, if they had cut anymore corners at all, it would not have worked out of the box , much less, the two usages I got out of it before I threw it away...</li>
            <li>Only fastener I can imagine is that whole grill snaps in but a snap is undecernable or less than 1/8th inch.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The sink/faucet adaptor works great</li>
            <li> happy with this</li>
            <li> But all in all this is a great idea for washing hair and if it had been longer, would have worked well to use in bathtub.</li>
            <li> It was great, just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It was great for my friend&#x27;s dog</li>
            <li> I started out using this product for my dog and it always worked great.</li>
            <li> Good quality too, i&#x27;ve had mine for two years and its still in great condition.</li>
            <li> To be able to wash my hair in the sink would be marvelous.  </li>
            <li> I love it!!!The quality very good</li>
            <li> The hose is 48 inches, a good length for supplying water to all corners of the sink.  </li>
            <li> It would be good also for washing</li>
            <li> Hose arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that would be a good thing - preventing leaks, but</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shower head has a good number of holes for</li>
            <li> It stays on my faucet and it has good water flow/pressure.</li>
            <li> The connector fit perfectly and didn&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li> full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, Great buy!</li>

            <li> Good product - I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> i got this for my mom to make it easy for her to wash and rinse her hair very handy</li>
            <li> I brought this set for my brother-in-law, so he can start his own business.</li>
            <li> , however it worked on any sink , I use it for wash my Cat , it is handy tool</li>
            <li> great dogs love this more then before then with the cup</li>
            <li> and then the top portion has come undone...cheap and would have paid more for a more substantial one that would have lasted!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and its functional too.</li>
            <li> I needed to wash my 2 year old daughters hair and this is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I tried to replace it, fix it, do whatever I could to get it to work, but it is a very cheaply made piece of plastic that just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Attaches to the faucet as easily as it says it will and just a handy item to have around any home.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit most faucets!</li>
            <li> I like this items very much!!!</li>
            <li> If it stayed on better, it would be a convenient product.</li>
            <li> this is ok</li>
            <li> I was all dressed up in my bib, a product I like better and better.  </li>
            <li> So much better than a cup</li>
            <li> and he enjoys it much better.</li>
            <li> so my mom could sit but better than nothing</li>
            <li> And so fare he love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of faucet it would fit.</li>
            <li> We bought this in hopes of being able to bathe our dog with ease in the tub.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just need a better place to put it.</li>
            <li> My daughters Barbie dolls have better quality than this.</li>
            <li> but with some fixing it&#x27;s usable. :)</li>
            <li> Granted, I use this this item more often than not.</li>
            <li> It now looks cute and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The seller should have mentioned the maximum fitting diameter for the fitting.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay.  </li>
            <li> It covers more area.</li>
            <li> We use it to bathe our dogs and it works better than a pitcher to rinse them.</li>
            <li> I read that it fits \\&quot;most\\&quot; tub faucets, I could never see it fitting a tub faucet.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to use it in tub when bathing the dog.</li>
            <li> It is designed to fit this type of a faucet!</li>
            <li> it really works great very easy to hook up and use very good quality also real easy to clean and store until further use</li>
            <li> It is easy to connect to the faucet and very easy to disconnect.</li>
            <li> and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> How excited I was to be receiving this \\&quot;faucet-to-shower\\&quot; converter!  </li>
            <li> It looks cheap but OK for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It installs in seconds and comes off easily as well.  </li>
            <li> Easy and efficient, a \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I think of that\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> and even though it kind of leaks it still has good water pressure and works well enough to keep.</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> Once attached it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to give the dog a bath, and it did fine.</li>
            <li> Also as a bonus, this is little guy is great for cleaning the shower walls and the kitchen sink to boot!</li>
            <li> great concept, too short a hose...</li>
            <li> Got this product primarily for bathing our chihuahua in the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> cheap made.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I am suspicious of those 5star reviews, because this didn&#x27;t fit on ANY faucet in this house.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit in any of my faucets: kitchen, bathroom, outdoor.</li>
            <li> The item is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> so I would probably give it the lowest rating even if it did fit the faucets.  </li>
            <li> The faucet attachment fit on a utility sink in our laundry room without any problems.  </li>
            <li> item is made out of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> the hole didn&#x27;t fit my faucet at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too rigid &amp; way cheap</li>
            <li> cheap and doesn&#x27;t stay connected to faucet.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit my faucet, gave to my sis</li>
            <li> this one fit.  </li>
            <li> Would return it if it wouldnt be more effort that its worth.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the faucet</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this in my laundry sink, but the adapter doesn&#x27;t fit all faucet nozzles.</li>
            <li> Made out of cheap plastic and made in China.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my faucet.....</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit on my faucet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my sink faucet</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my faucet</li>
            <li> but I decided to be cheap</li>
            <li> We have a square one and it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I felt so refreshed after that mini-shower; I finally knew how great my dog feels after his showers.</li>
            <li> Try as I would, I could not put the spray part on to head so that it fit and wouldn&#x27;t spray the floor,</li>
            <li> Using a pitcher is more time consuming and the temp isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> This hose attachment is very useful, as I can push the faucet to the side and aim the spray wherever I need it.</li>
            <li> I have small foster dogs, and this is perfect in helping me wash them in the sink.</li>
            <li> This gadget is great when you have to leave  conditioner in your hair long after you&#x27;re finished  showering.  </li>
            <li> It seemed a simple solution at a good price and it works fine although there is just a bit of water leakage around the connector.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheaply made  </li>
            <li> The ONLY GOOD thing I can say about this item is that it fit over the utility sink faucet.</li>
            <li> Use this to clean my permanent furnace filters.</li>
            <li> It looked like something from the dollar store and didn&#x27;t fit any of my faucets, but at $8, it wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed when I got it, because it was no where close to fitting.</li>
            <li> It was fine the first month I bought it</li>
            <li> I can quickly attach the hose to my laundry tub in the garage and give my 18 lb.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> It didnt slip off while using it, and it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> then it broke as the front plastic on the head get lose and had to fix it with super glue</li>
            <li> If you put the water pressure on too high it will pop off; but we are able to get adequate pressure while keeping the tube in place.</li>
            <li> it dosen&#x27;t look very pretty</li>
            <li> The faucet fitting is of better material but will not fit anything more than 2cm in diameter.</li>
            <li> its a pretty cheap product</li>
            <li> After a few moments of spraying, the hose would fly off.  </li>
            <li> Among the items that absorbed some of this water was a package of storage boxes I just bought from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not think it was worth returning.</li>
            <li> Hooked it up to my sink faucet, turned on the water, and the spray section, where the water comes out, popped right out.  </li>
            <li> Fits neatly on the faucet and looks right.</li>
            <li> And the hose is is just the right length.</li>
            <li> Im sure it would fit a sink faucet as long as it is a newer one</li>
            <li> Great idea but did not fit over my faucet!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> While washing my dog, the fitting came off the faucet multiple times.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to all friends and family members who are interested in using this for their pets or for themselves.</li>
            <li> There are 257 apartments in my building, and each has  kitchen and bathroom faucets exactly like mine.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my years of buying from Amazon, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to return something.</li>
            <li> The Lowes guy knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Fits the faucet but blows off with any pressure or hot water.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took some effort but is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Also, pushing it on much further than they are will also make it work better.</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to order it instead of listening to those low star</li>
            <li> The first time we used it the sprinkler head fell off.  </li>
            <li> This product works well until you turn on the hot water and then every time it falls off, Bought this item so my mother in law could wash her hair without bending over the tub</li>
            <li> Should have sent it back, but I figured some one in the family might be able to use it.,</li>
            <li> Reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> I gave it only 4 stars because I feel they could have used a slightly better hose on the product; not one that wants to kink all of the time.</li>
            <li> Do not buy waste of money made soooooo cheap and doesn&#x27;t even  fit to my  kitchen sink !</li>
            <li> Please look for one that has threads to screw on to a faucet or that has positive reviews on attaching to bathroom or kitchen faucets.</li>
            <li> I live in apt and have had problems in the past finding a kitchen sink hose that will fit on them.  </li>
            <li> Within a month, I had turned all my showers into closets (I put all my rare, collectable Beanie Babies in my new closet), and I bought a Faucet-to-Shower Converter for all of the faucets in the house.</li>
            <li> I think people need to wet the attachment a bit first, then it will slide on much better.</li>
            <li> I use this in the kitchen for washing large pots and pans, since my kitchen sink doesn&#x27;t have one built in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would certainly recommend it to anyone who has a sink without a spray attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wish the shower head was done better as it is cheap plastic that will not last long</li>
            <li> Cost a few dollars more than this, however, works SO much better and will last a LOT longer because it is a much higher quality item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, I grouped it with some other items for free shipping to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any faucet very well (our faucets are all standard); fell off or became a geyser as soon as the water was turned on.</li>
            <li> If anyone out there is looking for a reasonably priced item to give them this capability - then I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Even if it fit over the tap, the hose is too short.</li>
            <li> Item is cheap and pops off the spigot unless water pressure on low.</li>
            <li> I have to leave it running the whole time</li>
            <li> Item is very cheaplyh constructed, made in china which produces inferior products.  </li>
            <li> Attaches to faucet through a rubber coupling that fits most sinks.</li>
            <li> This device didn&#x27;t fit any of my current faucets.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit any of the 3 different faucets</li>
            <li> Just fold it and its convenient for a fast wash and go</li>
            <li> It is a cheap flimsy plastic hose that doesn&#x27;t even unravel properly</li>
            <li> I returned it as a defective item...because it really is.</li>
            <li> Save your money and go to a hardware store to buy a real faucet attachment.</li>
            <li> I worry about where to store it, mold, leakage, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> I spent more time readjusting the faucets after I had to shut them and reattach the hose.  </li>
            <li> My cats are much happier taking baths now.</li>
            <li> so I figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out of much money.  </li>
            <li> is very flexible and</li>
            <li> I thought this item worked VERY well.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with it, and it looks and feels very durable.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and looks like materials were probably only about 10 cents.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much pressure for this to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually used some Zebra pattern duct tape to secure the perimeter of the troublesome areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The plastic tube material is cheap and of the same material as disposable drinking straws.</li>
            <li> we have found this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of getting it ready to return.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> you do need one of the old style faucets from years ago for it to fit right properly.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get this to fit on faucet high enough to try to clamp or wire it on.  </li>
            <li> It still makes it a whole lot easier to wet down or rinse a soapy dog who isn&#x27;t all that happy about getting a bath to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Going by the material and quality, this product is realistically not worth more than a dollar or two.</li>
            <li> If you run HOT watter at too high of pressure through it, the plastic will get soft and it will come off.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I wish it had a quick spray on/off.  </li>
            <li> So I took a quick shower (only washing my hair)</li>
            <li> It is a high quality item</li>
            <li> If water pressure is too high, the faucet cover starts to spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have high expectations.  </li>
            <li> Then the part that attaches to the faucet came off when the water pressure was to high...</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to help me bathe my little Yorkie Terriers. :)</li>
            <li> Other residents have converter hoses and water purifiers that are easily attached to their faucets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>
            <li> Like the oblong shape better than the round head I used to have.</li>
            <li> This falls right off the faucet, and when I finally pushed it up and used a rubber band to hold it in place, it backed up my faucet which is now leaking.   </li>
            <li> I had the shampoo out, right next to my dishwashing detergent.  </li>
            <li> this is fine for occasional use, but if I had to use it regularly I would probably pick something else.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use it to for my new born.</li>
            <li> The seller should specify that its mainly for old faucets, it doesn&#x27;t work with newer wider versions.</li>
            <li> the hose is made of cheap plastic and the connector did not fit in my faucet which is pretty standard faucet  </li>
            <li> Grill certainly won&#x27;t snap back in place if it is a snap fastener.</li>
            <li> We have an old 1940s tub</li>
            <li> All day, at work, I was fixed on that sink shower.</li>
            <li> came early , easy to use for small dog bathing</li>
            <li> I read all of the negative reviews, however I ordered this item anyway - partially because I didn&#x27;t see many other options available out there.</li>
            <li> From the first try it didnt stay on faucet, it keeps slipping.</li>
            <li> This shower converter doesn&#x27;t fit my round sink faucet or the traditional bath tub faucet.</li>
            <li> The only downside to it is that the part that fits over the faucet comes off if you turn the pressure up too high as it only slips on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit ANY faucet,,, pretty much useless,,, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This barely fits over my thumb, there is no way to put it on a kitchen or bathroom faucet, nevermond a bathtub faucet.  </li>
            <li> It does not fit my standard sink nor does it appear to be flexible enough to fit anything else.  </li>
            <li> should be an old smaller one.</li>
            <li> Wow only hits the tip of the iceberg.</li>
            <li> and though the service is great - ontime delivery and follow up - it is a useless product, hands down.</li>
            <li> Was a very small opening to fit onto the faucet and it would not go on to the kitchen faucet</li>
            <li> I bought it to attach to a utility sink to bathe my two small Chihuahuas, and during the first use, pinprick holes developed in the hose and it started gushing water from the sides of the hose itself.  </li>
            <li> My wife thinks I&#x27;m a little bit loony now, but I am saving so much water, plus we can all shower in our clothes now!</li>
            <li> The fitting is so rigid it won&#x27;t flex enough to fit onto faucet thus making this product totally worthless.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t find any faucets that are less than 2cm anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li> Not pleased, very cheap and did not fit my sink.</li>
            <li> My kitchen has a pretty small sink, and it&#x27;s often hard to fit big pans in under the faucet to rinse them.</li>
            <li> Flat spray head came completely off with only moderate water pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comical really, if they had cut anymore corners at all, it would not have worked out of the box , much less, the two usages I got out of it before I threw it away...</li>
            <li> Only fastener I can imagine is that whole grill snaps in but a snap is undecernable or less than 1/8th inch.  </li>
            <li> First, the flat trace on the tube resulted from folded packing couldn&#x27;t be recovered after few times hot water flush due to the tube material feature; Next, in 3 days, the spray cap fell off the showerhead under water pressure; Finally, since the cap was not attached to the head with thread but push-in and the overlaid surface was too narrow to use glue (must be unwashable and no harm to skin), I trashed it.</li>
            <li> the whole was just too small or the plastic not flexible enough to accommodate my faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use only on a Kitchen Faucet because of the back pressure developed by the narrow hose.</li>
            <li> So i had to returned it after few more trails which are not successful.</li>
            <li> It probably would fit any standard faucet, mine are just weird.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used to because I&#x27;m not steady enough on my feet!</li>
            <li> It is ok the hose could be longer because it wouldn&#x27;t stay on faucet being so short short not to bad if your in a bind</li>
            <li> the opening is too small for just normal faucets</li>
            <li> Given the ratings left by other</li>
            <li> It is all I was looking for and the price was so low compared the other products I have been looking at.</li>
            <li> Never had a disconnect when using cold water on high or hot water on medium pressure.</li>
            <li> Tough to install and does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I could still use it, but I didn&#x27;t like that it was now a single stream instead of shower stream.</li>
            <li> The band either slipped off the faucet or water would moderately shoot out of the band causing it to castigate everywhere and making my bathroom a mess.  </li>
            <li> Seems unless you use little water pressure, the shower head always faces up and will spray water outside the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Hose</li>
            <li> then the band rusted and all heck broke loose!  </li>
            <li> When I bought this I knew it was risk considering many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> But too bad I can&#x27;t use the second one, cause even if it did fit it can&#x27;t handle a lot of water pressure.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it works just as expected and</li>
            <li> Not very well made.  </li>
            <li> It was not at all what I wanted or expected.</li>
            <li> Not to worry it can be fixed, and I dont mean just reataching these items.</li>
            <li> After searching amazon, google, and other sites....</li>
            <li> (look at picture to see how small it is, does not expand bigger)</li>
            <li> The tube is also too small for the flow, even on very low flow.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived fast; unfortunately, it does not work with my faucets.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not like it takes that long to soap up and rinse a small dog.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews are totally correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what it costs, this is not worth one penny.</li>
            <li> Not worth 9 bucks or even a penny.</li>
            <li> Save yourself time and just go down to Lowe&#x27;s, they carry a selection of these converters.</li>
            <li> Extremely flimsy, and the connector will not fit over the faucet.</li>
            <li> Did NOT fit my utility sink nor any other sink in my house.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews on this and decided to buy it anyways.</li>
            <li> This is a completely worth piece of junk--either poorly designed or poorly made.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering buying a utility sink in order to wash my dog, but this little attachment did the trick, no need to spend $100.00 on a bigger sink</li>
            <li> It was tight getting it on</li>
            <li> Had a really tight seal on the suction cup part.</li>
            <li> Grill flew off  hose extension upon just a little water pressure.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved hundred not having to take her to the DIY dog wash down the street!</li>
            <li> Product looks very cheap, and performed very bad.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of breaking my back in the tub.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Did not fit any of my faucets</li>
            <li> Nine dollars seems a bit much to waste, though.</li>
            <li> The converter did not fit my faucet.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have had the trouble and expense of returning it.</li>
            <li> Does not fit any of my faucets.</li>
            <li> The tube is so narrow it would take you all day to rinse an egg.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this thing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Faucet adapter did not fit bathroom faucet, no clip to hold adapter to faucet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> no fit whit my sink or shower , the water is everywhere ,</li>
            <li> , after a few uses the thing just started falling apart.</li>
            <li> she is 87 years old, so needless to say she is still bending over the tub looking for some way to connect it without falling off when water is turned on</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy waste of money</li>
            <li> It did not fit any faucet in my house.</li>
            <li> Did not fit and faucet in my home😣  </li>
            <li> I have some trouble mounting it to the faucet</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> This is made for a round nozzle fossil.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a waste to return</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a disappointment because of its poor quality, but with a quick fix it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive for me to return than to just forget about this so too bad it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The L connector does not fit the kitchen sink faucet, opening is too small.</li>
            <li> The connector slides out with very little water pressure and causes sprays of water.</li>
            <li> i bought it to wash my small dog</li>
            <li> Waste of money !</li>
            <li> Coupling is too small for bathtubs</li>
            <li> it was way too small.</li>
            <li> the product to attach and four bathrooms and a kitchen sink later, I&#x27;m angry.</li>
            <li> The attachment is too small.</li>
            <li> It fits a small faucet so I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this, what a waste!</li>
            <li> Will not adhere to a normal fixture thereby making it impossible to do its job.  </li>
            <li> It is way too small and the rubber is hard, not pliable at all.  </li>
            <li> I should of went with the negative reviews and avoided this</li>
            <li> One day, I woke up a bit late and was going to be late for work if I took a shower.</li>
            <li> This faucet was received broken, I mean seriously???</li>
            <li> However, I couldn&#x27;t just ignore my daily shower, because I would smell bad all day.</li>
            <li> Not a good product and not good quality either.</li>
            <li> This Product SUCKS!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the rubber flange would not fit over it, rendering this product completely useless for our intentions.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 by accident and one of them already  came broken.</li>
            <li> It came broken in packet.</li>
            <li> The hose is thin and came kinked.</li>
            <li> This is total crap.</li>
            <li> This item could not be made any worse yet still work...</li>
            <li> shower head was broken between head and hose when I received it and the shipping box was not damaged therefore it was broken when it was packaged.</li>
            <li> I guess I was a little foolish, however I thought maybe it couldn&#x27;t be as bad as they said.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality rubber, and poor fabrication.  </li>
            <li> Duh!  Amazon!  </li>
            <li> No more cricked neck muscles!!!</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> but it was the wrong item for me to order</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>

            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It is therefore useless for my needs.</li>
            <li> The connection to the hose from the faucet cover is very poor.</li>
            <li> This is very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> a had bressels, this is very poor</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t reach her from the sink faucet.  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great concept, too short a hose... i bought it to wash my small dog but it doesn&#x27;t reach her from the sink faucet.  :(</li>
            <li> I have small foster dogs, and this is perfect in helping me wash them in the sink. AA++</li>
            <li> Cheap and works as expected.</li>
            <li> My kitchen has a pretty small sink, and it&#x27;s often hard to fit big pans in under the faucet to rinse them. This hose attachment is very useful, as I can push the faucet to the side and aim the spray wherever I need it. It fits snugly on my standard faucet (no leaks) and attaches and detaches easily enough.</li>
            <li> As a child I remember my mother always having one of these hoses to shampoo our hair.  I have looked and looked to no avail. Finally hit me...Duh!  Amazon!  It works like a charm.  It is 100% what I wanted.    Thanks!</li>
            <li> Got this product primarily for bathing our chihuahua in the kitchen sink. I have to say that it works just as expected and we are getting that bath done alot quicker and easier than before!  If anyone out there is looking for a reasonably priced item to give them this capability - then I highly recommend it!  DCK</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my dogs in my utility sink. I was tired of breaking my back in the tub.Those fancy pet sprayers can cost up to $30, this is such a money saver!! Good quality too, i&#x27;ve had mine for two years and its still in great condition.</li>
            <li> cheap made. doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> What a product!  I was seriously considering buying a utility sink in order to wash my dog, but this little attachment did the trick, no need to spend $100.00 on a bigger sink</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!  It is perfect for my infant bath that fits in the sink.  It is wonderful for rising him off and he loves taking a bath even more!</li>
            <li> Extremely flimsy, and the connector will not fit over the faucet. Totally useless. I bought this with the intention of using it to wash the dog. Even if it fit over the tap, the hose is too short. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in  hopes that it will work for bathing my baby. The item arrived fast; unfortunately, it does not work with my faucets. The seller should specify that its mainly for old faucets, it doesn&#x27;t work with newer wider versions. It is more expensive for me to return than to just forget about this so too bad it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Item is cheap and pops off the spigot unless water pressure on low. However,for the price, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I can quickly attach the hose to my laundry tub in the garage and give my 18 lb. miniature Labradoodle a bath.  It doesn&#x27;t leak and I like the spray it puts out.  I only gave it 4 stars because I wish it had a quick spray on/off.  I have to leave it running the whole time but it&#x27;s not like it takes that long to soap up and rinse a small dog.  It&#x27;s great for the money.</li>
            <li> Low quality plastic. Front part ripped apart after couple of months.</li>
            <li> Flat spray head came completely off with only moderate water pressure. Then the hose came off of the faucet.  I&#x27;ve used this type of converter before and know what to expect...and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Item is very cheaplyh constructed, made in china which produces inferior products.  The handle, which there is none, the pix is deceiving.</li>
            <li> I ordered this faucet to shower converter to use on the faucet of the laundry room tub where we bathe our two Mini Dachshunds.  It seemed a simple solution at a good price and it works fine although there is just a bit of water leakage around the connector.  It still makes it a whole lot easier to wet down or rinse a soapy dog who isn&#x27;t all that happy about getting a bath to begin with.  The hose is 48 inches, a good length for supplying water to all corners of the sink.  It would be good also for washing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 7/4/12 - The hose part comes off of the part that connects to the faucet.  I&#x27;ve been putting it back on, but unless I keep the water on low it keeps coming off again.  Not very well made.  I&#x27;m changing my rating from 4 stars to 2.</li>
            <li> Not pleased, very cheap and did not fit my sink. I ordered 2 by accident and one of them already  came broken. But too bad I can&#x27;t use the second one, cause even if it did fit it can&#x27;t handle a lot of water pressure. Waste of money !</li>
            <li> While washing my dog, the fitting came off the faucet multiple times.  If it stayed on better, it would be a convenient product.</li>
            <li> This falls right off the faucet, and when I finally pushed it up and used a rubber band to hold it in place, it backed up my faucet which is now leaking.   I am suspicious of those 5star reviews, because this didn&#x27;t fit on ANY faucet in this house. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> No frills, plastic shower head.  Attaches to faucet through a rubber coupling that fits most sinks. Coupling is too small for bathtubs however, you&#x27;ll need some sort of aerator adapter to make it work with bathtub faucets.</li>
            <li> The shower head piece at the end of the hose came apart after the fourth use. I could still use it, but I didn&#x27;t like that it was now a single stream instead of shower stream.</li>
            <li> After searching amazon, google, and other sites....Get the rinse ace 3 way faucet pet sprayer or their indoor/outdoor pet sprayer.  I needed to wash my 2 year old daughters hair and this is WONDERFUL! Great if you need to do hair in your home. You wont be disappointed. And if you cant wait for shipping, check your local pet store.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t fit in any of my faucets: kitchen, bathroom, outdoor. The item is cheaply made. Do not buy this. I so want to return it but since I would have to pay for the return shipping, I trashed it.</li>
            <li> I use this item in my kitchen sink to wash my hair. It does not leak or spray.  It is perfect to use on kids hair or as a sprayer on dishes. It is a high quality item and I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Good product - I liked it.  Use only on a Kitchen Faucet because of the back pressure developed by the narrow hose.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time in great condition. Would recommend to all friends and family members who are interested in using this for their pets or for themselves.</li>
            <li> It came broken in packet. When I bought this I knew it was risk considering many bad reviews. Well 10 bucks loss!</li>
            <li> the hose is made of cheap plastic and the connector did not fit in my faucet which is pretty standard faucet  I will never recommend it to anybody...</li>
            <li> This device didn&#x27;t fit any of my current faucets.  I contacted the seller, and seller stated I had to contact the manufacturer since he / she was only selling this device.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.  My wife bought it for giving her dogs a bath, but no luck.</li>
            <li> The only reason it isn&#x27;t one star is because I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; - nothing to hate, there should be a scale &amp;#34;useless&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t fit any of the 3 different faucets I tried it on. If I had the time to take pictures and post - I would. I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s super cheaply made  and though the service is great - ontime delivery and follow up - it is a useless product, hands down. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and its functional too. Just fold it and its convenient for a fast wash and go</li>
            <li> This shower converter doesn&#x27;t fit my round sink faucet or the traditional bath tub faucet. It is a cheap flimsy plastic hose that doesn&#x27;t even unravel properly so I would probably give it the lowest rating even if it did fit the faucets.  Save your time and money and don&#x27;t buy this junk</li>
            <li> Product looks very cheap, and performed very bad.  Waste of time and money. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> this is ok but it was the wrong item for me to order i did not need this item but a using it for onother</li>
            <li> How excited I was to be receiving this \\&quot;faucet-to-shower\\&quot; converter!  To be able to wash my hair in the sink would be marvelous.  I had the shampoo out, right next to my dishwashing detergent.  The towel was draped over the back of a chair.  I was all dressed up in my bib, a product I like better and better.  I got it, of course, from Amazon. The UPS man arrived.  I signed for the package, opened it, opened the plastic bag the converter was in. Here was a piece of equipment I could use to wash my hair and/or my dog&#x27;s hair.  Regretting the fact that I don&#x27;t have a dog to wash and wondering if I could borrow one, I rushed to the sink.  There my joy and rapture ended.  There began my weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. And why was that? I could not, simply could not, get that gadget attached to the faucet.  Every time I turned on the water, water sprayed out from the spot where the connection was supposed to be. The plastic bib worked well. After a few moments of spraying, the hose would fly off.  I tried holding it on.  I tried tying a rag around it.  Nothing worked.  Nothing.  The connection never held.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the problem was my kitchen faucet?  Would the hose attach to my bathroom faucet?  No. It wouldn&#x27;t. There are 257 apartments in my building, and each has  kitchen and bathroom faucets exactly like mine.  Other residents have converter hoses and water purifiers that are easily attached to their faucets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I didn&#x27;t think that ANY water had managed to get into the hose.  I was wrong. It didn&#x27;t drain out in the kitchen sink.  Oh, no!  When I trekked from kitchen to bathroom, that water left a trail.  Among the items that absorbed some of this water was a package of storage boxes I just bought from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends, buy this item only if you are a masochist seeking adventure. I&#x27;d give this contraption a no star rating if I could.  For the first time in my years of buying from Amazon, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to return something.</li>
            <li> came early , easy to use for small dog bathing</li>
            <li> I got it for the utility sink for washing my dog. So much better than a cup and he enjoys it much better. Works fine and we&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> Did not fit any of my faucets</li>
            <li> Hose arrived in good shape.</li>
            <li> The faucet attachment fit on a utility sink in our laundry room without any problems.  If you turn on the faucet all the way, it may leak.  If you use it with moderate force, no issues.  I think it works great for the price.  It installs in seconds and comes off easily as well.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I read all of the negative reviews, however I ordered this item anyway - partially because I didn&#x27;t see many other options available out there. I guess I was a little foolish, however I thought maybe it couldn&#x27;t be as bad as they said. I was wrong. The negative reviews are totally correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is made out of cheap plastic. The hose is thin and came kinked. The connection to the hose from the faucet cover is very poor. The connector slides out with very little water pressure and causes sprays of water. If water pressure is too high, the faucet cover starts to spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to wash my dog with in the utility sink. The ONLY GOOD thing I can say about this item is that it fit over the utility sink faucet. It was tight getting it on and I was hoping that would be a good thing - preventing leaks, but no luck there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t decided if I will send it back yet. Nine dollars seems a bit much to waste, though. Luckily, I grouped it with some other items for free shipping to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;I went to Lowes and bought the cheapest regular hand shower I found ($13) and a metal adapter that would adapt it to my utility sink faucet. The Lowes guy knew exactly what I needed. Cost a few dollars more than this, however, works SO much better and will last a LOT longer because it is a much higher quality item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this item to Amazon and they paid my return shipping of $3.41. I returned it as a defective item...because it really is. No lie!</li>
            <li> The converter did not fit my faucet.  Waste of money.  I purchased it for a friend and she could not use it.</li>
            <li> leaks on bathroom faucet so my mom could sit but better than nothing</li>
            <li> I brought this set for my brother-in-law, so he can start his own business. And so fare he love it.</li>
            <li> This is total crap. Fits the faucet but blows off with any pressure or hot water. Do not buy this junk!!  It does not deserve one star.</li>
            <li> I bought it to attach to a utility sink to bathe my two small Chihuahuas, and during the first use, pinprick holes developed in the hose and it started gushing water from the sides of the hose itself.  Very poor quality rubber, and poor fabrication.  This was not a leak at the juncture of the hose attachment and the faucet but litterally holes developing along the tubing.  Save your money and go to a hardware store to buy a real faucet attachment.</li>
            <li> This works great when you don&#x27;t have a sprayer hose at the sink. Sliding it over the tap is the simplest thing.</li>
            <li> the hole didn&#x27;t fit my faucet at all. it was way too small. I don&#x27;t know what kind of faucet it would fit. that should have been shown in picture so I wouldn&#x27;t have had the trouble and expense of returning it.</li>
            <li> this is fine for occasional use, but if I had to use it regularly I would probably pick something else.  If you run HOT watter at too high of pressure through it, the plastic will get soft and it will come off.  Never had a disconnect when using cold water on high or hot water on medium pressure.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my kitchen sink.  Useless.</li>
            <li> Great idea but did not fit over my faucet!</li>
            <li> We have an old 1940s tub so I think the faucet diameter is much smaller (closer to a sink). We bought this in hopes of being able to bathe our dog with ease in the tub. Works like a charm! If you put the water pressure on too high it will pop off; but we are able to get adequate pressure while keeping the tube in place. I&#x27;ve saved hundred not having to take her to the DIY dog wash down the street! Also as a bonus, this is little guy is great for cleaning the shower walls and the kitchen sink to boot!</li>
            <li> It is ok the hose could be longer because it wouldn&#x27;t stay on faucet being so short short not to bad if your in a bind</li>
            <li> It was fine the first month I bought it then the band rusted and all heck broke loose!  I used it for my hair washing only and after the month of purchase the grip didn&#x27;t support well. The band either slipped off the faucet or water would moderately shoot out of the band causing it to castigate everywhere and making my bathroom a mess.  Lesson learned, I won&#x27;t buy this paricular hose anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this in the kitchen for washing large pots and pans, since my kitchen sink doesn&#x27;t have one built in.  I worry about where to store it, mold, leakage, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.  Perhaps I just need a better place to put it.</li>
            <li> First, the flat trace on the tube resulted from folded packing couldn&#x27;t be recovered after few times hot water flush due to the tube material feature; Next, in 3 days, the spray cap fell off the showerhead under water pressure; Finally, since the cap was not attached to the head with thread but push-in and the overlaid surface was too narrow to use glue (must be unwashable and no harm to skin), I trashed it.</li>
            <li> it really works great very easy to hook up and use very good quality also real easy to clean and store until further use</li>
            <li> Does not fit any of my faucets. The tube is so narrow it would take you all day to rinse an egg. I got it an hour ago and it&#x27;s in the garbage already.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold onto the faucet.  Didn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this thing.  It&#x27;s too rigid &amp; way cheap</li>
            <li> I was looking for the faucet adaptor for my home brewing and glassware cleaning, so bought this , put the bristle end on a plastic rod for a back scratcher. The sink/faucet adaptor works great</li>
            <li> It worked perfect for three baths for my Puppy and then the top portion has come undone...cheap and would have paid more for a more substantial one that would have lasted!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly recommend it to anyone who has a sink without a spray attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> cheap and doesn&#x27;t stay connected to faucet. I don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> I needed one for a faucet and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  This fit the bill.  The only downside to it is that the part that fits over the faucet comes off if you turn the pressure up too high as it only slips on.</li>
            <li> The hose does NOT attach to any faucet in my house.  Please look for one that has threads to screw on to a faucet or that has positive reviews on attaching to bathroom or kitchen faucets.</li>
            <li> Water pressure causes hose to \\&quot;jump\\&quot; off faucet.  I bought it for my laundry room sink to use while bathing my Maltese. I spent more time readjusting the faucets after I had to shut them and reattach the hose.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. I ended up just throwing it in the trash. Wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit my faucet, gave to my sis</li>
            <li> Quality is similar to what you would expect to find in a dollar store at one-fourth this price. Didn&#x27;t fit any faucet very well (our faucets are all standard); fell off or became a geyser as soon as the water was turned on.</li>
            <li> I did not have a chance to use it, because when I opened the package and tried to attach it to the faucet, I found that the shower head was cracked.  I did not think it was worth returning.</li>
            <li> Faucet adapter did not fit bathroom faucet, no clip to hold adapter to faucet.&lt;br /&gt;I made modifications &amp; it does work well after adding holding clip.</li>
            <li> Good buy. My cats are much happier taking baths now.</li>
            <li> This is very poorly made.  It broke before I even opened it.  My daughters Barbie dolls have better quality than this.</li>
            <li> The L connector does not fit the kitchen sink faucet, opening is too small. I am very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> The faucet that we intended to attach to this sprayer is just about 3 cm in diameter.  Unfortunately the rubber flange would not fit over it, rendering this product completely useless for our intentions.</li>
            <li> This barely fits over my thumb, there is no way to put it on a kitchen or bathroom faucet, nevermond a bathtub faucet.  It is way too small and the rubber is hard, not pliable at all.  Useless.</li>
            <li> Product is obvious junk &amp; will never work &amp; should not be sold.  Grill flew off  hose extension upon just a little water pressure.  Turns out grill is not glued, threaded or screwed on.  Only fastener I can imagine is that whole grill snaps in but a snap is undecernable or less than 1/8th inch.  Grill certainly won&#x27;t snap back in place if it is a snap fastener. I&#x27;m returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to give this product zero stars, but I think one is as low as it goes.  This product didn&#x27;t even work properly one time.  Hooked it up to my sink faucet, turned on the water, and the spray section, where the water comes out, popped right out.  I tried to replace it, fix it, do whatever I could to get it to work, but it is a very cheaply made piece of plastic that just doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t care what it costs, this is not worth one penny.</li>
            <li> This gadget is great when you have to leave  conditioner in your hair long after you&#x27;re finished  showering.  Now I don&#x27;t have to bend under the faucet.</li>
            <li> This thing is horrible.....I cant even use it because it wont stay on the faucet I would not recomend this product</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, it was only about $8 so I figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out of much money.  It looked like something from the dollar store and didn&#x27;t fit any of my faucets, but at $8, it wasn&#x27;t worth returning.</li>
            <li> The fitting is so rigid it won&#x27;t flex enough to fit onto faucet thus making this product totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit ANY faucet,,, pretty much useless,,, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> The end &amp;#34;slips&amp;#34; over the laundry sink faucet. Took some effort but is exactly what I wanted. The rubber should never &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly disappointed at the fact the shower head end doesn&#x27;t rotate. Seems unless you use little water pressure, the shower head always faces up and will spray water outside the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Hose is very flexible and the perfect length.&lt;br /&gt;Shower head has a good number of holes for full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, Great buy! Tough to install and does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I live in apt and have had problems in the past finding a kitchen sink hose that will fit on them.  Lucky for me this one fit.  Although it fits, it leaks a bit from the botom of the rubber area that goes around the faucet.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it coming off of the faucet though and even though it kind of leaks it still has good water pressure and works well enough to keep.</li>
            <li> This item was just what I was looking for. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality and performance this item provides.</li>
            <li> The item worked real good for the purpose I needed it for. It is easy to connect to the faucet and very easy to disconnect.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews on this and decided to buy it anyways. I used to have one but couldnt find it, and couldnt find a replacement of this item until now. I thought this item worked VERY well. It stays on my faucet and it has good water flow/pressure. It didnt slip off while using it, and it dries out quickly. I dont know what everyone is talking this item not working or not staying on the faucet. I think people need to wet the attachment a bit first, then it will slide on much better. Also, pushing it on much further than they are will also make it work better. I had no problems with it, and it looks and feels very durable. Glad I decided to order it instead of listening to those low star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I go this to use as an attachment for a skin or a bath tub. Given the ratings left by other I did not have high expectations.  But, even with almost non existant expectations, I rate this as a 1.  It is cheaply made and looks like materials were probably only about 10 cents.  It does not fit my standard sink nor does it appear to be flexible enough to fit anything else.  I would say save your money. Would return it if it wouldnt be more effort that its worth.  This is going in the trash immediately.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> We bought it to use for giving our dogs a bath in our sanitary tub.. The first time we used it the sprinkler head fell off.  My husband just glued it with water proof glue.  Then the part that attaches to the faucet came off when the water pressure was to high...my husband used a hose clamp to fix that.  all in all it dosen&#x27;t look very pretty but with some fixing it&#x27;s usable. :)</li>
            <li> I bought it to use it to for my new born. From the first try it didnt stay on faucet, it keeps slipping. i couldnt make it work. So i had to returned it after few more trails which are not successful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother who loves to wash her hair in the sink...works like a charm! No more cricked neck muscles!!!</li>
            <li> When you need a way for one person to soak a foot in a tub this works. Using a pitcher is more time consuming and the temp isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> It worked 1 time, It worked second time then it broke as the front plastic on the head get lose and had to fix it with super glue , however it worked on any sink , I use it for wash my Cat , it is handy tool but I wish the shower head was done better as it is cheap plastic that will not last long</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the faucet but we cut some out and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, just as it was described.</li>
            <li> I hate it, I can&#x27;t return this thing, when I try to use , no fit whit my sink or shower , the water is everywhere , no functional :-( I pay for this 10 dlls</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this in my laundry sink, but the adapter doesn&#x27;t fit all faucet nozzles. It is therefore useless for my needs.</li>
            <li> Granted, I use this this item more often than not. I have 4 daughters and clients that come  to my home for hair appointments. The Faucet to Shower Converter does what its suppose to do, but the pressure of the water allows for attachments to start popping off, the hose connection, and or the attachment to the actual faucet. It does not take much pressure for this to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after a few uses the thing just started falling apart. Not to worry it can be fixed, and I dont mean just reataching these items. I actually used some Zebra pattern duct tape to secure the perimeter of the troublesome areas. It now looks cute and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the item as is it&#x27;s a disappointment because of its poor quality, but with a quick fix it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Avoid this product.  It is a piece of $%&amp;t.  Will not adhere to a normal fixture thereby making it impossible to do its job.  Made out of cheap plastic and made in China.</li>
            <li> This product works well until you turn on the hot water and then every time it falls off, Bought this item so my mother in law could wash her hair without bending over the tub she is 87 years old, so needless to say she is still bending over the tub looking for some way to connect it without falling off when water is turned on</li>
            <li> Did not work for my purpose, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Just what I needed. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this with hopes of it reaching my bathtub, but I needed a longer hose.  But all in all this is a great idea for washing hair and if it had been longer, would have worked well to use in bathtub.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! I love it!!!The quality very good and I need it for my job! I like this items very much!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth it! Going by the material and quality, this product is realistically not worth more than a dollar or two. The plastic tube material is cheap and of the same material as disposable drinking straws. The faucet fitting is of better material but will not fit anything more than 2cm in diameter. The seller should have mentioned the maximum fitting diameter for the fitting. I certainly didn&#x27;t find any faucets that are less than 2cm anywhere in the house.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay.  It broke after I used it once.  Thinner than advertised and it seemed shorter, though I didn&#x27;t measure it.</li>
            <li> Use this to clean my permanent furnace filters. Like the oblong shape better than the round head I used to have. It covers more area.</li>
            <li> Worst experience. Don&#x27;t buy waste of money</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for rinsing dishes after they have been washed.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap add-on for rinsing dishes after washing.</li>
            <li> we have found this product to work very well.  We use it to bathe our dogs and it works better than a pitcher to rinse them.</li>
            <li> Was a very small opening to fit onto the faucet and it would not go on to the kitchen faucet</li>
            <li> OMG! This Product SUCKS!  The Spray head will not stay on the end, and the hose connector falls off....If you purchase this product...plan on using PVC Glue and a Hose clamp with it!</li>
            <li> It came off faucet immediately.  I couldn&#x27;t even get this to fit on faucet high enough to try to clamp or wire it on.  I am returning the item.</li>
            <li> I read that it fits \\&quot;most\\&quot; tub faucets, I could never see it fitting a tub faucet. Very dissapointed when I got it, because it was no where close to fitting. Im sure it would fit a sink faucet as long as it is a newer one should be an old smaller one. (look at picture to see how small it is, does not expand bigger)</li>
            <li> Easy and efficient, a \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I think of that\\&quot; product. Attaches to the faucet as easily as it says it will and just a handy item to have around any home.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Not my favorite. Tried using it with my big tub, didn&#x27;t work at all. Not a good product and not good quality either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my fixtures are too updated, but I couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;get the product to attach and four bathrooms and a kitchen sink later, I&#x27;m angry.</li>
            <li> I have to keep holding it onto the faucet while I&#x27;m using.  The tube is also too small for the flow, even on very low flow.  I am only using it to fill an infant tub next to my sink, so it does the trick, but I can&#x27;t imagine using it to wash anything in the sink.</li>
            <li> i got this for my mom to make it easy for her to wash and rinse her hair very handy</li>
            <li> If the faucet has a short nozzel - it won&#x27;t work.  The work around is going to your local plumbing store and purchasing two components that extend the nozzel, cost about $12.00.  The seller should specify the minimum length of the nozzel that the converter will securly fasten (attach) to or supply some sort of extension with the converter.  Once attached it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my faucet.....</li>
            <li> So very disappointed with this product. It did not fit any faucet in my house. It was not at all what I wanted or expected. I am in the process of getting it ready to return.</li>
            <li> Did not fit and faucet in my home😣  the opening is too small for just normal faucets</li>
            <li> Hose arrived as ordered.  I use it to hook onto the laundry tub and use it when giving my dogs a bath.  The spray cleans the shampoo out of the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit on my faucet. its a pretty cheap product so I figured there was a 50/50 chance that might happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up using these types of attachments on our bathtubs in the UK. so know what they are like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one the whole was just too small or the plastic not flexible enough to accommodate my faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so its a gamble.</li>
            <li> Toy hose made in China.....trash!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to use it in tub when bathing the dog. The attachment is too small.</li>
            <li> This item could not be made any worse yet still work... in fact it broke on its second use. The low quality rubber sleeve ripped and the head came apart at the seem on the 1st use , I used duct tape to fix it...&lt;br /&gt;Comical really, if they had cut anymore corners at all, it would not have worked out of the box , much less, the two usages I got out of it before I threw it away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wash my dog.  It works fine for this purpose.  I have some trouble mounting it to the faucet but this maybe related to the old-fashioned fauset that I have in the utility sink. It looks cheap but OK for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Did NOT fit my utility sink nor any other sink in my house. I reported to vendor Maya Beauty, who promised to check into it. Never heard back. Don&#x27;t throw your money away.</li>
            <li> It fits a small faucet so I couldn&#x27;t use it. Not the fault of the company, I should of seen it was a kitchen faucet. Had a really tight seal on the suction cup part. Save yourself time and just go down to Lowe&#x27;s, they carry a selection of these converters.</li>
            <li> It was great, just what I was looking for.  Arrived quicker than I had anticipated.  Thank You Amazon</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my sink faucet so I didn&#x27;t use it.  Should have sent it back, but I figured some one in the family might be able to use it.,</li>
            <li> really poor leaks at the faucet, it&#x27;s made cheap, iv&#x27;e seen some where the hose was larger and of heavier material and the head a had bressels, this is very poor</li>
            <li> I bought it to give the dog a bath, and it did fine. It can handle low to moderate water pressure and stay on the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;But you do need one of the old style faucets from years ago for it to fit right properly.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It is all I was looking for and the price was so low compared the other products I have been looking at.</li>
            <li> This is a completely worth piece of junk--either poorly designed or poorly made. It won&#x27;t fit most faucets!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my faucet it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I should of went with the negative reviews and avoided this but I decided to be cheap and I got what I paid for -_-. Not worth 9 bucks or even a penny. This faucet was received broken, I mean seriously??? I&#x27;m returning this, what a waste!</li>
            <li> I bought this to bath the dog in the laundry wash tubs! It is designed to fit this type of a faucet! The connector fit perfectly and didn&#x27;t leak! I gave it only 4 stars because I feel they could have used a slightly better hose on the product; not one that wants to kink all of the time.All and all it works well !</li>
            <li> This is made for a round nozzle fossil.  We have a square one and it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Do not buy waste of money made soooooo cheap and doesn&#x27;t even  fit to my  kitchen sink ! And it&#x27;s a waste to return they say once the bag is open they won&#x27;t take it back !!! I don&#x27;t even wanna give this product even a star but They made me</li>
            <li> It was great for my friend&#x27;s dog</li>
            <li> great dogs love this more then before then with the cup</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used to because I&#x27;m not steady enough on my feet! Fits neatly on the faucet and looks right.</li>
            <li> Wow only hits the tip of the iceberg. I started out using this product for my dog and it always worked great. One day, I woke up a bit late and was going to be late for work if I took a shower. However, I couldn&#x27;t just ignore my daily shower, because I would smell bad all day. Well on my way out, I saw the Faucet to Shower Converter, and I thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; So I took a quick shower (only washing my hair); I had to use the dog shampoo because it was the closest shampoo bottle. I felt so refreshed after that mini-shower; I finally knew how great my dog feels after his showers. All day, at work, I was fixed on that sink shower. I came to the conclusion that I would replace all of the regular showers, at my house, with the faucet showers. Within a month, I had turned all my showers into closets (I put all my rare, collectable Beanie Babies in my new closet), and I bought a Faucet-to-Shower Converter for all of the faucets in the house. My wife thinks I&#x27;m a little bit loony now, but I am saving so much water, plus we can all shower in our clothes now!</li>
            <li> Plastic coupling fits faucet like a glove. And the hose is is just the right length. Just what I needed to help me bathe my little Yorkie Terriers. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to bathe my bichon frise in the sink to save my back. It has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> The water squirted and and splashed from between the spray and the shower head all over the place.  Try as I would, I could not put the spray part on to head so that it fit and wouldn&#x27;t spray the floor, the walls and me.</li>
            <li> It probably cost .75 cents to to make. shower head was broken between head and hose when I received it and the shipping box was not damaged therefore it was broken when it was packaged. It&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It probably would fit any standard faucet, mine are just weird. Great packaging and service though! Reasonable price too! Thanks</li>
