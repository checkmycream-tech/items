            <li>THE MIRROR IS GREAT NOW ,</li>
            <li>This mirror is attractive and seems to be sturdy, however since I just bought it, time will tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank goodness they have a good attitude and a good return policy!  </li>
            <li>The light is perfect and the mirror is great.</li>
            <li>The lighting is bice and bright.</li>
            <li>I loved it until the bulb blew within 7 months of purchase.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>This item was a gift for a family member and they loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>know what you are thinking \\&quot;his family member loved it</li>
            <li>I made a good deal, huh?  </li>
            <li>Light is very bright and it shows it all.</li>
            <li>Very stylish mirror.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I have purchased and returned so many makeup mirrors to them!  </li>
            <li>The magnification is perfect and it can be moved around easily and plugged in for additional light if needed.</li>
            <li>It works amazing</li>
            <li>Looking into the mirror is really amazing</li>
            <li>Great light.</li>
            <li>this mirror is bright and that&#x27;s a feature that most of the mirrors I&#x27;ve tried are lacking.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror for the money.  </li>
            <li>It did enlarge the pores and stray hairs effectively for treatment if that is your purpose.  </li>
            <li>I had a mirror just like this one and traded it to my soon-to-be ex-husband for a nice painting I wanted in the divorce.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking mirror.  </li>
            <li>I liked what we got for the price with this mirror.</li>
            <li>Lighting isn&#x27;t too warm and magnification is just what I need.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I would very strongly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>The light is bright without being blinding</li>
            <li>Might be nice to have more lighting settings though.</li>
            <li>Lots of bright light and the swivel mirror stays in place where you put it.  </li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t get too hot like some of the makeup mirrors and the magnification is wonderful!</li>
            <li>The lighted feature is great and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Many of the lighted mirrors have 10x or more, and I honestly don&#x27;t understand why you need to see the molecules in your pores.</li>
            <li>it was great for the first month</li>
            <li>Getting older can&#x27;t see a good as I used too!</li>
            <li>I felt the mirror was pretty good, till the magnifying side got a bit warm and the magnifing side fell off and keeps doing it.  </li>
            <li>My niece reports that this is a fabulous mirror!</li>
            <li>For the price I paid ($72), I would expect much better quality.</li>
            <li>Love the magnification and the 2 sides.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Ok for tweezing whiskers but nothing else.  </li>
            <li>Love this vanity.</li>
            <li>so she would leave mine alone :)</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love them.</li>
            <li>This mirror is very well made and attractive.</li>
            <li>so you can see more of your face.  </li>
            <li>But on the upside, I&#x27;m putting more effort into my skin care routine and seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror for eyebrow plucking.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  I thought I had pretty good skin before using this mirror.</li>
            <li>However for that it works fine, was hoping for more for the price</li>
            <li>and I just purchased another one for my best friend, after she came over and used it and was amazed at the crisp, clear, magnification.  </li>
            <li>the mirror won&#x27;t light any more.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR THE 40 - 50 YEAR OLD EYES USING IT</li>
            <li>The lighting is bright, better than other brands, the mobility and adjustability is good.</li>
            <li>The brightness is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for--very pleased!</li>
            <li>The magnification is awesome as is the other side.  </li>
            <li>not so easy sometimes with online purchases.  </li>
            <li>But, at 8X it was too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Although a bit pricier than I really wanted to pay, I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love that it promises right on the box that it is so easy to replace the bulb.  </li>
            <li>but it does not make my face look huge.</li>
            <li>I would recommend they have light just facing  one way</li>
            <li>Light seems to shine in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use the magnified side because it&#x27;s kind of intense.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>- Free Shipping</li>
            <li>Cheap is an understatement.</li>
            <li>The painting is worth much more.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate on the brightness of the light until I replace the bulb - hopefully</li>
            <li>the light wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>then light stopped working.</li>
            <li>THE MIRROR ITSELF HAS A BRIGHTER LIGHT</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for my girlfriend for her birthday and after one day the light bulb burned out.</li>
            <li>The #1 feature I really wanted was a nice bright light, and this one definitely has that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure you could perform surgery with that magnified side and the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not travel friendly.</li>
            <li>But for the price, this is probably the best small lighted vanity on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also good for makeup application and general skin maintenance.</li>
            <li>This light is really bright, the brightest that I&#x27;ve seen, and you can definitely see every pore and every hair on your face.  </li>
            <li>Adequate light and image enlargement.  </li>
            <li>The light is bright enough...</li>
            <li>It really helps me with doing my makeup so much more precisely.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the light switch that is on the top, not on the cord.</li>
            <li>Aug.04, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great materials, appearance and function.&lt;br /&gt;May need to adjust face locations to achieve the right about of light and 8x magnification clarity because of the orbicular light source and magnification</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, bright but not harsh light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright enough and fits on my vanity well.</li>
            <li>More image zoom would be too much for me.</li>
            <li>It magnifies ok, must use the edges to really see anything.  </li>
            <li>Floxite and Rialto mirrors seems to have the best light, while Conair and Zadro mirrors are not bright at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light is daylight, which will render the most natural setting.  </li>
            <li>It is not as bright as I expected it to be but certainly bright enough.  </li>
            <li>Great clear white light.</li>
            <li>Very pretty lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>The light is close to day night, this will avoid to put on too much makeup on.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is heavy and the finish is very nice.  </li>
            <li>It apparently is a good chance it won&#x27;t work anyway, according to the other reviews.</li>
            <li>image quality, instant-on qualities, and lighting that allows you to get right to it...</li>
            <li>I find the lighting just right</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t imagine how large everything is in it!</li>
            <li>Magnification is tremendous, and the switch on the bottom very convenient.  </li>
            <li>If you wake up early you may not want the light bothering someone else.</li>
            <li>:&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>The ol&#x27; lady really likes it!</li>
            <li>This item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>With this mirror my face never gets hot, so my makeup stays put.  </li>
            <li>Frankly I think a switch or wire in more likely the problem.  </li>
            <li>Florescent bulbs last many years.  </li>
            <li>Better than the one I had prior .</li>
            <li>But with 8x magnification, you may find a lot of flaws you weren&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li>I would not not buy this product if you can find something better at or around the same price.</li>
            <li>The normal side is clear and bright, and the magnifying side is large enough to see everything</li>
            <li>I looked long and hard for this as the one I am replacing I&#x27;ve loved for many years but because of normal wear and tear it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Light shines front and back of mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for anyone who wants to see a real close-up of their skin, get this mirror.  </li>
            <li>out the different types of magnifications where available before ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;-Leo</li>
            <li>Be warned the 8x magnification is intense.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I am not going to return it at my expense and then get a partial refund, as I am sure that shipping would eat up the refund.  </li>
            <li>I have had cheap mirrors last 15 years.</li>
            <li>I replaced my 40 year old plastic lighted mirror because the plastic was crumbling!!!  </li>
            <li>However, you will have to use the other side of the mirror to see the sides of your face because 8x magnification is pretty strong and you just can&#x27;t get the angle needed to focus in on those areas with this size of mirror.</li>
            <li>All the other mirrors just are not bright enough for fair skinned, fair haired women.  </li>
            <li>I only placed that as a con as a quick warning to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Older guy who just got braces to alleviate periodontal issues.</li>
            <li>Was hit for high school senior, college bound, granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li>If you want to closely examine the center of your face (mouth, nose, eyes), you are fine.  </li>
            <li>My first Coolite lasted over 4 years, but taking it apart to change the bulb was such a pain that I just bought a whole new unit!  </li>
            <li>It has one button for power and the mirror swivels from normal 1x to a magnified 8x.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>I like the double sided swivel and the magnification is just right for me.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself seems fine, but it arrived with a broken light bulb.  </li>
            <li>I need other lights around it to use it comfortably.</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I have the painting plus a brand new mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically this is a really lengthy way for me to explain that the 8x magnification was simply too much for my family member.</li>
            <li>Very clear and no distortion.</li>
            <li>Both sides are lit and the quality of the lighting is very natural.  </li>
            <li>the magnification mirror is a little hard to get a good look without fuzziness unless you are right up on the mirror.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to properly angle the mirror due to a tab on the side which restricted rotation of the mirror.</li>
            <li>By now having complete rotation, I may have damaged the wiring connected to the bulb.</li>
            <li>did not choose 10x or greater magnification because the detail was too confusing</li>
            <li>I have ordered 3 of these so far.  </li>
            <li>Classy look and design&lt;</li>
            <li>I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>I had to contact Floxite directly to get an exchange plus pay for shipping to get it there.</li>
            <li>Also, if it had a taller base that was adjustable, that would be perfect.</li>
            <li>, while not perfect, I guess this mirror is as good as I&#x27;m going to find.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you that a normal mirror does not really show you where you missed plucking certain brow hairs or missed waxing a mustache.</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough to allow me to comfortably use this item at a tall table with a low outlet</li>
            <li>This mirror needs to be set on something to be high enough to reach your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife broke hers and the new one is the same product at a lower price</li>
            <li>It came and I used it, but after a few weeks the light went out and would not come back on.  </li>
            <li>The chord could be less annoying (no way to wrap it up in the base), but the light is very bright and the magnification is great.</li>
            <li>This is my second one (first one was dropped) and works as expected.  </li>
            <li>I think my new mirror will last just as long.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, it is a poor design with the limited rotation, the light failing after only 6 months, and it is a real pain to take the mirror apart to replace the bulb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, but haven&#x27;t found exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I knew I could buy a new mirror just like my old one for a little over $48.  </li>
            <li>-- I mean can you ask for any product to give you almost 20 years of loyal and faithful service, never letting you down?&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

            <li> this mirror is bright and that&#x27;s a feature that most of the mirrors I&#x27;ve tried are lacking.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror for the money.  </li>
            <li> It did enlarge the pores and stray hairs effectively for treatment if that is your purpose.  </li>
            <li> I had a mirror just like this one and traded it to my soon-to-be ex-husband for a nice painting I wanted in the divorce.  </li>
            <li> Nice looking mirror.  </li>
            <li> I liked what we got for the price with this mirror.</li>
            <li> Lighting isn&#x27;t too warm and magnification is just what I need.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I would very strongly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> The light is bright without being blinding</li>
            <li> Might be nice to have more lighting settings though.</li>
            <li> Lots of bright light and the swivel mirror stays in place where you put it.  </li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t get too hot like some of the makeup mirrors and the magnification is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The lighted feature is great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Many of the lighted mirrors have 10x or more, and I honestly don&#x27;t understand why you need to see the molecules in your pores.</li>
            <li> it was great for the first month</li>
            <li> Getting older can&#x27;t see a good as I used too!</li>
            <li> I felt the mirror was pretty good, till the magnifying side got a bit warm and the magnifing side fell off and keeps doing it.  </li>
            <li> My niece reports that this is a fabulous mirror!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid ($72), I would expect much better quality.</li>
            <li> Love the magnification and the 2 sides.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Ok for tweezing whiskers but nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Love this vanity.</li>
            <li> so she would leave mine alone :)</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love them.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very well made and attractive.</li>
            <li> so you can see more of your face.  </li>
            <li> But on the upside, I&#x27;m putting more effort into my skin care routine and seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror for eyebrow plucking.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  I thought I had pretty good skin before using this mirror.</li>
            <li> However for that it works fine, was hoping for more for the price</li>
            <li> and I just purchased another one for my best friend, after she came over and used it and was amazed at the crisp, clear, magnification.  </li>
            <li> the mirror won&#x27;t light any more.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR THE 40 - 50 YEAR OLD EYES USING IT</li>
            <li> The lighting is bright, better than other brands, the mobility and adjustability is good.</li>
            <li> The brightness is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for--very pleased!</li>
            <li> The magnification is awesome as is the other side.  </li>
            <li> not so easy sometimes with online purchases.  </li>
            <li> But, at 8X it was too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Although a bit pricier than I really wanted to pay, I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love that it promises right on the box that it is so easy to replace the bulb.  </li>
            <li> but it does not make my face look huge.</li>
            <li> I would recommend they have light just facing  one way</li>
            <li> Light seems to shine in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the magnified side because it&#x27;s kind of intense.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> - Free Shipping</li>
            <li> Cheap is an understatement.</li>
            <li> The painting is worth much more.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate on the brightness of the light until I replace the bulb - hopefully</li>
            <li> the light wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> then light stopped working.</li>
            <li> THE MIRROR ITSELF HAS A BRIGHTER LIGHT</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my girlfriend for her birthday and after one day the light bulb burned out.</li>
            <li> The #1 feature I really wanted was a nice bright light, and this one definitely has that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure you could perform surgery with that magnified side and the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not travel friendly.</li>
            <li> But for the price, this is probably the best small lighted vanity on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also good for makeup application and general skin maintenance.</li>
            <li> This light is really bright, the brightest that I&#x27;ve seen, and you can definitely see every pore and every hair on your face.  </li>
            <li> Adequate light and image enlargement.  </li>
            <li> The light is bright enough...</li>
            <li> It really helps me with doing my makeup so much more precisely.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the light switch that is on the top, not on the cord.</li>
            <li> Aug.04, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great materials, appearance and function.&lt;br /&gt;May need to adjust face locations to achieve the right about of light and 8x magnification clarity because of the orbicular light source and magnification</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, bright but not harsh light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright enough and fits on my vanity well.</li>
            <li> More image zoom would be too much for me.</li>
            <li> It magnifies ok, must use the edges to really see anything.  </li>
            <li> Floxite and Rialto mirrors seems to have the best light, while Conair and Zadro mirrors are not bright at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light is daylight, which will render the most natural setting.  </li>
            <li> It is not as bright as I expected it to be but certainly bright enough.  </li>
            <li> Great clear white light.</li>
            <li> Very pretty lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li> The light is close to day night, this will avoid to put on too much makeup on.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is heavy and the finish is very nice.  </li>
            <li> It apparently is a good chance it won&#x27;t work anyway, according to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> image quality, instant-on qualities, and lighting that allows you to get right to it...</li>
            <li> I find the lighting just right</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t imagine how large everything is in it!</li>
            <li> Magnification is tremendous, and the switch on the bottom very convenient.  </li>
            <li> If you wake up early you may not want the light bothering someone else.</li>
            <li> :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> The ol&#x27; lady really likes it!</li>
            <li> This item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> With this mirror my face never gets hot, so my makeup stays put.  </li>
            <li> Frankly I think a switch or wire in more likely the problem.  </li>
            <li> Florescent bulbs last many years.  </li>
            <li> Better than the one I had prior .</li>
            <li> But with 8x magnification, you may find a lot of flaws you weren&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li> I would not not buy this product if you can find something better at or around the same price.</li>
            <li> The normal side is clear and bright, and the magnifying side is large enough to see everything</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard for this as the one I am replacing I&#x27;ve loved for many years but because of normal wear and tear it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Light shines front and back of mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for anyone who wants to see a real close-up of their skin, get this mirror.  </li>
            <li> out the different types of magnifications where available before ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;-Leo</li>
            <li> Be warned the 8x magnification is intense.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to return it at my expense and then get a partial refund, as I am sure that shipping would eat up the refund.  </li>
            <li> I have had cheap mirrors last 15 years.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 40 year old plastic lighted mirror because the plastic was crumbling!!!  </li>
            <li> However, you will have to use the other side of the mirror to see the sides of your face because 8x magnification is pretty strong and you just can&#x27;t get the angle needed to focus in on those areas with this size of mirror.</li>
            <li> All the other mirrors just are not bright enough for fair skinned, fair haired women.  </li>
            <li> I only placed that as a con as a quick warning to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Older guy who just got braces to alleviate periodontal issues.</li>
            <li> Was hit for high school senior, college bound, granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> If you want to closely examine the center of your face (mouth, nose, eyes), you are fine.  </li>
            <li> My first Coolite lasted over 4 years, but taking it apart to change the bulb was such a pain that I just bought a whole new unit!  </li>
            <li> It has one button for power and the mirror swivels from normal 1x to a magnified 8x.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> I like the double sided swivel and the magnification is just right for me.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself seems fine, but it arrived with a broken light bulb.  </li>
            <li> I need other lights around it to use it comfortably.</li>
            <li> and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I have the painting plus a brand new mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically this is a really lengthy way for me to explain that the 8x magnification was simply too much for my family member.</li>
            <li> Very clear and no distortion.</li>
            <li> Both sides are lit and the quality of the lighting is very natural.  </li>
            <li> the magnification mirror is a little hard to get a good look without fuzziness unless you are right up on the mirror.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to properly angle the mirror due to a tab on the side which restricted rotation of the mirror.</li>
            <li> By now having complete rotation, I may have damaged the wiring connected to the bulb.</li>
            <li> did not choose 10x or greater magnification because the detail was too confusing</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 of these so far.  </li>
            <li> Classy look and design&lt;</li>
            <li> I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> I had to contact Floxite directly to get an exchange plus pay for shipping to get it there.</li>
            <li> Also, if it had a taller base that was adjustable, that would be perfect.</li>
            <li> , while not perfect, I guess this mirror is as good as I&#x27;m going to find.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that a normal mirror does not really show you where you missed plucking certain brow hairs or missed waxing a mustache.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to allow me to comfortably use this item at a tall table with a low outlet</li>
            <li> This mirror needs to be set on something to be high enough to reach your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife broke hers and the new one is the same product at a lower price</li>
            <li> It came and I used it, but after a few weeks the light went out and would not come back on.  </li>
            <li> The chord could be less annoying (no way to wrap it up in the base), but the light is very bright and the magnification is great.</li>
            <li> This is my second one (first one was dropped) and works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I think my new mirror will last just as long.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, it is a poor design with the limited rotation, the light failing after only 6 months, and it is a real pain to take the mirror apart to replace the bulb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, but haven&#x27;t found exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I knew I could buy a new mirror just like my old one for a little over $48.  </li>
            <li> -- I mean can you ask for any product to give you almost 20 years of loyal and faithful service, never letting you down?&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I had a Conair one that was decent, but after a few years the bulb went out.  </li>
            <li> mirror has a magnification of 8x (which is still a little too much), and the other side is a regular mirror.  </li>
            <li> bought new bulbs no help still no light .</li>
            <li> The only con is that I&#x27;ve found the circular light is difficult to replace if it goes out.</li>
            <li> magnification of this mirror is 8x on one side and a regular mirror on the other, which is acceptable.  </li>
            <li> And, unfortunately, I did not return it right away as I left on a long trip out of the country.  </li>
            <li> so the insides were loose and rattling around&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to buy a new bulb only to find out that it isn&#x27;t the bulb it is the switch or a broken wire.  </li>
            <li> I may have caused the problem due to the poor design of the mirror in the first place.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> THE SURFACE AREA IS ALSO A LITTLE BIGGER.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I would make is that I wish this mirror was a little taller.  </li>
            <li> I think if you are maybe in your 70&#x27;s or older with poor vision you could use this.  </li>
            <li> Not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> I returned home on October 16, and due to getting settled again, I did  not return it by the cut-off date which was Oct. 22.</li>
            <li> No more left shadow residues on my face.</li>
            <li> Upon inspection I saw that the thin fabric sleeve over the wires had been completely severed from rotating the mirror, and the wires were partially severed.</li>
            <li> The magnification side only lets you view about 1/2 of your eye at a time which is pretty bad for those of us who wear glasses/contacts and rely on a mag mirror to see details.  </li>
            <li> needs improvement: the diameter of this mirror is 6.5\\&quot; and it could be larger, like at least 8\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a huge base that take up too much of my limited counter space in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The lighting on the mirror itself is not adequate to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is magnified on one side and a plain mirror on the other.  </li>
            <li> After turning it on I was in shock at what I was missing from my previous mirror.</li>
            <li> Likes it a lot and uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> It is compact, but heavy, so I would not advise packing this for any plane trip.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bulb in the old one died and it was not replaceable like the newer ones.  </li>
            <li> , the bulb is the only thing broken in there.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not quite two years old and is expensive.</li>
            <li> The inside parts were missing screws</li>
            <li> But even though I am middle-aged and require reading glasses, this required me to be no more than four inches away from the mirror or</li>
            <li> I contacted the Supplier and told them - they were not sympathetic at all.</li>
            <li> Not too tall, so it fits on my small vanity make up table.</li>
            <li> They found it impossible to apply makeup because the magnification was too high.</li>
            <li> This  mirror is very heavy and magnifies well.</li>
            <li> I returned it, don&#x27;t waste your money, not good quality.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a lighted mirror to please our daughter.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is optical quality and is on a sturdy SS (stainless steel) base.  </li>
            <li> I just knew the glass was going to be broken - it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When I removed the cover I found one of the brackets that holds the bulb in was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you a secret.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was the base has a cardboard which came off.</li>
            <li> Beware when you look into the magnifying side because you will see all the things wrong with your teeth &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because I have a difficult time seeing my eyebrows when putting on make up.  </li>
            <li> Poor Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot go wrong...</li>
            <li> Very expensive to have this type of result</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality built product but disappointed in its performance.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This thing has lasted me about 2 years and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> My niece reports that this is a fabulous mirror!</li>
            <li> Awesome! The light is perfect and the mirror is great. No distortion. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a makeup mirror!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!!!</li>
            <li> This device was not to my wife&#x27;s liking</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a makeup light/mirror for awhile. Although a bit pricier than I really wanted to pay, I&#x27;m glad I did! It works amazing and I love it!</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife. She loves the magnification. Not too big or too small. Light is very bright and it shows it all. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved it until the bulb blew within 7 months of purchase. Very expensive to have this type of result Light shines front and back of mirror. If you wake up early you may not want the light bothering someone else. I would recommend they have light just facing  one way</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality built product but disappointed in its performance.  Light seems to shine in your eyes. Mirror seemed smalled than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Floxite/Rialto mirror in May 2012, and after only 6 months of use, the fluorescent bulb went out. Those bulbs should last years! I ordered a replacement bulb, and it did not work, so the problem is elsewhere .... possibly the wiring? I may have caused the problem due to the poor design of the mirror in the first place. I wasn&#x27;t able to properly angle the mirror due to a tab on the side which restricted rotation of the mirror. I removed the tab just so I could use the mirror. By now having complete rotation, I may have damaged the wiring connected to the bulb. Bottom line, it is a poor design with the limited rotation, the light failing after only 6 months, and it is a real pain to take the mirror apart to replace the bulb. For the price I paid ($72), I would expect much better quality. P.S. I now see the mirror selling for $40 as of Oct. 2013.</li>
            <li> The brightness is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for--very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have owned this mirror for 3 years now and I just purchased another one for my best friend, after she came over and used it and was amazed at the crisp, clear, magnification.  The mirror is optical quality and is on a sturdy SS (stainless steel) base.  It has one button for power and the mirror swivels from normal 1x to a magnified 8x.  Let me tell you that a normal mirror does not really show you where you missed plucking certain brow hairs or missed waxing a mustache. The magnified side reveals a lot .... so BEWARE of the what you will see that you won&#x27;t see on a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mirror.&lt;br /&gt;So, for anyone who wants to see a real close-up of their skin, get this mirror.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This purchase was well-researched.  I&#x27;ve had my mirror for 2 years now and it is still in \\&quot;like new\\&quot; shape.  Still haven&#x27;t had to replace a bulb.  I just damp dust (no chemicals).  The light is daylight, which will render the most natural setting.  Magnification is terrific--you won&#x27;t believe what you missed before! Rialto is a top-rated brand.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  Very sturdy, bright but not harsh light.  Magnification is tremendous, and the switch on the bottom very convenient.  This product will probably last longer than I will!  I replaced my 40 year old plastic lighted mirror because the plastic was crumbling!!!  I think my new mirror will last just as long.  :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> This light is really bright, the brightest that I&#x27;ve seen, and you can definitely see every pore and every hair on your face.  I don&#x27;t even use the magnified side because it&#x27;s kind of intense.  I am pretty sure you could perform surgery with that magnified side and the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the bulb is replaceable.  I had a Conair one that was decent, but after a few years the bulb went out.  We opened it up to replace it but couldn&#x27;t find that size bulb anywhere, and it wasn&#x27;t that great to begin with, so I decided to give that one away and get this one.  I did my research and I think this one is the best one for my purposes, at the best price.</li>
            <li> This is my second one (first one was dropped) and works as expected.  The magnification is awesome as is the other side.  I don&#x27;t know how I put make up on before having this lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> The magnification side only lets you view about 1/2 of your eye at a time which is pretty bad for those of us who wear glasses/contacts and rely on a mag mirror to see details.  The lighting on the mirror itself is not adequate to apply makeup.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great clear white light. Beware when you look into the magnifying side because you will see all the things wrong with your teeth &amp; skin. LOL  Great value.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter-purchased 2 earlier for myself--love them</li>
            <li> This mirror is fantastic.  Plz keep it in stock&#x27;. It is great for tweeting and applying makeup&lt;br /&gt;It is so great I had to purchase one for my mother as well</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a local store in my area. After turning it on I was in shock at what I was missing from my previous mirror. The lighting and magnification allows me to see what I am doing without my glasses. Great for tweezing and makeup application.</li>
            <li> This mirror is magnified on one side and a plain mirror on the other.  Both sides are lit and the quality of the lighting is very natural.  I purchased it because I have a difficult time seeing my eyebrows when putting on make up.  This mirror would be quite helpful to a person who wears \\&quot;readers\\&quot; glasses but can&#x27;t see to put on makeup that well without them.  I think I&#x27;m getting to that point any life.  The mirror is heavy and the finish is very nice.  I paid $49.99 on Amazon.com which is cheaper than I could find a similar mirror anywhere else.  The only downside, is that on the magnification side, the magnification is such that you cannot see the sides of your face or your ears.  If you want to closely examine the center of your face (mouth, nose, eyes), you are fine.  However, you will have to use the other side of the mirror to see the sides of your face because 8x magnification is pretty strong and you just can&#x27;t get the angle needed to focus in on those areas with this size of mirror.</li>

            <li> This one did not work, and  was sent back.&lt;br /&gt;Please reorder a working one and send to me ASAP&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Niva grill</li>
            <li> The ol&#x27; lady really likes it!</li>
            <li> All the other mirrors just are not bright enough for fair skinned, fair haired women.  This one does the job.</li>
            <li> Very stylish mirror. I wish it were a little bigger. The lighting is bice and bright. Good price.</li>
            <li> Was hit for high school senior, college bound, granddaughter. Big hit. Likes it a lot and uses it everyday. The lighted feature is great and the price is right. Warning!! Do not reverse the mirror and look at it unless you are prepared for a shock. Unless of course you are of the model nature. They probably use this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror for the money.  Almost double in the big box retailer stores.  You definately see it all on the mag side!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 of these so far.  One for both bathrooms and one for a guest that wanted to know where I got it.  Love the magnification and the 2 sides.  Very clear and no distortion.</li>
            <li> This was a very good product for it&#x27;s magnification.  But, at 8X it was too strong for me.  I think if you are maybe in your 70&#x27;s or older with poor vision you could use this.  But even though I am middle-aged and require reading glasses, this required me to be no more than four inches away from the mirror or else it was distorted.  It did enlarge the pores and stray hairs effectively for treatment if that is your purpose.  However for my needs, I went with the Simple Human 5X:[[ASIN:B00AZSNW3E simplehuman Sensor Mirror - Sensor-Activated Lighted Makeup Mirror]].</li>
            <li> This item came exactly as described. Be warned the 8x magnification is intense. This item was a gift for a family member and they loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- The light is bright without being blinding&lt;br /&gt;- The cord is long enough to allow me to comfortably use this item at a tall table with a low outlet&lt;br /&gt;- Classy look and design&lt;br /&gt;- Item feels solid&lt;br /&gt;- Magnification is incredible. If you are looking to tweeze things then this item is perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the person I have this to has actually asked me to return it! ( continue reading!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you are thinking \\&quot;his family member loved it and he gave it five stars but then they returned it? What&#x27;s up with that?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is a really lengthy way for me to explain that the 8x magnification was simply too much for my family member. They found it impossible to apply makeup because the magnification was too high. Looking into the mirror is really amazing you can&#x27;t imagine how large everything is in it! I only placed that as a con as a quick warning to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is really great but be warned that the 8x magnification will allow you to see inside of your pores.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the box I heard a rattle. I just knew the glass was going to be broken - it wasn&#x27;t. The rattle came from the inside. When I removed the cover I found one of the brackets that holds the bulb in was broken. I contacted the Supplier and told them - they were not sympathetic at all. I returned it, don&#x27;t waste your money, not good quality. Cheap is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a lighted mirror to please our daughter.  This one did the trick.</li>
            <li> It works great. However, when it arrived the cardboard bottom was detached from the unit. I had to glue it back on.</li>
            <li> This is the best make-up mirror! The normal side is clear and bright, and the magnifying side is large enough to see everything but it does not make my face look huge. It is compact, but heavy, so I would not advise packing this for any plane trip. With this mirror my face never gets hot, so my makeup stays put.  My first Coolite lasted over 4 years, but taking it apart to change the bulb was such a pain that I just bought a whole new unit!  Great price and product.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  It is not as bright as I expected it to be but certainly bright enough.  The light doesn&#x27;t get too hot like some of the makeup mirrors and the magnification is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you a secret.  I had a mirror just like this one and traded it to my soon-to-be ex-husband for a nice painting I wanted in the divorce.  He wanted to use the mirror when he plucks his eyebrows.  I knew I could buy a new mirror just like my old one for a little over $48.  The painting is worth much more.  I made a good deal, huh?  I have the painting plus a brand new mirror.</li>
            <li> My wife broke hers and the new one is the same product at a lower price</li>
            <li> I felt the mirror was pretty good, till the magnifying side got a bit warm and the magnifing side fell off and keeps doing it.  I amo off to look for a mirrorr again....sigh</li>
            <li> I do like it but wish it were brighter. I need other lights around it to use it comfortably.</li>
            <li> Very pretty lighted mirror.  Adequate light and image enlargement.  More image zoom would be too much for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Love it. Getting older can&#x27;t see a good as I used too! Helps a lot when it  comes to plucking eyebrows</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because it was just like the one I had had for 10 years.  Unfortunately the bulb in the old one died and it was not replaceable like the newer ones.  So....I ordered this one from Amazon.  It came and I used it, but after a few weeks the light went out and would not come back on.  And, unfortunately, I did not return it right away as I left on a long trip out of the country.  I returned home on October 16, and due to getting settled again, I did  not return it by the cut-off date which was Oct. 22. So now, I am stuck with a non-working lamp.  I am not going to return it at my expense and then get a partial refund, as I am sure that shipping would eat up the refund.  So, my word on this, is don&#x27;t buy this mirror...you may be out $50. It apparently is a good chance it won&#x27;t work anyway, according to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself seems fine, but it arrived with a broken light bulb.  I can&#x27;t rate on the brightness of the light until I replace the bulb - hopefully, the bulb is the only thing broken in there.</li>
            <li> It magnifies ok, must use the edges to really see anything.  Ok for tweezing whiskers but nothing else.  However for that it works fine, was hoping for more for the price</li>
            <li> Great light. Second one i purchased in 10 yrs.  not travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Nice looking mirror.  Great glass.  Magnification works great.  I purchased this Nov 20th 2012 as of 2/8/2013 it will not come on.  Can&#x27;t return it.  I don&#x27;t want to buy a new bulb only to find out that it isn&#x27;t the bulb it is the switch or a broken wire.  Frankly I think a switch or wire in more likely the problem.  Florescent bulbs last many years.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this item is on the fence and it seems recent productions are of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> Love this vanity. The chord could be less annoying (no way to wrap it up in the base), but the light is very bright and the magnification is great. The only con is that I&#x27;ve found the circular light is difficult to replace if it goes out. But for the price, this is probably the best small lighted vanity on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This works great. I like the double sided swivel and the magnification is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Works great ! Better than the one I had prior .</li>
            <li> Have had this mirror for 6 months now and no complaints. It&#x27;s bright enough and fits on my vanity well.</li>
            <li> This  mirror is very heavy and magnifies well. For the price I thought it would be the last one I would buy. About 8 months after I bought it the light wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I took it apart to check connections, replaced the bulb(expensive) tried a different outlet etc. the mirror won&#x27;t light any more. I feel completely ripped off. I have had cheap mirrors last 15 years. Not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror. The magnification is perfect and it can be moved around easily and plugged in for additional light if needed.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter so she would leave mine alone :)</li>
            <li> The lighting is bright, better than other brands, the mobility and adjustability is good. the magnification mirror is a little hard to get a good look without fuzziness unless you are right up on the mirror. I liked what we got for the price with this mirror. Might be nice to have more lighting settings though. I am just relaying the review from my wife who I bought this for. She is happy with it.</li>
            <li> it was great for the first month then light stopped working. bought new bulbs no help still no light . used meter found no power to bulb. has power to circuit card but nothing coming out to bulb.  UPDATE: the company on amazon only exchanged for 30 days though it has a 1 year warenty. I had to contact Floxite directly to get an exchange plus pay for shipping to get it there. but they did not seen happy about it kept saying {Please remember though when you purchase something and there&#x27;s a problem return it to  the place that has your money.} not so easy sometimes with online purchases.  THE MIRROR IS GREAT NOW , HOPE IT STAYS THAT WAY    THE MIRROR ITSELF HAS A BRIGHTER LIGHT THEN OTHERS WE HAVE HAD. THE SURFACE AREA IS ALSO A LITTLE BIGGER. GREAT FOR THE 40 - 50 YEAR OLD EYES USING IT</li>
            <li> I would say that the mirror works as promised. The only issue I had was the base has a cardboard which came off. It doesn&#x27;t impact the working but still was expecying it to stay.</li>
            <li> Poor Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond!  I have purchased and returned so many makeup mirrors to them!  Thank goodness they have a good attitude and a good return policy!  I finally settled on the Rialto mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror has a magnification of 8x (which is still a little too much), and the other side is a regular mirror.  The light is bright enough...a lot of them aren&#x27;t.  I like the style!  It doesn&#x27;t have a huge base that take up too much of my limited counter space in the bathroom.  I love that it promises right on the box that it is so easy to replace the bulb.  All in all, this is the best makeup mirror that I have found, and I LOOKED!</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard for this as the one I am replacing I&#x27;ve loved for many years but because of normal wear and tear it needed to be replaced. The lighting is very good and the magnification great!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love them. No problems with the product. Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality mirror.</li>
            <li> This make-up mirror replaces an earlier generaton (same style, same manufacturer) that simply \\&quot;wore out\\&quot; -- I mean can you ask for any product to give you almost 20 years of loyal and faithful service, never letting you down?&lt;br /&gt;For image quality, instant-on qualities, and lighting that allows you to get right to it... this is the mirror to purchase.  The manufacturer is well-known, been around forever and backs what they make.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong... for yourself, your daughter or your granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Update 12/05/2016 Today this mirror flickered, then went off and would not come back on. Thinking the bulb had failed, I took the housing apart to get the bulb out to be sure to get the correct replacement. Upon inspection I saw that the thin fabric sleeve over the wires had been completely severed from rotating the mirror, and the wires were partially severed. This mirror is not quite two years old and is expensive. It is intended to be rotated. Unacceptable.  *********************  This mirror is very well made and attractive. I find the lighting just right and like that it goes all around instead of just on the sides as with some rectangular mirrors.  I do find that it takes some practice to get your reflection in focus with the magnified side.  Once you do,  you&#x27;ll see things you can&#x27;t forget! I also feel like the 1X side actually reflects smaller than life-size.</li>
            <li> Good quality!! It really helps me with doing my makeup so much more precisely.  The light is close to day night, this will avoid to put on too much makeup on.  No more left shadow residues on my face.</li>
            <li> This item arrived looking like it had been used! The inside parts were missing screws so the insides were loose and rattling around&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back!</li>
            <li> This is the second mirror I purchased, because I could not find another with the same magnification and brightness this one delivers.  Your image is not distorted and the brightness is perfect.  The only suggestion I would make is that I wish this mirror was a little taller.  That&#x27;s it!  Anyway, I would very strongly recommend this mirror.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lighted make up mirror for over a year. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few, but haven&#x27;t found exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. This mirror seems to come closest, although there is room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: this mirror is bright and that&#x27;s a feature that most of the mirrors I&#x27;ve tried are lacking. Floxite and Rialto mirrors seems to have the best light, while Conair and Zadro mirrors are not bright at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification of this mirror is 8x on one side and a regular mirror on the other, which is acceptable.  Many of the lighted mirrors have 10x or more, and I honestly don&#x27;t understand why you need to see the molecules in your pores. 8x is plenty big,and I would actually prefer 7x. This mirror is attractive and seems to be sturdy, however since I just bought it, time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What needs improvement: the diameter of this mirror is 6.5\\&quot; and it could be larger, like at least 8\\&quot; so you can see more of your face.  Also, if it had a taller base that was adjustable, that would be perfect. This mirror needs to be set on something to be high enough to reach your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while not perfect, I guess this mirror is as good as I&#x27;m going to find. The #1 feature I really wanted was a nice bright light, and this one definitely has that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I thought I had pretty good skin before using this mirror. But with 8x magnification, you may find a lot of flaws you weren&#x27;t aware of. So there&#x27;s that. But on the upside, I&#x27;m putting more effort into my skin care routine and seeing some improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror for eyebrow plucking. Also good for makeup application and general skin maintenance.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter both like this makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> Lots of bright light and the swivel mirror stays in place where you put it.  Also, the height is perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my girlfriend for her birthday and after one day the light bulb burned out. I read reviews that this could happen and it actually did. I would not not buy this product if you can find something better at or around the same price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Older guy who just got braces to alleviate periodontal issues. And this is a must when it comes to cleaning and flossing. Expect it would work just as well when applying cosmetics. Stable base, great illumination, swivels well and stays at whatever angle you place it.</li>
            <li> I love it. Not too tall, so it fits on my small vanity make up table. Perfect magnification, so I do not need my reading glasses. Nice light. and I really like the light switch that is on the top, not on the cord. I give this six stars.</li>
            <li> This mirror is as advertised.  Lighting isn&#x27;t too warm and magnification is just what I need.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
