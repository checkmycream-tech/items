            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>being said, this concealer is great for those of us who have blemish problems and cant mask them discreetly with just the Bisque or another powder.</li>

            <li>I wish it had come with an applicator of some kind.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and great coverage!</li>

            <li>Flows easily.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 so far, it is so creamy and light but great for under the eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with just the tip of your finger.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Ulta after a lady there recommended it strongly.</li>
            <li>Light 1 is for those with a warmer-fair complexion.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous concealer...</li>
            <li>I bought the Light 2 and should have bought the medium, as it is a bit light for me...</li>
            <li>(I use maybelline fit me), apply my foundation (I use a liquid) set it with the bareMinerals foundation powder, and then use this.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dark circles around my eyes and this product is the absolute best I have found to cover.</li>
            <li>It is true to color.</li>
            <li>Most people with problems with Bare Minerals is their own fault for using the products as you would most other cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin, and I&#x27;ve been pleased with this product, and their line of products.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of all Bare Escentuals!!</li>
            <li>I find that I get the best coverage by applying a thin consistency concealer first</li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Love Bare Escentuals product line.  </li>
            <li>I love all the products by Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>This concealer blends well, is easy to use, offers MAXIMUM coverage.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, looks natural and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It was good as an under-eye concealer; however it didn&#x27;t cover dark spots on my cheeks and nose very well.</li>
            <li>Covers skin evenly concealing blemishes and redness in a light natural finish.  </li>
            <li>As expected with Bare Escentuals, it provides great coverage without feeling weighty.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my married daughter.</li>
            <li>This stuff if a lifesaver for the days I want a little more coverage and help hiding a breakout!</li>
            <li>Do your work with these amazing products, look up the proper tutorials on youtube, go into a Bare Escentuals boutique and ask a technician.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair, sensitive, oily skin, and this is seriously the only concealer I have EVER used that matches my skin tone, blends smoothly and evenly, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li>Light 2 is actually the lighter shade, just FYI.</li>
            <li>It conceals very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Sephora&#x27;s concealer which is very comparable</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does absolutely nothing for the redness on my cheeks and chin, either.</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and I&#x27;m definitely switching to this from now on!</li>
            <li>Favorite concealer for hereditary dark under eye circles!</li>
            <li>Hard to choose a color online, but effective concealer if you think it will match your skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals products for years, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>either too light or too dark.  </li>
            <li>The concealer covers pretty well but made me break out which is unusual because I use other bare minerals products and have no issues.</li>
            <li>This is high quality stuff and made to last.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting a concealer like this for a while, but did not realize one was made by Bare Escentuals.  </li>
            <li>She loves Bare Escentuals make up.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that women&#x27;s cosmetics is so expensive, but the result looks OK.  </li>
            <li>I am a HUGE bareMinerals fan, and up until a few months ago I never used any product other than theirs.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to cover much (the dark areas under my eyes and on either side of my nose).</li>
            <li>So sad because I really love bare minerals</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this concealer, but be sure you know you color choice.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other concealers, they don&#x27;t work well under the eye, they&lt;br /&gt;are</li>
            <li> I have an olive undertone to my skin, as well as dark spots and this does the trick at covering but not</li>
            <li> This is small, convenient size.  </li>
            <li> I have tried both, and would seriously consider returning it if I hadn&#x27;t misplaced my receipt.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed it when she demonstrated its consistency due to the awful lighting in the store,  but after a while I began to notice a cakey look under my eyes and especially when I applied this over red areas in my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, or those of you who have given negative ratings</li>
            <li> I ordered wrong color</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t blame the seller and give bad reviews because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it dries out my skin under my eyes SO BAD.</li>
            <li> Have never been disappointed in any purchase from them.</li>
            <li> It looks like cracked marble after a couple of hours :(</li>
            <li> i also use it as an eyeshadow base and it holds eyeshadow in place all day.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great. Goes on smoothly, looks natural and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals. I have an olive undertone to my skin, as well as dark spots and this does the trick at covering but not so it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;m trying to do so.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, or those of you who have given negative ratings -I&#x27;m telling you, you are using the products incorrectly. This is high quality stuff and made to last. If it wears off, looks smudgy or caked or itchy or any of the complaints I&#x27;ve read, its from incorrect use. Do your work with these amazing products, look up the proper tutorials on youtube, go into a Bare Escentuals boutique and ask a technician. Less is more. I cant express it any simpler than that. Most people with problems with Bare Minerals is their own fault for using the products as you would most other cosmetics. Don&#x27;t blame the seller and give bad reviews because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this concealer is great for those of us who have blemish problems and cant mask them discreetly with just the Bisque or another powder. Light 2 is actually the lighter shade, just FYI. Light 1 is for those with a warmer-fair complexion.</li>
            <li> The concealer covers pretty well but made me break out which is unusual because I use other bare minerals products and have no issues.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Escentuals product line.  It is the only makeup line I use. Have never been disappointed in any purchase from them.</li>
            <li> Excelent product....it doesnt sink in on my wrinkles and it has medium coverage for underehe circles and age spots. Flows easily.</li>
            <li> this is a very good concealer and I am able to wear it with no problem.  I have a lot of allergies and this covers without causing problems.</li>
            <li> I wish it had come with an applicator of some kind.  It conceals very well. It is true to color.</li>
            <li> Creamiest concealer ever</li>
            <li> It was good as an under-eye concealer; however it didn&#x27;t cover dark spots on my cheeks and nose very well.</li>
            <li> This concealer blends well, is easy to use, offers MAXIMUM coverage. I just wish it came in a bigger container!</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark circles around my eyes and this product is the absolute best I have found to cover. It goes on creamy to ensure coverage and then dries into powder so that it doesn&#x27;t create lines and creases. I apply with a Sephora brand &amp;#34;Pro Airbrush Concealer&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> Great concealer. Cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 so far, it is so creamy and light but great for under the eyes</li>
            <li> I love the quality of all Bare Escentuals!! The concealer does what it should do...conceal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve always used Sephora&#x27;s concealer which is very comparable but this is more affordable. It came quickly and I&#x27;m definitely switching to this from now on! Very creamy and great coverage!</li>

            <li> This is fabulous concealer...i also use it as an eyeshadow base and it holds eyeshadow in place all day.  I bought the Light 2 and should have bought the medium, as it is a bit light for me...but, i still use it.</li>
            <li> Hard to choose a color online, but effective concealer if you think it will match your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair, sensitive, oily skin, and this is seriously the only concealer I have EVER used that matches my skin tone, blends smoothly and evenly, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out! I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer. . .use it with my mineral makeup and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item before, so I knew what I was getting.  I really like it a lot.  I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals products for years, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about cosmetics.  I have sensitive, acne prone skin, and I&#x27;ve been pleased with this product, and their line of products. I have fair to medium skin tone, and very little time in the sun, and this color works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a concealer like this for a while, but did not realize one was made by Bare Escentuals.  This is small, convenient size.  It&#x27;s easy to use with just the tip of your finger.  I have tried it both under and over foundation and it seems to work just as well.  As expected with Bare Escentuals, it provides great coverage without feeling weighty.</li>
            <li> I bought it together with foundation and final touch Veil. This one ($14.45) and Veil ($12.99) are in 2 g (0.7 oz) size and the foundation ($18.44) is in 1.6 oz size.  I was surprised that women&#x27;s cosmetics is so expensive, but the result looks OK.  My wife likes it that counts.</li>
            <li> I ordered wrong color and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s the best conceler</li>
            <li> I was going to go to the local boutique to get the correct color but didn&#x27;t because I felt it did not cover well even in small areas.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer.  Best I have ever used</li>
            <li> This stuff if a lifesaver for the days I want a little more coverage and help hiding a breakout!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product....I loved the pricing, quality packaging, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the only concealer I use. Five stars!!</li>
            <li> I apply once in the morning and it makes me look younger. I wish I could bring it closer to my lash line but it will make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my married daughter. She loves Bare Escentuals make up. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this concealer, but be sure you know you color choice.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how to use this product. I am a HUGE bareMinerals fan, and up until a few months ago I never used any product other than theirs. I find that I get the best coverage by applying a thin consistency concealer first (I use maybelline fit me), apply my foundation (I use a liquid) set it with the bareMinerals foundation powder, and then use this. It works wonders over a powder! I am thankful I didn&#x27;t throw it out, but it took like two years to figure out how to use this, and now that I know I love it! bareMinerals makes such good products!</li>
            <li> I spoke with a woman at Ulta who recommended this product as a concealer for both over and under makeup. I have tried both, and would seriously consider returning it if I hadn&#x27;t misplaced my receipt. I hadn&#x27;t noticed it when she demonstrated its consistency due to the awful lighting in the store,  but after a while I began to notice a cakey look under my eyes and especially when I applied this over red areas in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this with a concealer brush, patting it in with my fingers, and even attempting to blend it with a damp brush as one Youtube guru suggested. This product doesn&#x27;t seem to cover much (the dark areas under my eyes and on either side of my nose). It&#x27;s almost as though it just disappears, and leaves a noticeably cakiness in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does absolutely nothing for the redness on my cheeks and chin, either. Not only that, but by the end of the day, it has settled into creases under my eyes and around any blemishes I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used this up and can move on to something else. I might even just accept the loss and replace it with something that actually works for me. Hopefully others have had better luck with this product than I have.</li>
            <li> Love, love this. Happy to get it on line!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta after a lady there recommended it strongly. It covers and looks great but it dries out my skin under my eyes SO BAD. It looks like cracked marble after a couple of hours :( So sad because I really love bare minerals</li>
            <li> I love all the products by Bare Escentuals.  This one is exceptionally good, often&lt;br /&gt;when I have purchased other concealers, they don&#x27;t work well under the eye, they&lt;br /&gt;are either too light or too dark.  This one, in medium, was perfect!</li>
