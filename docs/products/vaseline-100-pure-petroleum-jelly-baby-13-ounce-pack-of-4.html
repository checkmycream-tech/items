            <li>I love the Vaseline brand of petroluem jelly.  </li>
            <li>So convenient and much more sanitary than a tub of Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I know many use this for their infants</li>
            <li>This is one more example.  </li>
            <li>A tube is without a doubt the most hygienic way to store and dispense Vaseline.</li>
            <li>much more convenient than jumbo jars of  Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything that would make it better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a plastic (not metal) tube with a clicky cap on the end which makes usage more convenient and more sanitary.</li>
            <li>Unlike a metal tube or jar, it&#x27;s more durable and won&#x27;t get damaged if dropped.</li>
            <li>I like the squeeze tube as it is more sanitary and baby has never had a reaction.</li>
            <li>Recommended to is in birth class and glad we had it on hand.</li>

            <li>Love the convenient squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>The tube top doesn&#x27;t clog and the vaseline comes out with ease.</li>
            <li>Love this for my lips.</li>
            <li>Was dying to find this product and have to admit it is just ok.</li>
            <li>it is just ok.</li>
            <li>Good size for the first aid kit.</li>
            <li>good price.. very convenient to have a tube for vaseline!</li>
            <li>Easy to portion and sealed from the environment, I love the tube.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with the tubs of vaseline, this tube style packaging makes it even better.</li>
            <li>Easy to grab and use.  </li>
            <li>the same great Vaseline jelly as always.</li>
            <li>but now they stay smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just good old fashion Vaseline.</li>
            <li>The tube is small, put perfect for my use.</li>
            <li>It keeps the Vaseline inside clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the wintertime when your lips and nose get dry....</li>
            <li>It helped to wipe the baby&#x27;s first tar like stools off easily.</li>
            <li>True to Vaseline&#x27;s reputation, the petroleum jelly is pure and free of any sort of debris or variation in quality/</li>
            <li>Wish i had it with my first baby!</li>
            <li>Is free too much to ask?</li>
            <li>Useful for our baby&#x27;s rashes.</li>
            <li>Not as good as products designed specifically for rashes, but much cheaper, so economical to have several tubes lying around.</li>
            <li>was not able to find this size in any store so this works great fits in my running bag</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the hairball remedy made for pets and those things have inactive ingredients that are not very healthy for our pets.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>They tubes are exactly as described and arrived timely.</li>
            <li>And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Observed long ago that that&#x27;s what they use in most hospitals I&#x27;ve visited.</li>
            <li>I have found keeping certain problem areas covered with petroleum jelly, allows it to heal.  </li>
            <li>I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Just Vaseline but much easier to.</li>
            <li>It also may be partially responsible for no lines or wrinkles around and/or under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff stays on there rain or snow and really doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied too often.</li>
            <li>You can tell a real lack of quality when you switch brands.  </li>
            <li>Save my hands during whole winter.</li>
            <li>You can squeeze out exactly as much you need without dipping a finger or Q-Tip into the fray.  </li>
            <li>So much for the container.</li>
            <li>Squeezable tube is very sanitary, and shipping was on time.</li>
            <li>Vaseline in a tube is much easier and tidier to use than in a jar.</li>
            <li>Let them just lick a bit from the tube, once they figure out you&#x27;ll squeeze out as fast as they lick, they&#x27;ll start licking the fool out of the opening.</li>
            <li>this tube version is awesome for travel and delivers a small amount without the mess.</li>
            <li>Jars of Vaseline always get so messy, so this little tube is a great way to access just the right amount without the remainder getting gooped up.</li>
            <li>I use Vaseline on my chapped lips, and the tube is so much easier and more sanitary than digging into a little jar.</li>
            <li>I am 68, wash my face only with warm water after removing eye make-up, and have never had a facelift or any other cosmetic procedures on my face or around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I live in one of the coldest cities in the U.S.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  </li>
            <li>I finally figured out I can give my cats and dogs 100% pure petroleum jelly to encourage them to groom themselves and keep away hairballs.</li>
            <li>Petroleum jelly has so many uses that it is hard to list all of them.</li>
            <li>It is SO SO much easier to get out of a tube versus dipping out of a tub and contaminating the entire thing.</li>
            <li>No messy jar.  </li>
            <li>I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean.</li>
            <li>(Vaseline or any generic brand as long as it says 100% petroleum jelly) Don&#x27;t squeeze out a whole lot in the beginning.</li>
            <li>One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover.</li>

            <li> (Vaseline or any generic brand as long as it says 100% petroleum jelly) Don&#x27;t squeeze out a whole lot in the beginning.</li>
            <li> One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have tried like fifteen different eye makeup removers and this is the only one my eyes can tolerate long term.</li>
            <li> and you can use it on dry skin ,, rash and more ... can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
            <li> In recent years, Vaseline has gotten more expensive and harder to find in bulk discounts.</li>
            <li> regular plain old vaseline is the ONLY thing that keeps my lips from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area</li>
            <li> and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  </li>
            <li> I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only.</li>
            <li> The tube vaseline is a lot softer and does not stay on your teeth for long.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients in it also makes the whole tube go bad once it&#x27;s been opened for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Skin gets dry the day after</li>
            <li> so dry skin is always an issue for me.</li>
            <li> keep this in my handbag for use when hands get dry away from home.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> A few years back, I smeared Vaseline Petroleum Jelly on the outside bottom of the boxes to see if that would deter them.  </li>
            <li> Harder to squeeze out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s petroleum jelly, not much to review about it.</li>
            <li> It is Vaseline, it does what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> Harder to squeeze out than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> not used this yet, as our class keeps getting post poned due to illness, never had problems with it before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become increasingly difficult to find the large vaseline tubes in the stores</li>
            <li> Like the tube less messy</li>
            <li> but I did get a little blemish on my chin</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday, I put it on my knuckles before I wrap my hands for boxing class.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> but it was so messy in that tub.  </li>
            <li> I wonder why so few stores carry the tube instead of the ubiquitous tub.</li>
            <li> that seems very odd to me.</li>

            <li> Just Vaseline but much easier to. Use.  I use at night as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Many uses for this, so we keep a tube handy all the time</li>
            <li> I use it to remove eye make-up -- and have used it for this for years.  I would not use anything else and I trust only the Vaseline brand.  It also may be partially responsible for no lines or wrinkles around and/or under my eyes.  I am 68, wash my face only with warm water after removing eye make-up, and have never had a facelift or any other cosmetic procedures on my face or around my eyes.  I also like this squeeze tube.  It keeps the Vaseline inside clean.  I just squeeze a small amount onto a fingertip to apply to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition.  I have found keeping certain problem areas covered with petroleum jelly, allows it to heal.  These are convenient for my desk at work, rather than a jar.</li>
            <li> Works great and the shipper, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I use this for two things. One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover. I have tried like fifteen different eye makeup removers and this is the only one my eyes can tolerate long term. Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use. But not this. I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean. And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Weird reason to buy this but  I actually utilized this as a squirrel deterrent for my bird feeder and does this do the trick!! I&#x27;ve tried everything to outwit the sneaky pests but using this vaseline to grease the pole has left my bird feeder unmolested ever since. This stuff stays on there rain or snow and really doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied too often. I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;m not spending $$ all the time on replacement birdseed and my birds are able to get nice and fat for upcoming  winter!</li>
            <li> It is SO SO much easier to get out of a tube versus dipping out of a tub and contaminating the entire thing.</li>
            <li> Like the tube less messy</li>
            <li> My little guy loves this tub!! Wish i had it with my first baby!</li>
            <li> I use vaseline every day!</li>
            <li> Great petroleum jelly in a tube.....much more convenient that in a jar. .</li>
            <li> the same great Vaseline jelly as always. Three stars because of the design-- the tube just doesn&#x27;t make it easier to use, especially in the winter or if your office runs AC in a low temp and the jelly gets stuck at the opening.</li>
            <li> Great Vaseline for skin, but I bought it to put it on my teeth to prevent stains. The tube vaseline is a lot softer and does not stay on your teeth for long. Get the ones in the pods if you intend to use them on your teeth.</li>
            <li> great for feet with socks at night</li>
            <li> I love the Vaseline brand of petroluem jelly.  You can tell a real lack of quality when you switch brands.  It&#x27;s become increasingly difficult to find the large vaseline tubes in the stores and I was very happy to find this vendor on Amazon.  They tubes are exactly as described and arrived timely.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday, I put it on my knuckles before I wrap my hands for boxing class. My knuckles were getting rubbed raw from boxing but now they stay smooth.</li>
            <li> So convenient and much more sanitary than a tub of Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I&#x27;m usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is the perfect size for the diaper bag and great for travel.</li>
            <li> This products works well with my skin. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This was a bigger tube then I thought.  Great product though.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done great for your feet</li>
            <li> I order many things online that are difficult to find locally.  This is one more example.  Like the tube for travels.</li>
            <li> not used this yet, as our class keeps getting post poned due to illness, never had problems with it before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our baby&#x27;s circumcision care. Our pediatrician recommended a tube instead of a jar you have to put your fingers in.  This is so much more sanitary and easy to use!  It&#x27;s also great for packing, as it doesn&#x27;t leak like the jars sometimes do.</li>
            <li> regular plain old vaseline is the ONLY thing that keeps my lips from getting chapped. this tube version is awesome for travel and delivers a small amount without the mess.</li>
            <li> Skin gets dry the day after</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for the usual reasons.  I have Bluebird boxes outside and, in the spring, the wasps like to attach nests under the boxes.  A few years back, I smeared Vaseline Petroleum Jelly on the outside bottom of the boxes to see if that would deter them.  It works!!  Every spring I go out with the tube and repeat the procedure.  Haven&#x27;t had a wasp problem since.</li>
            <li> A tube is without a doubt the most hygienic way to store and dispense Vaseline. This belongs in every household.</li>
            <li> much more convenient than jumbo jars of  Vaseline. makes application to wounds and bandages easier.</li>
            <li> Good, slim travel size and not too oily.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and convenient presentation !</li>
            <li> What can you say about Vaseline?</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a bit cheaper. I can&#x27;t think of anything that would make it better. Except maybe a lower price. Is free too much to ask?</li>
            <li> I live in one of the coldest cities in the U.S. so dry skin is always an issue for me. I use it on my hands, elbows, and lips, and it always does the trick!</li>
            <li> Great size - just what we needed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for use at the hospital with my newborn. It helped to wipe the baby&#x27;s first tar like stools off easily. Anyone who&#x27;s had a baby knows how hard that is.</li>
            <li> Petroleum jelly has so many uses that it is hard to list all of them. I use it for a variety of different things and have historically used the Vaseline brand whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2.5oz tube is really nice compared to most of the packaging petroleum jelly comes in. It&#x27;s a plastic (not metal) tube with a clicky cap on the end which makes usage more convenient and more sanitary. Unlike a metal tube or jar, it&#x27;s more durable and won&#x27;t get damaged if dropped. True to Vaseline&#x27;s reputation, the petroleum jelly is pure and free of any sort of debris or variation in quality/consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, this is a super good price compared to most stores. In recent years, Vaseline has gotten more expensive and harder to find in bulk discounts. So this is a great find for anyone needing Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Using on my eyelashes nightly.  Great results.</li>
            <li> Works great and couldnt find this in stores</li>
            <li> Perfect for those early days of diaper changes. I like the squeeze tube as it is more sanitary and baby has never had a reaction. Recommended to is in birth class and glad we had it on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just good old fashion Vaseline. Harder to squeeze out then I thought.</li>
            <li> This is great for diaper bags.  Easy to grab and use.  No messy jar.  Those I save for home.  Price was good as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all i use and have for years.  Observed long ago that that&#x27;s what they use in most hospitals I&#x27;ve visited.</li>
            <li> I use Vaseline on my chapped lips, and the tube is so much easier and more sanitary than digging into a little jar.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  Save my hands during whole winter.</li>
            <li> was not able to find this size in any store so this works great fits in my running bag</li>
            <li> Maybe this is giving up my age but I recall the yellow pots of Vaseline always being in the medicine cabinet.  There are so many uses for Vaseline but it was so messy in that tub.  This squeeze package is brilliant.  You can squeeze out exactly as much you need without dipping a finger or Q-Tip into the fray.  I&#x27;ll never buy the tub again.</li>
            <li> Just buy regular Vaseline</li>
            <li> This is the best Vaseline you can buy!  Love this size as I carry one in the van and at work as I need moisturizer on my hands and this works wonderful.  Love the size and price!</li>
            <li> Like the handy squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> keep this in my handbag for use when hands get dry away from home.&lt;br /&gt;Nice size, excellent product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to use and you can put it in your pocket and carry it with you.  It&#x27;s great for the wintertime when your lips and nose get dry....it keeps them moist and lasts keeping your lips moist.</li>
            <li> I wonder why so few stores carry the tube instead of the ubiquitous tub. Easy to portion and sealed from the environment, I love the tube. So much for the container. About the contents: Vaseline is Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Love the convenient squeeze tube. Vaseline makes a great petroleum jelly product. My skin is thankful!</li>
            <li> Perfect way to package a great-as-always product. If you&#x27;re familiar with the tubs of vaseline, this tube style packaging makes it even better. No more sticking your finger and contaminating a jar! The tube top doesn&#x27;t clog and the vaseline comes out with ease. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> works great on anything ...its Vaseline and you can use it on dry skin ,, rash and more ... can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
            <li> Useful for our baby&#x27;s rashes. Not as good as products designed specifically for rashes, but much cheaper, so economical to have several tubes lying around.</li>
            <li> Love this for my lips. I use this after I get out of the shower and it helps keep them hydrated. Great for the winter too!</li>
            <li> Jars of Vaseline always get so messy, so this little tube is a great way to access just the right amount without the remainder getting gooped up.</li>
            <li> Good size for the first aid kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s petroleum jelly, not much to review about it. Thanks for the quick shipping. The tube is small, put perfect for my use.</li>
            <li> no seal.  that seems very odd to me. but we checked one bought at the store, and it didn&#x27;t have a seal either.  so we&#x27;re using it. no problems.  the tube is WAAAAAAAY easier to use.</li>
            <li> Use this for tattoos. Works great. Squeezable tube is very sanitary, and shipping was on time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Vaseline in a tube is much easier and tidier to use than in a jar.</li>
            <li> It is Vaseline, it does what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> good price.. very convenient to have a tube for vaseline!</li>
            <li> I finally figured out I can give my cats and dogs 100% pure petroleum jelly to encourage them to groom themselves and keep away hairballs. (Vaseline or any generic brand as long as it says 100% petroleum jelly) Don&#x27;t squeeze out a whole lot in the beginning. Let them just lick a bit from the tube, once they figure out you&#x27;ll squeeze out as fast as they lick, they&#x27;ll start licking the fool out of the opening. I&#x27;m happy because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the hairball remedy made for pets and those things have inactive ingredients that are not very healthy for our pets.  The other ingredients in it also makes the whole tube go bad once it&#x27;s been opened for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> great consistency, long-lasting effect.</li>
            <li> Was dying to find this product and have to admit it is just ok. Harder to squeeze out than I thought it would be. Still it keeps you from getting on your fingers. All in all it is just ok.</li>
            <li> What can I say it petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s petroleum jelly, what can I say.  Can&#x27;t go won&#x27;t</li>
