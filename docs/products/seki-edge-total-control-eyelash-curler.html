            <li>ONE IS THE BEST!</li>
            <li>but once I sorted that out, I&#x27;ve been very pleased!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Best of all, this device made it easy to conquer those hard-to-curl outer lashes.  </li>
            <li>; I just had to figure out why she loved it</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>but once you figure out a technique of some sort, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>but as I use it more and more I am getting great results on the lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>There is a replacement pad included in the handle, which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a couple more as backups for sure!</li>
            <li>Love love love!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>The lower lashes are a bit more challenging</li>

            <li>Once was NOT too many.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I no longer have &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; lashes- with this curler, I can actually do precisely that</li>

            <li>time was too many.</li>
            <li>I do love that it is cageless and gets every one of my lashes</li>
            <li>I love this curler.  </li>
            <li>I found it was available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I have lovely, curled eyelashes again.</li>
            <li>Great results with this new one!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool looking, but it just didn&#x27;t curl my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I loved this curler so much, I wanted another one, but couldn&#x27;t find one for sale ANYWHERE, not even on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I also like how it folds up and stashes easily in my travel cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly because it does half the eye at a time.</li>
            <li>One-size-fits-all Eyelash curlers don&#x27;t work for everyone, and if you&#x27;re one of those people that they don&#x27;t fit, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>) Cage free - no side bars that could pull out my lashes&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The pads and curling part were okay, but the frame was big and prevented me from getting a good fit.  </li>
            <li>The seki edge curler takes some practice, but now it&#x27;s quite easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I can put it in my purse and it stays clean.</li>
            <li>So, I reserved it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>This product was highly reviewed by a blogger who I have a lot of respect for (yeah, Phyrra!), and I generally love the things she recommends, so I had to keep trying with this</li>
            <li>I tried to decide what kind of professional might repair the handle.</li>
            <li>The wife says it took some getting used to, but now likes and prefers it to the old fashioned kind that looks like the one my mother used.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best eyelash curler I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The best part is that I can curl the outside and inside lashes separately-couldn&#x27;t do that with the standard curlers.  </li>
            <li>you conquer that stuff, you will find that you can get fabulous control over what you curl, and how much you curl it!</li>
            <li>I tried others that were wide and they wouldn&#x27;t produce a good curl/crimp.</li>
            <li>I do use the blow dryer on it briefly first.  </li>
            <li>but this one you have to have a good 5 min not like the traditional eyelash curler where you only need a minute...</li>
            <li>I only need to use light to medium pressure to get a nice soft curve on the upper lashes.  </li>
            <li>(and, secure in the knowledge I had a new one, attempted a repair on my old one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely give it 5 stars now.</li>
            <li>It took me about 3 days to really get the hang of using this.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not crimping as much.</li>
            <li>It really curls my lashes without much effort.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you how really I feel about this</li>
            <li>It can be a little challenging to use at first, because it lacks the \\&quot;frame\\&quot; of the old-fashioned curlers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not losing as many lashes as I did previously</li>
            <li>is the only curler I&#x27;ve been able to find anywhere that comes close to my Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>I have complete control over how much curl I want</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a negative comment.</li>
            <li>So, one of those little thoughtful surprise gifts that was appreciated.  </li>
            <li>New (correct)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m buying new pads for this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Bought a Revlon curler to use till I get the new pads</li>
            <li>tried to figure out how it could be repaired or if I could somehow cast a new handle in plastic and replace it.</li>
            <li>You must get up close and personal with your eye; the first several times you must really watch your position, and get over the urge to blink while you are situating your lashes between the pad and the curling bar, so that you don&#x27;t poke yourself in the eye.</li>
            <li>Having said that, using a little more care (and a magnifying mirror - I&#x27;m over 50) I can curl the inner and outer edges of my eyelashes separately.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have a steadier hand while doing this, I don&#x27;t (and I wore contacts for years, so I&#x27;m not squeamish about stuff near my eye).</li>
            <li>I guess I needed to try this to appreciate the old style type of eyelash curler that&#x27;s been around forever.</li>
            <li>Love the open edge design of this curler, no more pinching the corners of the eye or pulling out the outer lashes.</li>
            <li>it really makes my lashes so long</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are long, blonde, and fairly straight.</li>
            <li>Thin top - by this</li>
            <li>I know this is sounding crazy, but that&#x27;s how much I loved it.</li>
            <li>Remember not to hold down for too long, it curls your lashes really quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not pinching myself with this one nearly as much as I did with the other type of curler.</li>
            <li>Finally, it&#x27;s more comfortable to use than traditional curlers (less awkward feeling).  </li>
            <li>The rubber insert seems higher quality than I&#x27;ve seen in other products-should last a long time (seki comes with a spare just in case).  </li>
            <li>will say that while I have wildly curly hair, my eyelashes are stick straight and hard to curl -- go figure.  </li>

            <li> I finally decided to try this after I got tired of all the curlers I bought being too large.</li>
            <li> /&gt;****My original (wrong)</li>
            <li> After buying several other curlers, I stumbled upon this one and it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> I mean the top portion that presses into the bottom pad had to be thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d try to hold the handle above the crack (which was slight) in order to avoid making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was because I was so accustomed to using the other type of eyelash curler, that I just wasn&#x27;t used to this, and needed to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a lot of thought, because I didn&#x27;t want to do something to make it worse, break it altogether, or make the wrong decision so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I filed down the sharp part on the edge, and tried, tried, tried again.&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve with this product.</li>
            <li> With conventional lash curlers, the frame can rest in/on your eye socket/lid;</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something similar.</li>
            <li> It is shorter than the average drugstore variety</li>
            <li> It has a lot nicer result when you pulse, instead of holding it down.</li>
            <li> metal curling edge of this is really sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several variations of the standard eyelash curler but have  been frustrated because the lashes on the outer portion of my right eye always curl at a weird angle.  </li>
            <li> It cut some of my lashes in half!</li>
            <li> I like this, was a little hard to get onto how to hold it....</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s hard to brace your hand so that this product doesn&#x27;t hit you in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;Never.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time trying to find an eye lash curler that fits my eye shape.</li>
            <li> This thing is a real piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat inset small eyes and using a traditional eyelash curler was very difficult!</li>
            <li> They tended to pinch my outer eye skin, not get close enough to the base of my lashes  and do funky curls on the lashes closest to my nose...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten comments over the years about my lashes, even being asked it they were fake.</li>
            <li> Without that, it can be difficult to gauge where to place this one before you close it, and if you gauge wrong - OUCH!  </li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> BUT unfortunately it does not work!!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several variations of the standard eyelash curler but have  been frustrated because the lashes on the outer portion of my right eye always curl at a weird angle.  After searching the internet for reviews, I settled on the Seki.  It can be a little challenging to use at first, because it lacks the \\&quot;frame\\&quot; of the old-fashioned curlers.  Without that, it can be difficult to gauge where to place this one before you close it, and if you gauge wrong - OUCH!  Having said that, using a little more care (and a magnifying mirror - I&#x27;m over 50) I can curl the inner and outer edges of my eyelashes separately.  One-size-fits-all Eyelash curlers don&#x27;t work for everyone, and if you&#x27;re one of those people that they don&#x27;t fit, give this one a try.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Love love love!  It took a try to two to figure out the best pressure to use but once I sorted that out, I&#x27;ve been very pleased!  I have somewhat inset small eyes and using a traditional eyelash curler was very difficult! They tended to pinch my outer eye skin, not get close enough to the base of my lashes  and do funky curls on the lashes closest to my nose...  Great results with this new one!  I only need to use light to medium pressure to get a nice soft curve on the upper lashes.  The lower lashes are a bit more challenging but as I use it more and more I am getting great results on the lower lashes.  Love love love!</li>
            <li> Love the open edge design of this curler, no more pinching the corners of the eye or pulling out the outer lashes.</li>
            <li> I like this, was a little hard to get onto how to hold it....but it does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler EVER.  Period.  I was able to use a lot of pressure without any pinching. Best of all, this device made it easy to conquer those hard-to-curl outer lashes.  Finally, it&#x27;s more comfortable to use than traditional curlers (less awkward feeling).  Buy it...you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I give this Eyelash Curler 1 star because I like the idea of it.... and the look! BUT unfortunately it does not work!!!!! I have tried every Eyelash Curler out there and thought maybe this time.... I guess I&#x27;m going back to my Maybeline Eyelash Curler with the lighter to heat it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She has large eyes and has always complained that she cannot find an eyelash curler that she felt reached from corner to corner of her eye.  She loves this one and says it does the trick.</li>
            <li> ****I have edited this review****&lt;br /&gt;****My New (correct) Review****&lt;br /&gt;Okay. Once was NOT too many. I have totally changed my mind about this eyelash curler. I absolutely give it 5 stars now. This product was highly reviewed by a blogger who I have a lot of respect for (yeah, Phyrra!), and I generally love the things she recommends, so I had to keep trying with this; I just had to figure out why she loved it and I hated it. So I filed down the sharp part on the edge, and tried, tried, tried again.&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve with this product. You have to get used to not having anything to brace your hand/the curler on. With conventional lash curlers, the frame can rest in/on your eye socket/lid; not so with this one. You must get up close and personal with your eye; the first several times you must really watch your position, and get over the urge to blink while you are situating your lashes between the pad and the curling bar, so that you don&#x27;t poke yourself in the eye. Now that I have a steadier hand while doing this, I don&#x27;t (and I wore contacts for years, so I&#x27;m not squeamish about stuff near my eye). It just takes practice.&lt;br /&gt;Once you conquer that stuff, you will find that you can get fabulous control over what you curl, and how much you curl it! I am thrilled that I no longer have &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; lashes- with this curler, I can actually do precisely that: CURL my stick-straight, curl resistant eyelashes! And the curl lasts! I love, love, love this curler. I am ordering another so that I&#x27;m never without. This is seriously the best eyelash curler I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I threw out all of my others. I had 15 of them. No lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****My original (wrong) review****&lt;br /&gt;The metal curling edge of this is really sharp! It cut some of my lashes in half! Also, it&#x27;s hard to brace your hand so that this product doesn&#x27;t hit you in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;Never. Using. It. Again.&lt;br /&gt;One time was too many. If I could give this zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the regular metal-frame eyelash curlers with side-bars pinched my eyelids(Shuemura, sephora, maybelline). The seki edge curler takes some practice, but now it&#x27;s quite easy and quick. The rubber insert seems higher quality than I&#x27;ve seen in other products-should last a long time (seki comes with a spare just in case).  The best part is that I can curl the outside and inside lashes separately-couldn&#x27;t do that with the standard curlers.  The closing cover is awesome. I can put it in my purse and it stays clean. The one star short is because it takes practice. I&#x27;m not too graceful, so perhaps others will train themselves sooner.</li>
            <li> FINALLY - I have been searching for a second \\&quot;cageless\\&quot; eyelash curler (no bars on the side) that can go in my purse/travel kit. I use the Urban Decay \\&quot;Revolution\\&quot; lash curler daily but it&#x27;s been discontinued so I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something similar. After buying several other curlers, I stumbled upon this one and it&#x27;s a winner. I needed to achieve the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cage free - no side bars that could pull out my lashes&lt;br /&gt;2) Metal - needed to be metal because I heat my curler in order to get my lashes to stay curled&lt;br /&gt;3) Thin top - by this I mean the top portion that presses into the bottom pad had to be thin.I tried others that were wide and they wouldn&#x27;t produce a good curl/crimp. (Keep in mind, I don&#x27;t mean the length from left to right, I&#x27;m talking about the actual thickness of the metal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only curler I&#x27;ve been able to find anywhere that comes close to my Urban Decay. I&#x27;ll be buying a couple more as backups for sure!</li>
            <li> I do love that it is cageless and gets every one of my lashes but this one you have to have a good 5 min not like the traditional eyelash curler where you only need a minute...</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used. I have complete control over how much curl I want and it allows me to get every lash and fan out the ones on the sides.</li>
            <li> ADDENDUM: About 2 years later and I&#x27;m buying new pads for this eyelash curler. Bought a Revlon curler to use till I get the new pads and I reemember why I switched. Bought 2 packages of pad refills for the Seki so I obviously still like it. JenQ 4-23-2016  I finally decided to try this after I got tired of all the curlers I bought being too large. The pads and curling part were okay, but the frame was big and prevented me from getting a good fit.  It took me about 3 days to really get the hang of using this. It is shorter than the average drugstore variety so you have to curl in 2 portions. It also doesn&#x27;t curl as sharply as a regular curler, but that seems like an advantage. I&#x27;m not losing as many lashes as I did previously and I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not crimping as much. I&#x27;m also not pinching myself with this one nearly as much as I did with the other type of curler. There is a replacement pad included in the handle, which is a nice touch. I also like how it folds up and stashes easily in my travel cosmetic bag. This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time trying to find an eye lash curler that fits my eye shape. Yes, I am Asian. This works perfectly because it does half the eye at a time. It does take some getting used to but once you figure out a technique of some sort, it is amazing. Remember not to hold down for too long, it curls your lashes really quick. It has a lot nicer result when you pulse, instead of holding it down.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an eyelash curler without sides or a &amp;#34;cage&amp;#34; like the design of this one. This does not curl my eyelashes at all. I did not know it was possible for an eyelash curler to do nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same curler for years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing compares to this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been recommending this to everyone for almost 20 years!&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find, haven&#x27;t seen one in years, so happy to have found one!&lt;br /&gt;Lifesaver!</li>
            <li> it really makes my lashes so long</li>
            <li> I love this curler.  It really curls my lashes without much effort. I do use the blow dryer on it briefly first.  I have had to replace it twuce but it holds up rather well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s very cool looking, but it just didn&#x27;t curl my lashes.  I thought maybe it was because I was so accustomed to using the other type of eyelash curler, that I just wasn&#x27;t used to this, and needed to give it a chance.  But after trying it every day for a week, it&#x27;s a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that while I have wildly curly hair, my eyelashes are stick straight and hard to curl -- go figure.  I guess I needed to try this to appreciate the old style type of eyelash curler that&#x27;s been around forever.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long, blonde, and fairly straight. I&#x27;ve gotten comments over the years about my lashes, even being asked it they were fake. (I&#x27;m not making this up.) Of course, I use mascara, and preferably, a curler. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of curlers, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ONE IS THE BEST! Let me tell you how really I feel about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these years ago--I can&#x27;t even remember when--and after some time, noticed a stress crack in the handle where you press the lever. BUT WAIT! That&#x27;s not a negative comment. I loved this curler so much, I wanted another one, but couldn&#x27;t find one for sale ANYWHERE, not even on Amazon.com. So, I reserved it for special occasions. I&#x27;d try to hold the handle above the crack (which was slight) in order to avoid making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to figure out how it could be repaired or if I could somehow cast a new handle in plastic and replace it. Maybe I could wrap it with something, like a cast to reinforce it. I tried to decide what kind of professional might repair the handle. I know this is sounding crazy, but that&#x27;s how much I loved it. I gave it a lot of thought, because I didn&#x27;t want to do something to make it worse, break it altogether, or make the wrong decision so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From time to time, I&#x27;d search the web, googling and googling to try to find one without any luck. I tried looking at Japanese sites and the manufacturer&#x27;s. No luck. Then, one day about 6 months ago, EUREKA! I found it was available on Amazon!  Of course, I bought one! (and, secure in the knowledge I had a new one, attempted a repair on my old one. It worked! so I have a back-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have lovely, curled eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife who curls her eyelashes - I don&#x27;t, never have and hopefully never will.  I follow a website called &amp;#34;Cool Tools&amp;#34;, and someone posted a favorable review of this.  So, one of those little thoughtful surprise gifts that was appreciated.  The wife says it took some getting used to, but now likes and prefers it to the old fashioned kind that looks like the one my mother used.</li>
            <li> This thing is a real piece of crap. You can&#x27;t get all your lashes in at once, and it leaves lashes crimped, not curled.</li>
