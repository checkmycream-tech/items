            <li> I bought this body spray thinking it was going to smell like coconut! When I recieved it, the body spray smelled of vanilla and I absolutley do not like the smell, it dissapointed me so bad! It was a major let down, and is was so misleading..</li>
            <li> Great service, just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I really love coconut scents for the summer but this was a let down.  It smelled kind of strange like a mixture of vanilla, a little coconut, and something I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  The scent is very light and wears off easily but I just did not like how it smelled on my skin.</li>
            <li> very good product , super excellent</li>
            <li> VERY NICE, A GOOD PRODUCT...</li>

            <li> Vanilla &amp; Coconut are my favorite scents.  I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect body spray that smells like true vanilla &amp; coconut. Either alone or combo. Haven&#x27;t found it yet. I detect pineapple &amp; other citruses in this spray. But smells nice, price is good &amp; shipped free.</li>
            <li> What a delightful body mist.  Love the tropical smell.  Victoria Secret has great Body Mists and this one is no exception.</li>

            <li> Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> This does smell more like vanila than coconut, but it is still a great smelling perfume. It seems to linger on you for awhile. I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> its smells really good but when i put it on in the morning before i go to school it loses its smell in like ten minutes</li>
            <li> This is the best scent. This is the best scent. Please buy it; it is well worth the cost. Your guy will love it.</li>
            <li> actually I always buy this fragrance because I like a lot is very good and is one of the most popular here where I live where it&#x27;s a city of Venezuela. I always recommend the encata.</li>
            <li> I love it! Its worth the price. It smells so good. Go ahead and buy it! U will never regret it!</li>
            <li> The name on it is vanilla coconut, but my daughter absolutely loves it and I as well think it smells yummy.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love it</li>
            <li> The product is very good. It&#x27;s in a good state.&lt;br /&gt;I proof it and I didn&#x27;t find any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this fragrance before, and was happy to replace it. But I do want to bring light in the description of what you&#x27;ll smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event a major scent is listed first....that means that&#x27;s the primary smell you&#x27;re sensing. The secondary is a subtle mixture...and since my smelling is insanely good...I can catch that \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of coconut. (reading what you buy isn&#x27;t a crime...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who enjoys smelling like a cake shop! Its a long lasting spray among the others similar to it.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, lo recomiendo</li>
