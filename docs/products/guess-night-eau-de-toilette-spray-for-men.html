            <li> Nice fragrance. I think more of an evening fragrance, but can be used for daytime also if applied lightly.</li>
            <li> I really love the sent of this new cologne:  spicy but fresh...like a cross between Armani Aqua di Gio and Obsession for Men.  I would give it five stars based on the scent alone but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Even so, it is relatively inexpensive and a great smell.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> smells awesome but does not last.</li>
            <li> Good smell and the product came as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft fragance. Its good</li>
            <li> I tried to like it. The scent is not really pleasant nor lasting. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great cologne ...so refreshing and smells sooooo good ...great eveyday cologne great job by guess ...it gives dolce and gabbana a run for its money</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Light, fresh, clean scent great for working during the day or at night for a night out on the town.  Fragrance lasts a long time.  I highly recommend!</li>

            <li> Wonderful product. I don&#x27;t know who made it. To me it&#x27;s not a top name cologne or a top brand... note that this is a steal. Great sent. The ladies will love it on your man. I believe though the price can be more affordable.</li>
            <li> Great buy and really enjoy it. Got lot compliments for the ladies. I WILL REODER WHEN I NEED TO !</li>
            <li> Will be giving this as a gift to my son.  He had a sample and received several compliments for it.</li>
