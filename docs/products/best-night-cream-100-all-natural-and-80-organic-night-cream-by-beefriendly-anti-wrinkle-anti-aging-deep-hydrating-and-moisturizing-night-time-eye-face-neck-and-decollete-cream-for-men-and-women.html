            <li>Feels good on my skin, smells good</li>

            <li>glad I found this :)</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>This is a VERY friendly night cream.</li>
            <li>but it is very rich..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this cream, and I plan on switching out all my face products to Bee Friendly Skincare products.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully moisturizing without any strange scents.</li>
            <li>Skin is very smooth, and fine lines gone.</li>
            <li>Great product, love how natural it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my skin which tends to be on a dry side.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and nice company follow up.  </li>
            <li>The seller delivered the product very quickly so I was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful night cream for dry skin</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s all natural makes me happy but there are better ones on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a really good night cream and the best thing I like about it is that It doesn&#x27;t leave and icky feeling on your face when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for natural ingredients and a nourishing, inside-out kind of healing experience for your skin, vs a quick-fix cosmetic approach, this could be a good option for you.</li>
            <li>This cream is so perfect for the dry Alaskan winters!</li>
            <li>There is no scent, so if you are sensitive to fragrance this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a great cream.</li>
            <li>It will leave your face smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>In theory it&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s all natural and it supports bee and olive oil woo</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks great after wearing this all night.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it makes my skin feel and how moisturized it is.</li>
            <li>I am perplexed how this works so well after so many products have not...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try night cream to see if it was an even better fit for me.</li>
            <li>My most favorite part is the sweet smell of honey on my skin...</li>
            <li>Smooth and non greasy :)</li>
            <li>Put it on my face when I dampen first, goes on and absorbs so well, delightful, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and clean product.  </li>
            <li>Love the Bee Friendly Night Cream and that it is all Natural/Organic.  </li>
            <li>I love this Bee Friendly Skincare cream.</li>
            <li>I received this cream after I wrote a review stating that their other cream was too greasy for me (great customer service)!  </li>

            <li>I also use it in the daytime, too, and once the oils have soaked in, makeup goes on fine.</li>
            <li>Helps reduce my fine lines.</li>
            <li>A little on the greasy side, so best used as night cream.</li>

            <li>Pleasant mild natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this cream; it at first seemed like I&#x27;d taken a stick of butter and lightly rolled it on to my skin -</li>
            <li>I put it on before bed, it goes on quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how it is still creamy and being bee friendly cream.  </li>
            <li>I was browsing around, looking for some night cream; then I ran into Bee Friendly night cream</li>
            <li>:) I would recommend it and will be buying more in the future! :)</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly</li>
            <li>I found Bee Friendly night cream to be everything as reported</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on all Bee Friendly  products and will be a customer for life.</li>
            <li>Rich moisturizer.....</li>
            <li>And else I bought Bee Friendly REJUVENATING AND ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZING  cream, so</li>
            <li>After seeing a dermatologist with all my skin care items in tow, they determined I have an allergy to beeswax and recommended I stop using the Bee Friendly products.  </li>
            <li>My first order of this lovely product never arrived.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much the first time that I ordered it again!</li>
            <li>After emails to Amazon Customer Service and the good folks at Bee Friendly Skincare, my account was credited the entire purchase price and I was was free to reorder...or not.</li>
            <li>Finally a cream that is natural with a great result!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs very fast!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>Nice feel and skin is soft!</li>
            <li>and my skin is great, not one dry spot!</li>
            <li>My wife is using night creams for the first time and loves this product, so much so she has asked me to order more!</li>
            <li>Specially when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Tried this product out because it was on sale for a special deal.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I am doing right by my face!</li>
            <li>I have purchased several times, and am delighted at the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too early to tell but it feels nice on my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li>Nice natural cream.</li>
            <li>This cream is lush and effective.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll stick to this nice natural cream.</li>
            <li>A bit too heavy for day use but at night, its ideal</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.</li>
            <li>natural ingredients and nice scent.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how nice the texture is.</li>
            <li>nice product, not to greasy and like the idea that it is all natural</li>
            <li>Be sure to gently rub in circles into your skin.</li>
            <li>Not a bad lotion if you just want moisture but don&#x27;t expect improvement in skin issues</li>
            <li>This cream goes on so easy, is light and yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products,  this is as good or better than the most expensive</li>
            <li>Fine wrinkles are gone, skin is soft, no breakouts or blackheads :).</li>
            <li>I am happy I gave this a try and would encourage anyone who has tried all of the other products that have not worked well, to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Its smooth and soaks in beautifully during the night, (during  lazy hours of the day too).</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>However, overnight, it really softens my skin and by the morning, most of the oiliness was gone and had absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>It is doing wonders for my overall appearance and promotes a youthful glow that I find very refreshing at my age (56).</li>
            <li>Thank for letting me try it at such good price, and love that its all natural.</li>
            <li>I love that all Bee Friendly  products are made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>And this product does a great job of making those wrinkles less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use many products: my eyes are very sensitive, and i get headaches.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>for me it is good because it is absorbed into my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not bad, but just not as good as the other reviews</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it works great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>Im really loving this Cream and the fact that it is Organic is a big plus!!</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel when i wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like that it is mostly organic and all natural.  </li>
            <li>A bit greasy on the skin, but worth the shine.</li>
            <li>My pores do looks smaller and my foundation is going on more smoothly in the morning.</li>
            <li>Some of the best cream I have used on my 61 yr old face that spent way too much time in the sun and surf.</li>
            <li>[I have Rosacea], quickly absorbed and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I actually love this natural smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and firm - I am very happy!</li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t find anything else that is so natural that works so great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>I use it at bedtime and wake up with fresh, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>useful for elbows, knees and heels.  </li>
            <li>I love how this makes my face feel when I put it on, and again it feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but so far I love it!!</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly were so curtious and fast to refund my money.</li>
            <li>I really like the Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li>had several friends get in on this order special and they all love this product.  </li>
            <li>Really nice skin cram, I felt the improvement to dry skin the first morning after I used it!</li>
            <li>I love that I am also able to use this cream on my little girls (2 &amp; 6) hands, lips and face and it does not sting their cheeks or eyes.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my skin feels soft, bright, refresh.  </li>
            <li>The Best Night Cream falls shy of the mark as it is waxy and just sits on your skin instead of being absorbed.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way as the write-up states and it does have a nice, honey scent that I find very pleasant especially in a night cream.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all</li>
            <li>and I would love to know what other products your company has available,</li>
            <li>It absorbs wonderfully, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The natural aroma of these products is also a huge plus as I always stay away from chemical</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>She also loves the gentle honey scent and I will be getting her another jar soon!</li>
            <li>#34;beauty is only skin deep&amp;#34;...  : )</li>
            <li>but you will wake up to incredibly soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>This product has a nourishing effect, and I enjoy being able to breathe deeply while I apply it - it has a &#x27;wholesome-ingredient, natural&#x27; aroma.</li>
            <li>I love the night cream will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>My daughters love it and can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li>my face looked hydrated, not greasy at all &amp; felt so smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user or this</li>
            <li>so much so, that I want to put it on in the morning too!</li>
            <li>Fantastic all natural skin cream.  </li>
            <li>Works, but it smells funny.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a lovely product</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have a &#x27;natural&#x27; product that actually works as one would hope.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural and organic, and makes my face feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Even though I knew nothing about this product, I decided to give it a try because of all the positive feedbacks.</li>
            <li>Just started using this wonderfully soft and sweet smelling cream.  </li>
            <li>NOT BAD, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>It seems it will last me quite a while as it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount to work.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>My face feels very supple.  </li>
            <li>but this cream is very luxurious and has no odor which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that it is organic.</li>
            <li>I really like this creme.</li>
            <li>It feels so like on my face, while also being very nurishing.</li>
            <li>This is a really moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>I really like the texture of the cream</li>
            <li>I really like these products.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go straight to bed after applying it, either, so that it absorbs into my skin instead of my pillow.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is still somewhat greasy, but it absorbs quite fast and it works while I sleep, so who cares.</li>
            <li>Since it is summer, very humid</li>
            <li>This cream really just melts into my skin but does not leave it greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Fast response if you have questions and very customer-friendly.</li>
            <li>I dont think anything really</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that is VERY greasy</li>
            <li>Feels very Oily and heave on a face for night, and not absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Pampering time for me, includes gently rubbing this cream into my face and neck areas.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Highly and enthusiastically recommended!</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin .</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much each application, so</li>
            <li>Thanks once again.</li>
            <li>It definitely is very hydrating</li>
            <li>(The price is incredibly reasonable as well).</li>
            <li>so much so, that I just bought the serum and face/eye cream as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This night cream really work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>has a very soothing, relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>It is very thick with unusual scent, not unpleasant, (for a cosmetic product) but very light, it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>Same with the scent; it&#x27;s a natural result of the mix of its clean and fresh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this one, Bee Friendly&#x27;s luscious and delicate night cream has vaulted to the top of the pile on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Will definitely try other Bee Friendly products :)</li>
            <li>Because I was suffering from eczema-like dryness around my nasolabial folds due to the forced-air heat in my home and Midwest winter, I searched for a healthy, natural/organic night cr√®me which was going to be a moisture-loss barrier on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I want to try other products in this line and buy more of this night cream for my mom and sisters.</li>
            <li>I have thirsty skin which needs an  extra moisture rich cream.</li>
            <li>This is the third Bee Friendly product I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Rich enough to recharge your skin overnight.</li>
            <li>so many other women, I&#x27;ve got an array of like products from which to choose.</li>
            <li>Very nice cream!  Thick and buttery, extremely emollient.  </li>
            <li>This amazing little cream is already firming everything up!</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest to anyone who can afford to pay the money for a single product.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way making it VERY reasonable price wise.</li>
            <li>I love a lavish and rich, yet subtle creamy treat for my face.  </li>
            <li>Nice to support small company that gets honey from bee keepers in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I have noticed quicker/ better results as far as getting the wrinkles to not be so visible, from other brands; but they definitely didn&#x27;t use completely natural, non-toxic chemicals &amp; they cost easily triple what this does.</li>
            <li>In the mornings I notice that the skin on my face feels smooth and refreshed without any dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it at all, to be honest; there&#x27;s no real &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to this night cream as there with similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and supple!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for results with it long-term.  </li>
            <li>I am 75 years young and have never looked my age so this will help me continue fooling people!!</li>
            <li>My face does feel a little more hydrated in the mornings.</li>
            <li>A little goes a lonnnng way, but when I need more of this type of product, I will be re-ordering this one.</li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>And I really like the fact that it the ingredients are mostly natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>but so far I can say it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels moist, fresh and younger in the morning.  </li>
            <li>the jar is going to last quite awhile, making it well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and didn&#x27;t start using it right away because I still had some of my old moisturizer - well I started using it and my whole face would get irritated and red.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; creams and lotions and still had dry skin especially around my nose.</li>
            <li>My skin has suffered over the years and after using this product for just one week, I have discovered very supple soft skin that feels and looks young again!</li>
            <li>I live in Minnesota</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural and bit highly fragranced as for results</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive mixed/dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an aesthetician for nearly 30 years and have used hundreds of different professional and department store products and none had the true natural moisturizing properties of these products.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use this at night, and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that really works, dry face, chest, hands.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, there was a difference in my neck the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past 5 months, most mornings and at night.  </li>
            <li>My first reaction was that it was not &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; enough, but I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>Smells funny, but I can tell a big difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I will try other products by Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li>The condition of my skin is improving and my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li>Soft and creamy, non-greasy, and leaves my skin glowing in the morning!</li>
            <li>This one works just as well, if not better than most.</li>
            <li>I love that the soft yellow color of this cream is natural and due to the ingredients and is not from the addition of chemical colors.</li>
            <li>Although the cream is rich and moisturizing,  I found it caused dark discoloration in places on my face and neck</li>
            <li>I am 60 years young and although no cream will return my skin to its 20 year young state, this cream makes my skin feel as though it has!</li>
            <li>It has not been long enough to see a significant change in my skin, however; my skin does seem to be softer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I like that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I will be 39 in October, and just got mistaken for my 20 year old sons girlfriend.</li>
            <li>So yea, will be a frequent purchase for me.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the fact that they are all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but it is light, not greasy or heavy, and it does seem to be brightening and smoothing my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft in the morning after using this every night before bed.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats the quality of a product that is nothing but 100% natural.</li>
            <li>and I use it with Herbalism face wash from LUSH.</li>
            <li>Appreciate the all natural ingredients, but as far as reducing lines and wrinkles...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; have had no problems.....</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I would say the scent is different, but you get used, because it does really soften the skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my face soft and does not break out my face üòä</li>
            <li>I think its a bit greasy but I like that this is natural.</li>
            <li>it gives my wife&#x27;s skin a glow, finally somthing that really moistures.</li>
            <li>After using this cream, my face feels really soft and hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Even my daughter gave me an unsolicited compliment on how soft my cheek was when she kissed me goodnight.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for this product it really works for my skin, definitely will recommend this night cream to others.</li>
            <li>I loved how my face look and felt after using just three days, sadly I had an allergic reaction and had to return.</li>
            <li>I use both the day and night creams and it leaves my skin feeling nourished, I have dry skin but live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s humid, and it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t seen obvious improvement over the dark spots I have on the cheeks after a couple of months of use, I still feel it helped the fine line and pores.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients are olive oil, beeswax, honey and vitamin E, so its a simple natural formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, unlike most people, a little didn&#x27;t go a long way for me.  </li>
            <li>Love the texture and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with inflammation caused by acne since it tones mine down so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that actually made a difference in the wrinkle areas of the face and neck skin and the areas that are trying to develop the big pours.</li>
            <li>It does leave a little excess oil, but, it&#x27;s not a big deal, can be easily blotted away.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, this product is amazing for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very rich, a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; at first, because I put a lot on....by morning my skin is soft and not dry at all (used to be dry by morning with other cream).</li>
            <li>Love this cream .I have been using this now for a few weeks and have no problem with the face breaking out due to sensitive skin ..</li>
            <li>I have bought other brands at much higher price.</li>
            <li>Others have said how the mask reduces the size of pores and generally tightens the skin</li>
            <li>I do like how light it feels, but I&#x27;m not sure it moisturizes enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft the next day</li>
            <li>Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote about bees in my award winning book, Nature&#x27;s Secret Messages.</li>
            <li>And just as they say, a little goes a very long way, which makes this product very economical.</li>
            <li>In the dry heat we have, or simply because the heat is on at night, this cream is a real godsend.  </li>
            <li>So far i am really liking the night cream - its thick and lush -</li>
            <li>I also like that there is utterly no odor w/ this extremely rich &amp; thick cream.</li>
            <li>One application and my face lost all the dry patches and left my skin as soft as a peach!</li>
            <li>It is more of an oil than a cream, to be sure, due to its base of olive oil -</li>
            <li>Verys sensitive and dry skin..</li>
            <li>My daughter developed a skin care line for my skin type...sensitive and slightly dry...</li>
            <li>I recommend these products for dry, mature and combination skin.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Very dense, you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li>I only need a little for my whole face, so it should last for quite some time.</li>

            <li> Wonderful night creme, best part is that it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I could not find anything that was good for my face.  </li>
            <li> I used to work for a company that sold &amp;#34;hive products&amp;#34; so I have a fair amount of knowledge about bee products.  </li>
            <li> Nice company &amp; Great product.</li>
            <li> However, I will continue to use because it is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have also used some on my elbows and cuticles with good results.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this is a fair price</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin, smells good</li>
            <li> The smell is good.</li>
            <li> face feels and looks good in the morning too.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It was safely packaged and arrived in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> Because of the unacceptable chemicals in the product, they actually do more to age skin than not.  </li>

            <li> absolutely love that this product is 100% organic.</li>
            <li> I love that I can pronounce every ingredient from which it was made--and that I know what those items are, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to review a cosmetic product, but I love this so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> glad I found this :)</li>
            <li> I love this company.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY friendly night cream.</li>
            <li> but it is very rich..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this cream, and I plan on switching out all my face products to Bee Friendly Skincare products.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully moisturizing without any strange scents.</li>
            <li> Skin is very smooth, and fine lines gone.</li>
            <li> Great product, love how natural it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my skin which tends to be on a dry side.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and nice company follow up.  </li>
            <li> The seller delivered the product very quickly so I was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful night cream for dry skin</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s all natural makes me happy but there are better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a really good night cream and the best thing I like about it is that It doesn&#x27;t leave and icky feeling on your face when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for natural ingredients and a nourishing, inside-out kind of healing experience for your skin, vs a quick-fix cosmetic approach, this could be a good option for you.</li>
            <li> This cream is so perfect for the dry Alaskan winters!</li>
            <li> There is no scent, so if you are sensitive to fragrance this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great cream.</li>
            <li> It will leave your face smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> In theory it&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s all natural and it supports bee and olive oil woo</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks great after wearing this all night.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it makes my skin feel and how moisturized it is.</li>
            <li> I am perplexed how this works so well after so many products have not...</li>
            <li> I wanted to try night cream to see if it was an even better fit for me.</li>

            <li> Helps reduce my fine lines.</li>

            <li> Pleasant mild natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this cream; it at first seemed like I&#x27;d taken a stick of butter and lightly rolled it on to my skin -</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed, it goes on quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how it is still creamy and being bee friendly cream.  </li>
            <li> I was browsing around, looking for some night cream; then I ran into Bee Friendly night cream</li>
            <li> :) I would recommend it and will be buying more in the future! :)</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly</li>
            <li> I found Bee Friendly night cream to be everything as reported</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on all Bee Friendly  products and will be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Rich moisturizer.....</li>
            <li> And else I bought Bee Friendly REJUVENATING AND ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZING  cream, so</li>
            <li> After seeing a dermatologist with all my skin care items in tow, they determined I have an allergy to beeswax and recommended I stop using the Bee Friendly products.  </li>
            <li> My first order of this lovely product never arrived.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much the first time that I ordered it again!</li>
            <li> After emails to Amazon Customer Service and the good folks at Bee Friendly Skincare, my account was credited the entire purchase price and I was was free to reorder...or not.</li>
            <li> Finally a cream that is natural with a great result!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs very fast!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> Nice feel and skin is soft!</li>
            <li> and my skin is great, not one dry spot!</li>
            <li> My wife is using night creams for the first time and loves this product, so much so she has asked me to order more!</li>
            <li> Specially when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Tried this product out because it was on sale for a special deal.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am doing right by my face!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several times, and am delighted at the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too early to tell but it feels nice on my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> Nice natural cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is lush and effective.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll stick to this nice natural cream.</li>
            <li> A bit too heavy for day use but at night, its ideal</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.</li>
            <li> natural ingredients and nice scent.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how nice the texture is.</li>
            <li> nice product, not to greasy and like the idea that it is all natural</li>
            <li> Be sure to gently rub in circles into your skin.</li>
            <li> Not a bad lotion if you just want moisture but don&#x27;t expect improvement in skin issues</li>
            <li> This cream goes on so easy, is light and yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products,  this is as good or better than the most expensive</li>
            <li> Fine wrinkles are gone, skin is soft, no breakouts or blackheads :).</li>
            <li> I am happy I gave this a try and would encourage anyone who has tried all of the other products that have not worked well, to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Its smooth and soaks in beautifully during the night, (during  lazy hours of the day too).</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> However, overnight, it really softens my skin and by the morning, most of the oiliness was gone and had absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> It is doing wonders for my overall appearance and promotes a youthful glow that I find very refreshing at my age (56).</li>
            <li> Thank for letting me try it at such good price, and love that its all natural.</li>
            <li> I love that all Bee Friendly  products are made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> And this product does a great job of making those wrinkles less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use many products: my eyes are very sensitive, and i get headaches.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> for me it is good because it is absorbed into my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad, but just not as good as the other reviews</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it works great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Im really loving this Cream and the fact that it is Organic is a big plus!!</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin feel when i wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like that it is mostly organic and all natural.  </li>
            <li> A bit greasy on the skin, but worth the shine.</li>
            <li> My pores do looks smaller and my foundation is going on more smoothly in the morning.</li>
            <li> Some of the best cream I have used on my 61 yr old face that spent way too much time in the sun and surf.</li>
            <li> [I have Rosacea], quickly absorbed and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I actually love this natural smell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and firm - I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t find anything else that is so natural that works so great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> I use it at bedtime and wake up with fresh, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> useful for elbows, knees and heels.  </li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel when I put it on, and again it feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but so far I love it!!</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly were so curtious and fast to refund my money.</li>
            <li> I really like the Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li> had several friends get in on this order special and they all love this product.  </li>
            <li> Really nice skin cram, I felt the improvement to dry skin the first morning after I used it!</li>
            <li> I love that I am also able to use this cream on my little girls (2 &amp; 6) hands, lips and face and it does not sting their cheeks or eyes.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my skin feels soft, bright, refresh.  </li>
            <li> The Best Night Cream falls shy of the mark as it is waxy and just sits on your skin instead of being absorbed.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as the write-up states and it does have a nice, honey scent that I find very pleasant especially in a night cream.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all</li>
            <li> and I would love to know what other products your company has available,</li>
            <li> It absorbs wonderfully, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The natural aroma of these products is also a huge plus as I always stay away from chemical</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> She also loves the gentle honey scent and I will be getting her another jar soon!</li>
            <li> #34;beauty is only skin deep&amp;#34;...  : )</li>
            <li> but you will wake up to incredibly soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This product has a nourishing effect, and I enjoy being able to breathe deeply while I apply it - it has a &#x27;wholesome-ingredient, natural&#x27; aroma.</li>
            <li> I love the night cream will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My daughters love it and can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> my face looked hydrated, not greasy at all &amp; felt so smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user or this</li>
            <li> so much so, that I want to put it on in the morning too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic all natural skin cream.  </li>
            <li> Works, but it smells funny.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a lovely product</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have a &#x27;natural&#x27; product that actually works as one would hope.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural and organic, and makes my face feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Even though I knew nothing about this product, I decided to give it a try because of all the positive feedbacks.</li>
            <li> Just started using this wonderfully soft and sweet smelling cream.  </li>
            <li> NOT BAD, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> It seems it will last me quite a while as it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount to work.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> My face feels very supple.  </li>
            <li> but this cream is very luxurious and has no odor which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that it is organic.</li>
            <li> I really like this creme.</li>
            <li> It feels so like on my face, while also being very nurishing.</li>
            <li> This is a really moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> I really like the texture of the cream</li>
            <li> I really like these products.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go straight to bed after applying it, either, so that it absorbs into my skin instead of my pillow.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is still somewhat greasy, but it absorbs quite fast and it works while I sleep, so who cares.</li>
            <li> Since it is summer, very humid</li>
            <li> This cream really just melts into my skin but does not leave it greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Fast response if you have questions and very customer-friendly.</li>
            <li> I dont think anything really</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that is VERY greasy</li>
            <li> Feels very Oily and heave on a face for night, and not absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Pampering time for me, includes gently rubbing this cream into my face and neck areas.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Highly and enthusiastically recommended!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin .</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much each application, so</li>
            <li> Thanks once again.</li>
            <li> It definitely is very hydrating</li>
            <li> (The price is incredibly reasonable as well).</li>
            <li> so much so, that I just bought the serum and face/eye cream as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This night cream really work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> has a very soothing, relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> It is very thick with unusual scent, not unpleasant, (for a cosmetic product) but very light, it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> Same with the scent; it&#x27;s a natural result of the mix of its clean and fresh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this one, Bee Friendly&#x27;s luscious and delicate night cream has vaulted to the top of the pile on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Will definitely try other Bee Friendly products :)</li>
            <li> Because I was suffering from eczema-like dryness around my nasolabial folds due to the forced-air heat in my home and Midwest winter, I searched for a healthy, natural/organic night cr√®me which was going to be a moisture-loss barrier on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I want to try other products in this line and buy more of this night cream for my mom and sisters.</li>
            <li> I have thirsty skin which needs an  extra moisture rich cream.</li>
            <li> This is the third Bee Friendly product I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Rich enough to recharge your skin overnight.</li>
            <li> so many other women, I&#x27;ve got an array of like products from which to choose.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream!  Thick and buttery, extremely emollient.  </li>
            <li> This amazing little cream is already firming everything up!</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest to anyone who can afford to pay the money for a single product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way making it VERY reasonable price wise.</li>
            <li> I love a lavish and rich, yet subtle creamy treat for my face.  </li>
            <li> Nice to support small company that gets honey from bee keepers in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I have noticed quicker/ better results as far as getting the wrinkles to not be so visible, from other brands; but they definitely didn&#x27;t use completely natural, non-toxic chemicals &amp; they cost easily triple what this does.</li>
            <li> In the mornings I notice that the skin on my face feels smooth and refreshed without any dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it at all, to be honest; there&#x27;s no real &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to this night cream as there with similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and supple!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for results with it long-term.  </li>
            <li> I am 75 years young and have never looked my age so this will help me continue fooling people!!</li>
            <li> My face does feel a little more hydrated in the mornings.</li>
            <li> A little goes a lonnnng way, but when I need more of this type of product, I will be re-ordering this one.</li>
            <li> Wow!!  </li>
            <li> And I really like the fact that it the ingredients are mostly natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> but so far I can say it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels moist, fresh and younger in the morning.  </li>
            <li> the jar is going to last quite awhile, making it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and didn&#x27;t start using it right away because I still had some of my old moisturizer - well I started using it and my whole face would get irritated and red.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; creams and lotions and still had dry skin especially around my nose.</li>
            <li> My skin has suffered over the years and after using this product for just one week, I have discovered very supple soft skin that feels and looks young again!</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota</li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural and bit highly fragranced as for results</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive mixed/dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an aesthetician for nearly 30 years and have used hundreds of different professional and department store products and none had the true natural moisturizing properties of these products.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that really works, dry face, chest, hands.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, there was a difference in my neck the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 5 months, most mornings and at night.  </li>
            <li> My first reaction was that it was not &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; enough, but I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> Smells funny, but I can tell a big difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I will try other products by Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> The condition of my skin is improving and my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Soft and creamy, non-greasy, and leaves my skin glowing in the morning!</li>
            <li> This one works just as well, if not better than most.</li>
            <li> I love that the soft yellow color of this cream is natural and due to the ingredients and is not from the addition of chemical colors.</li>
            <li> Although the cream is rich and moisturizing,  I found it caused dark discoloration in places on my face and neck</li>
            <li> I am 60 years young and although no cream will return my skin to its 20 year young state, this cream makes my skin feel as though it has!</li>
            <li> It has not been long enough to see a significant change in my skin, however; my skin does seem to be softer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I like that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I will be 39 in October, and just got mistaken for my 20 year old sons girlfriend.</li>
            <li> So yea, will be a frequent purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Also, I like the fact that they are all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but it is light, not greasy or heavy, and it does seem to be brightening and smoothing my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft in the morning after using this every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the quality of a product that is nothing but 100% natural.</li>
            <li> and I use it with Herbalism face wash from LUSH.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the all natural ingredients, but as far as reducing lines and wrinkles...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; have had no problems.....</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I would say the scent is different, but you get used, because it does really soften the skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my face soft and does not break out my face üòä</li>
            <li> I think its a bit greasy but I like that this is natural.</li>
            <li> it gives my wife&#x27;s skin a glow, finally somthing that really moistures.</li>
            <li> After using this cream, my face feels really soft and hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Even my daughter gave me an unsolicited compliment on how soft my cheek was when she kissed me goodnight.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for this product it really works for my skin, definitely will recommend this night cream to others.</li>
            <li> I loved how my face look and felt after using just three days, sadly I had an allergic reaction and had to return.</li>
            <li> I use both the day and night creams and it leaves my skin feeling nourished, I have dry skin but live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s humid, and it&#x27;s not too much.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen obvious improvement over the dark spots I have on the cheeks after a couple of months of use, I still feel it helped the fine line and pores.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients are olive oil, beeswax, honey and vitamin E, so its a simple natural formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, unlike most people, a little didn&#x27;t go a long way for me.  </li>
            <li> Love the texture and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with inflammation caused by acne since it tones mine down so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that actually made a difference in the wrinkle areas of the face and neck skin and the areas that are trying to develop the big pours.</li>
            <li> It does leave a little excess oil, but, it&#x27;s not a big deal, can be easily blotted away.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, this product is amazing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very rich, a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; at first, because I put a lot on....by morning my skin is soft and not dry at all (used to be dry by morning with other cream).</li>
            <li> Love this cream .I have been using this now for a few weeks and have no problem with the face breaking out due to sensitive skin ..</li>
            <li> I have bought other brands at much higher price.</li>
            <li> Others have said how the mask reduces the size of pores and generally tightens the skin</li>
            <li> I do like how light it feels, but I&#x27;m not sure it moisturizes enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft the next day</li>
            <li> Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote about bees in my award winning book, Nature&#x27;s Secret Messages.</li>
            <li> And just as they say, a little goes a very long way, which makes this product very economical.</li>
            <li> In the dry heat we have, or simply because the heat is on at night, this cream is a real godsend.  </li>
            <li> So far i am really liking the night cream - its thick and lush -</li>
            <li> I also like that there is utterly no odor w/ this extremely rich &amp; thick cream.</li>
            <li> One application and my face lost all the dry patches and left my skin as soft as a peach!</li>
            <li> It is more of an oil than a cream, to be sure, due to its base of olive oil -</li>
            <li> Verys sensitive and dry skin..</li>
            <li> My daughter developed a skin care line for my skin type...sensitive and slightly dry...</li>
            <li> I recommend these products for dry, mature and combination skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very dense, you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I only need a little for my whole face, so it should last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I add a little organic sweet almond oil and a little organic avocado oil to the container and stir it up and keep it next to my bed.</li>
            <li> Over 50; slightly dry skin; no acne problems, minor redness issues, live in a dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so also a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews were right, it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but it&#x27;s a night cream</li>
            <li> But I think I&#x27;ve figured out the right amount to use (very, very small amount).</li>
            <li> I live in a hight altitude arid climate, so it would probably last even longer in a less dry climate.</li>
            <li> It feels thick at first</li>
            <li> is the only one I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry by the morning.</li>
            <li> and then my skin goes back to dry.</li>
            <li> Other much more expensive brands I tried in the past never did too much either</li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy when putting on but completely gone when getting up the next morning and skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> ; the skin under and around my almost 50 year old eyes but never found any natural product that wasn&#x27;t super greasy or smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside: It is somewhat waxy; does slightly smell like such(tho not enough to put me off); very oily and can get messy when being applied (tho you can rub the residue on your hands).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and live in the cold weather at a high altitude.  </li>
            <li> Despite my efforts, I still developed small wrinkles around my eyes and a deep brow wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for a heavy moisturizer that absorbed very well and was incredibly expensive.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for a long time for a product that will &amp;</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of it because a little goes a long way; I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks now and it still looks like brand new (guess this can last for half a year to me).</li>
            <li> So far I like the results a lot more than the other, expensive &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It actually had a dewy feel which has never happened with other night creams.</li>
            <li> Also, you only need to use a little each night so this container is going to last me forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering when the time comes--and am off to peruse their other products, too.</li>
            <li> One jar can go for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, I do have dry, breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> i use the night cream for a day cream because i am so dry</li>
            <li> I will be trying it on my face once the weather changes and my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> and I only have been using this only for a few days.</li>
            <li> and this has not given me a single blemish.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I think the jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this should last a while.  </li>
            <li> I was using a lighter cream, and the skin around my eyes was feeling dry and tight by mid afternoon.</li>
            <li> My deep brow wrinkle faded by half.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this during the day because I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> i have very very dry skin</li>
            <li> I instantly opened this product and put it liberally on my face and even threw a little bit on my arms because I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I also use a little extra on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> BUT she now  lives in Canada...making the  time sensitive cream hard to get to me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream left my face very oily and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I like a cream that goes on the skin without feeling that I have to drag it over my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a night cram &amp; is heavy + shiny so can only be used for night.</li>
            <li> Not very absorbent</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m careful not to put it too close to eyes.</li>
            <li> (very moist, non irritating</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel any different, tried it a few days.</li>
            <li> I developed a horrible rash on my chin in kind of a U shape.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry, dull skin... especially during the winter months and this cream feels so luxurious and hydration.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had that tight, dry feeling around my eyes since.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and am also sensitive to artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> It is soothing, and seems to contain extremely favorable healing properties.....</li>
            <li> I started using it every other day to see if it changed</li>
            <li> I often have problems with eye irritation with other products.</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long ways!  </li>
            <li> and I use it in conjunction with my homemade A lotion and other products (blends well).</li>
            <li> With my dry skin, I apply it in the morning sometimes, too, when it will be a little while before I apply makeup: make no mistake that it does have a presence for a bit.</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe, but my skin just feels different than it does with other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I am 58 and was having some wrinkly dry skin areas on my neck, no more of either problem.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of expensive night creams for the last ten years.</li>
            <li> I took the suggestion and I use less.  </li>
            <li> May be slightly too emollient for oily skin...</li>
            <li> It does go on shiny, but disappears in a half hour.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight greasy layer on the skin, but by morning, it seems to be soaked in.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve noticed little difference in imperfections like lines around my mouth or forehead.</li>
            <li> but it was a little greasy</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES ALONG</li>
            <li> but a little bit greasy.</li>
            <li> When they use a little bit, they mean it, this product goes along way even with dry skin.</li>
            <li> You only need a little as it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> it feels a little harsh around my eyes, so I just ordered the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work out since I like the fact that this does not have any artificial scent to it.  </li>
            <li> We call it our Honey-Bunny-Bee-Cream &amp; use it daily - especially during the cold months when skin tends to chap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday since it arrived.</li>
            <li> It is nice to find a product that is &amp;#34;unadulterated&amp;#34; and without nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> will try to update this in a few months.</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> It is quite heavy for the day time</li>
            <li> Sticky and not smooth</li>
            <li> it is heavy.</li>
            <li> Lush and silky with a faint scent of honey, it rolls onto my skin with the lightest touch of my fingers.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to the olive oil smell, but it&#x27;s not strong.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any changes over the past few weeks of using.  </li>
            <li> I am an Alaskan woman that has exposed her skin to many different types of abuse...from very cold wet weather that chapped my skin to extremely cold weather that gave me frostbite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as I did love this cream.  </li>
            <li> As noted, you need very little product for each application.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked it could work so fast, but hey, who am I to complain?</li>
            <li> Felt like applying oil to my skin, even in small amounts.  </li>
            <li> no matter how small the amount I applied.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this cream.  </li>
            <li> mediocre as i still use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product helps with wrinkles, but my skin looks brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Will give updates in a few months!</li>
            <li> Once morning, I realized my facial skin looked very tired.  </li>
            <li> but it was too late</li>
            <li> I use retin-A twice a week then wait at least 20 minutes and apply the night cream.  </li>
            <li> Had to give it at least one star, which it rally doesn&#x27;t deserve.</li>
            <li> I tried it so I could at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Especially with the cold temperature.</li>
            <li> Usually it is a thick salve and almost waxy product</li>
            <li> I like its smell and thick texture.</li>
            <li> Thick creamy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> the product is too thick and sticky,and priced too high.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small wrinkles and lines gone!</li>
            <li> Seriously the wrinkle around my neck is disappearing</li>
            <li> First the smell of this is so nasty it literally made me want to vomit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> I have not experienced an allergic reation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for two weeks now and have noticed a dramatic improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wondering if I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Well, I was not impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The one listed on Amazon was too expensive -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a fragrance, but this has sort of a stale smell.</li>
            <li> were the winters can be cold, dry and brutal on the skin.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> I buy everything, I try everything up to very expensive products.</li>
            <li> It just too bad that it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> was a bit disappointed as I paid 3 times the price of the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; night creams.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely one of the, if not THE, best face cream I have tried....And believe me, I have tried them all.  I love a lavish and rich, yet subtle creamy treat for my face.  It is soothing, and seems to contain extremely favorable healing properties..... I have purchased several times, and am delighted at the results. * Nice*  ;*)</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  Great Organic cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of expensive night creams for the last ten years. In my mid-30&#x27;s, my goal had always been prevention. Despite my efforts, I still developed small wrinkles around my eyes and a deep brow wrinkle. I switched to Best Night Cream about a month ago, mostly just to go natural with my skin care. What I didn&#x27;t expect was that with a week, all of my eye wrinkles would disappear. My deep brow wrinkle faded by half. Now, after a month, my skin looks like it did at 18. I&#x27;ve got acne prone skin, and this cream didn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this cream, and I plan on switching out all my face products to Bee Friendly Skincare products. If you&#x27;re thinking of trying this, do it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Although the cream is rich and moisturizing,  I found it caused dark discoloration in places on my face and neck so I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  My face feels very supple.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Felt like applying oil to my skin, even in small amounts.  And I&#x27;ve noticed little difference in imperfections like lines around my mouth or forehead. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Im really loving this Cream and the fact that it is Organic is a big plus!!</li>
            <li> This night cream is wonderful.  It came as described and in two days to my door.  I instantly opened this product and put it liberally on my face and even threw a little bit on my arms because I have very dry skin.  I was amazed how it is still creamy and being bee friendly cream.  Usually it is a thick salve and almost waxy product but this cream is very luxurious and has no odor which is a bonus.  I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and will definitely be adding this night cream to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had several friends get in on this order special and they all love this product.  Thank you so much for such a lovely product and I would love to know what other products your company has available, if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product I had not heard of the brand before. I really like the product. The main ingredients are olive oil, beeswax, honey and vitamin E, so its a simple natural formula. This cream is great for winter since it is really hydrating. It feels thick at first but once it warms up it melts into skin. You only need a very small amount. I also use this on my hands and on my lips. There is no scent, so if you are sensitive to fragrance this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great cream. Very dense, you only need to use a little bit. Hydrates wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was browsing around, looking for some night cream; then I ran into Bee Friendly night cream and I saw all 5-stars in the reviews. Even though I knew nothing about this product, I decided to give it a try because of all the positive feedbacks. I tried it on the day the cream arrived. My skin felt so great! The cream works wonderfully for the skin in winter. And I don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of it because a little goes a long way; I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks now and it still looks like brand new (guess this can last for half a year to me). Anyways, this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought from Amazon!! Will definitely try other Bee Friendly products :)</li>
            <li> this is working well...it moisturizes and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. The fact that it&#x27;s all natural makes me happy but there are better ones on the market. The cream is somewhat solid and doesn&#x27;t have that ultra creamy texture I thought it would have. A little goes a long way as the write-up states and it does have a nice, honey scent that I find very pleasant especially in a night cream.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream. It&#x27;s very thick so it&#x27;s nice for nighttime. I like that it&#x27;s natural and bit highly fragranced as for results it&#x27;s too early to tell but it feels nice on my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> I like a cream that goes on the skin without feeling that I have to drag it over my face.  Too dense for me.  Like the ingredients though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very creamy. A small amount goes a long way. After only a week I ca see an improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Too oily for me. Can&#x27;t believe the amount of amazing reviews though. Wondering if I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Really nice skin cram, I felt the improvement to dry skin the first morning after I used it! Very nice to use something with all good ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a really good night cream and the best thing I like about it is that It doesn&#x27;t leave and icky feeling on your face when you wake up in the morning. I also really like the fact that it is organic. I highly recommend this product if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet. It will leave your face smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> This night cream is awesome! I have tried so many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; creams and lotions and still had dry skin especially around my nose. 2 night with this cream and my skin is great, not one dry spot!</li>
            <li> The cream is so rich and wonderful. I love how soft it makes my skin feel when i wake up in the morning. Its not oily at all and nourishes my skin while i sleep. A++</li>
            <li> Just started using this wonderfully soft and sweet smelling cream.  Feels great on my skin--can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> love the cream so good for skin make it feel soft</li>
            <li> Awesome ingredients that are all beneficial. Moisture absorbs into skin immediately and stays locked in all day. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky either. I would strongly suggest to anyone who can afford to pay the money for a single product.</li>
            <li> Very rich, a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; at first, because I put a lot on....by morning my skin is soft and not dry at all (used to be dry by morning with other cream). Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff has all natural ingredients and is definitely good for your skin. I love it and I feel like I am doing right by my face! :) I would recommend it and will be buying more in the future! :)</li>
            <li> I liked it but it was a little greasy no matter how small the amount I applied.</li>
            <li> So far i am really liking the night cream - its thick and lush - i have 60+ skin and its soothing and antiaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great review.  Well, I was not impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Japanese product called Aloessen for over 12 years when I was in the west coast.  After moving to the east coast, I could not find it anywhere.  The one listed on Amazon was too expensive - I used to buy it under 20 in the west coast.  I could not find anything that was good for my face.  Since this product has such great reviews, I have decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, unlike most people, a little didn&#x27;t go a long way for me.  I had to use a chunk and 2-3 layers to even feel moisturized. I used this product day and night for one month.  Once morning, I realized my facial skin looked very tired.  This is the only way I could describe how it looked. I knew it was time to look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This maybe perfect for a lot of people, but not for me.  I really wanted this to work out since I like the fact that this does not have any artificial scent to it.  It just too bad that it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this creme. I like its smell and thick texture. After circular massage into my skin I feel invigorated. It does take time to absorb. I have sensitive skin. I have not experienced an allergic reation. In the mornings I notice that the skin on my face feels smooth and refreshed without any dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bee Friendly</li>
            <li> great on my skin ,seeing improvement in last 6 days</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best cream. It feels so like on my face, while also being very nurishing.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I have very dry skin and this is the first product that really works, dry face, chest, hands. When they use a little bit, they mean it, this product goes along way even with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the best night cream I have ever used.  The first time I used it, there was a difference in my neck the next morning.  Most products do not deliver on their claims but you can trust this one.  I like that it is mostly organic and all natural.  I am 75 years young and have never looked my age so this will help me continue fooling people!! A best buy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product :-)</li>
            <li> I used this cream last week and I&#x27;m just happy to have the best thing ever.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have very sensitive skin and live in the cold weather at a high altitude.  This cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at it is the only one I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry by the morning.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. It does leave a little excess oil, but, it&#x27;s not a big deal, can be easily blotted away. But the results are great. Skin is very smooth, and fine lines gone. Will order again</li>
            <li> I totally love the Best Night Cream by Bee Friendly Skincare. It is doing wonders for my overall appearance and promotes a youthful glow that I find very refreshing at my age (56).</li>
            <li> This cream is so perfect for the dry Alaskan winters! One application and my face lost all the dry patches and left my skin as soft as a peach! I will never be without this product!</li>
            <li> This is a really moisturizing cream.  I use it at night.</li>
            <li> Great product, love how natural it is. A bit greasy on the skin, but worth the shine. My skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Nice natural cream. Pleasant mild natural fragrance. It&#x27;s a night cram &amp; is heavy + shiny so can only be used for night. A little goes a long ways. Not very absorbent but it does moisturize. Seems to stay out of my eyes but I&#x27;m careful not to put it too close to eyes. Have not noticed any &amp;#34;significant changes&amp;#34; thought it does moisturize.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream!  Thick and buttery, extremely emollient.  My face does feel a little more hydrated in the mornings. I also use it in the daytime, too, and once the oils have soaked in, makeup goes on fine. No problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 5 months, most mornings and at night.  I use it with rose water.  It&#x27;s great and absorbs well.  I live in a hight altitude arid climate, so it would probably last even longer in a less dry climate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok. I do like how light it feels, but I&#x27;m not sure it moisturizes enough for my skin. I will finish the jar, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, this product is amazing for dry skin. I put it on my face and feet and it does amazing things during the night.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. Specially when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> It has not been long enough to see a significant change in my skin, however; my skin does seem to be softer. I really like the texture of the cream and I like that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love the cream.  I work in the hospital, air conditioned or heated at all times.  Hydration at night time is so important and this cream is doing the job well.  It is very thick with unusual scent, not unpleasant, (for a cosmetic product) but very light, it goes away quickly.  I recommend this cream to everyone who mentions about skin problem at work.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and didn&#x27;t start using it right away because I still had some of my old moisturizer - well I started using it and my whole face would get irritated and red. I started using it every other day to see if it changed but it did not! And I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!!! And since I took a couple weeks to start using it now I can&#x27;t return it!</li>
            <li> Love this cream .I have been using this now for a few weeks and have no problem with the face breaking out due to sensitive skin .. My skin seems softer so I am going to stick to this product and see what happens .</li>
            <li> I loved how my face look and felt after using just three days, sadly I had an allergic reaction and had to return. Bee Friendly were so curtious and fast to refund my money. Great company!</li>
            <li> This is my second tub.  Very smooth, moist and creamy application.  Almost odorless yet pleasant fragrance.  I use it during the day also.</li>
            <li> Thick creamy moisturizer.  Great for my sun damaged skin!</li>
            <li> This cream is lush and effective.  After giving me a kiss and noticing how nice the cream smelled and felt, my fianc√© started using it!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this cream.  Have not seen any changes over the past few weeks of using.  Will continue to use and update as I go.</li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing! I won&#x27;t buy anything else now. Other reviews were right, it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but it&#x27;s a night cream and that&#x27;s what you need to rehydrate your skin. Smells great and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my grandmother and she&#x27;s been using them every night.  She loves that its extra hydrating and firming.  She also loves the gentle honey scent and I will be getting her another jar soon!</li>
            <li> This is a VERY friendly night cream. Its smooth and soaks in beautifully during the night, (during  lazy hours of the day too). My skin feels soft and relaxed. In the dry heat we have, or simply because the heat is on at night, this cream is a real godsend.  I am also using it for added moisturizing  around my lip line. It helps there too.  I am surprisingly pleased with this product. For once someone has actually&lt;br /&gt;produced a product that performs as they say it will! Hopefully it will fulfill your expectations as well !</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday since it arrived. I&#x27;m not a makeup wearer, I just wash my face and apply this all over sparingly. It absorbs wonderfully, and a little goes a long way. I know this is technically a night cream, but I use it both am and pm. I cannot say enough on how this has improved my skin. It&#x27;s so moisturized, and just GLOWS. I will be 39 in October, and just got mistaken for my 20 year old sons girlfriend. So yea, will be a frequent purchase for me. Also, I do have dry, breakout prone skin and this has not given me a single blemish. Forever customer here!</li>
            <li> In theory it&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s all natural and it supports bee and olive oil woo la la. But in actuality, it is just toooooo oily and made me break out all over!!!! I wish I could have returned it but it was too late</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin feels soft and looks great after wearing this all night. Takes a while to get used to the olive oil smell, but it&#x27;s not strong. Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality cream. It works nicely on the skin and does not leave an oily residue and makes skin feel very nice and smooth. Smells very good as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I like the weight and feel of this cream. Gives great results, my face feels very nourished in the morning. Love it!</li>
            <li> The product is and does what it says.  It was safely packaged and arrived in a timely fashion.  Because I was suffering from eczema-like dryness around my nasolabial folds due to the forced-air heat in my home and Midwest winter, I searched for a healthy, natural/organic night cr√®me which was going to be a moisture-loss barrier on my skin.  It is &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s what I needed.  I use it as the last layer of my skincare routine which includes a moisturizing hyaluronic serum and another bee-product serum (separate company).  I used to work for a company that sold &amp;#34;hive products&amp;#34; so I have a fair amount of knowledge about bee products.  They are quite remarkable.  It is nice to find a product that is &amp;#34;unadulterated&amp;#34; and without nasty chemicals.  Almost all &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products in the mainstream marketplace have some &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ingredients, but they are so loaded with synthetic chemicals, it&#x27;s unacceptable.  Synthetic chemicals are actually &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; to the body.  Because of the unacceptable chemicals in the product, they actually do more to age skin than not.  Do your research.  Knowledge is power.  This is an excellent product.  A little goes a lonnnng way, but when I need more of this type of product, I will be re-ordering this one.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love how smooth it makes my skin feel and how moisturized it is. It gives me a youthful glow and has done wonders for my sensitive/older skin. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am only giving 4 stars because I think with moisturizers you need some time to truly know if it works for you.  I was looking for a replacement for a heavy moisturizer that absorbed very well and was incredibly expensive.  As noted, you need very little product for each application.  My first reaction was that it was not &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; enough, but I stuck with it.  It does moisturize and absorb as well as the more expensive product.  I use it each evening.  I use retin-A twice a week then wait at least 20 minutes and apply the night cream.  I also use it over DMAE.  (Yes, I am trying everything!) My pores do looks smaller and my foundation is going on more smoothly in the morning. Here is some info I find helpful in reviews: Over 50; slightly dry skin; no acne problems, minor redness issues, live in a dry area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this in a few months.</li>
            <li> I took the suggestion and I use less.  I like it now.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing. I like it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Verys sensitive and dry skin..this night cream felt like my skin got a nice drink..i use the night cream for a day cream because i am so dry but it is very rich..ordered one for my mom too !will order more products for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Some of the best cream I have used on my 61 yr old face that spent way too much time in the sun and surf. My daughter developed a skin care line for my skin type...sensitive and slightly dry...it is a wonderful product BUT she now  lives in Canada...making the  time sensitive cream hard to get to me. I was thrilled to find this by chance. I will say I have spared no expense on lotions and potions...from my dermatologist office to Nordstrom to on line products....channel to dr. brandt to la mer....etc. Nothing since my daughter&#x27;s cream has worked this well.  A little goes a long way making it VERY reasonable price wise. My skin glows in the morning...I am perplexed how this works so well after so many products have not...but i will take it. I put it around my eyes and no sensitivity at all. May be slightly too emollient for oily skin...then again may help balance it. Hope it works as well for you...but remember &amp;#34;beauty is only skin deep&amp;#34;...  : )</li>
            <li> Awesome cream. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s very rich and a little goes a long way. Nice to support small company that gets honey from bee keepers in Hawaii. Can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream!! It&#x27;s perfect for my skin which tends to be on a dry side. The effect is much better than from the creams that cost 3 times more. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for two weeks now and have noticed a dramatic improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of night creams and this one is definitely the best. I add a little organic sweet almond oil and a little organic avocado oil to the container and stir it up and keep it next to my bed. Totaly wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Smells funny, but I can tell a big difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I found Bee Friendly night cream to be everything as reported (very moist, non irritating [I have Rosacea], quickly absorbed and not greasy. My skin was immediately moisturized after application. It actually had a dewy feel which has never happened with other night creams. I will try other products by Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> I am using this night cream in conjunction  with the day moisturizer.  I really like these products. I saw improvement in my skin within a few days. They are the best I have ever used and I have used many.  Also, I like the fact that they are all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> YHE BEST CREAM I HAVE EVER USED THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Fabulous....my skin loves this. Goes on smooth. You don&#x27;t need alot. So a little goes a long way.  Will definitely buy again!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wow. I am a beauty product junkie. I buy everything, I try everything up to very expensive products. This cream is so affordable and works. Seriously the wrinkle around my neck is disappearing and I only have been using this only for a few days. Crazy. I actually put a lot on my face and neck when I go to sleep. It feels like a lot but you will wake up to incredibly soft and smooth skin. I actually love this natural smell. I want to try other products in this line and buy more of this night cream for my mom and sisters. Aloha!</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful night cream as it is so moisturising and good for the skin. You really can&#x27;t beat it as a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but so far I love it!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this cream; it at first seemed like I&#x27;d taken a stick of butter and lightly rolled it on to my skin - but, in fact, it&#x27;s nothing like that. It is more of an oil than a cream, to be sure, due to its base of olive oil - but it is light, not greasy or heavy, and it does seem to be brightening and smoothing my skin. I have very sensitive skin, and am also sensitive to artificial fragrances. This product has a nourishing effect, and I enjoy being able to breathe deeply while I apply it - it has a &#x27;wholesome-ingredient, natural&#x27; aroma. It feels like the nourishing treatment it is. With my dry skin, I apply it in the morning sometimes, too, when it will be a little while before I apply makeup: make no mistake that it does have a presence for a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t go straight to bed after applying it, either, so that it absorbs into my skin instead of my pillow. But I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash my hair - even though it&#x27;s got &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; in it, this is olive oil, not petrolatum, and beeswax, not wax in any traditional sense. So if you&#x27;re looking for natural ingredients and a nourishing, inside-out kind of healing experience for your skin, vs a quick-fix cosmetic approach, this could be a good option for you. I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I have used NUMEROUS products for facial care/ &amp;#34;de-wrinkle&amp;#34; creams, serums, etc. For the money this one is great. It seems it will last me quite a while as it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount to work. I&#x27;ll admit I have noticed quicker/ better results as far as getting the wrinkles to not be so visible, from other brands; but they definitely didn&#x27;t use completely natural, non-toxic chemicals &amp; they cost easily triple what this does. I also like that there is utterly no odor w/ this extremely rich &amp; thick cream. My skin feels really soft in the morning after using this every night before bed. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Best night cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Sent some to my parents and they also agree.  I also use the mask which is also wonderful.  Nothing beats the quality of a product that is nothing but 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and clean product.  Makes my skin feel so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> My favorite cream! I&#x27;m at my second pot now and my skin is so happy!!! I have very sensitive mixed/dry skin and I use it with Herbalism face wash from LUSH. Fine wrinkles are gone, skin is soft, no breakouts or blackheads :). I use it night and day, but it does make skin look greasy, I just powder over before I leave the house and done! I DON&#x27;T EVEN USE FOUNDATION ANYMORE!</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have very dry skin.  Some complain that this is oily, but that is just what I need.  I also really like that it does not irritate my eyes.  I often have problems with eye irritation with other products.</li>
            <li> Excellent night cream. The next morning my skin feels soft, bright, refresh.  I love the night cream will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Nice company &amp; Great product. The best I have found in a long time and I have tried MANY! I have thirsty skin which needs an  extra moisture rich cream. The day cream is great as well.I wanted to try night cream to see if it was an even better fit for me.Give these products a try, I believe you&#x27;ll be happy with them.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all and it does not feel greasy. I use this during the day because I have very dry skin.  My only complaint is the smell.  I don&#x27;t need a fragrance, but this has sort of a stale smell. It doe not stop me from using it or giving 5 stars.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Liked it so much the first time that I ordered it again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I will order more</li>
            <li> Had to give it at least one star, which it rally doesn&#x27;t deserve. First the smell of this is so nasty it literally made me want to vomit. I tried it so I could at least give it a try. It didn&#x27;t feel any different, tried it a few days. I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t pay for this, no wonder they were giving them out. It is trash.</li>
            <li> This cream is AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> Appreciate the all natural ingredients, but as far as reducing lines and wrinkles... Not so much.  However, I will continue to use because it is a good moisturizer.  A little on the greasy side, so best used as night cream.</li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy when putting on but completely gone when getting up the next morning and skin feels soft and refreshed. One jar can go for a very long time.  Very pleasant smell. Although I haven&#x27;t seen obvious improvement over the dark spots I have on the cheeks after a couple of months of use, I still feel it helped the fine line and pores. Other much more expensive brands I tried in the past never did too much either so I&#x27;ll stick to this nice natural cream.</li>
            <li> I see no difference in my skin. Not a bad lotion if you just want moisture but don&#x27;t expect improvement in skin issues</li>
            <li> My daughters love it and can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Continues to impress me.  A bit too heavy for day use but at night, its ideal</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long time for a product that will &amp;#34;plump up&amp;#34; the skin under and around my almost 50 year old eyes but never found any natural product that wasn&#x27;t super greasy or smelled really bad. This night cream is still somewhat greasy, but it absorbs quite fast and it works while I sleep, so who cares. My skin feels soft and firm - I am very happy! - it feels a little harsh around my eyes, so I just ordered the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! The texture is amazing &amp; melts on your skin like butter...but it is in no way greasy or oily. The texture is so nice, I can even use it on my face in the morning under my makeup &amp; my makeup does not get all gunky and melt off.  I love that I am also able to use this cream on my little girls (2 &amp; 6) hands, lips and face and it does not sting their cheeks or eyes.  We call it our Honey-Bunny-Bee-Cream &amp; use it daily - especially during the cold months when skin tends to chap. It is so nice to have a &#x27;natural&#x27; product that actually works as one would hope.  I&#x27;m in love with our Honey-Bunny-Bee-Cream!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome, it looks a little greasy when applied, so make sure to rub it in good &amp; when i woke up my face looked hydrated, not greasy at all &amp; felt so smooth &amp; soft. I&#x27;m a first time user or this &amp; I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this item again, I love it!!</li>
            <li> love these products...I have sensitive skin &amp; have had no problems.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love, love with this night cream. My husband and I both love it. My skin is so soft in the morning. Thank you.... will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This cream goes on so easy, is light and yet very moisturizing.  My skin feels very soft and supple! And just as they say, a little goes a very long way, which makes this product very economical.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about these products. I have both the day and night cream as well as the  lip balm. I live in Minnesota were the winters can be cold, dry and brutal on the skin. These wonderful all natural products work amazingly well at keeping my face and lips moisturized and nourished. I&#x27;ve been an aesthetician for nearly 30 years and have used hundreds of different professional and department store products and none had the true natural moisturizing properties of these products. No harmful coloring, fragrancing, preservatives or unneeded chemical fillers. I recommend these products for dry, mature and combination skin. Oilier skin types may not like the feel of the thickness but used more sparingly would work for them as well.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy. Feels like it covers well.</li>
            <li> BEST NIGHT CREAM A LITTLE GOES ALONG WAY. WILL ORDER MORE WHEN NEEDED</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product and I am sure to buy it Again.</li>
            <li> I started using the night cream about 2  weeks ago.  Since it is summer, very humid and I have oily skin I have been using the night cream only on my neck and upper chest area.  Wow!!  I am 58 and was having some wrinkly dry skin areas on my neck, no more of either problem.  This cream really just melts into my skin but does not leave it greasy feeling.  I will be trying it on my face once the weather changes and my skin gets dry.  I have also used some on my elbows and cuticles with good results.  I would be happy  to purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream. I have bought other brands at much higher price. This is a great product for the price and well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin almost immediately!  After cleansing, I applied and the next morning--soft, supple skin! Small wrinkles and lines gone! Amazing stuff. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream. My skin adores this stuff</li>
            <li> I really Love this!  I would reccomend to try this.</li>
            <li> I really like the Bee Friendly products. I have used this for 3 months and my skin does feel better and look better. I put it on before bed, it goes on quickly and easily. I even use it around my eyes without any problem. I would recommend to others. Price, value and results are all there.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry and sensitive. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this night cream and am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> natural ingredients and nice scent. but a little bit greasy.</li>
            <li> perfect night cream for face and neck and love that its organic, would highly recommend for 50+ age group</li>
            <li> it really is the best night cream</li>
            <li> I most definitely love this product!!! I am an Alaskan woman that has exposed her skin to many different types of abuse...from very cold wet weather that chapped my skin to extremely cold weather that gave me frostbite! My skin has suffered over the years and after using this product for just one week, I have discovered very supple soft skin that feels and looks young again! I am not kidding! Nothing else has done that but this product is amazing! My most favorite part is the sweet smell of honey on my skin...so much so, that I want to put it on in the morning too! ;) I really love this cream!!! Thank you for making it!</li>
            <li> This cream is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Goes on smoothly and absorbs very fast! Does not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. I had only used for 3 days before I started noticing a difference in the firmness of my neck and skin. I recently had weight loss surgery so am experiencing some sagging, wrinkles and extra skin. This amazing little cream is already firming everything up! I was shocked it could work so fast, but hey, who am I to complain? I absolutely love it. Oh and they have the BEST customer service team out there! Fast response if you have questions and very customer-friendly. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I just got it and I was surprised at how nice the texture is. i love that it&#x27;s organic and all great ingredients. No nasties. Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote about bees in my award winning book, Nature&#x27;s Secret Messages. Bees are amazzzzing! So, I&#x27;ll use bee products for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it as an eye cream too, so you don&#x27;t have to buy an extra beauty product.</li>
            <li> this is the best night cream ever, i also use it in the morning. Applying my powder concealer over it helps absorb the oilyness and helps protect my skin, providing a barrier and has also helped to heal any acne that starts. Love this!!</li>
            <li> I like it. It smells good and goes on smooth. I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> very nice stuff; hydrates for awhile but not all day. i have very very dry skin and it does give it a boost just not improving any dryness.. I dont think anything really does.&lt;br /&gt;i did buy it again because i liked the feel of it on my skin. it is a bit greasy if you already have a lot of oil on your skin. for me it is good because it is absorbed into my dry skin.  just keep that in mind when buying.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft the next day</li>
            <li> Love the Bee Friendly Night Cream and that it is all Natural/Organic.  Don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.  A little product goes a long ways!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have ordered there products twice. It does go on shiny, but disappears in a half hour. I simply can&#x27;t find anything else that is so natural that works so great on my skin. I love this company&#x27;s product line.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice, soft, and good smelling cream. It doesnt leave a greasy look on my face and I would definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and a little goes a long way. I would say the scent is different, but you get used, because it does really soften the skin. Very comfortable on the skin, no irritation what so ever. Thank for letting me try it at such good price, and love that its all natural.</li>
            <li> NOT BAD, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! Makes my face soft and does not break out my face üòä</li>
            <li> Great smell and light on my skin. I think its a bit greasy but I like that this is natural.</li>
            <li> love this night cream. very smooth, not waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the third Bee Friendly product I have purchased.  I use their anti wrinkle cream and absolutely love it. I have been using it for 8 months and see a wonderful improvement in the tone, smoothness and overall health of my skin.  The mask is also wonderful.  Others have said how the mask reduces the size of pores and generally tightens the skin and it does.  I love that all Bee Friendly  products are made from natural ingredients. The night cream is my favorite product of all.  The consistently is just perfect.  My skin feels moist, fresh and younger in the morning.  I&#x27;m sold on all Bee Friendly  products and will be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I love this Bee Friendly Skincare cream.</li>
            <li> The best night cream ever. Rich enough to recharge your skin overnight.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fantastic after using this product.  It moisturizes without feeling greasy.  And I really like the fact that it the ingredients are mostly natural.  I am 60 years young and although no cream will return my skin to its 20 year young state, this cream makes my skin feel as though it has!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Love that it is all natural and organic, and makes my face feel soft.  Helps reduce my fine lines. I don&#x27;t feel like I even need to go out and pay big money for a facial.  A little goes a long way, so this should last a while.  Made is USA is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Rich moisturizer..... it gives my wife&#x27;s skin a glow, finally somthing that really moistures.</li>
            <li> So far, the night cream is what I expected. I will have to use it longer before I can make a statement about the results.</li>
            <li> Tried this product out because it was on sale for a special deal. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it works great for my dry skin! Especially with the cold temperature. Keep in mind that is VERY greasy and I would not recommend using in the day. However, overnight, it really softens my skin and by the morning, most of the oiliness was gone and had absorbed into my skin. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s only 2 oz, but that is plenty. A little bit goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I received this cream after I wrote a review stating that their other cream was too greasy for me (great customer service)!  I like this one much better.  After using this cream, my face feels really soft and hydrated in the morning.  Even my daughter gave me an unsolicited compliment on how soft my cheek was when she kissed me goodnight.  Its hard to describe, but my skin just feels different than it does with other moisturizers.  I especially like that I&#x27;m not putting a lot of chemicals on my skin.  As for reducing wrinkles, that remains to be seen.  A little goes a long way, so I think the jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy.  Love that it&#x27;s natural.  Moisturizing.</li>
            <li> nice product, not to greasy and like the idea that it is all natural</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream, I am so glad I tried it.  Moisturizing but not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever!  I feel like this is a fair price and I will definitely continue to order this quality product.  I love how my skin looks and how this product feels on my skin.  I just wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Upside: This is a great nighttime moisturizer.  I am 64 and have oily/normal skin. When I sleep on my side, I wake up with creases in my neck and face. Anything that helps diminish wrinkles is tops in my book. And this product does a great job of making those wrinkles less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: It is somewhat waxy; does slightly smell like such(tho not enough to put me off); very oily and can get messy when being applied (tho you can rub the residue on your hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I like the way my skin feels (silky) in the morning, looks smooth  and I use it in conjunction with my homemade A lotion and other products (blends well). I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The Best Night Cream falls shy of the mark as it is waxy and just sits on your skin instead of being absorbed.  I woke up with my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> amazing super hydration!</li>
            <li> a great night cream!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this night  cream and love that  it&#x27;s natural.  I wake up with hydrated skin in the morning!  Best night cream I&#x27;ve used! It is quite heavy for the day time do I only  use it at night.</li>
            <li> Love it, skin looks great! I live in the desert and I just turned 60. I have tried many products,  this is as good or better than the most expensive</li>
            <li> Feels very Oily and heave on a face for night, and not absorbs well. And else I bought Bee Friendly REJUVENATING AND ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZING  cream, so I don&#x27;t see any difference between those  creams, everything the same, same ingredients, just different price</li>
            <li> Awesome product and company.  Quick delivery and nice company follow up.  Skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> the product is too thick and sticky,and priced too high.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad, but just not as good as the other reviews indicated.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed as I paid 3 times the price of the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; night creams.</li>
            <li> Sticky and not smooth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream left my face very oily and greasy.  It broke out my face.</li>
            <li> Great cream&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Wonderful face cream.  A little goes a long way, so also a real bargain.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> My wife is using night creams for the first time and loves this product, so much so she has asked me to order more!</li>
            <li> Awesome night cream! I&#x27;ve tried many creams and none have been as moisturizing as this one. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. It is not greasy, the smell is so light and pleasant. You only need a little as it is very thick.  I will be ordering more when this is gone.</li>
            <li> This cream is great and helps my face feel refreshed. My only advice is to not use every night. I use it on rotation with another lotion and the effects seem better.</li>
            <li> Great product! Feels good on my skin, smells good and I love the way my skin looks in the morning. So far I like the results a lot more than the other, expensive &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Although they weren&#x27;t kidding about &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;. But I think I&#x27;ve figured out the right amount to use (very, very small amount).</li>
            <li> mediocre as i still use it daily.</li>
            <li> I just use this under my eyes, helps with the bags. Tha&#x27;ts about it</li>
            <li> updated 11/3/15 - After using this cream for several months (I&#x27;m on my second cream now) I developed a horrible rash on my chin in kind of a U shape.  It&#x27;s red, flaky, and sore.  After seeing a dermatologist with all my skin care items in tow, they determined I have an allergy to beeswax and recommended I stop using the Bee Friendly products.  I&#x27;ve stopped using this night cream and mask - and after not changing anything else about my skin care routine the rash is clearing up.  I&#x27;m very disappointed as I did love this cream.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Fantastic all natural skin cream.  Wonderfully moisturizing without any strange scents.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth. The smell is good. I have tried many products on my skin that did not work. This is the first one that actually made a difference in the wrinkle areas of the face and neck skin and the areas that are trying to develop the big pours. Some of the sagging that was just starting is gone as well. I have a lot of allergies to products. I have had no problem with this product at all. I am happy I gave this a try and would encourage anyone who has tried all of the other products that have not worked well, to give this one a try. You will not regret this product at all. Be sure to gently rub in circles into your skin. Pampering time for me, includes gently rubbing this cream into my face and neck areas. Relaxes me and make me look better</li>
            <li> The cream has a great texture and smell. Dont see incredible results yet, but will keep using!, I also liked the fast shipping and good customer service.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and so far so good.  Smooth and non greasy :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Item as described...fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Nice gentle citrus smell.  Very moisturizing.  I like the feel and look of it.  I only need a little for my whole face, so it should last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! I could write love 100 more times and it still wouldn&#x27;t be enough lol! This is a must have! It along with the face and eye cream hydrate my face soon well. The condition of my skin is improving and my face feels so soft! Highly and enthusiastically recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT - my skin feels so much better in the morning</li>
            <li> Its a great product. I have been using this for over one week now and it seems to be a perfect blend of Natural Ingredients.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing, it makes my skin radiant and moist . I have really oily skin . At beginning I was concerned but this cream didnt cause any breakout or anything. My skin loves it</li>
            <li> Nice feel and skin is soft!</li>
            <li> This night cream is a wonderful moisturizer. I use it at bedtime and wake up with fresh, hydrated skin. I also rub it into my cuticles. I works great!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a week now and it&#x27;s honestly the best night cream I&#x27;ve ever had! Soft and creamy, non-greasy, and leaves my skin glowing in the morning! Will definitely buy more! I highly recommend it to anyone with inflammation caused by acne since it tones mine down so much! Doesn&#x27;t even clog my pores!</li>
            <li> Smells great...useful for elbows, knees and heels.  My skin is combination so I don&#x27;t use it on my face...it is heavy.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel when I put it on, and again it feels so soft in the morning. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and  doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores like most lotions do. Also, it doesn&#x27;t take much each application, so the jar is going to last quite awhile, making it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the top brand skin lines.  This one works just as well, if not better than most. Best of all, it&#x27;s pure. What I&#x27;ve found with many products is they work for a while and then my skin goes back to dry. Not with this! My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this product it really works for my skin, definitely will recommend this night cream to others. Thanks once again.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I apply it at night underneath my eyes. It does moisturize nicely and the smell is delicious. It does leave a slight greasy layer on the skin, but by morning, it seems to be soaked in.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff as a night cream (not for the day - too greasy).  It definitely is very hydrating and I wake up feeling refreshed.  Also, you only need to use a little each night so this container is going to last me forever!</li>
            <li> Works, but it smells funny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! This cream is the only cream that moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS NIGHT CREAM!  I was a staunch Clinique/Kiehl&#x27;s user until they started changing and cheapening their formulas.  I found this while browsing on Amazon and liked the reviews, but most importantly, the ingredient statement.  (The price is incredibly reasonable as well). I suffer from dry, dull skin... especially during the winter months and this cream feels so luxurious and hydration.  My skin looks healthy and refreshed in the mornings... so much so, that I just bought the serum and face/eye cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;The natural aroma of these products is also a huge plus as I always stay away from chemical fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream!!! This night cream really work. I wake up my skin looks brighter and smooth. I am hook!!! I just love love this night cream. Finally a cream that is natural with a great result! Did I mention AWESOME customer service! Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful night creme, best part is that it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I really love this night cream.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling soft. I noticed a difference in my skin within days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so amazing! I saw results immediately the next morning. My wrinkles were dramatically diminished.  I will be buying some for my mom and sister!</li>
            <li> Finally found the perfect cream. Put it on my face when I dampen first, goes on and absorbs so well, delightful, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product.  By far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> My first order of this lovely product never arrived. After emails to Amazon Customer Service and the good folks at Bee Friendly Skincare, my account was credited the entire purchase price and I was was free to reorder...or not. I know, though, that mistakes happen and because I&#x27;m quite intrigued by this product, I reordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say it was a wonderful decision because this is a lovely product. Lush and silky with a faint scent of honey, it rolls onto my skin with the lightest touch of my fingers. It absorbs very quickly, too, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling (or looking) greasy. I don&#x27;t feel it at all, to be honest; there&#x27;s no real &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to this night cream as there with similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love that this product is 100% organic. I love that I can pronounce every ingredient from which it was made--and that I know what those items are, too. I love that the soft yellow color of this cream is natural and due to the ingredients and is not from the addition of chemical colors. Same with the scent; it&#x27;s a natural result of the mix of its clean and fresh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many other women, I&#x27;ve got an array of like products from which to choose. But this one, Bee Friendly&#x27;s luscious and delicate night cream has vaulted to the top of the pile on my bathroom counter. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering when the time comes--and am off to peruse their other products, too.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream! Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super silky and soft.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I think it is rather pleasant and unoffensive.  It&#x27;s definitely a night cream; too oily for the day.  I also use a little extra on my eyes.  It feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a nighttime eye cream. I was using a lighter cream, and the skin around my eyes was feeling dry and tight by mid afternoon. I now use this at night and the lighter cream under my makeup during the day. I haven&#x27;t had that tight, dry feeling around my eyes since. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and it makes my skin very soft. I&#x27;m not sure if this product helps with wrinkles, but my skin looks brighter and healthier. And I also like the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to review a cosmetic product, but I love this so far.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use many products: my eyes are very sensitive, and i get headaches.&lt;br /&gt;This has a very soothing, relaxing smell. I apply this all around my eyes and eye lids as we&#x27;ll ! It feels so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels and looks good in the morning too.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found this :)&lt;br /&gt; Will give updates in a few months!</li>
            <li> I love this company. I use both the day and night creams and it leaves my skin feeling nourished, I have dry skin but live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s humid, and it&#x27;s not too much. Love!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for about a week but so far I can say it is very moisturizing.  I have high hopes for results with it long-term.  The seller delivered the product very quickly so I was pleased with that as well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful night cream for dry skin</li>
    </ol>
