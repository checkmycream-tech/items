            <li>good stuff!</li>
            <li>The nutmeg oil is great in and of itself and deserves 5 starts.  </li>
            <li>Great for bachaches, tendonitis, arthritis, etc.</li>
            <li>great value and quality.</li>

            <li>My pies, bread, muffins, anything that calls for nutmeg are now superior to what I have made before.</li>
            <li>Some of the literature I&#x27;ve read has said Nutmeg is good for HIV.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as Aura Cacia but cheaper.</li>
            <li>In my book that&#x27;s a good thing though.</li>
            <li>Good to use on achy joints</li>
            <li>Good purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>the Nutmeg Oil smells great and arrived incredibly quick!</li>
            <li>It smells good, helps with pain and is fabulous for cooking!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so warm and soothing.</li>
            <li>I use it in homemade toothpastes since it helps to heal sore gums - perfect for sensitive mouths.  </li>
            <li>This added a nice complement to the triple chocolate holiday soap I made :)… smells just like nutmeg :)</li>
            <li>Great product, the nutmeg oil is pure and it works well as fragrance for my living room and also as a muscle relaxer.  </li>
            <li>I just need to dose more, well see</li>
            <li>The addition of a dropper top will make them 5 stars almost every time.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>its okay</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and look forward to buying more goodies from them in the future.</li>
            <li>Hope to utilize this in many ways.</li>
            <li>This Nutmeg oil had a richer and more pure smell to it, and seemed to be the best quality as compared to several others.</li>
            <li>If you are using this on the skin you must dilute it with a carrier oil, my favorite is sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>at best maybe takes it down a notch or two on a pain scale of 1-10.</li>
            <li>Dropper top allows for controlled dispensing which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>For a number of years, I have been studying about Aroma Therapy, but haven&#x27;t actually purchased very many oils.</li>
            <li>I love the nutmeg essential oil; it smells and tastes like nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I had ordered about 5 different Nutmeg oils from various other Amazon stores and this oil from Pure Formulas was packaged the best and shipped sooner than any of the others.</li>
            <li>That´s why I buy NOW FOODS pure oils.</li>
            <li>On receiving it and reading the fine print, it says &#x60;not for internal use&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Really does take away the pain.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So far I have taken large doses and not yet tripped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>normally I would need fro 6 - 10 indocin  in pills before I would begin to feel some pain relief.</li>
            <li>Very strong though, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>BUT ONLY IF YOU PURCHASE PURE OILS.</li>
            <li>Very high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>and if you do yourself the blessings of researching their uses, you will be surprised and amazed.</li>
            <li>my wife mixed several drops of liquid nutmeg with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and then she rubbed my right foot which was in pain due to gout.</li>

            <li> my wife mixed several drops of liquid nutmeg with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and then she rubbed my right foot which was in pain due to gout.</li>
            <li> YOU ONLY NEED A FEW DROPS.</li>
            <li> Now oils is cheaper than other brands which makes me continue to purchase from them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to trip balls off of the active ingredient in nutmeg.</li>
            <li> Has the active ingredient (myristicin) been removed in some way?</li>
            <li> It does not come with a dropper, making it difficult to measure how much you are using.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in a bowl in my living room a few times a week</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure of the effects yet, but I do sense an immediate calming and it does seem to have helped with my blood circulation.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that a company that sells food products would sell something like this as not for internal use and not have that clearly in the description.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend hurt his back real bad.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you wont be sorry</li>
            <li> However, after trying this product, I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> This oil rubbed into a painful area with a dot of lotion relieves the pain in seconds!  </li>

            <li> I bought this product in order to trip balls off of the active ingredient in nutmeg. However, after trying this product, I was a bit disappointed. So far I have taken large doses and not yet tripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there some reason for this? Has the active ingredient (myristicin) been removed in some way? If so, I demand a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or I just need to dose more, well see</li>
            <li> The nutmeg oil is great in and of itself and deserves 5 starts.  It smells great and a little goes a long way.  I use it in homemade toothpastes since it helps to heal sore gums - perfect for sensitive mouths.  The bottle it comes in is not feasible.  It does not come with a dropper, making it difficult to measure how much you are using.  I will need to purchase a separate bottle with a dropper for usage and proper storage.  Now oils is cheaper than other brands which makes me continue to purchase from them.  The addition of a dropper top will make them 5 stars almost every time.</li>
            <li> Really does take away the pain.  I love this product. It&#x27;s so warm and soothing. I use it for joint pain. Love it.</li>
            <li> Essential oils work and if you do yourself the blessings of researching their uses, you will be surprised and amazed. THEY WORK BUT ONLY IF YOU PURCHASE PURE OILS. That´s why I buy NOW FOODS pure oils.</li>
            <li> This added a nice complement to the triple chocolate holiday soap I made :)… smells just like nutmeg :) Awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Now &#x60;FOODS&#x27; to use for making 7X flavoring for cola. On receiving it and reading the fine print, it says &#x60;not for internal use&#x27;. Very disappointed that a company that sells food products would sell something like this as not for internal use and not have that clearly in the description.</li>
            <li> I love the nutmeg essential oil; it smells and tastes like nutmeg. Yes, I said taste, because I have used it in my chai tea and it can be used in your cooking.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The fragrance is LONG-lasting and only takes a tiny bit at a time.</li>
            <li> Great product, the nutmeg oil is pure and it works well as fragrance for my living room and also as a muscle relaxer.  The nutmeg oil over powers cigarette smoke and prevents the smoke from entering my apartment. I put a few drops in a bowl in my living room a few times a week and it works.</li>
            <li> I always head for NOW essential oils.</li>
            <li> For a number of years, I have been studying about Aroma Therapy, but haven&#x27;t actually purchased very many oils. Some of the literature I&#x27;ve read has said Nutmeg is good for HIV.

            <li> This oil rubbed into a painful area with a dot of lotion relieves the pain in seconds!  Great for bachaches, tendonitis, arthritis, etc.</li>
            <li> my wife mixed several drops of liquid nutmeg with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and then she rubbed my right foot which was in pain due to gout. 10 minutes later the pain was gone. normally I would need fro 6 - 10 indocin  in pills before I would begin to feel some pain relief. I am going to use this combo on my left foot for diabetic neuropathy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Almost as good as Aura Cacia but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very high quality essential oil. Very strong though, so a little goes a long way. In my book that&#x27;s a good thing though. Dropper top allows for controlled dispensing which is very helpful. If you are using this on the skin you must dilute it with a carrier oil, my favorite is sweet almond oil. Bottom line is I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For pain its okay at best maybe takes it down a notch or two on a pain scale of 1-10.</li>
            <li> great value and quality.</li>
            <li> the Nutmeg Oil smells great and arrived incredibly quick!</li>

            <li> My boyfriend hurt his back real bad. Someone suggested nutmeg oil. WOW!! This thing really works. Buy it, you wont be sorry</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Good to use on achy joints</li>
            <li> We put this in our diffuser and the house smells like apple pie...good stuff!</li>
            <li> This Nutmeg oil had a richer and more pure smell to it, and seemed to be the best quality as compared to several others. I had ordered about 5 different Nutmeg oils from various other Amazon stores and this oil from Pure Formulas was packaged the best and shipped sooner than any of the others. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and look forward to buying more goodies from them in the future. P.S. I am an actual customer, not a \\&quot;friend\\&quot; of the business !</li>
