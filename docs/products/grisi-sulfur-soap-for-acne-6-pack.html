            <li>I know sulfur soap is not that good for the kids</li>
            <li>Good soap, dries up acne but also dries up skin.</li>
            <li>the smell its so good out of the box but in the shower.....</li>
            <li>I remember looking at models and actresses on Tv just praying that my skin could one day be as gorgeous and as even as</li>

            <li>Good for underarm wetness.</li>
            <li>Also keeps my skin good color.</li>

            <li>If you need something like this for your skin, as I do, this is  good choice.</li>

            <li>I have a strong acne and this soap works very good for me.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but the price is kind of high.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The seller was excellent and the soap was exactly as described and arrived almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would use others&#x27; hands to give it as many thumbs up as I can!</li>
            <li>Good stuff real clean feeling</li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone, but for me, this is amazing.</li>
            <li>but for what it does, I&#x27;d happily pay the 20 bucks on here for a 6-pack, still cheap.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it often works for people that benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t effective for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap is nice.</li>
            <li>own</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a good moisturizer because the soap can be drying and if you don&#x27;t replace that moisture, your skin will produce excess oil to make up for it causing more pimples.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell all that nice</li>
            <li>Does anybody know of a good brand without strong perfumes?</li>
            <li>good but strong smell</li>
            <li>It also has a VERY strong perfume odor which I assume is supposed to mask the sulfur smell.</li>
            <li>Our Dr. had wanted him to take a very strong anti-fungal medication</li>
            <li>It gave me a tan.the sulfur is very strong, it made my eyes water even when it wasn&#x27;t used on my face.  </li>
            <li>This GRISI Sulfur soap with Lanolin has a very strong added odor.  </li>
            <li>but my skin scars very easily).</li>
            <li>This soap contains a very strong perfume scent that set off my asthma.</li>
            <li>This would be more effective during the summer months when my skin is oiler.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, and love the price even more!</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, but I can honestly say this is the best skincare product I have ever had the pleasure of using.</li>
            <li>the benefits are great but be aware before you buy it</li>
            <li>i buy this at food4less for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is very smooth and soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>skin is very smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful soap</li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse well, or preferably use at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Many soaps contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which is a known skin irritant.</li>
            <li>and I dont get pimples on my bottom any more.</li>
            <li>better b/c</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks great Now!!!!!</li>
            <li>Its fantastic!</li>
            <li>I noticed it also cleared my face up (for the most part).</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>And no dreadful side-effects to worry about!  </li>
            <li>that bar was used up, he had me look on amazon for more</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s thrilled and his hand is completely free of the fungal infection now.</li>
            <li>Yes, the shipping DOES cost MORE than the product, but . . .</li>
            <li>One more note:  </li>
            <li>Most creams make me feel like it sits on my skin and</li>
            <li>Also, most lightening/brightening creams note to avoid sun</li>
            <li>Most creams make me feel like it sits on my skin and</li>
            <li>Also, most lightening/brightening creams note to avoid sun</li>
            <li>After trying so many products I found my skin reacted well to sulfur soap.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels better.  </li>
            <li>He has oily skin and is now acne free!</li>
            <li>Still a quicker strategy than most acne product</li>
            <li>I do notice my skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li>Words cannot express how much I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather like most soaps, rather it feels like a creamy soap (I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the lanolin).</li>
            <li>and I have been more confident than I ever was before.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible either.</li>
            <li>My favorite anti acne bar would be proactive.  </li>
            <li>The product contains sulphur, which my hyper sense of smell recognizes but most people are not so well endowed and nobody has ssaid they can smell anythign when I ask them.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>Grisi Sulfur Soap will be in my bathroom for many days to come.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face nice and clean and acne free!</li>
            <li>I liked that it was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This soap is simple and effective!!</li>
            <li>The quality is very good, and the bars have lasted longer than others I have tried, even though they are not very big.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with my Proactive Treatments and have noticed a phenomenal results, my skin is virtually acne free.  </li>
            <li>Next I use witch hazel astringent, with aloe, which I discovered works real effectively in preventing inflammation in my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the soap for over a month; I wanted to really test the product&#x27;s ability over a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you reside in a hot tropical climate you will need and or truly love sulfur soap !</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It cleared my acne up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong soap, with a strong smell, but I have no problems with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap with high hopes since it got good reviews.</li>
            <li>and I am VERY HAPPY MY SKIN IS 80times Better and also it helps with dark spots too!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li>But the sulfur acts as a mild exfoliant, so that&#x27;s part of what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Very Strong Odor On First Use, But Diminshes</li>
            <li>It is a little drying though so a good moisturizer is good to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Some blemishes still get through, but this has been hugely helpful to me.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it helps with my facial seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Strong smell to them, but they leave your face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>...works great on summer cycling back</li>
            <li>She has gotten SUCH GREAT RELIEF from THIS GRISI BRAND SOAP.  </li>
            <li>now he had smooth skin！</li>
            <li>When your face is smooth after, you tend to still have oil or some sort of moisturizer from the product.</li>
            <li>Plus it is cheap, when I think about the money I have tried on products over the years I want to cry.  </li>
            <li>but overall, im happy with it.</li>
            <li>It was amazing and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Smells but works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also, the bar is soap free and does not leave a coating on my skin.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into the gross details, but this soap has greatly reduced acne in about of week of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to me that I don&#x27;t use anything that dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>this soap is great, especially for scabies.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>Has a clean smell, It&#x27;s also great for entire body.</li>
            <li>THIS percentage IS important because the higher amount of sulfur in the soap, the better the results.</li>
            <li>Do this twice a day and in my experience, you will begin to see significant improvement in 3-5 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ingredients are also sensitive-skin friendly.  </li>
            <li>I tried this 2-years ago and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased....and it has a higher sulphur content than the wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about this product</li>
            <li>It was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>and then Clean and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helps keep clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>And Clean Feel After Application</li>
            <li>and I leave the shower feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this soap to help clean up my acne and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I had never seen so many positive reviews for a product before.</li>
            <li>Sure my face is red from the rinsing and drying, but it quickly calms and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products including prescription drugs, and this little bar of soap is more effective than all of them put together.</li>
            <li>If someone could alter genetic code for great skin, that may be the only real fix!</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t itchy but they were bright red dots everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I use this soap with the Clarisonic facial brush, and it&#x27;s good that way.</li>
            <li>This soap has 10% sulfur which is good for various skin afflictions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly I apply moisturizing lotion on my face, and call it good.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smell is not bad.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are very small and provide excellent scrubbing/cleaning without being overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li>However, the smell dissipates quickly so it isn&#x27;t a problem if you don&#x27;t like the way it smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you Grisi Co. for inventing the BEST solution to several human skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>I use this soap much for my back and face, is great for helping me with the fat of the face and prevent acne.</li>
            <li>LUCKILY</li>
            <li>Works but super smelly</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of ecezema</li>
            <li>I like the mild smell.  </li>
            <li>Sulfur is one of the oldest and most effective non-prescription treatments for acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li>The bars are not very big, but they are packaged very nicely, the soap smells better than most sulpher bars, and they appear to be manufactured to a high standard.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong but I really like it.</li>
            <li>The exercise part I don&#x27;t do, but overall, this is some pretty good soap.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good but drying, and I already have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Try the pomada azufre (sulfur pomade) by the same sulfur-soap company; you will love what it does!</li>
            <li>The instructions say to let dry on your face for 10 minutes; I only do that about 2-3 times per week based on time and still got wonderful</li>
            <li>Pleasant smelling, fab soap helps with scabies and other bug bites.</li>
            <li>and I see a face that looks healthier, even-toned, calm, and balanced.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this item available to us by mail.</li>
            <li>I would caution there is a distinct oder associated with using this product.</li>
            <li>I keep this soap in the house for my teens and for my own occasional outbreak.</li>
            <li>I carry studio 35 beauty cleansing towelettes in case I need a touch up (oily skin), which I rarely do anymore.</li>
            <li>give it a try it could work for u and remember natural things works better than anything AND PLEASE PLEASE DONT USE MAKE UP</li>
            <li>Still worth it for the results it gives.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not 100% clear, 95% is okay with me.  </li>
            <li>Has made a very positive improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>In conjunction to keeping skin clean with any facial regimen, its suggested that you also have a pretty healthy diet, drink plenty of water and excercise.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This is a very reasonably priced sulfur bar soap that works well.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why I am giving it a 4 out of 5 is because the smell is pretty strong, not bad</li>
            <li>A complimentary cologne is certainly acceptable.  </li>
            <li>It can be a little drying to the skin in some places so it is good to put on lotion</li>
            <li>second time to buy it, I like the sulfur soap, give you a clean smooth skin, no itch at all.</li>
            <li>This soap does wonders,my skin is so clear and smooth  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to break out in the hot humid summer months.</li>
            <li>As soon as I went back to using my Paulas Choice products my face cleared up a lot and looked so much better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not used to sulfur soap, be aware that the smell is something to get used to.  </li>
            <li>At first she couldn&#x27;t figure out what exactly was getting the fibers to come out of her skin, but the longer she used this soap, she figured out that is what was helping.  </li>
            <li>I washed my face for the first time with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap twice a day for about 3 weeks now and my skin is soft, smooth, glowy, and radiant.</li>
            <li>I have more acne on my back now than I did before I used this product.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>..shiping is fast!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to spend that much money on a face wash!  </li>
            <li>Very well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first bar</li>
            <li>me, use this, it really does work!</li>
            <li>Love this soap this is my second batch.</li>
            <li>The topical ointment is magic too.</li>
            <li>I find the 6 pack a more economical means of purchased as opposed to single bars.</li>
            <li>I had problems with steady outbreaks right between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This soap have shown a magical result with only few days wash off oily substantial reduced and smooth kept smooth in touch.</li>
            <li>Every parent with an acne prone teenager should be trying this before they resort to strong and potentially harmful prescription drugs.</li>
            <li>Certainly works well.</li>
            <li>And yes, it has a distinct smell, but it fades quickly and is nothing near the overwhelming rotten-egg smell you typically think of with sulfur.</li>
            <li>However, if you didn&#x27;t smell the sulfur like you can with this product, then it might not have a very high concentration of sulfur.  </li>
            <li>I tried other sulfur soaps because i run out of this one and it was out of market, and it was nothing compare to this one, this one is not expensive and really does a great job at removing the oil and yet don&#x27;t leaving the skin very dry.</li>
            <li>I stock up when I can because this soap works great on tough acne.</li>
            <li>of the biggest bonuses is that it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I use this soap on my whole body, except for my unmentionables.</li>
            <li>, I really just want to be helpful.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the normal face washes</li>
            <li>It clearing up my son&#x27;s acne fast.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and often need to lather, wash and rinse my face twice back-to-back; this really gets all of the residual grease clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li>The soap is much easier to work with than the sulfur wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 with hormonal acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li>but it really works..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combination of this has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combination of this has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>THIS LATIN PRODUCTS IS A REALLY SLEAZY OUTFIT.AGAIN</li>
            <li>This soap is very helpful with problem skin.</li>
            <li>I find this product very helpful.</li>
            <li>Very Sleek</li>
            <li>My skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li>Since the price on this soap is beyond reasonable, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe this, even all the reviews.</li>
            <li>These are very generously-sized bars.  </li>
            <li>It seems to leave a delicate film on my face that feels good, and I think it&#x27;s probably beneficial.</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of acne or just have simple breakouts, get this soap and use it in the morning and at night, regularly.</li>
            <li>I find that lathering it on the area, then leaving it for a few minutes is highly effective.</li>
            <li>Not sure how I came to finding about this soap, but I am SUPER glad I did.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a lightening cream but most lightening creams, for me, are too heavy, which is why the Clean and Clear gel works for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a lightening cream but most lightening creams, for me, are too heavy, which is why the Clean and Clear gel works for me.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for my problem with acne on the back and have definitley noticed a change.  </li>
            <li>Keep my back clean.</li>
            <li>I dislike the smell, although overall the product leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This soap had definitely helped calm my mild rosacea and clear up my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances and this has a pleasant subtle almost lemony smell that dissipates once it&#x27;s rinsed off.</li>
            <li>Great soap, smells a little sulfuric, extremely drying, but it really seems to help with acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: One of my older sons has tinea versicolor</li>
            <li>my skin goes on-jive with sulfur, particularly this brand of soap.  </li>
            <li>but I do highly recommend Paulas Choice products.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>wish I had this soap in high school.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s hard to get teenagers to do it, but if you can get your child to use this soap every day, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have learned that I should always have Grisi Sulfur Soap as a standard of living a calm skin life.</li>
            <li>I enjoy that the soap isn&#x27;t mooshy when wet.</li>
            <li>Soap lathers like  a normal bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>given the results, I can live with it.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Florida,</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida,</li>
            <li>Great for use everyday, but does not last very long at that rate.</li>
            <li>so actually works better...create a good thick lather</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone who had oily complexion with frequent break outs.</li>
            <li>I still have light dark spots that are fading</li>
            <li>I still have light dark spots that are fading</li>
            <li>(I ran out and didn&#x27;t restock), and I had a bit more acne than usual emerge over that time.  </li>
            <li>This was my first try with sulfer soap and it definitely has a drying quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a magical cure or anything, but if you have acne or are acne-prone, be sure to shower with sulfur soap to save yourself the pain of unsightly acne.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day with my Proactive treatments and it has given me clear skin the first time in my entire life.</li>
            <li>I have been using this sulfur soap for almost two years, and my face stays crisp and clear with only the occasional minor breakouts that disappear as quick as they emerged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Face olive oil soap, which we love), and my husband opened up a bar of sulfur soap (not this particular brand) and noticed after just a couple of days that the small fungal infection on his hand (which the dr. thinks he picked up at the gym) was actually beginning to heal!!!  </li>
            <li>Everything broke me out and nothing would clear my skin.</li>
            <li>and I have clear skin, something I haven&#x27;t seen since I was 12.</li>
            <li>but it clearly works well.</li>
            <li>Clear Morning Burst hydrating gel moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up in days and has stayed clear for over two years now.</li>
            <li>When used as directed helps clear breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have obnoxiously intermediate skin--acne problems on my forehead and chin but clear cheeks and nose.  </li>
            <li>Its only fault is that if you get it near your eyes, it burns intensely.  </li>
            <li>so when parents ask me about something for their kids&#x27; acne, I now direct them to a sulfur mask (if they don&#x27;t have an allergy to sulfur) and to a soap.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks it made it look like my old self again.</li>
            <li>I use this product along with the pomade Azufre de la cruz, and then the witch hazel 100% natural astrigent  to combat the dryness.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer straight sulfur smell over the faux flower-sulfur mix.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough that it does not irritate my face</li>
            <li>therefore I must use a heavy moisturizing cream every night and a light moisturizer</li>
            <li>my son 9 years old</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to suffer through adult acne going through products found at the drug store, doctors prescriptions and Sephora products until I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It has completely transformed my skin into something I never thought it could be.</li>
            <li>It has completely changed my skin</li>
            <li>THE SOAP DIDNT HELP MY ADULT ACNE.</li>
            <li>am 29 years old with large pore on my cheeks, oily Tzone, small bumps on my face that easily scar from constant picking.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day my face remains even-toned and non-oily (not dry, but a normal amt of oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years now with success!</li>
            <li>Next time I try something new, I&#x27;ll do before and afters!</li>
            <li>Not smooth, literal squeak of a clean.</li>
            <li>(My skin is pretty tough, and yours might be too sensitive for that full regimen.)</li>
            <li>My skin is bit tight after using, but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>This is only part of my regime as I mix up a food grade lotion that also helps me maintain a normal skin.  </li>
            <li>the smell is not unpleasant and the soap seems designed to last longer than the usual bar or regular soap... I will come back with another review when I start seeing significant results</li>
            <li>My skin is not 100% (maybe 80%) clear but after two weeks it is working better than other things I have tried (for a fraction of the cost) and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin (which tends to be dry anyway).</li>
            <li>and since we live on a farm, sweat and dirt equal breakouts for me!</li>
            <li>If it works, then great, but I find that to be an awkward use of time, especially if showering.  </li>
            <li>Her hands are starting to look normal again, instead of all swollen, red, torn apart, and full of black specks.  </li>
            <li>But even so, this soap dried them up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>NO other bars come close to 10%.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin slightly on the dry side, but nothing some oil free moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because as I have gotten older I am starting to see a difference in my skin especially that on my legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great soap, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it I see a return of those under-the-skin bumps, which is apparently an excess of keratin.</li>
            <li>So far I plan on getting a 2nd bar.</li>
            <li>Work as expected and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I tried different acne fighting products, medications and even the notorious Accutane, which reduced my acne&#x27;s severity but never succeeded in clearing it completely...</li>
            <li>Rosacea is apparently somewhat like acne</li>
            <li>I use to have problems with pimples popping up on the back of my neck near my hairling.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my rosecea and it actually leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I suffer from hormonal acne  (36 year old female).  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products and this along with Pomada De Azufre Sulfur Ointment has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>My initial purchase was an attempt to rid my moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and my red spots are slowly getting lighter.</li>
            <li>Smells a little funny...</li>
            <li>We started using this as a facial soap, but soon started using it as a general bath soap too.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to the young, old, and in-between before wasting your money on other products that in the end, won&#x27;t work, or ingesting drugs into your body.  </li>
            <li>I do have a small cyst-like pimple now on my chin (which is rare for me)</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I worked with what I had to keep it down, but I certainly know this stuff keeps my acne from coming back.</li>
            <li>Has a slight abrasive quality but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>smell is gross for the first few washes, but I think I just got used to it  after awhile and now don&#x27;t notice the smell at all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I know sulfur soap is not that good for the kids</li>
            <li> Good soap, dries up acne but also dries up skin.</li>
            <li> the smell its so good out of the box but in the shower.....</li>
            <li> I remember looking at models and actresses on Tv just praying that my skin could one day be as gorgeous and as even as</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good for underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> Also keeps my skin good color.</li>

            <li> I have a strong acne and this soap works very good for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap!!!!!!</li>

            <li> nice product, smells good.</li>

            <li> The seller was excellent and the soap was exactly as described and arrived almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would use others&#x27; hands to give it as many thumbs up as I can!</li>
            <li> Good stuff real clean feeling</li>
            <li> It may not work for everyone, but for me, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> but for what it does, I&#x27;d happily pay the 20 bucks on here for a 6-pack, still cheap.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it often works for people that benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t effective for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap is nice.</li>
            <li> own</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a good moisturizer because the soap can be drying and if you don&#x27;t replace that moisture, your skin will produce excess oil to make up for it causing more pimples.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell all that nice</li>
            <li> Does anybody know of a good brand without strong perfumes?</li>
            <li> good but strong smell</li>
            <li> It also has a VERY strong perfume odor which I assume is supposed to mask the sulfur smell.</li>
            <li> Our Dr. had wanted him to take a very strong anti-fungal medication</li>
            <li> It gave me a tan.the sulfur is very strong, it made my eyes water even when it wasn&#x27;t used on my face.  </li>
            <li> This GRISI Sulfur soap with Lanolin has a very strong added odor.  </li>
            <li> but my skin scars very easily).</li>
            <li> This soap contains a very strong perfume scent that set off my asthma.</li>
            <li> This would be more effective during the summer months when my skin is oiler.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, and love the price even more!</li>
            <li> Only time will tell, but I can honestly say this is the best skincare product I have ever had the pleasure of using.</li>
            <li> the benefits are great but be aware before you buy it</li>
            <li> i buy this at food4less for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is very smooth and soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> skin is very smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful soap</li>
            <li> Make sure you rinse well, or preferably use at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Many soaps contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which is a known skin irritant.</li>
            <li> and I dont get pimples on my bottom any more.</li>
            <li> better b/c</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin looks great Now!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its fantastic!</li>
            <li> I noticed it also cleared my face up (for the most part).</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> And no dreadful side-effects to worry about!  </li>
            <li> that bar was used up, he had me look on amazon for more</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s thrilled and his hand is completely free of the fungal infection now.</li>
            <li> Yes, the shipping DOES cost MORE than the product, but . . .</li>
            <li> One more note:  </li>
            <li> Most creams make me feel like it sits on my skin and</li>
            <li> Also, most lightening/brightening creams note to avoid sun</li>
            <li> Most creams make me feel like it sits on my skin and</li>
            <li> Also, most lightening/brightening creams note to avoid sun</li>
            <li> After trying so many products I found my skin reacted well to sulfur soap.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels better.  </li>
            <li> He has oily skin and is now acne free!</li>
            <li> Still a quicker strategy than most acne product</li>
            <li> I do notice my skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather like most soaps, rather it feels like a creamy soap (I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the lanolin).</li>
            <li> and I have been more confident than I ever was before.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not terrible either.</li>
            <li> My favorite anti acne bar would be proactive.  </li>
            <li> The product contains sulphur, which my hyper sense of smell recognizes but most people are not so well endowed and nobody has ssaid they can smell anythign when I ask them.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> Grisi Sulfur Soap will be in my bathroom for many days to come.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face nice and clean and acne free!</li>
            <li> I liked that it was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This soap is simple and effective!!</li>
            <li> The quality is very good, and the bars have lasted longer than others I have tried, even though they are not very big.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with my Proactive Treatments and have noticed a phenomenal results, my skin is virtually acne free.  </li>
            <li> Next I use witch hazel astringent, with aloe, which I discovered works real effectively in preventing inflammation in my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the soap for over a month; I wanted to really test the product&#x27;s ability over a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you reside in a hot tropical climate you will need and or truly love sulfur soap !</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It cleared my acne up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong soap, with a strong smell, but I have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap with high hopes since it got good reviews.</li>
            <li> and I am VERY HAPPY MY SKIN IS 80times Better and also it helps with dark spots too!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise the product is fine.</li>
            <li> But the sulfur acts as a mild exfoliant, so that&#x27;s part of what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very Strong Odor On First Use, But Diminshes</li>
            <li> It is a little drying though so a good moisturizer is good to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Some blemishes still get through, but this has been hugely helpful to me.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it helps with my facial seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Strong smell to them, but they leave your face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> ...works great on summer cycling back</li>
            <li> She has gotten SUCH GREAT RELIEF from THIS GRISI BRAND SOAP.  </li>
            <li> now he had smooth skin！</li>
            <li> When your face is smooth after, you tend to still have oil or some sort of moisturizer from the product.</li>
            <li> Plus it is cheap, when I think about the money I have tried on products over the years I want to cry.  </li>
            <li> but overall, im happy with it.</li>
            <li> It was amazing and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Smells but works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also, the bar is soap free and does not leave a coating on my skin.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into the gross details, but this soap has greatly reduced acne in about of week of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to me that I don&#x27;t use anything that dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> this soap is great, especially for scabies.</li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> Has a clean smell, It&#x27;s also great for entire body.</li>
            <li> THIS percentage IS important because the higher amount of sulfur in the soap, the better the results.</li>
            <li> Do this twice a day and in my experience, you will begin to see significant improvement in 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ingredients are also sensitive-skin friendly.  </li>
            <li> I tried this 2-years ago and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased....and it has a higher sulphur content than the wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about this product</li>
            <li> It was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> and then Clean and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps keep clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> And Clean Feel After Application</li>
            <li> and I leave the shower feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this soap to help clean up my acne and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I had never seen so many positive reviews for a product before.</li>
            <li> Sure my face is red from the rinsing and drying, but it quickly calms and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products including prescription drugs, and this little bar of soap is more effective than all of them put together.</li>
            <li> If someone could alter genetic code for great skin, that may be the only real fix!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t itchy but they were bright red dots everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I use this soap with the Clarisonic facial brush, and it&#x27;s good that way.</li>
            <li> This soap has 10% sulfur which is good for various skin afflictions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly I apply moisturizing lotion on my face, and call it good.  </li>
            <li> Also, the smell is not bad.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating beads are very small and provide excellent scrubbing/cleaning without being overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li> However, the smell dissipates quickly so it isn&#x27;t a problem if you don&#x27;t like the way it smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you Grisi Co. for inventing the BEST solution to several human skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping</li>
            <li> I use this soap much for my back and face, is great for helping me with the fat of the face and prevent acne.</li>
            <li> LUCKILY</li>
            <li> Works but super smelly</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of ecezema</li>
            <li> I like the mild smell.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur is one of the oldest and most effective non-prescription treatments for acne and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> The bars are not very big, but they are packaged very nicely, the soap smells better than most sulpher bars, and they appear to be manufactured to a high standard.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong but I really like it.</li>
            <li> The exercise part I don&#x27;t do, but overall, this is some pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good but drying, and I already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Try the pomada azufre (sulfur pomade) by the same sulfur-soap company; you will love what it does!</li>
            <li> The instructions say to let dry on your face for 10 minutes; I only do that about 2-3 times per week based on time and still got wonderful</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling, fab soap helps with scabies and other bug bites.</li>
            <li> and I see a face that looks healthier, even-toned, calm, and balanced.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this item available to us by mail.</li>
            <li> I would caution there is a distinct oder associated with using this product.</li>
            <li> I keep this soap in the house for my teens and for my own occasional outbreak.</li>
            <li> I carry studio 35 beauty cleansing towelettes in case I need a touch up (oily skin), which I rarely do anymore.</li>
            <li> give it a try it could work for u and remember natural things works better than anything AND PLEASE PLEASE DONT USE MAKE UP</li>
            <li> Still worth it for the results it gives.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not 100% clear, 95% is okay with me.  </li>
            <li> Has made a very positive improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> In conjunction to keeping skin clean with any facial regimen, its suggested that you also have a pretty healthy diet, drink plenty of water and excercise.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced sulfur bar soap that works well.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving it a 4 out of 5 is because the smell is pretty strong, not bad</li>
            <li> A complimentary cologne is certainly acceptable.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little drying to the skin in some places so it is good to put on lotion</li>
            <li> second time to buy it, I like the sulfur soap, give you a clean smooth skin, no itch at all.</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders,my skin is so clear and smooth  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to break out in the hot humid summer months.</li>
            <li> As soon as I went back to using my Paulas Choice products my face cleared up a lot and looked so much better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not used to sulfur soap, be aware that the smell is something to get used to.  </li>
            <li> At first she couldn&#x27;t figure out what exactly was getting the fibers to come out of her skin, but the longer she used this soap, she figured out that is what was helping.  </li>
            <li> I washed my face for the first time with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap twice a day for about 3 weeks now and my skin is soft, smooth, glowy, and radiant.</li>
            <li> I have more acne on my back now than I did before I used this product.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> ..shiping is fast!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to spend that much money on a face wash!  </li>
            <li> Very well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first bar</li>
            <li> me, use this, it really does work!</li>
            <li> Love this soap this is my second batch.</li>
            <li> The topical ointment is magic too.</li>
            <li> I find the 6 pack a more economical means of purchased as opposed to single bars.</li>
            <li> I had problems with steady outbreaks right between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This soap have shown a magical result with only few days wash off oily substantial reduced and smooth kept smooth in touch.</li>
            <li> Every parent with an acne prone teenager should be trying this before they resort to strong and potentially harmful prescription drugs.</li>
            <li> Certainly works well.</li>
            <li> And yes, it has a distinct smell, but it fades quickly and is nothing near the overwhelming rotten-egg smell you typically think of with sulfur.</li>
            <li> However, if you didn&#x27;t smell the sulfur like you can with this product, then it might not have a very high concentration of sulfur.  </li>
            <li> I tried other sulfur soaps because i run out of this one and it was out of market, and it was nothing compare to this one, this one is not expensive and really does a great job at removing the oil and yet don&#x27;t leaving the skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I stock up when I can because this soap works great on tough acne.</li>
            <li> of the biggest bonuses is that it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my whole body, except for my unmentionables.</li>
            <li> , I really just want to be helpful.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the normal face washes</li>
            <li> It clearing up my son&#x27;s acne fast.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and often need to lather, wash and rinse my face twice back-to-back; this really gets all of the residual grease clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li> The soap is much easier to work with than the sulfur wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 with hormonal acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li> but it really works..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combination of this has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combination of this has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> THIS LATIN PRODUCTS IS A REALLY SLEAZY OUTFIT.AGAIN</li>
            <li> This soap is very helpful with problem skin.</li>
            <li> I find this product very helpful.</li>
            <li> Very Sleek</li>
            <li> My skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li> Since the price on this soap is beyond reasonable, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe this, even all the reviews.</li>
            <li> These are very generously-sized bars.  </li>
            <li> It seems to leave a delicate film on my face that feels good, and I think it&#x27;s probably beneficial.</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of acne or just have simple breakouts, get this soap and use it in the morning and at night, regularly.</li>
            <li> I find that lathering it on the area, then leaving it for a few minutes is highly effective.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I came to finding about this soap, but I am SUPER glad I did.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a lightening cream but most lightening creams, for me, are too heavy, which is why the Clean and Clear gel works for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a lightening cream but most lightening creams, for me, are too heavy, which is why the Clean and Clear gel works for me.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it for my problem with acne on the back and have definitley noticed a change.  </li>
            <li> Keep my back clean.</li>
            <li> I dislike the smell, although overall the product leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This soap had definitely helped calm my mild rosacea and clear up my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances and this has a pleasant subtle almost lemony smell that dissipates once it&#x27;s rinsed off.</li>
            <li> Great soap, smells a little sulfuric, extremely drying, but it really seems to help with acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: One of my older sons has tinea versicolor</li>
            <li> my skin goes on-jive with sulfur, particularly this brand of soap.  </li>
            <li> but I do highly recommend Paulas Choice products.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> wish I had this soap in high school.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to get teenagers to do it, but if you can get your child to use this soap every day, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I have learned that I should always have Grisi Sulfur Soap as a standard of living a calm skin life.</li>
            <li> I enjoy that the soap isn&#x27;t mooshy when wet.</li>
            <li> Soap lathers like  a normal bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> given the results, I can live with it.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Florida,</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida,</li>
            <li> Great for use everyday, but does not last very long at that rate.</li>
            <li> so actually works better...create a good thick lather</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone who had oily complexion with frequent break outs.</li>
            <li> I still have light dark spots that are fading</li>
            <li> I still have light dark spots that are fading</li>
            <li> (I ran out and didn&#x27;t restock), and I had a bit more acne than usual emerge over that time.  </li>
            <li> This was my first try with sulfer soap and it definitely has a drying quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical cure or anything, but if you have acne or are acne-prone, be sure to shower with sulfur soap to save yourself the pain of unsightly acne.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day with my Proactive treatments and it has given me clear skin the first time in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sulfur soap for almost two years, and my face stays crisp and clear with only the occasional minor breakouts that disappear as quick as they emerged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Face olive oil soap, which we love), and my husband opened up a bar of sulfur soap (not this particular brand) and noticed after just a couple of days that the small fungal infection on his hand (which the dr. thinks he picked up at the gym) was actually beginning to heal!!!  </li>
            <li> Everything broke me out and nothing would clear my skin.</li>
            <li> and I have clear skin, something I haven&#x27;t seen since I was 12.</li>
            <li> but it clearly works well.</li>
            <li> Clear Morning Burst hydrating gel moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up in days and has stayed clear for over two years now.</li>
            <li> When used as directed helps clear breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have obnoxiously intermediate skin--acne problems on my forehead and chin but clear cheeks and nose.  </li>
            <li> Its only fault is that if you get it near your eyes, it burns intensely.  </li>
            <li> so when parents ask me about something for their kids&#x27; acne, I now direct them to a sulfur mask (if they don&#x27;t have an allergy to sulfur) and to a soap.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks it made it look like my old self again.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the pomade Azufre de la cruz, and then the witch hazel 100% natural astrigent  to combat the dryness.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d prefer straight sulfur smell over the faux flower-sulfur mix.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough that it does not irritate my face</li>
            <li> therefore I must use a heavy moisturizing cream every night and a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> my son 9 years old</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to suffer through adult acne going through products found at the drug store, doctors prescriptions and Sephora products until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It has completely transformed my skin into something I never thought it could be.</li>
            <li> It has completely changed my skin</li>
            <li> THE SOAP DIDNT HELP MY ADULT ACNE.</li>
            <li> am 29 years old with large pore on my cheeks, oily Tzone, small bumps on my face that easily scar from constant picking.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day my face remains even-toned and non-oily (not dry, but a normal amt of oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now with success!</li>
            <li> Next time I try something new, I&#x27;ll do before and afters!</li>
            <li> Not smooth, literal squeak of a clean.</li>
            <li> (My skin is pretty tough, and yours might be too sensitive for that full regimen.)</li>
            <li> My skin is bit tight after using, but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> This is only part of my regime as I mix up a food grade lotion that also helps me maintain a normal skin.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not unpleasant and the soap seems designed to last longer than the usual bar or regular soap... I will come back with another review when I start seeing significant results</li>
            <li> My skin is not 100% (maybe 80%) clear but after two weeks it is working better than other things I have tried (for a fraction of the cost) and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin (which tends to be dry anyway).</li>
            <li> and since we live on a farm, sweat and dirt equal breakouts for me!</li>
            <li> If it works, then great, but I find that to be an awkward use of time, especially if showering.  </li>
            <li> Her hands are starting to look normal again, instead of all swollen, red, torn apart, and full of black specks.  </li>
            <li> But even so, this soap dried them up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> NO other bars come close to 10%.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin slightly on the dry side, but nothing some oil free moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because as I have gotten older I am starting to see a difference in my skin especially that on my legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great soap, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it I see a return of those under-the-skin bumps, which is apparently an excess of keratin.</li>
            <li> So far I plan on getting a 2nd bar.</li>
            <li> Work as expected and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I tried different acne fighting products, medications and even the notorious Accutane, which reduced my acne&#x27;s severity but never succeeded in clearing it completely...</li>
            <li> Rosacea is apparently somewhat like acne</li>
            <li> I use to have problems with pimples popping up on the back of my neck near my hairling.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my rosecea and it actually leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hormonal acne  (36 year old female).  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products and this along with Pomada De Azufre Sulfur Ointment has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> My initial purchase was an attempt to rid my moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and my red spots are slowly getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funny...</li>
            <li> We started using this as a facial soap, but soon started using it as a general bath soap too.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to the young, old, and in-between before wasting your money on other products that in the end, won&#x27;t work, or ingesting drugs into your body.  </li>
            <li> I do have a small cyst-like pimple now on my chin (which is rare for me)</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I worked with what I had to keep it down, but I certainly know this stuff keeps my acne from coming back.</li>
            <li> Has a slight abrasive quality but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> smell is gross for the first few washes, but I think I just got used to it  after awhile and now don&#x27;t notice the smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv (worked, but became expensive), Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Dr. Freeman&#x27;s, Biore, you name it and</li>
            <li> I noticed that my breakouts decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap and a small tube of cream (kind of small but has lasted me a few weeks using nightly) by the same company at Family Dollar.</li>
            <li> This completely cleared up my back acne (YAY!), but it is entirely too harsh on my face (frown).</li>
            <li> My clothes began smelling strange only after I started to use the soap.</li>
            <li> so this stuff plus the OTC gel product &amp;#34;Prosacea&amp;#34; has definitely out-performed the prescription garbage by a long margin.  </li>
            <li> As the days progressed, which is now my first month of use, there are less breakouts, and less scarring .</li>
            <li> it slowly, subtly helped my acne (which is better than nothing, like with store brands like Clearasil, Neutrogena, clean&amp;clear. waste of money!)</li>
            <li> only drawback is the odor - it&#x27;s bearable, but lasts for a very long period of time.  </li>
            <li> Each bar is very long lasting</li>
            <li> The soap is actually soothing, although sulfur can dry one&#x27;s skin out a bit.</li>
            <li> Also this does smell kind of bad, but it did help my skin condition.</li>
            <li> It  took a few weeks for me to clear up, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This appears to have lessened the acne, but not completely eradicated it.</li>
            <li> It helps with breakouts somewhat, but not completely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll add a new review in a few months!</li>
            <li> Other OTC stuff would make my face red, flaky, and over-produce oil- and ironically break out.</li>
            <li> We had tried various other home remedies before the sulfur soap and some helped</li>
            <li> Use this in conjunction with lye soap twice a day then apply dry skin cream to plaque psoriasis.</li>
            <li> The dry skin cream I use is prescription Triamcinlone</li>
            <li> Use to help fight KP skin issue, does work well, but can dry skin out if used to often</li>
            <li> Cleans my face well and doesnt dry it out.</li>
            <li> Using this soap twice a day did help dry out my oily skin</li>
            <li> but this soap can also make the skin dry.</li>
            <li> it makes ur skin so dry it causes a rash</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any sulfer smell while using the soap, but did notice the smell lingers on the towel used to dry off.  </li>
            <li> If used to often does dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does dry out the skin and it does smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Products containing salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide tend to dry out my acne-free areas with variable results in controlling problem spots.  </li>
            <li> After showering (with this soap), towel dry body.</li>
            <li> Let air dry.</li>
            <li> As with all acne treatments, washing more than twice a day is irritating and drying to skin, which can actually make it worse, so stick to twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is it is a bit drying to my skin, but the benefits outweigh it.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and have very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Since using this soap for ONLY 3 weeks, these black fibers have lessened, and the soap is also drawing them out of the rest of her skin on her body.  </li>
            <li> I use it after applying oxy-cleaner of 10% benzoyl peroxide, because the benzoyl makes my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> If you have issues with acne or other minor skin problems, this might be just the thing to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it at least once per day with a loofah sponge and let the lather stay on the back for at least a few minutes (not the full 10 minutes, as recommended on the packaging).</li>
            <li> Just a little red spot on my elbows.</li>
            <li> He has it on his neck mostly and in the Texas heat, it gets bad in the summer months.</li>
            <li> Work up a lather on wet skin and then leave it there for 10 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Then a few years later I started to break out again.</li>
            <li> but he had rough  scaly skin.</li>
            <li> I was wet his skin with soap and massage for10min.</li>
            <li> wet my face in the shower, and rubbed the soap between my hands to make a lather and then applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I can tell if he skips a few days as it starts to come back.</li>
            <li> The last few times I went, they didn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Wet soap to develop some suds.</li>
            <li> I looked through all the reviews and no one has mentioned their clothes coming out of the wash having a slight rotten egg smell, or the strange burnt smell after being in the dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, my husband has had some serious adult acne breakouts, we can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li> In fact, my face got red and started peeling a few days after using it, so I use this strictly from the neck down.</li>
            <li> I have only gotten 2 zits, around my chin line, but I&#x27;m not sure if that was due to me applying another face product.</li>
            <li> , I use it Evey other day, and then apply Sarna lotion.</li>
            <li> I give it to other a lot.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED OTHER SULFUR SOAPS - NONE OF THEM</li>
            <li> I would notice a small difference in redness and irritation the next morning.</li>
            <li> No need to worry about other people smelling it in close proximity.</li>
            <li> There are other products that say they contain sulfur in them</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I&#x27;m not going to be able to try this.</li>
            <li> I think I am due for another one.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old had the a really bad case of eczema dermatitis and once we started using this soap, it really cleared it out, and he stopped itching.</li>
            <li> I knew sulfur was the active ingredient</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel clean and the smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant in the shower or on the skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> more acne scarring, no more self-consciousness due to bad acne beyond adolescence.  </li>
            <li> Our experience with these bars has been positive, and is less expensive than a prescription.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also use the soap as shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis, common in teen boys.</li>
            <li> With Proactive I average about 1 - 2  pimples a week and 1 - 2</li>
            <li> I average about 1 - 2 pimples a month and have not had a boil on my face since I started using this soap (3 months</li>
            <li> I would continue to use it every day, except that it is sulfur so even after you wash the soap off, it leaves a faint fart smell that you catch a whiff of every time you move really fast.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily skin and it dies me up without irritating me.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t noticeable like some other products!</li>
            <li> It seems to help break down the black heads.</li>
            <li> I washed probably for a couple of seconds, though I&#x27;ve read from other reviewers that you&#x27;re supposed to let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap less than a month and it has worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like another reviewer in that I previously used a sulphur wash that my derm.</li>
            <li> She had the black fibers in the cuticles of her fingernails, and no matter what she tried to get them out, they continuously kept coming out.  </li>
            <li> and is is less</li>
            <li> HAD USED ANOTHER BRAND PREVIOUSLY</li>
            <li> Pimples go away quicker, with less swelling</li>
            <li> my skin was still a mess.</li>
            <li> There seems to be NO rebound, and my skin feels normal - not the weird feeling I got from the $60 per tube (travel toothpaste size)</li>
            <li> She has a few very, very small red spots that are still healing up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP MADE MY ACNE WORSE AND CAUSED RED BLOTCHES IN OTHER AREAS.I</li>
            <li> but, learned the hard way to not use it in dry fall/winter time</li>
            <li> I always wondered what those little bumps under my skin were.  </li>
            <li> it seemed to reduce inflammation overnight, little by little.</li>
            <li> If you are worried just wear a little perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li> He showers with the soap and leaves the lather on his neck for a few minutes before rinsing and all the spots have disappeared.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to wear deodorant anymore while I used it and for a few months after I still didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I never used a bar soap to wash my face because I felt that would be messy</li>
            <li> but whenever I try to switch soaps after about 3 weeks I will see a few pimples popping up.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> This soap has replaced my everyday bath soap.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son and daughter and their acne got worse and their skin dried out.  </li>
            <li> I get a few bumps here and there, but they are so small that it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that the sulfur will upset the balance of the natural bacteria.</li>
            <li> (sulfur is anti a lot of things), but the soaps  are small for the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, though.</li>
            <li> We ran out of soap one day (we usually use the Kiss</li>
            <li> I have managed to stalemate my acne using Proactive Solution for the past 6 years.  </li>
            <li> so Im not sure how that will work out for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - not sure if it&#x27;s this soap or something else.</li>
            <li> I usually bathe with this soap in the summer helps keep Mosquitos off .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American Male in my late 30s, have had horrible pizza type acne</li>
            <li> small boils on my face per month but at least that is manageable.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find.</li>
            <li> hard part was finding it,</li>
            <li> I had horrible acne through my late teen years and early twenties.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is the way it has made my clothes smell.</li>
            <li> I also have some scarring that&#x27;s fading, slowly, but fading still.</li>
            <li> He hadn&#x27;t used it right away, thought I was giving him some crap stuff, but he was sick of the acne, and so he finally gave in &amp; used it.</li>
            <li> The film is very slight and thin and makes my skin matte, which I like.</li>
            <li> And by bed, I mean crawl into bed with my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didnt work for me, if uu reading this it doesnt mean this soap wont work</li>
            <li> I replaced my shampoo with this stuff and no more acne on my hairline!</li>
            <li> I may have a very small blemish every now and then, but it has improved the quality of my skin drastically.  </li>
            <li> along with the soap because it seems to lessen redness and scarring from acne and also keeps the pimples from getting dry and flaky while healing, which looks bad under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use nothing else and no more acne!!</li>
            <li> This made our son&#x27;s acne way worse.</li>
            <li> IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE AND SEARCH ABOUT ACNE RELIEF</li>
            <li> I have been buying an expensive prescription which has a sulfur base, this soap does the same job for one tenth the price.</li>
            <li> I do not have bad acne but get a few pimples a week that do go away if I use face masks, face peels, etc.</li>
            <li> at the first after i use a bar i always have my acne, smell bad, and at the end my acne was worst</li>
            <li> Needless to say she had me reordering it to be shipped PRONTO.</li>
            <li> This soap did give me an initial breakout but it wasn&#x27;t awful (maybe 3 or 4 pimples max).</li>
            <li> Each time it helped rid his foot of the uncomfortable wart.  </li>
            <li> not use on wash cloth for applications as it is difficult to get the sulphur smell out of cloth.</li>
            <li> I recommend all acne suffers give sulfur soap 10% a chance.</li>
            <li> I rinse it off with cold water; rinsing it with cold water will leave a bit of the soap in my pores.  </li>
            <li> THE LATIN PRODUCTS SULPHUR SOAP WAS DEFINITIVELY SOMETHING DANGEROUS WITH INFERIOR,UNPURE,CHEAP,CHEMICALS.</li>
            <li> almost impossible to read.</li>
            <li> This soap does not smell as bad as I thought it would, but it has cleared up my face quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t  like the fact that it dries my skin out so bad.</li>
            <li> Just to give you an idea of how bad my skin is.  </li>
            <li> im not saying this is a bad soap</li>
            <li> Does not smell that bad.</li>
            <li> Made my skin worse and smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> I slept on a bed about 5 years ago that caused me to breakout and itch VERY bad.</li>
            <li> These fibers stuck in the skin is VERY PAINFUL.  </li>
            <li> I know how psoriasis can make you feel nasty and ashamed.</li>
            <li> My face looked HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> and, after we read all the horrific side effects, we knew it wasn&#x27;t something we wanted to try.  </li>
            <li> Without Proactive, I would develop horrible pizza acne and boils on my face within a week.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the soap isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The seller was excellent and the soap was exactly as described and arrived almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the odor - it&#x27;s bearable, but lasts for a very long period of time.  If you don&#x27;t want your washroom to smell like the soap, you&#x27;ll want to have an airtight container.</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders,my skin is so clear and smooth  this is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it helps with my facial seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Grisi sulfur soap was recommended to me by a salon stylist. I ordered it online before I even left the store that day. The best purchase for the price that I&#x27;ve ever made. I would caution there is a distinct oder associated with using this product. Make sure you rinse well, or preferably use at bedtime. Love this product, and love the price even more!</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this product.  I originally purchased it for my problem with acne on the back and have definitley noticed a change.  It does tend to cause itching if I use it every day, so I have decided to use the soap every 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter used it for a couple of months daily and it improved her acne by 100%!!! All acne was cleared up - she did get the one pimple at &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;. She let her Grisis Sulfur Soap run out and the acne returned. Needless to say she had me reordering it to be shipped PRONTO. She told me that she will NOT be without it again.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but this soap - just what I was looking for - excellent.</li>
            <li> Sulfur is one of the oldest and most effective non-prescription treatments for acne and other skin problems. I keep this soap in the house for my teens and for my own occasional outbreak. I have noticed that it often works for people that benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t effective for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use. Work up a lather on wet skin and then leave it there for 10 minutes before rinsing. Do this twice a day and in my experience, you will begin to see significant improvement in 3-5 days. I keep it at the sink and in the shower, which is great for teens who have some acne on their backs. As with all acne treatments, washing more than twice a day is irritating and drying to skin, which can actually make it worse, so stick to twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also uses [[ASIN:B00411B4CC Pomade De Azufre Sulfur Ointment 2.6 Oz Acne Cream De La Cruz]] along with the soap because it seems to lessen redness and scarring from acne and also keeps the pimples from getting dry and flaky while healing, which looks bad under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the soap as shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis, common in teen boys. It worked wonderfully for one of my sons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the smell of this soap. It seems to have an herbal smell, in addition to the not so great sulfur smell. However, the smell dissipates quickly so it isn&#x27;t a problem if you don&#x27;t like the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest bonuses is that it is very inexpensive. If you have issues with acne or other minor skin problems, this might be just the thing to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: One of my older sons has tinea versicolor and we discovered that this sulfur soap gets rid of it! He has it on his neck mostly and in the Texas heat, it gets bad in the summer months. He showers with the soap and leaves the lather on his neck for a few minutes before rinsing and all the spots have disappeared.</li>
            <li> It works~!  After about two weeks, my daughter&#x27;s acne is 100% gone.  She has a few very, very small red spots that are still healing up.&lt;br /&gt;It also works to reduce the need for deodorant.  There is no discernible perfume to the soap, so you can smell the sulfur when you lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are also sensitive-skin friendly.  It contains sodium tallowate, sodium cocoate, corn starch, fragrance, lanolin, tetrasodium EDTA, polysorbate 80.  Many soaps contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which is a known skin irritant.</li>
            <li> The bars are not very big, but they are packaged very nicely, the soap smells better than most sulpher bars, and they appear to be manufactured to a high standard. The quality is very good, and the bars have lasted longer than others I have tried, even though they are not very big.</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my whole body, except for my unmentionables. I&#x27;m afraid that the sulfur will upset the balance of the natural bacteria. For this i use vagisil.  It makes my skin very soft and I dont get pimples on my bottom any more. I appoligize if i come across as being crass, I really just want to be helpful.</li>
            <li> helps with dandruff&lt;br /&gt;but need to use neem shampoo as well</li>
            <li> I always wondered what those little bumps under my skin were.  When I found out the name of the condition I also researched how to eliminate them and found out about sulfur soap.  This soap definitely works for me.  If I don&#x27;t use it I see a return of those under-the-skin bumps, which is apparently an excess of keratin.</li>
            <li> I have a strong acne and this soap works very good for me. I use it after applying oxy-cleaner of 10% benzoyl peroxide, because the benzoyl makes my skin very dry. I love that it has lanolin, it is very good for the skin. I tried other sulfur soaps because i run out of this one and it was out of market, and it was nothing compare to this one, this one is not expensive and really does a great job at removing the oil and yet don&#x27;t leaving the skin very dry.</li>
            <li> The soap is nice. I keep it in my lab just in case (sulfur is anti a lot of things), but the soaps  are small for the price.</li>
            <li> I slept on a bed about 5 years ago that caused me to breakout and itch VERY bad. I think I may have had bed bugs or something, but anyway after changing beds and getting a shot, it cleared up. Then a few years later I started to break out again. This time I don&#x27;t think it was the bugs, but something like a skin reaction the the bugs from before. I used this once a day, when I would shower at night and it cleared up after about a month. Also I used it for like 3 months and I didn&#x27;t have to wear deodorant anymore while I used it and for a few months after I still didn&#x27;t need to. Not sure why, though. Also this does smell kind of bad, but it did help my skin condition. I was very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommend this to me. I was hesitant at first because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the normal face washes but after a month I could see the difference. My face is smooth and my red spots are slowly getting lighter. I&#x27;m going to continue using it and I&#x27;ll add a new review in a few months!</li>
            <li> Thank you Grisi Co. for inventing the BEST solution to several human skin conditions.  I have learned that I should always have Grisi Sulfur Soap as a standard of living a calm skin life. Thank you and keep making this bar of gold for the skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m still amazed. I have only gotten 2 zits, around my chin line, but I&#x27;m not sure if that was due to me applying another face product. Every morning I wake up and I see a face that looks healthier, even-toned, calm, and balanced. Other OTC stuff would make my face red, flaky, and over-produce oil- and ironically break out. I got the idea to continue with a sulfur soap as I was using the AcneFree sulfur mask 2x/day. I like the soap better b/c my face doesn&#x27;t feel cemented, but I do still use it about 1/week. Now with the soap I wake up, lather the soap on my face, let it set while I iron my husband&#x27;s clothes, and rinse off when I&#x27;m finishes- about 10-15 mins. Sure my face is red from the rinsing and drying, but it quickly calms and looks amazing. I also have some scarring that&#x27;s fading, slowly, but fading still. Throughout the day my face remains even-toned and non-oily (not dry, but a normal amt of oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a nurse so when parents ask me about something for their kids&#x27; acne, I now direct them to a sulfur mask (if they don&#x27;t have an allergy to sulfur) and to a soap. I keep waiting on a rebound explosion on my face, but nothing yet. So far I plan on getting a 2nd bar. Oh yeah, the bar has been lasting a while too, not wasting away like a regular body soap does (I just use it for my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall: it tarnishes sterling silver so remove your jewelry before using.</li>
            <li> We have been using sulfur cleansers for years for acne. It&#x27;s the only thing that works for my family. Our experience with these bars has been positive, and is less expensive than a prescription.</li>
            <li> I love it. It clearing up my son&#x27;s acne fast. Grisi Sulfur Soap is a waonderful product.... i JUST LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> After doing sum research I came across this and I am VERY HAPPY MY SKIN IS 80times Better and also it helps with dark spots too!! But still needs a lightner tho. Overall my skin looks great Now!!!!!</li>
            <li> Use this in conjunction with lye soap twice a day then apply dry skin cream to plaque psoriasis. After a couple of weeks it made it look like my old self again. Just a little red spot on my elbows. Try this method and maybe it will work for you.  I know how psoriasis can make you feel nasty and ashamed. I have my self esteem back now. The dry skin cream I use is prescription Triamcinlone Acetonide.1%. Hope this helps you like it did me.</li>
            <li> I use this soap because I get the sweat rashes in the summer and my face breaks out occasionally also.  With this soap it stops the rashes and acne on the face and back.  Its fantastic!</li>
            <li> Use to help fight KP skin issue, does work well, but can dry skin out if used to often, I use it Evey other day, and then apply Sarna lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for 10 years and nothing worked. Everything broke me out and nothing would clear my skin. I had been using face wash my dermatologist recommended but my skin was still a mess. I was looking for alternatives to the traditional acne treatments when I saw sulfur soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 10 months now and it&#x27;s the clearest my skin has ever been. I don&#x27;t break out anymore and I have clear skin, something I haven&#x27;t seen since I was 12. This soap is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Dries up my oily face, I&#x27;m hoping it knocks out all my acne, I have deep cysts and it seems to help.  Moisturize after washing and my face feels good.</li>
            <li> This soap is the only product I&#x27;ve ever tried that keeps my acne in check.  I may have a very small blemish every now and then, but it has improved the quality of my skin drastically.  The scent is a little strong, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overwhelming. I would use others&#x27; hands to give it as many thumbs up as I can!</li>
            <li> A very good skin cleanser.  I have very oily skin and often need to lather, wash and rinse my face twice back-to-back; this really gets all of the residual grease clogging my pores.  Has made a very positive improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap as a result of online research and frustration with my dermatologist. I have rosacea and the blisters to go with it-- rather I had the blisters before this soap. 200 dollars of product and my skin was a wreck. A 5 dollar bar of soap and it&#x27;s fine. Still a bit of redness, but nothing like it was, and the blisters are gone.  It may not work for everyone, but for me, this is amazing. It  took a few weeks for me to clear up, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Had sun spots and the sulfer soap has helped get rid of them for all of the family. Just a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great even if you don&#x27;t have acne. It also works on rosacea!</li>
            <li> I have given this product to some of my grandchildren who have some breaking out occasionally and it seems to keep the problem in check.</li>
            <li> We use this a lot. I give it to other a lot. It is hard to find. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This soap does not smell as bad as I thought it would, but it has cleared up my face quite a bit. It leaves skin slightly on the dry side, but nothing some oil free moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Great soap, smells a little sulfuric, extremely drying, but it really seems to help with acne. You&#x27;ll have to moisturize after using it though!</li>
            <li> at the first after i use a bar i always have my acne, smell bad, and at the end my acne was worst</li>
            <li> I use this product along with the pomade Azufre de la cruz, and then the witch hazel 100% natural astrigent  to combat the dryness. It&#x27;s great to have the feeling of knowing that i have no longer have pimples.</li>
            <li> I just reordered the six-pack. It seems to leave a delicate film on my face that feels good, and I think it&#x27;s probably beneficial. The film is very slight and thin and makes my skin matte, which I like. It does seem to help with acne, and I like to use it all over. The fragrance is strong but I really like it. I use this soap with the Clarisonic facial brush, and it&#x27;s good that way. Then I go over my face with a hydrogen-peroxide-soaked cotton pad, following with a mask of the Bye Bye Blemish sulfur lotion for acne. (My skin is pretty tough, and yours might be too sensitive for that full regimen.) Try the pomada azufre (sulfur pomade) by the same sulfur-soap company; you will love what it does!</li>
            <li> Cleans my face well and doesnt dry it out. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This completely cleared up my back acne (YAY!), but it is entirely too harsh on my face (frown). In fact, my face got red and started peeling a few days after using it, so I use this strictly from the neck down. It also has a VERY strong perfume odor which I assume is supposed to mask the sulfur smell. Personally, I&#x27;d prefer straight sulfur smell over the faux flower-sulfur mix. Does anybody know of a good brand without strong perfumes?</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling, fab soap helps with scabies and other bug bites. If you reside in a hot tropical climate you will need and or truly love sulfur soap !</li>
            <li> My skin tends to break out in the hot humid summer months. Several years ago I was prescribed a sulfur wash by a dermatologist for a separate skin condition. I noticed it also cleared my face up (for the most part). As the temps are rising and my face started breaking out again, I decided to perform a search for a non-Rx alternative sulfur wash. I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did. The soap is much easier to work with than the sulfur wash I had before which was a lotion. It lathers well and is easy to use. My skin is not 100% (maybe 80%) clear but after two weeks it is working better than other things I have tried (for a fraction of the cost) and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin (which tends to be dry anyway). Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> This summer Texas averaged at 100s every day that imprinted my facial oily skin problem from greasy grill burger fries lunch. This soap have shown a magical result with only few days wash off oily substantial reduced and smooth kept smooth in touch.</li>
            <li> This product I great for the use of acne. I just don&#x27;t  like the fact that it dries my skin out so bad. But so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Keep my back clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap with high hopes since it got good reviews. I&#x27;m 30 with hormonal acne and very oily skin. Using this soap twice a day did help dry out my oily skin but it dried it out too much. My face broke out and the blemishes ended up scanning over! My face looked HORRIBLE! As soon as I went back to using my Paulas Choice products my face cleared up a lot and looked so much better. This soap did not work for me at all but I do highly recommend Paulas Choice products. They&#x27;re the only products that have helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> Good product. Work as expected and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with Grisi Sulfur Soap. I use is on my face with a thorough rinse afterwards. It is gentle enough that it does not irritate my face but it clearly works well. Has a clean smell, It&#x27;s also great for entire body. Certainly works well. Have purchased before and will purchase again. I find the 6 pack a more economical means of purchased as opposed to single bars.</li>
            <li> Still using it to get results.</li>
            <li> This soap had definitely helped calm my mild rosacea and clear up my complexion.  I will always use this soap.  I don&#x27;t find it overly drying, but I use a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> We ran out of soap one day (we usually use the Kiss My Face olive oil soap, which we love), and my husband opened up a bar of sulfur soap (not this particular brand) and noticed after just a couple of days that the small fungal infection on his hand (which the dr. thinks he picked up at the gym) was actually beginning to heal!!!  Our Dr. had wanted him to take a very strong anti-fungal medication but our insurance refused to approve it and, after we read all the horrific side effects, we knew it wasn&#x27;t something we wanted to try.  We had tried various other home remedies before the sulfur soap and some helped but they didn&#x27;t get rid of it entirely.  Sulfur soap did the trick, though!!  And no dreadful side-effects to worry about!  (Not to mention, it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than the medication!  LOL!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When that bar was used up, he had me look on amazon for more and so we bought this one.  He&#x27;s thrilled and his hand is completely free of the fungal infection now.</li>
            <li> This made our son&#x27;s acne way worse. Went back to using another brand.</li>
            <li> Strong smell to them, but they leave your face squeaky clean. The only reason why I am giving it a 4 out of 5 is because the smell is pretty strong, not bad just strong.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap less than a month and it has worked well. It totally cleared my blemishes however it is a bit drying and causes my face to peel therefore I must use a heavy moisturizing cream every night and a light moisturizer daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who had oily complexion with frequent break outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like another reviewer in that I previously used a sulphur wash that my derm. prescribed but when I went off health insurance and priced it out it was close to $100 for a bottle that may have lasted 2-months...I tried this 2-years ago and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased....and it has a higher sulphur content than the wash so actually works better...create a good thick lather so it stays in place, let stand on face/skin 2-3 minutes and then rinse...works great on summer cycling back (aka pizza back) in lieu of a back facial too!</li>
            <li> this product does help with acne and skin irritations..the smell is something to get used to but it really works.. i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced sulfur bar soap that works well.  If you&#x27;re not used to sulfur soap, be aware that the smell is something to get used to.  However, if you didn&#x27;t smell the sulfur like you can with this product, then it might not have a very high concentration of sulfur.  We started using this as a facial soap, but soon started using it as a general bath soap too.</li>
            <li> My wife has Morgellons Disease.  This soap is EXCELLENT for getting rid of the fibers in her skin.  She swears by this soap.  She had the black fibers in the cuticles of her fingernails, and no matter what she tried to get them out, they continuously kept coming out.  Oil, especially, brought them out in droves.  Since using this soap for ONLY 3 weeks, these black fibers have lessened, and the soap is also drawing them out of the rest of her skin on her body.  These fibers stuck in the skin is VERY PAINFUL.  She has gotten SUCH GREAT RELIEF from THIS GRISI BRAND SOAP.  At first she couldn&#x27;t figure out what exactly was getting the fibers to come out of her skin, but the longer she used this soap, she figured out that is what was helping.  So, for Morgellons Disease, this soap is REQUIRED!!!  Her hands are starting to look normal again, instead of all swollen, red, torn apart, and full of black specks.  The price for shipping IS astronomical, but remember, this prduct IS IMPORTED, from what I understand.  Yes, the shipping DOES cost MORE than the product, but . . . given the results, I can live with it.  So, Morgy&#x27;s patients, get this soap!!  One more note:  I HAVE USED OTHER SULFUR SOAPS - NONE OF THEM WORKED LIKE THIS GRISI BRAND!!!  It has 10% Sulfur in it.  NO other bars come close to 10%.  This highest I found was 3%.  THIS percentage IS important because the higher amount of sulfur in the soap, the better the results.</li>
            <li> It gave me a tan.the sulfur is very strong, it made my eyes water even when it wasn&#x27;t used on my face.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American Male in my late 30s, have had horrible pizza type acne my entire life and have tried every product in the world.  I have managed to stalemate my acne using Proactive Solution for the past 6 years.  I came across this soap in the isle one day and decided to try it (like I said, I will try anything).  I was AMAZED at the results.  I use this in combination with my Proactive Treatments and have noticed a phenomenal results, my skin is virtually acne free.  Just to give you an idea of how bad my skin is.  Without Proactive, I would develop horrible pizza acne and boils on my face within a week.  With Proactive I average about 1 - 2  pimples a week and 1 - 2 small boils on my face per month but at least that is manageable.  Now that I add in this Sulfur Soap I average about 1 - 2 pimples a month and have not had a boil on my face since I started using this soap (3 months ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had this soap in high school.  I use it twice a day with my Proactive treatments and it has given me clear skin the first time in my entire life.</li>
            <li> This soap has 10% sulfur which is good for various skin afflictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it and it is what it is. The soap is actually soothing, although sulfur can dry one&#x27;s skin out a bit. But the sulfur acts as a mild exfoliant, so that&#x27;s part of what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> this soap is amazing! my son 9 years old but he had rough  scaly skin. I know sulfur soap is not that good for the kids so I only use it 3 times a month for my son. I was wet his skin with soap and massage for10min. rinse...... now he had smooth skin！ love it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap and a small tube of cream (kind of small but has lasted me a few weeks using nightly) by the same company at Family Dollar. Both products were a couple of dollars each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My history:&lt;br /&gt;I am 29 years old with large pore on my cheeks, oily Tzone, small bumps on my face that easily scar from constant picking. I do not have bad acne but get a few pimples a week that do go away if I use face masks, face peels, etc. but that takes a while and I do not have the patience with work, school, and mommy and wife duties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this soap, along with Asepxia (a blue bar soap, which I use for my neck and sometimes face)  and a sulfur cream. I never used a bar soap to wash my face because I felt that would be messy and I do not like bar soaps to begin with. I decided to buy it anyway because I felt I had nothing to lose. I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv (worked, but became expensive), Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Dr. Freeman&#x27;s, Biore, you name it and these did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one:  Night time.&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face in the shower, and rubbed the soap between my hands to make a lather and then applied it to my face. I washed probably for a couple of seconds, though I&#x27;ve read from other reviewers that you&#x27;re supposed to let it sit for a few minutes. Once you rinse, you will notice the difference in your skin immediately. It was squeaky clean. Not smooth, literal squeak of a clean. When your face is smooth after, you tend to still have oil or some sort of moisturizer from the product. I liked that it was squeaky clean. After that, I used the cream and went to bed. And by bed, I mean crawl into bed with my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My morning routine was just any soap, in my case, it was Biore Deep Pore Charcoal cleanser  and then Clean and Clear Morning Burst hydrating gel moisturizer. I carry studio 35 beauty cleansing towelettes in case I need a touch up (oily skin), which I rarely do anymore. I dont use any makeup so Im not sure how that will work out for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of this has really cleared my skin. I still have light dark spots that are fading but I think the sulfur soap is clearing that up as well. I would recommend a lightening cream but most lightening creams, for me, are too heavy, which is why the Clean and Clear gel works for me. Most creams make me feel like it sits on my skin and in addition with oily skin, it just makes me feel greasy all day. Also, most lightening/brightening creams note to avoid sun and I live in Florida, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this soap in the beginning of June 2014 so it&#x27;s only been a few weeks. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this product but I will not buy from Amazon unless I cannot find it at Family Dollar anymore, it&#x27;s way cheaper (no shipping) but for what it does, I&#x27;d happily pay the 20 bucks on here for a 6-pack, still cheap.out for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of this has really cleared my skin.

            <li> Just as I remembered! It is very drying, so sometimes lather up my face and let sit for a few minutes a couple times/wk and especially after extractions. Decrease the grease and acne causing bacteria burden</li>
            <li> Good stuff real clean feeling</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product to reduce and get rid of acne. I thought I was going to have to suffer through adult acne going through products found at the drug store, doctors prescriptions and Sephora products until I started using this product. Maybe it was the timing, that at my age my hormones were changing and my acne reduced on it own but whenever I try to switch soaps after about 3 weeks I will see a few pimples popping up. It cleared up my back and chest acne 95% and my face it keeps the acne at bay.</li>
            <li> great product great shioping</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my son&#x27;s dermatologist.  Could not find in our area, Thanks for making this item available to us by mail.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have sensitive oily skin and it dies me up without irritating me.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for years &amp; I have literally tried just about every product out there - OTC &amp; prescription.  This soap is the only one that has worked over time.  It isn&#x27;t the greatest smelling soap but it works! Plus it is cheap, when I think about the money I have tried on products over the years I want to cry.  This soap is simple and effective!!</li>
            <li> i buy this at food4less for a very cheap price. my skin goes on-jive with sulfur, particularly this brand of soap.  it minimizes my acne so if i have a big one now the next day it would get smaller. but this soap can also make the skin dry. but overall, im happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good soap, dries up acne but also dries up skin.</li>
            <li> This has been working wonders!! I tried all kinds of facial soaps,cleanser and scrubs, but this one tops them all! I washed my face for the first time with this and I realized that all of my deadskin was peeling off. As the days progressed, which is now my first month of use, there are less breakouts, and less scarring . In conjunction to keeping skin clean with any facial regimen, its suggested that you also have a pretty healthy diet, drink plenty of water and excercise. The exercise part I don&#x27;t do, but overall, this is some pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe acne. After trying so many products I found my skin reacted well to sulfur soap.  So I tried grisi soap and I had some progress with my acne.  Then My Dermatologists recommended Dr Joesoef&#x27;s Sulfur Soap 10% that is pharmaceutical quality medicated Sulfur Soap.  This Soap was very effective against my Acne on my face and body.  Joesoef Skin Care sulfur soap 10% is guaranteed to work.  they offer 60 day money back guarantee. Dr Joesoef sulfur soap has been used by dermatologists for over 40 years treating acne.  Sulfur Soap is anti bacterial and anti fungal.  I recommend all acne suffers give sulfur soap 10% a chance.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but the price is kind of high.&lt;br /&gt;Helps keep clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Finally got rid of beard dandruff with this!</li>
            <li> this soap does work. it slowly, subtly helped my acne (which is better than nothing, like with store brands like Clearasil, Neutrogena, clean&amp;clear. waste of money!) it seemed to reduce inflammation overnight, little by little. I would notice a small difference in redness and irritation the next morning. I would continue to use it every day, except that it is sulfur so even after you wash the soap off, it leaves a faint fart smell that you catch a whiff of every time you move really fast. lol it did work though.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. My skin cleared up in days and has stayed clear for over two years now. The only down side is it is a bit drying to my skin, but the benefits outweigh it.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking this would work but but it didnt it irritated my skin im not saying this is a bad soap but it didnt work for me, if uu reading this it doesnt mean this soap wont work give it a try it could work for u and remember natural things works better than anything AND PLEASE PLEASE DONT USE MAKE UP IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE AND SEARCH ABOUT ACNE RELIEF IT CLEARED UP MY FACE IN 3 DAYS</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, I always get this great soap for oily skin. Even feels like it gives me a mini facelift effect</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years, it takes away the flakes and shaving bumps from my son,&lt;br /&gt;the hard part was finding it, well one day I thought  try Amazon.com and not only did they have it they have the shampoo. and is is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynda</li>
            <li> Works great for my acne. I had problems with steady outbreaks right between my eyebrows. This soap did the trick! It is a little drying though so a good moisturizer is good to have on hand.</li>
            <li> He quality of the soap is good gives a nice lather but the smell its so good out of the box but in the shower.....i know its sulfer based but ita like rotting eggs all over your body</li>
            <li> This soap works for me.  I have seborreic dermatis.  This helped me earlier to reduce redness, then I stopped using it.  I was having flaking around my temples with red sores and I started using this again and my face feels better.  I use it with cerave moisturizer. I do have a small cyst-like pimple now on my chin (which is rare for me) - not sure if it&#x27;s this soap or something else.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Keeps my face nice and clean and acne free! Would def buy again. Also this is the best smelling sulfur soap ive ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He has oily skin and is now acne free! Ive tried it and it&#x27;s good but drying, and I already have dry skin. But it works great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> nice product, smells good.</li>
            <li> Items arrived as indicated.  Will use again.</li>
            <li> I had horrible acne through my late teen years and early twenties.  I forgot what the doc&#x27;s called my specific acne, but it was a type of stubborn acne that left scars in their place. I tried different acne fighting products, medications and even the notorious Accutane, which reduced my acne&#x27;s severity but never succeeded in clearing it completely... Until I started using this soap.  I have been using this sulfur soap for almost two years, and my face stays crisp and clear with only the occasional minor breakouts that disappear as quick as they emerged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strategy is to apply this soap on my face at the beginning of my evening shower.  I leave the soap on my face to give it time to settle in as I finish the rest of my shower.  I rinse it off with cold water; rinsing it with cold water will leave a bit of the soap in my pores.  Next I use witch hazel astringent, with aloe, which I discovered works real effectively in preventing inflammation in my face.  Lastly I apply moisturizing lotion on my face, and call it good.  Still a quicker strategy than most acne product applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more acne scarring, no more self-consciousness due to bad acne beyond adolescence.  It has done the trick for me for two years.  Prior to writing this review, I actually went three weeks without using this soap (I ran out and didn&#x27;t restock), and I had a bit more acne than usual emerge over that time.  I worked with what I had to keep it down, but I certainly know this stuff keeps my acne from coming back.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail promptly. Does not smell that bad. My husband has not made a comment.  My skin is bit tight after using, but goes away quickly. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my skin. Of course it has been 100+ degrees outside and since we live on a farm, sweat and dirt equal breakouts for me! If someone could alter genetic code for great skin, that may be the only real fix! I do notice my skin looks more radiant. Next time I try something new, I&#x27;ll do before and afters!</li>
            <li> It does the job, after about a month using it I noticed that my breakouts decreased significantly. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel clean and the smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant in the shower or on the skin afterwards. The one complaint I have is the way it has made my clothes smell. I looked through all the reviews and no one has mentioned their clothes coming out of the wash having a slight rotten egg smell, or the strange burnt smell after being in the dryer. My clothes began smelling strange only after I started to use the soap. Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> Works great in the humid summer time to keep acne at bay...but, learned the hard way to not use it in dry fall/winter time bc it makes ur skin so dry it causes a rash</li>
            <li> Works great.  Cleared up some blemishes on back.  Smells a little funny... but it is sulfur.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this soap. It has completely transformed my skin into something I never thought it could be. I remember looking at models and actresses on Tv just praying that my skin could one day be as gorgeous and as even as their&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve had acne and bacne for about 5 years now (age 14-19) and have been self-conscience about it. It kept me from doing activities with my friends and kept me from living my life how I wanted to. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING for my acne: Proactive, Clearasil, Aveeno, you name it. I&#x27;ve even seen a dermatologist. Nothing was working for my skin. In an hour of desperation, I stumbled upon this review page on Amazon. I had never seen so many positive reviews for a product before. So, having nothing to lose, I bought the 4 pack and had it shipped to my home. The smell of the soap isn&#x27;t terrible. In fact, I actually like the smell of it. When you rinse your face and apply moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t even leave a trace. No need to worry about other people smelling it in close proximity. If you are worried just wear a little perfume to cover it up. The soap itself is very smooth and soothing on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t lather like most soaps, rather it feels like a creamy soap (I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the lanolin). I massage the product onto my face and leave it on for 10 minutes like the package says. It creates a mask that dries to pull impurities out of the pores. This soap did give me an initial breakout but it wasn&#x27;t awful (maybe 3 or 4 pimples max). But even so, this soap dried them up fairly quickly. I would recommend getting a good moisturizer because the soap can be drying and if you don&#x27;t replace that moisture, your skin will produce excess oil to make up for it causing more pimples. I&#x27;ve been using this soap twice a day for about 3 weeks now and my skin is soft, smooth, glowy, and radiant. I get a few bumps here and there, but they are so small that it&#x27;s hardly noticeable. Doesn&#x27;t even compare to the mountains I had before. I do haveacne scars but I swear this soap is even helping those lighten up. Only time will tell, but I can honestly say this is the best skincare product I have ever had the pleasure of using. I cannot recommend this product enough. If anyone has problem with acne or even body acne, I would recommend this product in a heartbeat. It has completely changed my skin and I have been more confident than I ever was before. I no longer fear letting people see me without makeup. And that my friends, is truly life changing.</li>
            <li> This GRISI Sulfur soap with Lanolin has a very strong added odor.  Those people with sensitivities to chemical smells may wish to try a different brand.  Furthermore, the ingredients are not listed on the package, except for the two ingredients considered \\&quot;active.\\&quot; What else is in there, who knows... Finally the color combination on the package makes the ingredients, etc. almost impossible to read.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are dealing with things like an itchy rash as well as acne. There are other products that say they contain sulfur in them and I have tried them. They must not have the same amount in them because they don&#x27;t work as well as this does. Doesn&#x27;t smell all that nice but it&#x27;s not terrible either. It does what it says it will. Good product.</li>
            <li> Still smells like sulfur. Husband can smell it on me for hours. My towel holds the smell as well.  Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good for underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> I have more acne on my back now than I did before I used this product. Very upset. I would like to return it but I can&#x27;t afford s&amp;h for it.</li>
            <li> It cleared my acne up very quickly. It was amazing and very affordable.It&#x27;s a great product for problem skin. Thanks</li>
            <li> Giving a 1 star because I had an allergic reaction to it after using it for about a week.  I was on the 2nd bar when I noticed red dots all over my body.  They weren&#x27;t itchy but they were bright red dots everywhere.  The soap was the only thing different that I used.  I stopped using it and the dots disappeared after about 3 days.</li>
            <li> The product has worked like nothing else I tried control of my untimely breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I have starting to use it as my daily shower soap.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 3 months for moderate back acne (not so severe...but my skin scars very easily). I use it at least once per day with a loofah sponge and let the lather stay on the back for at least a few minutes (not the full 10 minutes, as recommended on the packaging). This appears to have lessened the acne, but not completely eradicated it. Still getting enough acne for scarring to continue to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the product is fine. It&#x27;s a strong soap, with a strong smell, but I have no problems with it. It makes my skin feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I keep using this soap? Yes. Will I keep looking for another product to try? Yep.</li>
            <li> This is our third order for this soap. Great for use everyday, but does not last very long at that rate. Still worth it for the results it gives.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with chronic exzema for years. The prescription from the doctor and recommendations did not work. I stumbled upon this product and decided I would give it a try (my thought was lets see if this isnt going to work either) The day after I started using Grisi I noticed the itchy exzema was starting to look like it was clearing up.  I now am on week two and it is clearer than it has ever been in 15 years. LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son and daughter and their acne got worse and their skin dried out.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Used this product for two different incidences of planters warts on my son.  Each time it helped rid his foot of the uncomfortable wart.  Beats paying for a podiatrist at $100.00 a pop.  May take up to a month, but scraping at the foot doctor didn&#x27;t get any results at all.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell or the film it left on my skin after using it, has lanolin so that &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; your skin</li>
            <li> I use this soap much for my back and face, is great for helping me with the fat of the face and prevent acne. Also keeps my skin good color. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old had the a really bad case of eczema dermatitis and once we started using this soap, it really cleared it out, and he stopped itching. I think this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I dislike the smell, although overall the product leaves me feeling clean. I enjoy that the soap isn&#x27;t mooshy when wet. It also produces a nice lather and feels good. I would suggest this company create this soap in a scented version to perhaps hide the smell. FYI the benefits are great but be aware before you buy it that if you use this soap, you can smell it on your skin all day!</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP MADE MY ACNE WORSE AND CAUSED RED BLOTCHES IN OTHER AREAS.I HAD USED ANOTHER BRAND PREVIOUSLY AND DIDNT HAVE THIS PROBLEM,ONLY THAT THE SOAP DIDNT HELP MY ADULT ACNE. I TRIED TO RETURN THIS ITEM TO LATIN PRODUCTS;I SPOKE TO THEM AND THEY PROMISED TO SEND ME A SHIPPING LABEL.LATIN PRODUCTS NEVER DID-THEY ARE LIARS!PLEASE DONT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM LATIN PRODUCTS. THEY ARE CROOKS! LUCKILY AMAZON .COM IS THE BEST AND THEY WILL REFUND MY MONEY. IVE USED DIFFERENT KINDS OF SULPHUR SOAP FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. THE LATIN PRODUCTS SULPHUR SOAP WAS DEFINITIVELY SOMETHING DANGEROUS WITH INFERIOR,UNPURE,CHEAP,CHEMICALS. THIS LATIN PRODUCTS IS A REALLY SLEAZY OUTFIT.AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THEM!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sulcus soap for years and I recommend it to everyone. It&#x27;s a great soap, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. If you have any kind of acne or just have simple breakouts, get this soap and use it in the morning and at night, regularly. It works! You have to be consistent with it. I know it&#x27;s hard to get teenagers to do it, but if you can get your child to use this soap every day, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I like it because it works..and the price is great..shiping is fast! I would tell anyone that has problems with acne to try it.</li>
            <li> This soap has been the only thing that has kept my ache under control. I have been using this for a few years now with success!</li>
            <li> My hubs gets a rash on his back from sweating at work.  This soap eradicates it.  I can tell if he skips a few days as it starts to come back. Smells but works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any sulfer smell while using the soap, but did notice the smell lingers on the towel used to dry off.  Soap lathers like  a normal bar of soap.  I didn&#x27;t let the soap sit for ten minutes, because I do not have any areas that needed it.  If it works, then great, but I find that to be an awkward use of time, especially if showering.  This was my first try with sulfer soap and it definitely has a drying quality. This would be more effective during the summer months when my skin is oiler.  Has a slight abrasive quality but not as much as I would like. My favorite anti acne bar would be proactive.  The exfoliating beads are very small and provide excellent scrubbing/cleaning without being overly abrasive.  Also, the bar is soap free and does not leave a coating on my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is very helpful with problem skin. When used as directed helps clear breakouts. If used to often does dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find this product very helpful. Some people may not like the smell of it, but I have no problem with the smell.</li>
            <li> It seems to help break down the black heads. It does dry out the skin and it does smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> I have obnoxiously intermediate skin--acne problems on my forehead and chin but clear cheeks and nose.  Products containing salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide tend to dry out my acne-free areas with variable results in controlling problem spots.  This product works great to keep my skin moisturized but not oily, and it keeps acne under control! And yes, it has a distinct smell, but it fades quickly and is nothing near the overwhelming rotten-egg smell you typically think of with sulfur.</li>
            <li> Smells but then what do you expect from sulfur . I usually bathe with this soap in the summer helps keep Mosquitos off .</li>
            <li> I use nothing else and no more acne!!</li>
            <li> Very happy that an &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; product works as well as I had hoped.  Rosacea is apparently somewhat like acne so this stuff plus the OTC gel product &amp;#34;Prosacea&amp;#34; has definitely out-performed the prescription garbage by a long margin.  There seems to be NO rebound, and my skin feels normal - not the weird feeling I got from the $60 per tube (travel toothpaste size) misery from the drug companies.  The product contains sulphur, which my hyper sense of smell recognizes but most people are not so well endowed and nobody has ssaid they can smell anythign when I ask them.  A complimentary cologne is certainly acceptable.  This is only part of my regime as I mix up a food grade lotion that also helps me maintain a normal skin.  I would give it a 5-star if it smelled like nothing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into the gross details, but this soap has greatly reduced acne in about of week of use.  Pimples go away quicker, with less swelling and my pores are drying out.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Rids of Blackheads&lt;br /&gt;+ Very Sleek And Clean Feel After Application And Wash&lt;br /&gt;+ Rids Of Face&#x27;s Oily-ness After Use&lt;br /&gt;+ Reduces Face&#x27;s Oily-ness Production&lt;br /&gt;+ Great Against Acne&lt;br /&gt;+ Great Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very Strong Odor On First Use, But Diminshes As Soap Dwindles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and I recommend this to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on  your skin.</li>
            <li> This soap has proven to be a quality deterrent of acne. It&#x27;s not a magical cure or anything, but if you have acne or are acne-prone, be sure to shower with sulfur soap to save yourself the pain of unsightly acne. Some blemishes still get through, but this has been hugely helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Caution asthmatics! This soap contains a very strong perfume scent that set off my asthma. I don&#x27;t know how the soap works; I had to return it immediately and use my rescue inhaler. I&#x27;d recommend to the manufacturer that they change/remove the scent!!</li>
            <li> Works but super smelly</li>
            <li> This soap has replaced my everyday bath soap.  My skin has really cleared up.  I have tried other products and this along with Pomada De Azufre Sulfur Ointment has really worked for me.  The bar of soap seems to last longer and a regular bar and I leave the shower feeling clean.  It can be a little drying to the skin in some places so it is good to put on lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use to have problems with pimples popping up on the back of my neck near my hairling. I replaced my shampoo with this stuff and no more acne on my hairline! Lasts forever too!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended a sulfur wash product that was a prescription that would have cost me $400! My insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay for it and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to spend that much money on a face wash!  I knew sulfur was the active ingredient so I tried this. It cleared up my rosecea and it actually leaves my skin soft. I am 70 years old and have very few wrinkles. It&#x27;s important to me that I don&#x27;t use anything that dries my skin out. This doesn&#x27;t.  Very well worth the price. Each bar is very long lasting I&#x27;m still on the first bar and it has been several weeks. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> this soap is great, especially for scabies. my kids got scabies earlier this year and this soap helps a lot. it&#x27;s almost a must have. and for the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, decreases acne, reduces redness after about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use on wash cloth for applications as it is difficult to get the sulphur smell out of cloth.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that works for me, and believe me, I have tried everything.  It took about 2-3 days to see results, and it has kept up!  Also, the smell is not bad.  It isn&#x27;t noticeable like some other products!</li>
            <li> Good for what ails your skin. Doesn&#x27;t smell great but it works so don&#x27;t use it before going on a date.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this online as I wanted to have immediate access to this product immediately. I did not buy this for Acne eventhough I do have outbreaks every couple years. I purchased this product because as I have gotten older I am starting to see a difference in my skin especially that on my legs. I have a mild case of ecezema and I scratch in my sleep. Also I am currently experiencing a fungal infection on my two big toenails. I am just going thru a ton of changes.. and as a person so likes to scratch and pick at scabs (yes I know this is gross) I know I am only adding fuel to the fire... or bacteria to the open wounds. So I am giving this soap a try to help heal my skin condition quicker. I am also taking MSM internally, using MSM (organic sulfur) cream on my face (cause I have the occasional blackhead/whitehead, and pimple) and fade cream to bring the beauty back to my skin and look like the feminine creature I am. I&#x27;m excited about this product simply because I know it will work... the smell is not unpleasant and the soap seems designed to last longer than the usual bar or regular soap... I will come back with another review when I start seeing significant results</li>
            <li> I suffer from hormonal acne  (36 year old female).  I had read the reviews prior to buying this product and was hesitant it would work as well for me as it has for all the others. I tried every product under the sun, even some prescriptions to no avail at clearing up my face and neck breakouts.  Since the price on this soap is beyond reasonable, I decided to give it a try.  I have been using the soap for over a month; I wanted to really test the product&#x27;s ability over a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I will say without a doubt this soap is such a lifesaver!  Although I&#x27;m not 100% clear, 95% is okay with me.  The instructions say to let dry on your face for 10 minutes; I only do that about 2-3 times per week based on time and still got wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is gross for the first few washes, but I think I just got used to it  after awhile and now don&#x27;t notice the smell at all.  I wash morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to the young, old, and in-between before wasting your money on other products that in the end, won&#x27;t work, or ingesting drugs into your body.  I will continue to use this great soap!</li>
            <li> I stock up when I can because this soap works great on tough acne.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at Walmart..$2.99 per bar. The last few times I went, they didn&#x27;t have it. Maybe they stopped selling it? Anyway, it&#x27;s a great product...great for acne, razor bumps, and the sort. And it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of soap for over two years now. My initial purchase was an attempt to rid my moderate adult acne. It helps with breakouts somewhat, but not completely. (Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar takes credit for that) Anyways, like I said, Slight/moderate (noticeable) effect in the facial acne department. It&#x27;s DOES however, for me, keep the occasional summer shoulder chest acne at bay. How? After showering (with this soap), towel dry body. Wet soap to develop some suds. Then I apply to affected areas. Let air dry. I do this 2-3 times a week during summer months. Works every time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe this, even all the reviews. I always feel like some people are paid to write reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, my husband has had some serious adult acne breakouts, we can&#x27;t figure out why. After about maybe 2 years trying Proactive, some store bought items, etc...I decided to go online &amp; take a look. Not sure how I came to finding about this soap, but I am SUPER glad I did. After only I think maybe a week of using this, his skin has cleared, acne &amp; scars. He hadn&#x27;t used it right away, thought I was giving him some crap stuff, but he was sick of the acne, and so he finally gave in &amp; used it. HE LOVES THE RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, use this, it really does work! No joke.</li>
            <li> These are very generously-sized bars.  I like the mild smell.  If you need something like this for your skin, as I do, this is  good choice.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a facial skin problem. I have been buying an expensive prescription which has a sulfur base, this soap does the same job for one tenth the price.</li>
            <li> I never got this product but they did return my funds. Disappointed that I&#x27;m not going to be able to try this.</li>
            <li> Love this soap this is my second batch. The only thing that has controlled my acne in 15 yrs. this along with apple cider vinegar as a tone and olive or jojoba oil to moisturizer n my skin is perfection.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products including prescription drugs, and this little bar of soap is more effective than all of them put together. I don&#x27;t agree with the reviews that say it has an offensive fragrance. I am very sensitive to fragrances and this has a pleasant subtle almost lemony smell that dissipates once it&#x27;s rinsed off. The topical ointment is magic too. Now that my acne has cleared, I use it only a couple times a week. Sometimes I only use on the area where I&#x27;m starting to break out. I find that lathering it on the area, then leaving it for a few minutes is highly effective. The ointment works wonders on my cystic breakouts. Can&#x27;t believe this stuff has been around all this time. Every parent with an acne prone teenager should be trying this before they resort to strong and potentially harmful prescription drugs. I don&#x27;t know if I have ever used a product and been happier with the results.</li>
            <li> good but strong smell</li>
            <li> Excellent Price and Product, love it!!</li>
            <li> Did not work.  Made my skin worse and smelled awful.  It also tarnished my James Avery jewelry.  I would not buy this product or recommend it to someone.  I have 5 bars of this stuff and wish I could send it back!</li>
            <li> second time to buy it, I like the sulfur soap, give you a clean smooth skin, no itch at all.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times.  I think I am due for another one.  Its only fault is that if you get it near your eyes, it burns intensely.  Buy this stuff because it&#x27;s a good astringent.  But be careful of getting it it near your eyes.</li>
            <li> Used shower twice a month&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin is very smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful soap</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap to help clean up my acne and it has worked wonders. Grisi Sulfur Soap will be in my bathroom for many days to come.</li>
