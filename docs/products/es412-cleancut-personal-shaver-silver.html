    <ol>
            <li>The Very Best ever.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!!!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what it is for, and it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>best try again.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the Venus Embrace razor which was the best</li>
            <li>not as awesome as the review wrote.</li>
            <li>So happy I bought this product</li>
            <li>This works great for me and my wife.  </li>
            <li>Shaver was great the video should come with an age warning thougth</li>
            <li>great for the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>It works great for under my arms.  </li>
            <li>These products are amazing!</li>
            <li>Plus the battery is not made to perform at optimum speeds for the spinning blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Cleancut before, and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Is very safe and your wont cut yourself,</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go, smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Does a good job at doing a fine cut finish job, but would be more helpful if the trimmer had a more pronounced description to go go with this.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>n DVD, reliable n scheduled Delivery would recommend others to use this product, amazingly giving smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The buffer would be the finishing touch on a lovely mani/pedi - not the tool you&#x27;d use to shape the nail.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The top of the unit screws on like a bottle cap.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned above</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned above</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use baby powder.  </li>
            <li>The size is great, however, it does not give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Our shaver is still going strong, and we are still as happy with it as we were when I first wrote this review.  </li>
            <li>While this actually fits very nicely in the hand, and is even ideal in size/shape for being in a sitting position while cleaning up the bikini line and such (&#x27;nuff said LOL), the metal is pretty darn slippery.  </li>
            <li>Glad we tried it nothing nicer than a smooth bikini area.</li>
            <li>Best results if you shave every other day or even 2 days between shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that by updating this review, right at the top, that more people will make note of how this shaver is to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuts close without razor burn, works best if hair is trimmed very short first.</li>
            <li>shall we say smooth as a babys ........................</li>
            <li>It is really easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li>Like the smooth feel this leaves</li>
            <li>For personal area shaving it does a good job, it&#x27;s better under the arm pits than the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it for my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>The Cleancut just doesn&#x27;t give a clean shave like it promises and it has even pinched my skin a couple times.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying it to clean up your nether region, which tend to be thicker...</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for one week, so far it perfect for under arms, legs, toes!</li>
            <li>super smooth, no razor burn,</li>
            <li>My micro screen shaver (Panasonic) lasted me so far more than 2 years!</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It does a good job on the carrot and the plums as well as the entire bikini area.</li>
            <li>It is portable,easy to use, no bruises, handy clear instruction</li>
            <li>It only works good if you follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>I still had red bumps, but I am fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure -</li>
            <li>I like this shaver since I can get super close and not cut myself.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, precise and smooth.</li>
            <li>I get a super close shave</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>Please keep that in mind when you&#x27;re considering whether or not it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver!  </li>
            <li>This razor does a pretty good job, it&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It has certainly exceeded all of my expectations!</li>
            <li>There is any reference anywhere to the fact that this is a dry kind of shaver.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have used this for over 2 months and still on the first battery.</li>
            <li>With practice, and 2-3 times per week maintenance on your grooming, a micro screen shaver can last 2 years or more and reduce/remove hair at a level you prefer.</li>
            <li>In terms of how well it shaves, I have to say I&#x27;ve never used a better electric personal shaver, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>since purchased the Cleancut PS335 T Shape Personal Shaver and that shaver is SO much better than the Remington one I had.  </li>
            <li>I finally figured out how to use it and the only way it does anything is after you&#x27;ve already shaved and want your skin to be smooth or if you have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first review i have ever bothered to post I like it that much.</li>
            <li>I use it to shave the hair on the back of my neck between haircuts and it works fine for this.</li>
            <li>but I decided to keep trying for a couple weeks to really give it a shot.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely NOTHING but make noise.</li>
            <li>it would be the FINAL implement you&#x27;d use in creating a smooth bikini line.  </li>
            <li>As long as the hair is pretty short to begin with it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>and it has enhanced our intimate time together.</li>
            <li>It made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>This gives a nice close shave but if your hair lays against your skin this won&#x27;t touch it, so I was left with multiple stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Gives a close as possible shave in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>cant really make it clean enough</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll come right out and say it - if you want a shaver that is designed 100% to work on your \\&quot;more delicate</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll come right out and say it - if you want a shaver that is designed 100% to work on your \\&quot;more delicate</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to check before turning it on each time to make sure the cap is still tight.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend the Cleancut to everyone.</li>
            <li>at least 20 good \\&quot;full body\\&quot; (Legs, armpits, &#x27;other&#x27; areas) shaves out of it before it needs a change of battery.  </li>
            <li>It promises baby smooth, but it never really quite gets there.  </li>
            <li>This shaver looks cheap and not very well made.  </li>
            <li>This personal shaver is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I depended on a Venus disposable for years because I could not find an electric worth having, and I simply dealt with the unavoidablenicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(my hair is course--too much work with not-good-enough results) and I&#x27;m forever done with lotions (burns and waiting and then realizing I didn&#x27;t wait long enough and doing it again to get smooth).</li>
            <li>That means it is intended to be used IN CONJUNCTION with other shaving implements as a finishing tool - not as the primary hair removal method.  </li>
            <li>Plus you will need a trimmer to get the hairs short enough to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The cap seems to work loose after repeated usages, so a quick twist for safety before each use is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a regular rechargable razor first, then finish the job with this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not fair that people are \\&quot;blaming\\&quot; the product for their own inability to read and understand the instructions that come with the product.  </li>
            <li>I consider that a negative in any \\&quot;personal shaver,\\&quot; but to me the loss of being able to use this in my shower is still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, face and most of all the bikini area especially the more difficult areas to do when using a razor.</li>
            <li>As such, it&#x27;s really not a bad idea to stop at the hardware store and get a little bit of non-skid tape to wrap around it - one strip near the top, one near the middle, one near the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the description of the product itself makes this clear - hair no longer than a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never even bothered with a razor (messy), finished with Smooth Away</li>
            <li>Only works on the shortest of stuble and really doesnt get that close of a shave .</li>
            <li>I found an all natural powder, I think the brand name is Sween, and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in a personal shaver (whether you are male or female), we absolutely recommend this one without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Minor reasons - nothing serious enough to decrease our happiness with the product</li>
            <li>, I keep the Venus in the shower for a quick surface clean-up, but use the Seiko nearly every other day for \\&quot;deep shaving.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, I keep the Venus in the shower for a quick surface clean-up, but use the Seiko nearly every other day for \\&quot;deep shaving.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Can use it for 1 hour, going in all directions, and I may get a couple small areas that are smooth, with the rest having no change.</li>
            <li>Nice not to have to deal with the bumps and itchiness usually seem with other razors.</li>
            <li>Upon finding the Cleancut, I read multiple reviews and purchased one since there was no negative feedback.</li>
            <li>Dropped it a couple times over the years &amp; dented it; purchased a new one &amp; now I use the platic cover to protect it in case of future falls.</li>
            <li>You really need to cut short enough your hairs before operating this item.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only shave I&#x27;ve ever used that did not nick or pinch me.  </li>
            <li>It has been nearly 4 years since I purchased this shaver, and I wanted to come back and update this.  </li>
            <li>Closest shave ever and not a single nick or cut.</li>
            <li>Not a significant enough decrease to warrant battery replacement right away, but it does decrease the efficiency of the shaving a bit, so it takes longer.  </li>
            <li>I only used it twice before I gave up on it, since it barely cut any hair!</li>
            <li>It uses a \\&quot;C\\&quot; battery, and within the first few uses you&#x27;ll notice a decrease in power.  </li>
            <li>My general opinion is that people should buy a different micro screen shaver that can last longer.</li>
            <li>If you have thin, fine hair...</li>

            <li> I consider that a negative in any \\&quot;personal shaver,\\&quot; but to me the loss of being able to use this in my shower is still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , face and most of all the bikini area especially the more difficult areas to do when using a razor.</li>
            <li> As such, it&#x27;s really not a bad idea to stop at the hardware store and get a little bit of non-skid tape to wrap around it - one strip near the top, one near the middle, one near the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the description of the product itself makes this clear - hair no longer than a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even bothered with a razor (messy), finished with Smooth Away</li>
            <li> Only works on the shortest of stuble and really doesnt get that close of a shave .</li>
            <li> I found an all natural powder, I think the brand name is Sween, and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> If you are interested in a personal shaver (whether you are male or female), we absolutely recommend this one without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minor reasons - nothing serious enough to decrease our happiness with the product</li>
            <li> , I keep the Venus in the shower for a quick surface clean-up, but use the Seiko nearly every other day for \\&quot;deep shaving.\\&quot;  </li>

            <li> Can use it for 1 hour, going in all directions, and I may get a couple small areas that are smooth, with the rest having no change.</li>
            <li> Nice not to have to deal with the bumps and itchiness usually seem with other razors.</li>
            <li> Upon finding the Cleancut, I read multiple reviews and purchased one since there was no negative feedback.</li>
            <li> Dropped it a couple times over the years &amp; dented it; purchased a new one &amp; now I use the platic cover to protect it in case of future falls.</li>
            <li> You really need to cut short enough your hairs before operating this item.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only shave I&#x27;ve ever used that did not nick or pinch me.  </li>
            <li> It has been nearly 4 years since I purchased this shaver, and I wanted to come back and update this.  </li>
            <li> Closest shave ever and not a single nick or cut.</li>
            <li> Not a significant enough decrease to warrant battery replacement right away, but it does decrease the efficiency of the shaving a bit, so it takes longer.  </li>
            <li> I only used it twice before I gave up on it, since it barely cut any hair!</li>
            <li> It uses a \\&quot;C\\&quot; battery, and within the first few uses you&#x27;ll notice a decrease in power.  </li>
            <li> My general opinion is that people should buy a different micro screen shaver that can last longer.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, fine hair...</li>
            <li> This device cannot last since the blades are not made to cut forever and the spinning blades cannot/will not turn fast enough to cut those small hairs efficiently.</li>
            <li> Savings are not only the blades, but also water,because one is to dry shave with baby powder.</li>
            <li> I saw a tip somewhere to use baby powder prior to use to dry the area</li>
            <li> This seems to take me 3 times as long as just shaving with a razor</li>
            <li> Seems the battery-life has lasted a long time in mine</li>
            <li> That means it is not going to tear through your half-inch long hairs.  </li>
            <li> I said, these are minor issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find on this page, you can get the EXACT same one for $8 less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut even a single hair.</li>
            <li> You would not use the buffer to file down your big toe nail - you&#x27;d use the heaviest grit surface for that.  </li>
            <li> If this device was half the price and extra blades could be bought, it may work well for someone.</li>
            <li> Seiko really is NOT the product to buy if you&#x27;re looking to shave your legs.  </li>

            <li> When you receive the product and take the top off, you&#x27;ll see why the cap possibly falling off mid-shave would be VERY VERY VERY bad.  </li>

            <li> other product.- this is waste of money</li>
            <li> and I still can see black dots.</li>
            <li> Not really a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> That means it is intended for small, delicate areas of skin that have very, very, very short hairs.  </li>
            <li> Might seem like a little bit of work, but I keep up with it</li>
            <li> Further, it takes an insane amount of time to shave and it&#x27;s not that smooth</li>
            <li> For me this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working after few weeks, and now the unit is on regardless if the switch is in the on or off</li>
            <li> Yes, you \\&quot;can\\&quot; shave your legs, if you&#x27;re prepared to be at it for a while and waste battery juice (not to mention the wear on the foil), but that is not what it is designed for.  </li>

            <li> and when i try it as instruction, won&#x27;t cut any small hair.-&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> After removing the cap to check the blades, I was incredibly disappointed to find that they were completely dull, unlike my prior Cleancut that had sharp blades that could cut skin if you weren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for years for the delicate bikini areas.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to get a close shave.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what razor other people have, but this razor I have had for a few weeks is the worst shaver I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> It cuts as closely as this type can without leaving nasty red bumps.</li>
            <li> I lost it in a recent move, and the one I just purchased to replace it is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> The switch and electrical contacts to turn it on and off is very poorly designed.</li>
            <li> You will be sorry!</li>
            <li> Perhaps this was a conscious change for safety&#x27;s sake, but I am disgusted at the horrible quality of this product - and for how expensive it is, I expect quality!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy person. I&#x27;ve never even bothered with a razor (messy), finished with Smooth Away (my hair is course--too much work with not-good-enough results) and I&#x27;m forever done with lotions (burns and waiting and then realizing I didn&#x27;t wait long enough and doing it again to get smooth). With that said, I LOVE this thing. It takes all of three minutes to get rid of stubble on my underarm and I&#x27;m good to go, smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. The manual and other reviews have suggested using powder, but in my case I don&#x27;t seem to need it at all. The Amazon link to the replacement Cleancut foil and blade is a permanent bookmark.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what razor other people have, but this razor I have had for a few weeks is the worst shaver I have ever used!  After a week of shaving every day, the stubble was half an inch long.  I went over and over spots ten times and the hair was still there. There was no smooth area, it was all rough after a shave. Terrible, cheap material and useless toy.  Do not buy!   You will be sorry!</li>
            <li> This personal shaver is worth the price. It cuts as closely as this type can without leaving nasty red bumps. It does a good job on the carrot and the plums as well as the entire bikini area. Best results if you shave every other day or even 2 days between shaves. My wife and I have used this for over 2 months and still on the first battery. Glad we tried it nothing nicer than a smooth bikini area.</li>
            <li> This shaves as close as a razor can possibly shave. Cuts close without razor burn, works best if hair is trimmed very short first. I use a regular rechargable razor first, then finish the job with this razor.Nice not to have to deal with the bumps and itchiness usually seem with other razors.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it  ,i do it for her ...shall we say smooth as a babys ........................</li>
            <li> It is portable,easy to use, no bruises, handy clear instruction n DVD, reliable n scheduled Delivery would recommend others to use this product, amazingly giving smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for years for the delicate bikini areas. Dropped it a couple times over the years &amp; dented it; purchased a new one &amp; now I use the platic cover to protect it in case of future falls.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate shaving with a razor. This seems to take me 3 times as long as just shaving with a razor but I decided to keep trying for a couple weeks to really give it a shot. I have since gone back to a razor. This gives a nice close shave but if your hair lays against your skin this won&#x27;t touch it, so I was left with multiple stray hairs. I was still getting ingrown hairs but no razor bumps. After about a month of use I ended up with the worst ingrown hair I have ever had and I stopped using it. For me this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> No nicks, cuts or gotchas.  Gives a close as possible shave in the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly live up to the hype.  It promises baby smooth, but it never really quite gets there.  The hair also has to be verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry short before it&#x27;ll work well at all, and even then takes a while to work.  But, it&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve seen or used.</li>
            <li> This shaver looks cheap and not very well made.  It gives me razor bumps.  Not really a clean shave.  Don&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The Very Best ever.  So happy I bought this product</li>
            <li> I like this shaver since I can get super close and not cut myself.  I can hear it shaving hair that I can&#x27;t even see so I know how close it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.  Seems the battery-life has lasted a long time in mine but I use mine only for super-close shaving after I have shaved,</li>
            <li> This works great for me and my wife.  It only works good if you follow the directions.  Plus you will need a trimmer to get the hairs short enough to get a smooth shave.  It tells you this in the directions.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!!!  I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only shave I&#x27;ve ever used that did not nick or pinch me.  Tips:  ALWAYS use the powder lubricant, and work VERY slowly.  You will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> This is the ES412 model.  It&#x27;s hard to find on this page, you can get the EXACT same one for $8 less on Amazon. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description that well or I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered.      Further, it takes an insane amount of time to shave and it&#x27;s not that smooth (that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs folks).  i will be going back to waxing.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this shaver.  Makes several different sounds while using and can&#x27;t tell if blades are turning.  Can use it for 1 hour, going in all directions, and I may get a couple small areas that are smooth, with the rest having no change. Have persevered every day for 1 week now, with the same result, and the only thing I have gotten from this razor is frustration.</li>
            <li> Shaver was great the video should come with an age warning thougth so kids dont pick it up!!!!&lt;br /&gt; Many thanks</li>
            <li> I use it for the neck part of the bear to fight buried bear hair. It is fast, precise and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this some years ago and it worked for awhile on the private areas. However, its performance began to deteriorate as time went by. My general opinion is that people should buy a different micro screen shaver that can last longer. This device cannot last since the blades are not made to cut forever and the spinning blades cannot/will not turn fast enough to cut those small hairs efficiently. Plus the battery is not made to perform at optimum speeds for the spinning blades. If this device was half the price and extra blades could be bought, it may work well for someone. However, for $50, no. I use a micro screen shaver for men to shave those personal areas. With practice, and 2-3 times per week maintenance on your grooming, a micro screen shaver can last 2 years or more and reduce/remove hair at a level you prefer. This shaver lasted me for several months. My micro screen shaver (Panasonic) lasted me so far more than 2 years!</li>
            <li> This is not something that you solely would use as a hair removal tool. You&#x27;ll be disappointed when you receive it. I finally figured out how to use it and the only way it does anything is after you&#x27;ve already shaved and want your skin to be smooth or if you have very fine hair. I&#x27;ve only used it once and I don&#x27;t see it working for pubic hair at all.</li>
            <li> Yikes! This does not work at all. The Cleancut just doesn&#x27;t give a clean shave like it promises and it has even pinched my skin a couple times. I only used it twice before I gave up on it, since it barely cut any hair! I was looking forward to using this, since the design seemed like it would work well but it unfortunately isn&#x27;t designed very well. Wish I didn&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Never felt compelled to write a review before. I purchased this for my bikini area. It does absolutely NOTHING but make noise. I don&#x27;t know if it is defective or not but I will try to return it.</li>
            <li> The switch and electrical contacts to turn it on and off is very poorly designed. Mine stopped working after few weeks, and now the unit is on regardless if the switch is in the on or off position.&lt;br /&gt;The way I turn it off is to loosen the battery cover base at the bottom of the shaver to break electrical contact.</li>
            <li> *****Update to Review 03/15/12:  It has been nearly 4 years since I purchased this shaver, and I wanted to come back and update this.  Our shaver is still going strong, and we are still as happy with it as we were when I first wrote this review.  I DO want to add a note regarding the reviews which say this shaver does not shave well, however.  Ladies &amp; gentlemen - this is a PERSONAL shaver.  That means it is not going to tear through your half-inch long hairs.  That means it is intended for small, delicate areas of skin that have very, very, very short hairs.  That means it is intended to be used IN CONJUNCTION with other shaving implements as a finishing tool - not as the primary hair removal method.  Even the description of the product itself makes this clear - hair no longer than a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  It&#x27;s really not fair that people are \\&quot;blaming\\&quot; the product for their own inability to read and understand the instructions that come with the product.  I&#x27;m hopeful that by updating this review, right at the top, that more people will make note of how this shaver is to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You WILL be disappointed if you purchase this shaver with the idea that it is going to replace all of your other shaving implements.  It was never designed to do that.  Think of this as the buffing surface of a 4-grit nail file.  You would not use the buffer to file down your big toe nail - you&#x27;d use the heaviest grit surface for that.  The buffer would be the finishing touch on a lovely mani/pedi - not the tool you&#x27;d use to shape the nail.  It&#x27;s the same with this shaver - it would be the FINAL implement you&#x27;d use in creating a smooth bikini line.  Please keep that in mind when you&#x27;re considering whether or not it&#x27;s worth buying. :) *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to wait to write a review on this product until we&#x27;d had the chance to use it repeatedly.  If you are interested in a personal shaver (whether you are male or female), we absolutely recommend this one without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the four stars?  Minor reasons - nothing serious enough to decrease our happiness with the product, just things purchasers might want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It is a bit of a battery hog.  It uses a \\&quot;C\\&quot; battery, and within the first few uses you&#x27;ll notice a decrease in power.  Not a significant enough decrease to warrant battery replacement right away, but it does decrease the efficiency of the shaving a bit, so it takes longer.  You&#x27;ll still get at least 20 good \\&quot;full body\\&quot; (Legs, armpits, &#x27;other&#x27; areas) shaves out of it before it needs a change of battery.  (Read below for a comment about using this to shave the legs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - The top of the unit screws on like a bottle cap.  You&#x27;ll want to check before turning it on each time to make sure the cap is still tight.  When you receive the product and take the top off, you&#x27;ll see why the cap possibly falling off mid-shave would be VERY VERY VERY bad.  The cap seems to work loose after repeated usages, so a quick twist for safety before each use is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - It is slippery.  While this actually fits very nicely in the hand, and is even ideal in size/shape for being in a sitting position while cleaning up the bikini line and such (&#x27;nuff said LOL), the metal is pretty darn slippery.  You don&#x27;t want to drop this in your commode by accident. As such, it&#x27;s really not a bad idea to stop at the hardware store and get a little bit of non-skid tape to wrap around it - one strip near the top, one near the middle, one near the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - It&#x27;s not waterproof.  I consider that a negative in any \\&quot;personal shaver,\\&quot; but to me the loss of being able to use this in my shower is still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, these are minor issues.  In terms of how well it shaves, I have to say I&#x27;ve never used a better electric personal shaver, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I depended on a Venus disposable for years because I could not find an electric worth having, and I simply dealt with the unavoidablenicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I keep the Venus in the shower for a quick surface clean-up, but use the Seiko nearly every other day for \\&quot;deep shaving.\\&quot;  It does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned above that I had something to say about shaving legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Seiko really is NOT the product to buy if you&#x27;re looking to shave your legs.  It is a personal shaver, NOT a regular shaver.  Yes, you \\&quot;can\\&quot; shave your legs, if you&#x27;re prepared to be at it for a while and waste battery juice (not to mention the wear on the foil), but that is not what it is designed for.  Armpits and smaller surface areas, it works like a gem.  If you buy this as a leg shaver, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.  Get yourself a Remington or grab a Venus - not the Seiko.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come right out and say it - if you want a shaver that is designed 100% to work on your \\&quot;more delicate areas,\\&quot; - this is the shaver to buy, for both genders.  That&#x27;s what it is for, and it does the job perfectly.nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I keep the Venus in the shower for a quick surface clean-up, but use the Seiko nearly every other day for \\&quot;deep shaving.\\&quot;  It does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned above that I had something to say about shaving legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Seiko really is NOT the product to buy if you&#x27;re looking to shave your legs.

            <li> This razor does a pretty good job, it&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for.  For personal area shaving it does a good job, it&#x27;s better under the arm pits than the bikini area.  I still had red bumps, but I am fair skinned.  As long as the hair is pretty short to begin with it does a nice job.  Just make sure you use baby powder.  It is really easy to clean.  Overall I am pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Works just as advertised; my wife and I use it almost daily and it has enhanced our intimate time together.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, fine hair... this will probably work.  If you&#x27;re buying it to clean up your nether region, which tend to be thicker...best try again.  Not nearly enough power.  I&#x27;m an &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; dude in the hair dept btw.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for one week, so far it perfect for under arms, legs, toes!, face and most of all the bikini area especially the more difficult areas to do when using a razor. I used to use the Venus Embrace razor which was the best but it does&#x27;nt compare with this. This is the first review i have ever bothered to post I like it that much. It is just so convenient.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Makes your skin smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry shaver.  You sprinkle powder on the area to be shaved down after trimming it down to 1 mm stubble.  Works well.  Doesn&#x27;t nick or cut.</li>
            <li> Only works on the shortest of stuble and really doesnt get that close of a shave . Is very safe and your wont cut yourself,</li>
            <li> I use it to shave the hair on the back of my neck between haircuts and it works fine for this.</li>
            <li> I have been using a regular razor for years on my &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; areas. With the increase in razor blade costs, I decided to surf the net and see what is out there. Upon finding the Cleancut, I read multiple reviews and purchased one since there was no negative feedback. It has certainly exceeded all of my expectations! Closest shave ever and not a single nick or cut. Savings are not only the blades, but also water,because one is to dry shave with baby powder. Since my wife and I both shave, our monthly cost for regular blades was always between $50 and $60 dollars. It is a no brainer! I HIGHLY recommend the Cleancut to everyone.</li>
            <li> great for the bikini area.  this is the second one we have bought. So we don&#x27;t have to share razors</li>
            <li> The size is great, however, it does not give a very close shave.  I will go back to my husband&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and am about to return it. There is any reference anywhere to the fact that this is a dry kind of shaver. Therefore my rate.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver!  At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it for my bikini area.  It was a little difficult to get a close shave.  I had a Remington hair trimmer that I paired with this one and I still wasn&#x27;t getting too close of a shave.  It works great for under my arms.  I get a super close shave and I no longer have razor burn!!  I love it!  I have  since purchased the Cleancut PS335 T Shape Personal Shaver and that shaver is SO much better than the Remington one I had.  I can now get my bikini area super smooth, no razor burn, no cuts, no ingrown hairs from shaving.  I will never go back to using a razor.  I saw a tip somewhere to use baby powder prior to use to dry the area and I think it helps to lift the hair away from the body.  I found an all natural powder, I think the brand name is Sween, and it works wonders.  Might seem like a little bit of work, but I keep up with it and I don&#x27;t think it takes any longer than shaving.  Especially under my arms...it&#x27;s probably quicker than shaving.  I&#x27;ll say it again, I will never go back to using a razor.  These products are amazing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Came without batterie i buy it and when i try it as instruction, won&#x27;t cut any small hair.-&lt;br /&gt;You will take 3 days to get 2 inches.-&lt;br /&gt;Find other product.- this is waste of money</li>
            <li> Does a good job at doing a fine cut finish job, but would be more helpful if the trimmer had a more pronounced description to go go with this.  Like the smooth feel this leaves but now I still have to go back for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure - I&#x27;ve owned a Cleancut before, and I LOVED it. It made my life so much easier. I lost it in a recent move, and the one I just purchased to replace it is AWFUL. It doesn&#x27;t cut even a single hair. After removing the cap to check the blades, I was incredibly disappointed to find that they were completely dull, unlike my prior Cleancut that had sharp blades that could cut skin if you weren&#x27;t careful. Perhaps this was a conscious change for safety&#x27;s sake, but I am disgusted at the horrible quality of this product - and for how expensive it is, I expect quality!</li>
            <li> not as awesome as the review wrote. cant really make it clean enough and I still can see black dots. I carelessly pressed a bit hard and then, I was hurted. You really need to cut short enough your hairs before operating this item.</li>
