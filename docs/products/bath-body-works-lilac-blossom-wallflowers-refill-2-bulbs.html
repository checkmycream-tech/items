            <li> Can&#x27;t do with out them. Such a variety of fragrances.  Anyone who comes in the door notices the pleasant welcoming subtle smell.</li>

            <li> Finally I found something that really does smell like lilacs, first off you should know I grew up going to my Grandparent&#x27;s farm  all the time and they had many lilac bushes. Ever since I was a little girl lilacs were always my favorite flower, I have had candles, bought other air fresheners which always smelled to perfumery or fake. But this is true to the scent of a lilac or at least the closest I have found it isn&#x27;t over powering which was a plus for me since I wanted it for my bedroom, it&#x27;s also a good price. It comes highly recommended from me (a huge lilac fan) hope I helped.</li>
