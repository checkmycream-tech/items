            <li>This scrub strikes the perfect balance.  </li>
            <li>not everything can be perfect!</li>
            <li>And i loved it!</li>
            <li>Neutragena didn&#x27;t skimp on them and that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and i love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I maybe would like to have a lil bit more scruby parts in this scrub, but it was really great scrub!</li>
            <li>I used to use, and loved, Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Cleanser.</li>
            <li>It may be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t always a good thing.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is it has a very light scent..</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and the smell is soft but wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love  it.</li>
            <li>being said, I LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the Neutrogena Naturals line</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this from Target and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and smells great.  </li>
            <li>but I rebuy it anyway :)</li>
            <li>I love neutrogena products, but this one did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how smooth my face feels after using this product, and I love the scent of it as well.  </li>
            <li>so far it has been a great scrub</li>
            <li>This scrub left my skin nice and soft and smooth, and it smells great too, like apples!</li>
            <li>( I sound like an ad!!!)plus you can use it every day.</li>
            <li>Great Value for a terrific product.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to see this new product, which I assumed was a reformulation or repackaging of the one I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I can use most cleansers made for normal skin with no reaction but I have suffered reactions before, specifically from Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s good but</li>
            <li>Usually \\&quot;purifying\\&quot; products are best left to oily skin, but the product description made it sound like it&#x27;d be okay for my skin, in addition to acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>A very gentle exfoliating scrub that gets your skin so clean, you can feel it.</li>
            <li>I had previously used Aveeno Active Naturals, and was very pleased, but I am impressed with how transparents and responsible Neutrogena Naturals seems that I am switching to them.  </li>
            <li>Even though my skin has been hypersensitive due to the use of accutane, this scrub has successfully and painlessly exfoliated my skin for the last six months, and I really have loved it.</li>
            <li>Before, I thought Neutrogena Clear Pore Facial Cleanser was great, but this facial cleanser is oh so much better!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover, 6-Ounces  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Biore scrub but wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li>This is a nice scrub that I&#x27;ve bought several times now.  </li>
            <li>This is a great smelling product that left my face feeling smooth and dry.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>So just do a very gentle squeeze.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this scrub, I knew I&#x27;d continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I am getting pimples more regularly.  </li>
            <li>I have been to the dermatologist, tried their products, tried proactiv, tried murad, tried clean and clear, tried Desert Essence tt oil...</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and based on the description, I was hoping this would help clear it up.</li>
            <li>It has certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it has a great scent that&#x27;s subtle and not too perfumey like other face washes can be.  </li>
            <li>and I find it very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I flipped the tube over and squeezed way too much out.</li>
            <li>It produces a gentle foam and the particles do disintegrate as I scrub my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was also a residue after rinsing really well.  </li>
            <li>LOL with acne at its worse.</li>
            <li>Great value for the 2 pack and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I used to use a fantastic gentle scrub by Dove, but it was discontinued, so I spent the better part of a year and a half looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and natural - a complete surprise for a product from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Not that it&#x27;s bad -- in a way I think the consistency is good because it&#x27;ll be easy to use</li>
            <li>Most facial soaps either leave my skin dry and flaky or don&#x27;t seem to work at all and leave it oily.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so scrubs tend to be a no-no for me.  </li>
            <li>Although I still feel that the Dove scrub I used to use was slightly better, this is leaps and bounds above all other scrubs I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a nice scent to it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It disappeared from the shelves sometime last year, and I started using another pore cleanser, which was fine but more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is fairly natural.</li>
            <li>Using it in the shower it gets rinsed off completely and is not as drying.</li>
            <li>I like this product and that it is natural.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>So far, no luck.</li>
            <li>The beads in the scrub are so small that they can easily become embedded into the eye.</li>
            <li>It scrubs my face cleaner than other facial cleansers and it has a really clean feel to it.</li>
            <li>It can cause skin to be a little dry, so be sure to use a daily moisturizer after your shower.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face red and blotchy and stinging immediately after use, and my skin never looks even and clear.  </li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to use an exfoliating wash daily.  </li>
            <li>so i went to Target and on a whim picked up the new Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore facial scrub(in a white tube)</li>
            <li>and this was a very gentle everyday scrub.</li>

            <li> and this was a very gentle everyday scrub.</li>
            <li> Both my black heads and the red in my cheeks have improved considerably since I started using this!</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be gentle as advertised but after using it I broke out in a rash all over my face, little red bumps all over with burning.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful which soaps and other beauty products I use.  </li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this scrub every other day, alternating with the Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover, which I also like.  </li>
            <li> should point out, though, that I learned long ago not to use an exfoliator every day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena sensitive skin lotion to tame the reaction but I cannot use this product again.</li>
            <li> experience of other scrubs is that they either over-exfoliate or they don&#x27;t exfoliate enough.  </li>
            <li> My use of this facial scrub has caused me to go to the eye doctor twice for eye emergencies to remove a foreign body from my eye.</li>
            <li> This scrub exfoliates and cleans without leaving my skin over dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I got this as my skin is normal to dry, although it is slightly oily on chin, jaw area, and nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it four instead of five stars because it&#x27;s from a big corporation and seems a little \\&quot;greenwashed.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Not really the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be on the creamier side with scrubbing particles, but it&#x27;s sort of a translucent gel and is a bit runny.</li>
            <li> When we were at WDW this past Oct. I forgot to pack my facial cleanser...</li>
            <li> and I think I will continue to purchased this item and other items of Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when using this product.  </li>
            <li> It smells okay in the bottle, but the smell changes while you&#x27;re using it, and develops into this horrible, cloying, old lady smell that stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> consistency is a little bit weird and caught me off guard the first time I used.</li>
            <li> The redness calmed down too after using the olay face wash.  </li>
            <li> Usually in the winter my cheeks get dry and flaky but not with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I hate strong smelling products due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I waited a little while to see if it would go away, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> the people who gave bad reviews have an allergy to one of its all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I was so shocked and not only does it work</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve thrown this scrub away.</li>

            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin and this was a very gentle everyday scrub. It can cause skin to be a little dry, so be sure to use a daily moisturizer after your shower. This cleanser has a nice scent to it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so scrubs tend to be a no-no for me.  I used to use a fantastic gentle scrub by Dove, but it was discontinued, so I spent the better part of a year and a half looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience of other scrubs is that they either over-exfoliate or they don&#x27;t exfoliate enough.  This scrub strikes the perfect balance.  On top of that, it has a great scent that&#x27;s subtle and not too perfumey like other face washes can be.  The first time I tried this scrub, I knew I&#x27;d continue to use it.  Although I still feel that the Dove scrub I used to use was slightly better, this is leaps and bounds above all other scrubs I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should point out, though, that I learned long ago not to use an exfoliator every day.  My skin is too sensitive to use an exfoliating wash daily.  And my skin is also oily, which can be exacerbated by over-scrubbing/over-exfoliating.  I learned that the hard way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this scrub every other day, alternating with the Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover, which I also like.

            <li> i have combo acne prone skin and i love this stuff!! it&#x27;s very gentle. and the smell is soft but wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used this scrub every night before i went to bed. And i loved it! This scrub left my skin nice and soft and smooth, and it smells great too, like apples! I maybe would like to have a lil bit more scruby parts in this scrub, but it was really great scrub!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife from Target.  She loves it.  Sounds like the people who gave bad reviews have an allergy to one of its all natural ingredients.  Not really the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> A very gentle exfoliating scrub that gets your skin so clean, you can feel it. ( I sound like an ad!!!)plus you can use it every day. Great value for the 2 pack and a little goes a long way. Great Value for a terrific product.</li>

            <li> Even though my skin has been hypersensitive due to the use of accutane, this scrub has successfully and painlessly exfoliated my skin for the last six months, and I really have loved it. I like that it is fairly natural. It has certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> Before, I thought Neutrogena Clear Pore Facial Cleanser was great, but this facial cleanser is oh so much better! I love  it. It scrubs my face cleaner than other facial cleansers and it has a really clean feel to it. The fragrance is also a plus factor.  The fact that it is cheaper on amazon than when you buy it at Ulta or CVS is also a plus. I bought two and saved $3.00 as compared to when I bought it from CVS. I recommend that you buy this product on amazon because it is cheaper here and no taxes are added.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I got this as my skin is normal to dry, although it is slightly oily on chin, jaw area, and nose. Usually \\&quot;purifying\\&quot; products are best left to oily skin, but the product description made it sound like it&#x27;d be okay for my skin, in addition to acne prone skin. Wrong. I do use it about twice a week, but only in the shower, and only in those areas I mentioned above. Using it in the shower it gets rinsed off completely and is not as drying. If I use it at the sink, my skin is left with some residue and I find it very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I LOVE the scent. It&#x27;s so fresh and natural - a complete surprise for a product from Neutrogena. It smells a bit like apples to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a little bit weird and caught me off guard the first time I used. I expected it to be on the creamier side with scrubbing particles, but it&#x27;s sort of a translucent gel and is a bit runny. I flipped the tube over and squeezed way too much out. So just do a very gentle squeeze. Not that it&#x27;s bad -- in a way I think the consistency is good because it&#x27;ll be easy to use once I get to the bottom of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it has a ton of scrubbing particles. Neutragena didn&#x27;t skimp on them and that&#x27;s great.It produces a gentle foam and the particles do disintegrate as I scrub my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my second tube to my teenage son and he loves it. His skin can handle the drying nature of this scrub. Overall I think it&#x27;s good but buyer beware -- if you don&#x27;t have oily skin, skip it.</li>
            <li> I used to use, and loved, Neutrogena&#x27;s Pore Refining Cleanser. It disappeared from the shelves sometime last year, and I started using another pore cleanser, which was fine but more expensive.  So I was thrilled to see this new product, which I assumed was a reformulation or repackaging of the one I used to use.  It has been a DISASTER for my skin.  It leaves my face red and blotchy and stinging immediately after use, and my skin never looks even and clear.  I am getting pimples more regularly.  After using it for 2 weeks I am throwing it away.</li>
            <li> was it discontinued or did you just take the plastic beads out because the  fish were eating it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if so is on the market again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks karen</li>
            <li> Contains Jojoba. For those of us who have a sensitivity to lanolin, jojoba is also a problem. It may be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t always a good thing.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I are quite obsessed with scrubs, I must admit :)  This is a great smelling product that left my face feeling smooth and dry.   I definitely recommend using this only periodically and using a moisturizer afterwards.  I am really pleased with the Neutrogena Naturals line and I hope they eventually make moisturizers as well.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this from Target and fell in love with it. I&#x27;ve been using a Biore scrub but wanted something more natural. When I found it on Amazon, in a two pack for what I paid for just one at Target, I was stoked. I have it on auto delivery so I never run out.</li>
            <li> I have acne that turned cystic and I have been battling it for over 10 years! I have been to the dermatologist, tried their products, tried proactiv, tried murad, tried clean and clear, tried Desert Essence tt oil...none have worked. When we were at WDW this past Oct. I forgot to pack my facial cleanser...so i went to Target and on a whim picked up the new Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore facial scrub(in a white tube) and it has cleared up my skin like nothing else could! I was so shocked and not only does it work but I don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer!!! Usually in the winter my cheeks get dry and flaky but not with this stuff. Another great thing is it has a very light scent..I hate strong smelling products due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I like this product and that it is natural. It leaves my skin so soft after I use it. I have been using it in the morning for a couple weeks now, and I like it, but I haven&#x27;t seen any visible improvement in my skin. I have mild acne and based on the description, I was hoping this would help clear it up. So far, no luck. If that changes by the end of the bottle, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scrub that I&#x27;ve bought several times now.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and smells great.  I&#x27;ve given it four instead of five stars because it&#x27;s from a big corporation and seems a little \\&quot;greenwashed.\\&quot;  but I rebuy it anyway :)</li>
            <li> I love neutrogena products, but this one did nothing for me.  I have acne scars on my face and this just irritated them and made my face red and blotchy.  I waited a little while to see if it would go away, but it didn&#x27;t.  There was also a residue after rinsing really well.  I did not like that feeling.  So I washed my face again with an olay wash and the residue was gone-  The redness calmed down too after using the olay face wash.  I wanted to like this, but it didn&#x27;t.  I still use othet neutrogena products-  not everything can be perfect!</li>
            <li> At age 50 all of a sudden I was blessed...LOL with acne at its worse. Never had any acne in my younger years and have been trying all types of products try to heal and for maintenance. I am so devastated having acne at my age cause I just do not have the prior experience of having it....God has a sense of humor...LOL&lt;br /&gt;But so far it has been a great scrub and I think I will continue to purchased this item and other items of Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product twice.  After the second time a bead got in her eye.  Her eye is swollen, red and sore.  We&#x27;ll be going to the dye doctor tomorrow to have it looked at.  Be very careful when using this product.  I suggest taking it back and buying something with out pore scrub.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how smooth my face feels after using this product, and I love the scent of it as well.  I had previously used Aveeno Active Naturals, and was very pleased, but I am impressed with how transparents and responsible Neutrogena Naturals seems that I am switching to them.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful which soaps and other beauty products I use.  Most facial soaps either leave my skin dry and flaky or don&#x27;t seem to work at all and leave it oily.  This scrub exfoliates and cleans without leaving my skin over dry.  Both my black heads and the red in my cheeks have improved considerably since I started using this!</li>
            <li> My use of this facial scrub has caused me to go to the eye doctor twice for eye emergencies to remove a foreign body from my eye. The beads in the scrub are so small that they can easily become embedded into the eye. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve thrown this scrub away.</li>
