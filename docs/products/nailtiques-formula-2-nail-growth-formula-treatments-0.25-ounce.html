            <li>One time I asked her how she got her nails to look so amazing</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I do not go to nail salons, I do my own nails.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product before and liked the product.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best nail formula!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice sheen</li>
            <li>I honestly must recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s loving it.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product; I really like it.</li>
            <li>My nails grow just fine on their own, but began to break very easily after my youngest was born.</li>
            <li>The good news is it works...saw an elderly friend of mine with great nails, and she told me she used this religiously and didn&#x27;t used to have nice nails, so she was a testament to its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>this helps also to build strong nails! :)</li>
            <li>Nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>now after a month most of my nails have stopped splitting.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my nails looked a lot better --</li>
            <li>Then I apply two coats of my favorite \\&quot;Orly\\&quot; nail polish.</li>
            <li>This product strengthens my nails better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>I went to the nailtiques website and purchased more formula 2, formula 1, avocado foot cream, and polish remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products that claim to repair and grow problem nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more soon for myself and family.</li>
            <li>Awesome choice,  my nails are finally hardening and growing after many years of acrylic and shellac.</li>
            <li>My future mother in law has the most beautiful nails I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li>so I want to look my best and finally decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Must moisturize 2-3 times a day to keep nails &amp; cuticles healthy.</li>
            <li>About 8 months ago, I peeled all my gel nail polish off, taking my top layer of nail with it.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have not been able to grow my nails at all.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my manicurist which wasn&#x27;t even too sure it would work.</li>
            <li>so i know now to order the more stronger formula</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Saved my nails after too many gel nails.  </li>
            <li>It also helped strengthen my nails so the shape of the nails even looks better.  </li>
            <li>Now I have more to check when buying on-line.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably why they make more than one formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use this one formula, always, using it once a week after the two week induction phase.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t any better than Sally Hansen, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this.</li>
            <li>One review writer mentioned the bottle brush separating from the top - just reclose bottle until it catches on and start over.</li>
            <li>Helped my nails to look healthier and fell better.</li>
            <li>Love it when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail strengthener.</li>
            <li>After many years of never having nails, a friend of mine recommended this product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>So, I was actually able to try this product for myself.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t notice it to work any better for me in that time than Nail Envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you ask my mother she&#x27;ll say that this product is actually better than OPI.</li>
            <li>straight lol.</li>
            <li>, be sure to file/cut/buff any cracks or splits that are already in your nails.</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I found such an effective product!!!  </li>
            <li>and I get SOOOO many compliments on my beautiful NATURAL nails</li>
            <li>But this polish allows me to grow beautiful nails - and wear just clear polish all by itself.  </li>
            <li>I finally tried Naitiques 2 and this product is truly amazing!!</li>
            <li>And promote healthy strong nails.</li>
            <li>After using nailtiques for about a month I have strong, healthy, and durable nails.</li>
            <li>My nails have always peeled, been weak/thin and brake/chip easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m active, athletic, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have nails that split, peel and break easily because of medication I have been on for years.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t break so easily</li>
            <li>In fact, it seems to wear off and chip rather easily.</li>
            <li>Has made my nails so strong</li>
            <li>My nails have never been this strong.</li>
            <li>even before my nails got ruined they were not this strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works but even when I take the polish off, my nails are strong.</li>
            <li>My nails are staying strong and I keep them at a medium length.</li>
            <li>This product keeps them strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the use of Nailtiques for anyone with brittle or peeling nails.</li>
            <li>helped my nails to grow out strong......</li>
            <li>never ever been strong.  </li>
            <li>They were recommended to me by a friend for whom they also worked fine</li>
            <li>my nails are long, strong and beautiful and now I apply this product maybe once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>and there is a HUGE difference already in the strength of my nails</li>
            <li>and I liked the product so much I&#x27;ve continued to use it.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the soak off UV gel polish (Shellac, Gelish)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this great &#x27;bring back my nails&#x27; - product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to remember to use the product over time.  </li>
            <li>My nails are now so long after a month that I am wearing nail polish and they look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>did, i would absolutely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will have great natural nails for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>An excellent product I have used for years whenever my nails start becoming thin or cracking, this product builds them up and protects them until they are strong again.</li>
            <li>My weekly regimen is as follows; one coat of \\&quot;nailtiques\\&quot; on clean nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this procuct with great success for several years.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions with clean nails (swab with alcohol to clean well), added one coat per day for 4-5 days, removed and repeated.</li>
            <li>When used according to the directions, my own nails were able to grow out without constantly being snagged on everything I touched.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many products and this is the first one I have found that really works.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change right away, but because my individual nails had split so many times it took almost a year, but the splits are ALL GONE !!   </li>
            <li>I received this product in a very timely manner, well packaged, and was very pleased with this transaction as a whole.  </li>
            <li>I eat a healthy diet and take reasonable supplements</li>
            <li>Here are two tips to help you get the most out of Nailtiques and to help your nails really grow:    </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re her own natural nails.</li>
            <li>My nails were so strong and in  starting to grow that I bought my own bottle.  </li>
            <li>Then my nail tips are strong and ready for another couple months of chip-free gel polish manicures!</li>
            <li>My nail are strong and pretty and stay that way.</li>
            <li>If you have ANY kind of damage, or just like the look of a healthy natural nail, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly and dramatically my nails improved and</li>
            <li>I gave it to her, since she already was a loyal user and in her nineties by that time.</li>
            <li>Super nail product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many high priced nail hardeners but nothing ever worked</li>
            <li>It also is a clear polish that makes them look very nice and natural.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to be logical when using any type of beauty product.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, dries fast, and keeps my nails from peeling and cracking.</li>
            <li>This is the best nail polish for weak nails.</li>
            <li>For a strong top finish that protects both your nails and lets the nail polish last longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I can get nailtiques from amazon because it is not available in the stores where I used to get the product.  </li>
            <li>it sort of \\&quot;wears off\\&quot; or gets absorbed, so you never have to remove it -- just reapply.</li>
            <li>Worth any price.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this polish for years because my nails tend to be brittle and break if left on their own.  </li>
            <li>Seriously worth the price.</li>
            <li>they were thin, would bend and that was after months of trying to keep them in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled that I applied my second coat.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, and has a nice natural shine to it.</li>
            <li>Item arrived earlier than expected so the delivery is excellent.</li>
            <li>so I took it off right away with polish remover</li>
            <li>My nails are strong again, growing, and the product leaves a nice little shine.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and I highly recommend the smaller .25 ounce bottle so that the formula stays fresh and gilds best, since larger bottles sometimes get sticky towards the end</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear polish, and the looks of wearing this alone looked great --</li>
            <li>and I actually have strong fingernails!</li>
            <li>I cut my nails short and started my first application of Formula 2 Plus, using it only 9/10 days and saw a great improvement.</li>
            <li>Luckilly this formula dries super quick and doesn&#x27;t stay all gummy and sticky like other polishes do, so make sure you follow the directions: paint one coat on the first day, and continue to paint on one layer each day thereafter.   </li>
            <li>Before use of nailtiques, I could not make my own bed without being extremely careful not to let my nails touch the sheets as I pulled to tuck them...</li>
            <li>I first bought this product from my manicurist, just to be polite.</li>
            <li>, people are always asking if they are real!</li>
            <li>For the first week, you need to apply a coat EVERY day.  </li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m getting married in December</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>It made a real difference!</li>
            <li>I started noticing improvement since the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend nailtiques formula 2!!</li>
            <li>Agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY DIFFERENT remedies...</li>
            <li>My manicurist gave me my first 2+ bottle, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>My sister bought me my first bottle 1 1/2 years ago and this is all I use now.  </li>
            <li>Follow directions and make sure it&#x27;s mixed well before applying.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four star as they are looking better again, but it has not been long enough to see if they get healthy again.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Formula 2 PLUS first, then Formula 2 large size -</li>
            <li>My nails were super soft and brittle after having my baby and this really worked!</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I was so hopeful.</li>
            <li>I used it for about a month and my nails are so amazingly healthy and long.</li>
            <li>small bottle, good price</li>
            <li>They are strong, long and healthy and finally back to how they should be.</li>
            <li>The small bottle is perfect for slipping into your purse.</li>
            <li>My nails look almost like a French manicure - that&#x27;s how strong they are.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>i have only been using this every day for two weeks and my finger nails are as strong as my toe nails.</li>
            <li>It is pure junk.  </li>
            <li>My fingernails used to grow out to a certain length, then would crack at the corners where the nail meets the finger tip.</li>
            <li>My nails were paper thin when I started to use this, I applied it every morning for the first two weeks, now I&#x27;m actually wearing polish and my nails looks great!</li>
            <li>But as soon as I tried this product, I saw a huge difference the next morning when I woke up.</li>
            <li>It has proven to be a real lifesaver.  </li>
            <li>The effects of this stuff blew me away -- it really, really, really, really works.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>As soon as the damaged nail grew out is when I could really tell the difference</li>
            <li>Has not done much for growth and has not harden nail at all</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of drug store snake oil, this product really delivers.</li>
            <li>You really can believe all the reviews of formula 2.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I can&#x27;t really explain is that they are growing much slower than they used to.</li>
            <li>My nails have always grown fast and there is a very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I definitely expected more from this product than it delivered...</li>
            <li>Her nails are now longer than most acrylic tips and HARDER.</li>
            <li>and I have not broken or split one yet.  </li>
            <li>Some have helped, but none have really worked until a friend recommended Nailtiques 2.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Great for thin, flimsy nails and those that bite them.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>people this has formaldehyde in it so much that i had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li>Could it really be working?  </li>
            <li>I have very week nails that break and split all the time.</li>
            <li>As an extra bonus, the product makes the nail tips turn bright white instead of their natural yellowish tone.  </li>
            <li>I really like the nailtiques products and find that they are as advertised.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t know it contained formaldehyde until after I received it, which I really don&#x27;t want on any part of my body.  </li>
            <li>I started using it when I was trying to stop biting my nails, and it really helped.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to now, and she has CLAWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had  thin splitting/ peeling nails for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Although it seemed to do well and as it was advertised on one hand, the other, which had the more thinner and brittle nails is taking much longer for improvment (much longer than 2</li>
            <li>and I pick my nails a lot but started using this product and my nails are long and strong.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, my usually strong, long nails have been going through a period of chipping and peeling, so I fell for the Nailtique hype.    </li>
            <li>Now my nails are long and strong.</li>
            <li>My nails are now long and strong.</li>
            <li>I have always had long, strong, well manicured fingernails -</li>
            <li>My nails are very strong and if they break it&#x27;s just a little bit.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the super-star product that so many other people seem to think it is.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly long, strong, and healthy, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to believe they are really my nails!!  </li>
            <li>Absolute Rubbish,do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>I tried many \\&quot;nail hardener\\&quot; products with no success.  </li>
            <li>She wrote down the name for me, and I held onto the paper for over a year before I was able to find it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that while the directions in both brands now state that you can apply over nail color after initial application, I would strongly recommend that you stayaway from nail color for two weeks when you&#x27;re first starting out.</li>
            <li>OK, OK, I tried them all from the drugstores and was skeptical about this one too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m active and rough on my hands and this product has really helped to keep them in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I did not follow any particular instructions.</li>
            <li>As I am getting older (63)</li>
            <li>and if I were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off.  </li>
            <li>within a few weeks my nails were strong and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for well over 10 years and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it for nail growth and strength.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for any one who has troubles with breaking nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>When I was out of my Nail Envy a little while ago my mother actually gifted me a bottle of her Nailtiques.</li>
            <li>But I do notice, as soon as remove the nail polish after a day one of my nails break or get real soft.</li>
            <li>I work in a hospital as a nurses aide, and where my job requires to wash my hands over 50 times a day, it really dries my hands and nails out, causing my nails to be soft and brittle and crack.</li>
            <li>It really works to harden your brittle or soft nails and allows them to grow.</li>
            <li>Great after removing fake nails.</li>
            <li>but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>Keep your nails nicely filed, so if you do chip a nail avoid further damage from snags by filing down the chipped areas.</li>
            <li>after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over.  </li>
            <li>My biggest problem prior to trying nailtiques was my nails peeling off from the sides, right</li>
            <li>I have a vertical split on my right thumb that is slowly improving, but all the other nails are in good shape.</li>
            <li>and I got a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, which I found by chance, I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Too much protein can actually harden nails too much, to the point where they break.</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed a difference in the strength of my nails, which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>(they are so thick &amp; STRONG I can&#x27;t really bite them anyway!)    </li>
            <li>My sister first used this last year and her nails used to be brittle from her biting them and never grew.</li>
            <li>After years of breaks, splits, peels and such, i have real fingernails again!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>it wouldnt help when i was constantly running hot water over my hands.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it as clear nail polish, or so I thought.</li>
            <li>I will use naitiques for as long as they continue to provide a quality product that does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>, I ride horses, garden, and I&#x27;m a professional puppeteer performer</li>
            <li>how well they stand up to my very hands-on daily activities.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had nail tips for years &amp; wanted to go natural</li>
            <li>So far, it is working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had soft nails all my life until I tried formula 2.</li>
            <li>but nothing has helped  until I discovered nailtiques completely by accident.  </li>
            <li>it peel off in nearly 12 years of use.</li>
            <li>I had really soft brittle nails that would tear often.  </li>
            <li>This product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>Its the only thing that really changed my nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are soft AND brittle without using Nailtiques.   </li>
            <li>In a short time this product has really strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time she&#x27;s had long nails in 3 decades</li>
            <li>I can no longer find Nailtiques to purchase in my area and was thrilled to find it on the internet because my nails had become thin again.  </li>
            <li>when they would grow a little bit I would get a split in the side and it would just peel the whole nail end right off.  </li>
            <li>First time I have had long nails!  </li>
            <li>(they get long FAST); I just use this everyday and they are long again in NO time - and very strong.</li>
            <li>After that, you should apply a coat EVERY OTHER day until the polish begins to peel off, in which case you take off all the polish and apply a fresh coat.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it actually works because i didn&#x27;t use it more then twice to find out.</li>
            <li>First know that these products come in pretty small bottles.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, and I suggest clipping your nails short</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for others with similar nail problems.</li>
            <li>Right now I have all ten long finger nails.</li>
            <li>I began using this a week ago, and I already see a major improvement to my nails!</li>
            <li>I used to have naturally strong nails, until I got a job where I&#x27;m constantly having my hands in water and harsh santitizer with no option of gloves.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all thick and strong and look professionally</li>
            <li>and my nails are hard and strong.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will buy it in the larger bottle to keep it from drying out so fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other polishes and I am consistent.</li>
            <li>After about six weeks nails had grown out most of the weak or damaged nails; then used two coats once a week with color polish.</li>
            <li>I used for about 2 months and my nails were getting better, but still weak and peeling.</li>
            <li>I began to see significant improvement within just a few weeks of daily application.  </li>
            <li>At first to repair the damage artificial nails caused and now just because the polish stays on and my nails look so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use Nailtiques even when my nails are completely grown back just because it protects them.</li>
            <li>I commented on the lovely nails of my sister&#x27;s sister-in-law, and she told me her nails had been quite thin and brittle until she tried a product called Nailtique.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, the best way to use it is daily application over the last one, then after 2 weeks, it becomes my base coat for polish once a week.</li>
            <li>nails were difficult to grow; now have nice nails all of the time.  </li>
            <li>Underneath the acrylic nail, however, my own nails were very thin, brittle and splitting.  </li>
            <li>I have never used any other nail growth treatment that does as much for my nails as Nailtiques Formula 2.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate where my nails split.</li>
            <li>Perfect to repair damaged nails (say from wearing fake nails for a while) and strengthening thin nails.</li>
            <li>My nails became weak, brittle, and broke easily prompting me to use acrylics for a month which made them worse!&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the size of the bottle is smaller and price was higher so getting a lot less for my money.  </li>
            <li>I just keep the thin coat on and wear my nail short and they look very clean.</li>
            <li>Now I have been using Nailtiques consistently for a few months</li>
            <li>nails are just entirely too long now, but she won&#x27;t file them down as she&#x27;s having fun.</li>
            <li>I bought Nailtiques Formula 2 first because my nails are bad but they&#x27;re not horrible.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have only had decent nails a few times in my life.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it to anyone who has thin, splitting nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had thin peeling nails and since using this they&#x27;ve become strong and grow faster.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in my weak, brittle, splitting nails.  </li>
            <li>After using only half the bottle I am growing real fingernails again.  </li>

            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I do not go to nail salons, I do my own nails.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and liked the product.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best nail formula!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice sheen</li>
            <li> I honestly must recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s loving it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product; I really like it.</li>
            <li> My nails grow just fine on their own, but began to break very easily after my youngest was born.</li>
            <li> The good news is it works...saw an elderly friend of mine with great nails, and she told me she used this religiously and didn&#x27;t used to have nice nails, so she was a testament to its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> this helps also to build strong nails! :)</li>
            <li> Nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> now after a month most of my nails have stopped splitting.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my nails looked a lot better --</li>
            <li> Then I apply two coats of my favorite \\&quot;Orly\\&quot; nail polish.</li>
            <li> This product strengthens my nails better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> I went to the nailtiques website and purchased more formula 2, formula 1, avocado foot cream, and polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products that claim to repair and grow problem nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more soon for myself and family.</li>
            <li> Awesome choice,  my nails are finally hardening and growing after many years of acrylic and shellac.</li>
            <li> My future mother in law has the most beautiful nails I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> so I want to look my best and finally decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Must moisturize 2-3 times a day to keep nails &amp; cuticles healthy.</li>
            <li> About 8 months ago, I peeled all my gel nail polish off, taking my top layer of nail with it.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have not been able to grow my nails at all.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my manicurist which wasn&#x27;t even too sure it would work.</li>
            <li> so i know now to order the more stronger formula</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Saved my nails after too many gel nails.  </li>
            <li> It also helped strengthen my nails so the shape of the nails even looks better.  </li>
            <li> Now I have more to check when buying on-line.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably why they make more than one formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use this one formula, always, using it once a week after the two week induction phase.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t any better than Sally Hansen, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> One review writer mentioned the bottle brush separating from the top - just reclose bottle until it catches on and start over.</li>
            <li> Helped my nails to look healthier and fell better.</li>
            <li> Love it when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> After many years of never having nails, a friend of mine recommended this product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> So, I was actually able to try this product for myself.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t notice it to work any better for me in that time than Nail Envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you ask my mother she&#x27;ll say that this product is actually better than OPI.</li>
            <li> straight lol.</li>
            <li> , be sure to file/cut/buff any cracks or splits that are already in your nails.</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I found such an effective product!!!  </li>
            <li> and I get SOOOO many compliments on my beautiful NATURAL nails</li>
            <li> But this polish allows me to grow beautiful nails - and wear just clear polish all by itself.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried Naitiques 2 and this product is truly amazing!!</li>
            <li> And promote healthy strong nails.</li>
            <li> After using nailtiques for about a month I have strong, healthy, and durable nails.</li>
            <li> My nails have always peeled, been weak/thin and brake/chip easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m active, athletic, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have nails that split, peel and break easily because of medication I have been on for years.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t break so easily</li>
            <li> In fact, it seems to wear off and chip rather easily.</li>
            <li> Has made my nails so strong</li>
            <li> My nails have never been this strong.</li>
            <li> even before my nails got ruined they were not this strong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works but even when I take the polish off, my nails are strong.</li>
            <li> My nails are staying strong and I keep them at a medium length.</li>
            <li> This product keeps them strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the use of Nailtiques for anyone with brittle or peeling nails.</li>
            <li> helped my nails to grow out strong......</li>
            <li> never ever been strong.  </li>
            <li> They were recommended to me by a friend for whom they also worked fine</li>
            <li> my nails are long, strong and beautiful and now I apply this product maybe once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> and there is a HUGE difference already in the strength of my nails</li>
            <li> and I liked the product so much I&#x27;ve continued to use it.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the soak off UV gel polish (Shellac, Gelish)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this great &#x27;bring back my nails&#x27; - product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to remember to use the product over time.  </li>
            <li> My nails are now so long after a month that I am wearing nail polish and they look beautiful.  </li>
            <li> did, i would absolutely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will have great natural nails for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> An excellent product I have used for years whenever my nails start becoming thin or cracking, this product builds them up and protects them until they are strong again.</li>
            <li> My weekly regimen is as follows; one coat of \\&quot;nailtiques\\&quot; on clean nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this procuct with great success for several years.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions with clean nails (swab with alcohol to clean well), added one coat per day for 4-5 days, removed and repeated.</li>
            <li> When used according to the directions, my own nails were able to grow out without constantly being snagged on everything I touched.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products and this is the first one I have found that really works.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change right away, but because my individual nails had split so many times it took almost a year, but the splits are ALL GONE !!   </li>
            <li> I received this product in a very timely manner, well packaged, and was very pleased with this transaction as a whole.  </li>
            <li> I eat a healthy diet and take reasonable supplements</li>
            <li> Here are two tips to help you get the most out of Nailtiques and to help your nails really grow:    </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re her own natural nails.</li>
            <li> My nails were so strong and in  starting to grow that I bought my own bottle.  </li>
            <li> Then my nail tips are strong and ready for another couple months of chip-free gel polish manicures!</li>
            <li> My nail are strong and pretty and stay that way.</li>
            <li> If you have ANY kind of damage, or just like the look of a healthy natural nail, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly and dramatically my nails improved and</li>
            <li> I gave it to her, since she already was a loyal user and in her nineties by that time.</li>
            <li> Super nail product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many high priced nail hardeners but nothing ever worked</li>
            <li> It also is a clear polish that makes them look very nice and natural.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to be logical when using any type of beauty product.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, dries fast, and keeps my nails from peeling and cracking.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish for weak nails.</li>
            <li> For a strong top finish that protects both your nails and lets the nail polish last longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I can get nailtiques from amazon because it is not available in the stores where I used to get the product.  </li>
            <li> it sort of \\&quot;wears off\\&quot; or gets absorbed, so you never have to remove it -- just reapply.</li>
            <li> Worth any price.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this polish for years because my nails tend to be brittle and break if left on their own.  </li>
            <li> Seriously worth the price.</li>
            <li> they were thin, would bend and that was after months of trying to keep them in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled that I applied my second coat.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, and has a nice natural shine to it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than expected so the delivery is excellent.</li>
            <li> so I took it off right away with polish remover</li>
            <li> My nails are strong again, growing, and the product leaves a nice little shine.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and I highly recommend the smaller .25 ounce bottle so that the formula stays fresh and gilds best, since larger bottles sometimes get sticky towards the end</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear polish, and the looks of wearing this alone looked great --</li>
            <li> and I actually have strong fingernails!</li>
            <li> I cut my nails short and started my first application of Formula 2 Plus, using it only 9/10 days and saw a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Luckilly this formula dries super quick and doesn&#x27;t stay all gummy and sticky like other polishes do, so make sure you follow the directions: paint one coat on the first day, and continue to paint on one layer each day thereafter.   </li>
            <li> Before use of nailtiques, I could not make my own bed without being extremely careful not to let my nails touch the sheets as I pulled to tuck them...</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from my manicurist, just to be polite.</li>
            <li> , people are always asking if they are real!</li>
            <li> For the first week, you need to apply a coat EVERY day.  </li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m getting married in December</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> It made a real difference!</li>
            <li> I started noticing improvement since the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend nailtiques formula 2!!</li>
            <li> Agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY DIFFERENT remedies...</li>
            <li> My manicurist gave me my first 2+ bottle, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> My sister bought me my first bottle 1 1/2 years ago and this is all I use now.  </li>
            <li> Follow directions and make sure it&#x27;s mixed well before applying.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star as they are looking better again, but it has not been long enough to see if they get healthy again.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Formula 2 PLUS first, then Formula 2 large size -</li>
            <li> My nails were super soft and brittle after having my baby and this really worked!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I was so hopeful.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and my nails are so amazingly healthy and long.</li>
            <li> small bottle, good price</li>
            <li> They are strong, long and healthy and finally back to how they should be.</li>
            <li> The small bottle is perfect for slipping into your purse.</li>
            <li> My nails look almost like a French manicure - that&#x27;s how strong they are.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> i have only been using this every day for two weeks and my finger nails are as strong as my toe nails.</li>
            <li> It is pure junk.  </li>
            <li> My fingernails used to grow out to a certain length, then would crack at the corners where the nail meets the finger tip.</li>
            <li> My nails were paper thin when I started to use this, I applied it every morning for the first two weeks, now I&#x27;m actually wearing polish and my nails looks great!</li>
            <li> But as soon as I tried this product, I saw a huge difference the next morning when I woke up.</li>
            <li> It has proven to be a real lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> The effects of this stuff blew me away -- it really, really, really, really works.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> As soon as the damaged nail grew out is when I could really tell the difference</li>
            <li> Has not done much for growth and has not harden nail at all</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of drug store snake oil, this product really delivers.</li>
            <li> You really can believe all the reviews of formula 2.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I can&#x27;t really explain is that they are growing much slower than they used to.</li>
            <li> My nails have always grown fast and there is a very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I definitely expected more from this product than it delivered...</li>
            <li> Her nails are now longer than most acrylic tips and HARDER.</li>
            <li> and I have not broken or split one yet.  </li>
            <li> Some have helped, but none have really worked until a friend recommended Nailtiques 2.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Great for thin, flimsy nails and those that bite them.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> people this has formaldehyde in it so much that i had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Could it really be working?  </li>
            <li> I have very week nails that break and split all the time.</li>
            <li> As an extra bonus, the product makes the nail tips turn bright white instead of their natural yellowish tone.  </li>
            <li> I really like the nailtiques products and find that they are as advertised.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t know it contained formaldehyde until after I received it, which I really don&#x27;t want on any part of my body.  </li>
            <li> I started using it when I was trying to stop biting my nails, and it really helped.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to now, and she has CLAWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had  thin splitting/ peeling nails for many many years.  </li>
            <li> Although it seemed to do well and as it was advertised on one hand, the other, which had the more thinner and brittle nails is taking much longer for improvment (much longer than 2</li>
            <li> and I pick my nails a lot but started using this product and my nails are long and strong.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, my usually strong, long nails have been going through a period of chipping and peeling, so I fell for the Nailtique hype.    </li>
            <li> Now my nails are long and strong.</li>
            <li> My nails are now long and strong.</li>
            <li> I have always had long, strong, well manicured fingernails -</li>
            <li> My nails are very strong and if they break it&#x27;s just a little bit.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the super-star product that so many other people seem to think it is.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly long, strong, and healthy, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to believe they are really my nails!!  </li>
            <li> Absolute Rubbish,do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I tried many \\&quot;nail hardener\\&quot; products with no success.  </li>
            <li> She wrote down the name for me, and I held onto the paper for over a year before I was able to find it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that while the directions in both brands now state that you can apply over nail color after initial application, I would strongly recommend that you stayaway from nail color for two weeks when you&#x27;re first starting out.</li>
            <li> OK, OK, I tried them all from the drugstores and was skeptical about this one too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m active and rough on my hands and this product has really helped to keep them in good condition.  </li>
            <li> I did not follow any particular instructions.</li>
            <li> As I am getting older (63)</li>
            <li> and if I were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off.  </li>
            <li> within a few weeks my nails were strong and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over 10 years and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it for nail growth and strength.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for any one who has troubles with breaking nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I was out of my Nail Envy a little while ago my mother actually gifted me a bottle of her Nailtiques.</li>
            <li> But I do notice, as soon as remove the nail polish after a day one of my nails break or get real soft.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital as a nurses aide, and where my job requires to wash my hands over 50 times a day, it really dries my hands and nails out, causing my nails to be soft and brittle and crack.</li>
            <li> It really works to harden your brittle or soft nails and allows them to grow.</li>
            <li> Great after removing fake nails.</li>
            <li> but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> Keep your nails nicely filed, so if you do chip a nail avoid further damage from snags by filing down the chipped areas.</li>
            <li> after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem prior to trying nailtiques was my nails peeling off from the sides, right</li>
            <li> I have a vertical split on my right thumb that is slowly improving, but all the other nails are in good shape.</li>
            <li> and I got a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, which I found by chance, I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Too much protein can actually harden nails too much, to the point where they break.</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed a difference in the strength of my nails, which is the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> (they are so thick &amp; STRONG I can&#x27;t really bite them anyway!)    </li>
            <li> My sister first used this last year and her nails used to be brittle from her biting them and never grew.</li>
            <li> After years of breaks, splits, peels and such, i have real fingernails again!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> it wouldnt help when i was constantly running hot water over my hands.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it as clear nail polish, or so I thought.</li>
            <li> I will use naitiques for as long as they continue to provide a quality product that does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> , I ride horses, garden, and I&#x27;m a professional puppeteer performer</li>
            <li> how well they stand up to my very hands-on daily activities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had nail tips for years &amp; wanted to go natural</li>
            <li> So far, it is working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had soft nails all my life until I tried formula 2.</li>
            <li> but nothing has helped  until I discovered nailtiques completely by accident.  </li>
            <li> it peel off in nearly 12 years of use.</li>
            <li> I had really soft brittle nails that would tear often.  </li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> Its the only thing that really changed my nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are soft AND brittle without using Nailtiques.   </li>
            <li> In a short time this product has really strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time she&#x27;s had long nails in 3 decades</li>
            <li> I can no longer find Nailtiques to purchase in my area and was thrilled to find it on the internet because my nails had become thin again.  </li>
            <li> when they would grow a little bit I would get a split in the side and it would just peel the whole nail end right off.  </li>
            <li> First time I have had long nails!  </li>
            <li> (they get long FAST); I just use this everyday and they are long again in NO time - and very strong.</li>
            <li> After that, you should apply a coat EVERY OTHER day until the polish begins to peel off, in which case you take off all the polish and apply a fresh coat.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually works because i didn&#x27;t use it more then twice to find out.</li>
            <li> First know that these products come in pretty small bottles.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this, and I suggest clipping your nails short</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for others with similar nail problems.</li>
            <li> Right now I have all ten long finger nails.</li>
            <li> I began using this a week ago, and I already see a major improvement to my nails!</li>
            <li> I used to have naturally strong nails, until I got a job where I&#x27;m constantly having my hands in water and harsh santitizer with no option of gloves.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all thick and strong and look professionally</li>
            <li> and my nails are hard and strong.</li>
            <li> I think next time I will buy it in the larger bottle to keep it from drying out so fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other polishes and I am consistent.</li>
            <li> After about six weeks nails had grown out most of the weak or damaged nails; then used two coats once a week with color polish.</li>
            <li> I used for about 2 months and my nails were getting better, but still weak and peeling.</li>
            <li> I began to see significant improvement within just a few weeks of daily application.  </li>
            <li> At first to repair the damage artificial nails caused and now just because the polish stays on and my nails look so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use Nailtiques even when my nails are completely grown back just because it protects them.</li>
            <li> I commented on the lovely nails of my sister&#x27;s sister-in-law, and she told me her nails had been quite thin and brittle until she tried a product called Nailtique.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, the best way to use it is daily application over the last one, then after 2 weeks, it becomes my base coat for polish once a week.</li>
            <li> nails were difficult to grow; now have nice nails all of the time.  </li>
            <li> Underneath the acrylic nail, however, my own nails were very thin, brittle and splitting.  </li>
            <li> I have never used any other nail growth treatment that does as much for my nails as Nailtiques Formula 2.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate where my nails split.</li>
            <li> Perfect to repair damaged nails (say from wearing fake nails for a while) and strengthening thin nails.</li>
            <li> My nails became weak, brittle, and broke easily prompting me to use acrylics for a month which made them worse!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However the size of the bottle is smaller and price was higher so getting a lot less for my money.  </li>
            <li> I just keep the thin coat on and wear my nail short and they look very clean.</li>
            <li> Now I have been using Nailtiques consistently for a few months</li>
            <li> nails are just entirely too long now, but she won&#x27;t file them down as she&#x27;s having fun.</li>
            <li> I bought Nailtiques Formula 2 first because my nails are bad but they&#x27;re not horrible.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have only had decent nails a few times in my life.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it to anyone who has thin, splitting nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin peeling nails and since using this they&#x27;ve become strong and grow faster.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in my weak, brittle, splitting nails.  </li>
            <li> After using only half the bottle I am growing real fingernails again.  </li>
            <li> My nails are very thin and fragile because I use to have on acrylic nails, so I wanted to try something to strengthen them back to healthy.</li>
            <li> but once I got to the last bit in the bottle it got pretty thick</li>
            <li> I have had this product now for long enough to write a knowledgeable review.  </li>
            <li> If I try to smooth down any little nick, off comes half the finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that she really used the Nail Envy as directed, and religiously for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> You have to be VERY diligent about applying every day, this was hard for me because I was still experiencing peeling at the ridges from the artifical nails</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re stronger - hard to tell, but I can&#x27;t complain because they look so much nicer.</li>
            <li> I wore acrylics for years and my nails were ugly ever since until I started using this amazing</li>
            <li> I always had healthy nails up until I started working in the hospital, so it was disappointing</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t long yet, but they are getting there.</li>
            <li> My nails are long and stronger then they ever been .</li>
            <li> This has been around for a long time, no doubt b/c it works.</li>
            <li> so I get to cut them if they grow too long...</li>
            <li> The tiny 1/4 fluid ounce was priced just slightly lower than the others, so I thought I was getting a bargain.  </li>
            <li> If it keeps working this well over the long run, it&#x27;s like a miracle!</li>
            <li> Expensive product, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Nailtiques is the *only* other product I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s comparable to Nail Envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use if for very long.</li>
            <li> After 20 years of nails that peeled, broke, and always looked pathetic, in spite of trying every cream, pill and polish designed to fix the problem, I finally have nails I am proud of.</li>
            <li> By comparison, Nail Envy is thick enough with only one coat, but calls for two for the initial application.</li>
            <li> When the protien gets thick it peels off easier, normally I could go over a week without having to remove and start again, when it was thicker it would start peeling off after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> and I actually have to file them down.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go cold turkey and think it will remain as strong always.  </li>
            <li> If you have weak nails this will really help.</li>
            <li> my nails are a little stronger but no different then they were before..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a couple months and see absolutely no difference in my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using my Formula 2 until it&#x27;s empty and then switch to Formula 1 to maintain.</li>
            <li> It made absolutely no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I am using this to make my nails harder and stronger.</li>
            <li> After taking off my acrylic nails, my real nails were paper thin, ridged and just wouldn&#x27;t grow.  </li>
            <li> my nails were so soft and thin that they would split back into the nailbeds and bleed.  </li>
            <li> Ever since using Nailtique, my nails grow so long and never break that I have to file them down periodically.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a large bottle</li>
            <li> This product may be expensive compared to other nail polishes but believe me it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> BUT be aware that this is a very small bottle - not the travel size, but still really small.</li>
            <li> This time product was so thick could only use one time (the usual regiment of once daily for several weeks).  </li>
            <li> I used to have problems biting my nails and also problems with weak, brittle, peeling nails, and thus they would never grow long at all, or I could get them to grow to a certain length only to have them start peeling and become weak and break.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li> I had to remove and reapply after a few days due to work, but reapplying daily over a previous coat isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Did not know product came in such a small size.  </li>
            <li> I tried the other version \\&quot;nailtek\\&quot; but did not have sucess.</li>
            <li> I had tried using other products guaranteed to &amp;#34;strengthen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you have really thin nails, you NEED to be disciplined at applying a new coat every other day or it won&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> My nails were always thin, bendy, and peeling before acryclic (this is why I&#x27;ve used artificial nails on and off for special occasions)  I was determined to have pretty nails for my wedding that is coming up in 3 days and was sick of the thick artificial look... for the first time EVER my nails are long and strong, and no more peeling.  </li>
            <li> She blames me for \\&quot;stealing her protein\\&quot; as she was never able to grow her nails long again after having me.</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had very weak and thin nails that broke and chipped so easily.</li>
            <li> I give myself a manicure at least one a week on an average but within the past two years I&#x27;ve noticed the my middle fingernail, left hand has this slightly noticable crack and all 10 nails without polish look cracked and definitely not smooth like they use to be.</li>
            <li> My nails are peeling less and hopefully as I continue to use it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone trying to get out of the nail salon and rid of fake nails.</li>
            <li> My nails were a mess and someone recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> let the small bottle put you off - a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned about learning that this product has formaldehyde in it, so I&#x27;m weaning myself off.</li>
            <li> They sent me a little gift package with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My nails are a little stronger with it, but I still have crack issues.</li>
            <li> always soft and very weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nailtiques for a few years since nothing else will keep my nails from splitting and breaking.  </li>
            <li> I would not spend almost $20.00 every six weeks on a few ounces of nail polish if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I started using this a few weeks ago and my nails are stronger than ever and growing at a rapid speed.</li>
            <li> I figured because i already had it on that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt the second coat, but it did and it was worse.</li>
            <li> and you waste product.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of typing which is deadly for the nail tips.  </li>
            <li> I thought Nailtiques was just another waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for 16 years and decided to give them up as the cost/ maintenance was too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> While the directions call for only one coat, I still feel the need to apply two, as it paints on rather thinly.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it gets really thick after 3/4 of the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> It can take a couple of weeks to see a major difference, but it does work on brittle, weak or peeling nails!</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERYDAY (or at least every other day)!  </li>
            <li> The first coat I put on, it stung and burned my nails so bad</li>
            <li> I takes approximately 3 months for my nails to be long again and believe me</li>
            <li> I am now noticing that my nails are in pretty bad shape with ridges and less hard than they used to be.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow.  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked when I saw how much it was on the receipt (17.99$).</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 20 years - usually this bottle gives me two-three times per year usage.  </li>
            <li> i have been trying to find something to fix my nails for the past 6 years.</li>
            <li> and I would always head back to the nail salon for fake nails.</li>
            <li> No more peeling or breaking</li>
            <li> no more acrylics for me.</li>
            <li> I will continue to keep them very short until all the nail that was previously covered with artificial nails is grown out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my nails out for years without using fake acrylics, but they would always be soft and weak.</li>
            <li> One 1/2 ounce bottle lasts me at least a couple of months, but I have small nails.</li>
            <li> i never had a problem with my nails until i went to college bc of the the hard water in the showers.</li>
            <li> I have worn artificial nails for the last 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I use to bite my nails like crazy when I was in middle school, but now I&#x27;m 20</li>
            <li> Formula 2 so late in life.</li>
            <li> however after a couple months I like to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; my nails, because I do suspect those products are drying and slowly increase nail tip peeling over time.</li>
            <li> Nails grow so slowly, that I need to be patient, but the split nails, and all the layers seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> And I mean it...</li>
            <li> I started wearing wearing artificial nails because I had such weak brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> Seriously works.</li>
            <li> The product brought my nails back quite well, but sometimes they get bad again</li>
            <li> Only 3 of the very worst continue to split a little...but not nearly like they did before.  </li>
            <li> , they are still burning a bit after I removed the polish but Its not near as bad as with it on.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is product worked well but disappointed in only one time usage!</li>
            <li> My nails were peeling, weak and brittle and two weeks of using protein formula 2 has turned my nails around.</li>
            <li> After having artificial nails for a while I needed something to keep my nails from further splitting and hurting once the artificial nails were removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, they aren&#x27;t any worse either.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of having to go to nail appointments</li>
            <li> I used to have PAPER thin nails.  </li>
            <li> opi nail envy and nail tek made my nails even worse.</li>
            <li> my nails were getting thin and breaking all the time.</li>
            <li> but my nails were so thin (as a result of the tips).  </li>
            <li> I too tried this on my thin brittle nails as directed.</li>
            <li> My nails were so thin</li>
            <li> For anyone who has thin, brittle nails that peel like mine</li>
            <li> They have always broken, peeled, cracked...</li>
            <li> I do not know if my nails are beyond Nailtique help, but I am sticking with it because my nails are worse without it.</li>
            <li> I have very bad weak nails due to pain meds.</li>
            <li> After removing the artificial nails my nails were peeled, thin and weaker than ever.  </li>
            <li> For the hefty price i am not impressed</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin nails.</li>
            <li> even crazy glue did not help.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product 2.5 months ago after removing artificial nails.  </li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> And it peels off like crazy.</li>
            <li> I will never go with artificial nails again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I stopped having artificial nails applied.  </li>
            <li> However, I think it  is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I had bad splitting nails.  </li>
            <li> my nails were so bad that one time i broke a nail just because i was typing.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> No change what so ever. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my immunologist to help with the horrible damage that artificial nails did to my nailbeds.  </li>
            <li> Use two coats as a base coat.</li>
            <li> They have always peeled horribly.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only thing on the market that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nailtiques for a few years since nothing else will keep my nails from splitting and breaking.  I am now noticing that my nails are in pretty bad shape with ridges and less hard than they used to be.  I&#x27;m a little concerned about learning that this product has formaldehyde in it, so I&#x27;m weaning myself off.</li>
            <li> This product seems to penetrate &amp; change the character of the nails with every-other-day use.  Color can go over it, but my nails look so good without color, I don&#x27;t often bother with that.</li>
            <li> I have had this product now for long enough to write a knowledgeable review.  This was recommended by my immunologist to help with the horrible damage that artificial nails did to my nailbeds.  It has proven to be a real lifesaver.  Before use of nailtiques, I could not make my own bed without being extremely careful not to let my nails touch the sheets as I pulled to tuck them... my nails were so soft and thin that they would split back into the nailbeds and bleed.  Nothing I did would help...even crazy glue did not help.  After a week of applying nailtiques I could make the bed.. now after a month most of my nails have stopped splitting.  Only 3 of the very worst continue to split a little...but not nearly like they did before.  I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I was so hopeful. My nails have always peeled, been weak/thin and brake/chip easily. Used this product for several weeks, as directed and it did not make one bit of difference. No change what so ever. :(</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from my manicurist, just to be polite. She insisted. My nails would chip and she politely insisted that I try this product. OK, OK, I tried them all from the drugstores and was skeptical about this one too. I&#x27;d use it as clear nail polish, or so I thought. The effects of this stuff blew me away -- it really, really, really, really works. Really. I noticed my nails looked a lot better -- I was shocked. I usually don&#x27;t wear polish, and the looks of wearing this alone looked great -- it sort of \\&quot;wears off\\&quot; or gets absorbed, so you never have to remove it -- just reapply. I&#x27;m active, athletic, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn acrylic nails for years and decided to save the time and money required to keep up with them.  Underneath the acrylic nail, however, my own nails were very thin, brittle and splitting.  A friend referred me to Nailtiques and it has worked as advertised.  It strenthened my nails as they grew out and I liked the product so much I&#x27;ve continued to use it.  I&#x27;m active and rough on my hands and this product has really helped to keep them in good condition.  It also is a clear polish that makes them look very nice and natural.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for eight months and I have noticed great improvement in my nails. The improvement began after one month of use. I tried this product out to see if it would prevent my nails from peeling and breaking. And promote healthy strong nails. And it did just that !!! I am extremely happy with the results. This product actually made my nails grow !!! I did not follow any particular instructions. I do not go to nail salons, I do my own nails. My weekly regimen is as follows; one coat of \\&quot;nailtiques\\&quot; on clean nails. Then I apply two coats of my favorite \\&quot;Orly\\&quot; nail polish. Then one final coat of \\&quot;nailtiques\\&quot;. I think it&#x27;s important to be logical when using any type of beauty product. But take it from me I would not spend almost $20.00 every six weeks on a few ounces of nail polish if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I began using this a week ago, and I already see a major improvement to my nails! I used to have naturally strong nails, until I got a job where I&#x27;m constantly having my hands in water and harsh santitizer with no option of gloves. My nails became weak, brittle, and broke easily prompting me to use acrylics for a month which made them worse!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week and my nails are already stronger. I had to remove and reapply after a few days due to work, but reapplying daily over a previous coat isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, and I suggest clipping your nails short so you can see the progress for yourself! (Psst, cuticle oil 2x daily also helps tons!!!)</li>
            <li> I received this product in a very timely manner, well packaged, and was very pleased with this transaction as a whole.  I would not hesitate to recommend this vendor to the Amazon users.</li>
            <li> This product strengthens my nails better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.  If it keeps working this well over the long run, it&#x27;s like a miracle!</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2.5 months ago after removing artificial nails.  My nails were always thin, bendy, and peeling before acryclic (this is why I&#x27;ve used artificial nails on and off for special occasions)  I was determined to have pretty nails for my wedding that is coming up in 3 days and was sick of the thick artificial look... for the first time EVER my nails are long and strong, and no more peeling.  My biggest problem prior to trying nailtiques was my nails peeling off from the sides, right when they would grow a little bit I would get a split in the side and it would just peel the whole nail end right off.  You have to be VERY diligent about applying every day, this was hard for me because I was still experiencing peeling at the ridges from the artifical nails so it might seem like it&#x27;s not working but you have to be patient.  As soon as the damaged nail grew out is when I could really tell the difference and I have had to even file them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A .25 oz bottle has lasted me about 6 weeks (I&#x27;m still only on my second bottle after 2.5 months), although it would probably have lasted longer but once I got to the last bit in the bottle it got pretty thick and I got a new bottle.  I believe they also sell a nailtique protein thinner (nail polish thinner won&#x27;t work!)  When the protien gets thick it peels off easier, normally I could go over a week without having to remove and start again, when it was thicker it would start peeling off after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I teach pottery and working with clay wrecks my nails.  This is the ONLY product (and I&#x27;ve tried tons!) that protects, nourishes and grows my nails.  It can take a couple of weeks to see a major difference, but it does work on brittle, weak or peeling nails!</li>
            <li> Has not done much for growth and has not harden nail at all</li>
            <li> love it great product</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of drug store snake oil, this product really delivers. I enjoy the soak off UV gel polish (Shellac, Gelish) however after a couple months I like to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; my nails, because I do suspect those products are drying and slowly increase nail tip peeling over time. I remove the gel polish, cut the nails short and use the Nailtiques #2 every day for a week or two until they grow out a bit again. Then my nail tips are strong and ready for another couple months of chip-free gel polish manicures!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I decided to try this product. I used it for about a month and my nails are so amazingly healthy and long. I went to the nailtiques website and purchased more formula 2, formula 1, avocado foot cream, and polish remover. They sent me a little gift package with my purchase. I will use naitiques for as long as they continue to provide a quality product that does exactly what it claims. Worth any price.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have only had decent nails a few times in my life.  They have always peeled horribly.  I eat a healthy diet and take reasonable supplements so I knew it wasn&#x27;t lack of nutrients.  I asked my dermatologist if she could recommend anything and told me to always wear rubber gloves when cleaning or doing the dishes (something I often did, but not always) and to use Nailtique.  It has worked perfectly.  For the first time in years, I have perfect nails!</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter and I pick my nails a lot but started using this product and my nails are long and strong.  First time I have had long nails!  I have been using this product for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it always does the job. My nails grow and are very healthy. It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my usually strong, long nails have been going through a period of chipping and peeling, so I fell for the Nailtique hype.    Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is pure junk.  I followed the directions faithfully, but my nails are still chipping and the product is peeling off!!    Don&#x27;t believe everything you read about this scam.</li>
            <li> My nails were super soft and brittle after having my baby and this really worked! I want to say in about a week I saw a BIG difference!! You will love&amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and liked the product.  However the size of the bottle is smaller and price was higher so getting a lot less for my money.  That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had bad splitting nails.  I got on the Internet and started researching and found Nailtiques.  I used it and my my nails started to heal.  They started to grow and now they are beautiful.. Yes I would recommend it.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about EVERY product imaginable to get my nails to grow, from nail \\&quot;strengthening\\&quot; polishes to nail growth \\&quot;supplements\\&quot;... and nothing has worked like Nailtiques!  I used to have problems biting my nails and also problems with weak, brittle, peeling nails, and thus they would never grow long at all, or I could get them to grow to a certain length only to have them start peeling and become weak and break.  Now I have been using Nailtiques consistently for a few months and I get SOOOO many compliments on my beautiful NATURAL nails, people are always asking if they are real! They are incredibly long, strong, and healthy, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to believe they are really my nails!!  And because they are so beautiful I no longer have the urge to bite them (they are so thick &amp; STRONG I can&#x27;t really bite them anyway!)    Here are two tips to help you get the most out of Nailtiques and to help your nails really grow:    1.) USE IT EVERYDAY (or at least every other day)!  Luckilly this formula dries super quick and doesn&#x27;t stay all gummy and sticky like other polishes do, so make sure you follow the directions: paint one coat on the first day, and continue to paint on one layer each day thereafter.   At the end of the week I will remove all the layers with acetone nail polish remover, and then start applying layers of Nailtiques all over again.    2.) Keep your nails nicely filed, so if you do chip a nail avoid further damage from snags by filing down the chipped areas. And try to get a lot of protein in your diet this helps also to build strong nails! :)</li>
            <li> You really can believe all the reviews of formula 2.  It really does work.  My nails were not necessarily brittle, but they tended to split at the edges.  That has stopped and they just look nicer and healthier.  One thing that I can&#x27;t really explain is that they are growing much slower than they used to. My nails have always grown fast and there is a very noticeable difference.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re stronger - hard to tell, but I can&#x27;t complain because they look so much nicer.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. Although it seemed to do well and as it was advertised on one hand, the other, which had the more thinner and brittle nails is taking much longer for improvment (much longer than 2 wks)...I definitely expected more from this product than it delivered...</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to pick this up! My sister first used this last year and her nails used to be brittle from her biting them and never grew. Her nails are now longer than most acrylic tips and HARDER. I started using this a few weeks ago and my nails are stronger than ever and growing at a rapid speed. Try this before giving up!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the super-star product that so many other people seem to think it is. The directions say to apply DAILY, which is a hassle. And it peels off like crazy. If I try to smooth down any little nick, off comes half the finish. I&#x27;ve been using this a couple months and see absolutely no difference in my nails. But, they aren&#x27;t any worse either.</li>
            <li> I have worn artificial nails for the last 15 years.  I started wearing wearing artificial nails because I had such weak brittle nails.  After removing the artificial nails my nails were peeled, thin and weaker than ever.  I was so tired of having to go to nail appointments and now that I have discovered Nailtiques I will never go with artificial nails again.  I have used Nailtiques faithfully for three weeks, removing only once a week and there is a HUGE difference already in the strength of my nails and I have not broken or split one yet.  I will continue to keep them very short until all the nail that was previously covered with artificial nails is grown out. Hopefully I will have great natural nails for the first time in my life. Note: I did not know when I ordered that they make a formula \\&quot;After artificial\\&quot; or I would have tried that but am happy so will stay with Formula 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this polish for years because my nails tend to be brittle and break if left on their own.  But this polish allows me to grow beautiful nails - and wear just clear polish all by itself.  My nails look almost like a French manicure - that&#x27;s how strong they are.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the small bottle put you off - a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> After years of breaks, splits, peels and such, i have real fingernails again! I&#x27;ve used many products that claim to repair and grow problem nails.  Some have helped, but none have really worked until a friend recommended Nailtiques 2.  After using only half the bottle I am growing real fingernails again.  They aren&#x27;t long yet, but they are getting there.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. My nails are peeling less and hopefully as I continue to use it my nails will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. Not sure if it actually works because i didn&#x27;t use it more then twice to find out. The first coat I put on, it stung and burned my nails so bad, they felt like they were going to fall off, i couldn&#x27;t stand the pain in my finger tips. I figured because i already had it on that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt the second coat, but it did and it was worse. I couldn&#x27;t stand it so I took it off right away with polish remover, they are still burning a bit after I removed the polish but Its not near as bad as with it on. My nails are very thin and fragile because I use to have on acrylic nails, so I wanted to try something to strengthen them back to healthy. I do not like this product and wouldn&#x27;t not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Has made my nails so strong I just can&#x27;t do without it If you have problem nails this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> I used to have PAPER thin nails.  And I mean it...nails that would bend without any effort.  I tried everything to try to make them stronger.  My sister-in-law told me about Nailtiques Formula 2 so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  My nails are now the strongest they&#x27;ve every been.  For the first week, you need to apply a coat EVERY day.  After that, you should apply a coat EVERY OTHER day until the polish begins to peel off, in which case you take off all the polish and apply a fresh coat.  If you have really thin nails, you NEED to be disciplined at applying a new coat every other day or it won&#x27;t work as well.  One 1/2 ounce bottle lasts me at least a couple of months, but I have small nails.</li>
            <li> For the hefty price i am not impressed</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 20 years - usually this bottle gives me two-three times per year usage.  This time product was so thick could only use one time (the usual regiment of once daily for several weeks).  I have the thinning formula but didn&#x27;t work!  Bottom line is product worked well but disappointed in only one time usage!</li>
            <li> Great for thin, flimsy nails and those that bite them.  Works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this procuct with great success for several years. I have noticed that during periods of not using this product, my nails gradually return to a weakened condition.</li>
            <li> Not please with size please show actually size in the future</li>
            <li> NAILTIQUES works. Period. I&#x27;m ordering more soon for myself and family. If you have weak nails this will really help.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome .I will continue to use for ever. My nails are long and stronger then they ever been .</li>
            <li> I do put this on my fingernails every night before bed. Only one time a day. I don&#x27;t use any other polishes and I am consistent. Right now I have all ten long finger nails. I used to wear gel nails (I had them done at the salon Bi weekly) and when I finally stopped wearing them, the nail tech told me to get this to harden my nails. I did, it worked then, and now I&#x27;m just using it since my nails kept chipping b/c of the winter weather. This has been around for a long time, no doubt b/c it works. Seriously worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  However, I think it  is very expensive.</li>
            <li> My friend brought this product over one weekend, I applied it and it stayed on for two weeks.  My nails were so strong and in  starting to grow that I bought my own bottle.  A little goes a long way with this product.  My nails are now so long after a month that I am wearing nail polish and they look beautiful.  I wore acrylics for years and my nails were ugly ever since until I started using this amazing formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee in San Diego</li>
            <li> Awesome choice,  my nails are finally hardening and growing after many years of acrylic and shellac. This product really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had  thin splitting/ peeling nails for many many years.  I commented on the lovely nails of my sister&#x27;s sister-in-law, and she told me her nails had been quite thin and brittle until she tried a product called Nailtique.  She wrote down the name for me, and I held onto the paper for over a year before I was able to find it.  I started with  Formula 2, and progressed to Formula 2 Plus.  I noticed a change right away, but because my individual nails had split so many times it took almost a year, but the splits are ALL GONE !!   &lt;br /&gt;Give this a try.  Until I had seen this girl&#x27;s nails, I had given up hope. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product is great and I recommend every one to purchase it. My nails have never been this strong. I have farm work to do and I always break a nail but with this product I have not lost one yet.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best nail formula!  I live in a dry climate where my nails split. Now my nails are long and strong. Will not be without it!</li>
            <li> i never had a problem with my nails until i went to college bc of the the hard water in the showers. i have been trying to find something to fix my nails for the past 6 years. opi nail envy and nail tek made my nails even worse. every time i try to grow my nails after a month they start splitting and cracking and breaking. my nails were so bad that one time i broke a nail just because i was typing. i have only been using this every day for two weeks and my finger nails are as strong as my toe nails. even before my nails got ruined they were not this strong. they feel thicker too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works amazing!!</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had very weak and thin nails that broke and chipped so easily. I was always polishing them with hardeners and strengtheners but nothing worked. My future mother in law has the most beautiful nails I&#x27;ve ever seen! They look acrylic but they&#x27;re her own natural nails. One time I asked her how she got her nails to look so amazing and she told me she uses Nailtiques. She recommended I pick up a bottle and explained all the different formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting married in December so I want to look my best and finally decided to try it. I bought Nailtiques Formula 2 first because my nails are bad but they&#x27;re not horrible. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my nails are amazing! They used to be all different lengths because they kept breaking and chipping but now I can&#x27;t even remember the last time a nail chipped. They&#x27;re all thick and strong and look professionally manicured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ride horses, garden, and I&#x27;m a professional puppeteer performer so my nails get A TON of abuse, but they&#x27;re still strong and beautiful with Nailtiques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using my Formula 2 until it&#x27;s empty and then switch to Formula 1 to maintain. I can&#x27;t believe how quickly and dramatically my nails improved and how well they stand up to my very hands-on daily activities.</li>
            <li> As I am getting older (63) my nails were getting thin and breaking all the time. I started using this and my nails are hard and strong. I don&#x27;t know how it works but even when I take the polish off, my nails are strong. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months now....I am ordering a second bottle, as I think it is working.  Nails grow so slowly, that I need to be patient, but the split nails, and all the layers seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> One of the best products out there.  For a strong top finish that protects both your nails and lets the nail polish last longer.  It shipped fast and I highly recommend the smaller .25 ounce bottle so that the formula stays fresh and gilds best, since larger bottles sometimes get sticky towards the end and you waste product.</li>
            <li> I have very bad weak nails due to pain meds. Nailtiques formula 2 works great! My nails are staying strong and I keep them at a medium length.</li>
            <li> people this has formaldehyde in it so much that i had a reaction to it. there is no warning label this company might get sued!</li>
            <li> The product is still to be determined if it accomplishes what it is supposed to provide. Good luck to everyone.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS! Years of Horrible Peeling Fingernails Healed. I had tried just about everything over the years, but this actually worked. Followed the directions with clean nails (swab with alcohol to clean well), added one coat per day for 4-5 days, removed and repeated. After about six weeks nails had grown out most of the weak or damaged nails; then used two coats once a week with color polish. I have a vertical split on my right thumb that is slowly improving, but all the other nails are in good shape. Must moisturize 2-3 times a day to keep nails &amp; cuticles healthy. I just use almond oil with lavender oil added.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;d had nail tips for years &amp; wanted to go natural but my nails were so thin (as a result of the tips).  My sister sent me a bottle of this &amp; I started using it it &amp; within a few weeks my nails were strong and pretty.  I only use it every couple months now just to maintain.  It made a real difference!</li>
            <li> Wow! About 8 months ago, I peeled all my gel nail polish off, taking my top layer of nail with it. Since then, I have not been able to grow my nails at all. They would just peel, peel, peel. It was horrible. I was actually hopeless, thinking my nails would just peel forever. I finally tried Naitiques 2 and this product is truly amazing!! I&#x27;ve been using it for only 2 weeks and the peeling is growing out and the nails are stronger and no longer peeling. I don&#x27;t know how it works but it works!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I stopped having artificial nails applied.  This has been several years ago.  The product brought my nails back quite well, but sometimes they get bad again and I run out of the product or just don&#x27;t take the care of my nails as I should.  It was time.  I gave it a four star as they are looking better again, but it has not been long enough to see if they get healthy again.  I&#x27;m so happy that I can get nailtiques from amazon because it is not available in the stores where I used to get the product.  I hope you continue to have the product.  I will be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails. This product keeps them strong.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over 10 years and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> An excellent product I have used for years whenever my nails start becoming thin or cracking, this product builds them up and protects them until they are strong again. Does not turn yellow on my nails.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my manicurist which wasn&#x27;t even too sure it would work. I started noticing improvement since the first time I tried it. I strongly recommend the use of Nailtiques for anyone with brittle or peeling nails.</li>
            <li> small bottle, good price</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish for weak nails. We need is not on my nails they are brittle and do not feel good. I just keep the thin coat on and wear my nail short and they look very clean. I have tried a lot of different brands of nail polish and this is the only one that works for my nails and I&#x27;ve used it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I too tried this on my thin brittle nails as directed. It made absolutely no difference at all. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me. I used for about 2 months and my nails were getting better, but still weak and peeling. So I tried 2+ and what a difference!</li>
            <li> I am using this to make my nails harder and stronger. So far, it is working. I hope it continues to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had soft nails all my life until I tried formula 2. My nails are now long and strong. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My nails look like I had gone to a salon</li>
            <li> works wonders for the nails</li>
            <li> The product work great and my nail are going but when it wears off my nail break so i know now to order the more stronger formula</li>
            <li> After 20 years of nails that peeled, broke, and always looked pathetic, in spite of trying every cream, pill and polish designed to fix the problem, I finally have nails I am proud of. I used the formula 2 plus for about three weeks, and then changed to the formula 2, as my nails strengthened and grew. they are strong, look beautiful, and are not splitting, breaking or peeling anymore. It&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend nailtiques formula 2!! My nails were peeling, weak and brittle and two weeks of using protein formula 2 has turned my nails around. They are strong, long and healthy and finally back to how they should be. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does what it says, and yes, I would recommend this to anyone who has the same problems as I do with my nails.</li>
            <li> Saved my nails after too many gel nails.  Protects them well, too.  I think next time I will buy it in the larger bottle to keep it from drying out so fast.</li>
            <li> My nails NEVER grew...they were thin, would bend and that was after months of trying to keep them in perfect shape. I picked up nailtiques step 2 thinking it would be yet another so-so product. I didn&#x27;t see the price and I was shocked when I saw how much it was on the receipt (17.99$). THIS PRODUCT WORKS AWESOME. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years now, and as another reviewer said you don&#x27;t have to use it as often after a while. Sometimes I&#x27;ll cut my nails really short to start them over again (they get long FAST); I just use this everyday and they are long again in NO time - and very strong. People comment on them all the time and some even think they are acrylics!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;nailtiques&#x27; since before Xmas of 2010. I have always had long, strong, well manicured fingernails - I give myself a manicure at least one a week on an average but within the past two years I&#x27;ve noticed the my middle fingernail, left hand has this slightly noticable crack and all 10 nails without polish look cracked and definitely not smooth like they use to be. I always use oils before I go to bed but nothing has helped  until I discovered nailtiques completely by accident.  I purchased Formula 2 PLUS first, then Formula 2 large size - it works girls.    I cut my nails short and started my first application of Formula 2 Plus, using it only 9/10 days and saw a great improvement. I stopped using nail polish for about 2 month, using only the Formula 2 for the next 5 months - my nails are back to the way they use to be.  I still use the Formula 2 PLUS about once a month - I wouldn&#x27;t be without this stuff.  It has a nice sheen so it looks good on the nails without polish.  I takes approximately 3 months for my nails to be long again and believe me I do a lot of typing which is deadly for the nail tips.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this great &#x27;bring back my nails&#x27; - product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  At first to repair the damage artificial nails caused and now just because the polish stays on and my nails look so healthy.  It also helped strengthen my nails so the shape of the nails even looks better.  Never hd it peel off in nearly 12 years of use. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has thin, splitting nails.</li>
            <li> Did not know product came in such a small size.  Have been using the 1/2 fluid ounce &amp; thought that is what I would get.  The tiny 1/4 fluid ounce was priced just slightly lower than the others, so I thought I was getting a bargain.  Wrong.  Now I have more to check when buying on-line.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It helps to strengthen nails. In my experience, the best way to use it is daily application over the last one, then after 2 weeks, it becomes my base coat for polish once a week. Too much protein can actually harden nails too much, to the point where they break. That&#x27;s probably why they make more than one formula. I&#x27;m able to use this one formula, always, using it once a week after the two week induction phase.</li>
            <li> MAGIC! This stuff is amazing. Perfect to repair damaged nails (say from wearing fake nails for a while) and strengthening thin nails. Smooths away imperfections and lasts till you remove it. Works as good as I was told it would by a friend. If you have ANY kind of damage, or just like the look of a healthy natural nail, I highly recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Nothing even comes close to working as well. I swear by it</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t any better than Sally Hansen, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Nothing works like this product does for me. I&#x27;ve always had thin peeling nails and since using this they&#x27;ve become strong and grow faster.  I also take biotin which is good for nails. Only complaint is that it gets really thick after 3/4 of the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products and this is the first one I have found that really works. I almost gave up after trying Nail Envy. So glad I found this. It&#x27;s great and it works</li>
            <li> People think I have perfect nails.  This is why.  When I stop using it my nails fall apart.  Use two coats as a base coat. Shipping was a little slow.  That is the reason for 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My nails will NOT grow out in winter, and they split badly.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that stops the splitting.&lt;br /&gt;Only warmer weather will make them grow again....</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed a difference in the strength of my nails, which is the main reason I bought it. However, my nails have been growing faster. So if you are looking for something to help your nails grow faster I would suggest trying this out.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to regrow my nails for over a year and have been trying various products.  I thought Nailtiques was just another waste of time and money but I am finally beginning to see some improvement.  I have been using Nailtiques for about a month and my nails seem to be getting stronger.  Could it really be working?  I have my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I had really soft brittle nails that would tear often.  Using Nailtiques has been awesome.  They are now stronger and more beautiful. It&#x27;s important to remember to use the product over time.  Just don&#x27;t go cold turkey and think it will remain as strong always.  It&#x27;s a very good product; great for me!</li>
            <li> Absolute Rubbish,do not waste your money!! Never worked for me, nails still splitting!!</li>
            <li> I started using Nailtiques Formula 2 about a year ago.  My nails were so thin and if I were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off.  I tried many \\&quot;nail hardener\\&quot; products with no success.  Nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use.  I don&#x27;t use any remover - after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over.  I don&#x27;t try to remove it off all my nails at once - just the ones that appear to need lifting off at the moment.  Agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so.  This product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling.  One review writer mentioned the bottle brush separating from the top - just reclose bottle until it catches on and start over.It finally stops this nuisance.</li>
            <li> Hmm I ordered this and received it within three to four days i don&#x27;t remember.. But anyways, I have been using this product for a week now and haven&#x27;t seen no changes.. my nails are a little stronger but no different then they were before.. I use to bite my nails like crazy when I was in middle school, but now I&#x27;m 20 I don&#x27;t bite them as often they&#x27;re just short.. I hope I see progress soon or I&#x27;m going to be upset.. that this product was all hype smh..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update on March 20,2013*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to change my ratings on this to 4 stars because I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now, and people have been saying my nails look like they are french tipped! My nails are very strong and if they break it&#x27;s just a little bit. But I do notice, as soon as remove the nail polish after a day one of my nails break or get real soft. So we&#x27;ll see what happens...</li>
            <li> I have worn acrylics off and on for 20 years. I have tried many high priced nail hardeners but nothing ever worked and I would always head back to the nail salon for fake nails. Not this time!! I have been using this for over a month and I actually have strong fingernails! It&#x27;s amazing. My nails were paper thin when I started to use this, I applied it every morning for the first two weeks, now I&#x27;m actually wearing polish and my nails looks great! It&#x27;s a great top coat too! I highly recommend this product for anyone trying to get out of the nail salon and rid of fake nails.</li>
            <li> My fingernails used to grow out to a certain length, then would crack at the corners where the nail meets the finger tip. They would also peel. Ever since using Nailtique, my nails grow so long and never break that I have to file them down periodically. I only apply the stuff about once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my nails out for years without using fake acrylics, but they would always be soft and weak. After using nailtiques for about a month I have strong, healthy, and durable nails. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My nails were a mess and someone recommended this product.  I have definitely seen an improvement in my nails.  They are stronger and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail treatment. Helped my nails to look healthier and fell better.</li>
            <li> Seriously works. I have very week nails that break and split all the time. I honestly must recommend this product. Its the only thing that really changed my nails. No more peeling or breaking and I actually have to file them down. Didn&#x27;t think it was possible until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, but you can&#x27;t stop using it. Your nails will go back to the way they were when you started this product if you stop.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and years. My nails are soft AND brittle without using Nailtiques.   As an extra bonus, the product makes the nail tips turn bright white instead of their natural yellowish tone.  The small bottle is perfect for slipping into your purse.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital as a nurses aide, and where my job requires to wash my hands over 50 times a day, it really dries my hands and nails out, causing my nails to be soft and brittle and crack. I always had healthy nails up until I started working in the hospital, so it was disappointing and i thought that no matter what i did it wouldnt help when i was constantly running hot water over my hands. But as soon as I tried this product, I saw a huge difference the next morning when I woke up. I was so thrilled that I applied my second coat. It dries fast, and has a nice natural shine to it. For anyone who has thin, brittle nails that peel like mine did, i would absolutely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Use this product all of the time.....nails were difficult to grow; now have nice nails all of the time.  I would recommend this product; I also used this product after acrylic nails were removed and I saw what they had done to my nail beds.  Nailtiques has a two step product for use after acrylic nails....helped my nails to grow out strong......no more acrylics for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amaxing and the price is incredibly.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after deciding to discontinue acrylic nails.  My nails were brittle and flaking.  I began to see significant improvement within just a few weeks of daily application.  Expensive product, but worth it!</li>
            <li> In a short time this product has really strengthened my nails. I just wish the product came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and am very happy with the results. I highly recommend using it for nail growth and strength.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had good nails in my life.  They have always broken, peeled, cracked...never ever been strong.  This product is amazing if you follow the directions. My nail are strong and pretty and stay that way. I tell everyone about it!  I have also stayed with Formula 2.</li>
            <li> Love it when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for 16 years and decided to give them up as the cost/ maintenance was too much trouble.  This product may be expensive compared to other nail polishes but believe me it is well worth the cost. I tried the other version \\&quot;nailtek\\&quot; but did not have sucess. my nails are long, strong and beautiful and now I apply this product maybe once or twice a week. It is amazing but i&#x27;m dissapointed to see that some retailers are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> I really like the nailtiques products and find that they are as advertised. They were recommended to me by a friend for whom they also worked fine</li>
            <li> The product is excellent - have used it for years.  BUT be aware that this is a very small bottle - not the travel size, but still really small.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I happened to bash my nails into several different objects and they didn&#x27;t break! I highly recommend this product for any one who has troubles with breaking nails.</li>
            <li> The good news is it works...saw an elderly friend of mine with great nails, and she told me she used this religiously and didn&#x27;t used to have nice nails, so she was a testament to its effectiveness.  Just didn&#x27;t know it contained formaldehyde until after I received it, which I really don&#x27;t want on any part of my body.  I gave it to her, since she already was a loyal user and in her nineties by that time.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  It&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in my weak, brittle, splitting nails.  They look the best they&#x27;ve looked in literally years!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for years. Saved my nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent formula if you&#x27;re looking to strengthen brittle nails from either removal of artificial nails or poor diet, or whatever the case may be.. I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY DIFFERENT remedies... THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKS... WELL</li>
            <li> I can no longer find Nailtiques to purchase in my area and was thrilled to find it on the internet because my nails had become thin again.  I had tried using other products guaranteed to &amp;#34;strengthen&amp;#34; my nails but found nothing works as good as Nailtiques Formula 2.  After using this product for about 2 weeks my nails are again stronger and look great</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Helped my nails recover from 26 years of acrylic application in only 60 days. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My nails are a little stronger with it, but I still have crack issues. I do not know if my nails are beyond Nailtique help, but I am sticking with it because my nails are worse without it.</li>
            <li> I love this nail strengthener. It was recommended to me by a manicurist, and it works great. Goes on easy, dries fast, and keeps my nails from peeling and cracking.I started using it when I was trying to stop biting my nails, and it really helped.</li>
            <li> After many years of never having nails, a friend of mine recommended this product. Wow! I have nails. You will, too. All you have to do is get used to having nails after using this product. Item arrived earlier than expected so the delivery is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have splitting nails and if I use this as directed, it helps them a lot. My problem has been tat I don&#x27;t keep putting costs on all week.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product; I really like it. My nails improved a lot. I recommend it to everyone who has problems with their nails.</li>
            <li> After taking off my acrylic nails, my real nails were paper thin, ridged and just wouldn&#x27;t grow.  My manicurist gave me my first 2+ bottle, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. My nails are strong again, growing, and the product leaves a nice little shine.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other nail growth treatment that does as much for my nails as Nailtiques Formula 2.  I have nails that split, peel and break easily because of medication I have been on for years.  My sister bought me my first bottle 1 1/2 years ago and this is all I use now.  My nails grow beautifully and now I get compliments on them.  They don&#x27;t break so easily so I get to cut them if they grow too long...which has happened.  :)  Thank you Nailtiques.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  I have tried many other products for weak and brittle nails and this is the only one that has improved my nails 100%. I highly recommend this for others with similar nail problems.</li>
            <li> I did not get the  product that is advertised</li>
            <li> Super nail product. It really works to harden your brittle or soft nails and allows them to grow. Great after removing fake nails. I use it regularly. Follow directions and make sure it&#x27;s mixed well before applying.</li>
            <li> After having artificial nails for a while I needed something to keep my nails from further splitting and hurting once the artificial nails were removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nailtiques works for just that purpose. When used according to the directions, my own nails were able to grow out without constantly being snagged on everything I touched. I will continue to use Nailtiques even when my nails are completely grown back just because it protects them.</li>
            <li> First know that these products come in pretty small bottles. Also, I&#x27;m a diehard OPI Nail Envy fan and have been for years. When I was out of my Nail Envy a little while ago my mother actually gifted me a bottle of her Nailtiques. So, I was actually able to try this product for myself. For me, it worked about as well as Nail Envy. It&#x27;s not a large bottle so I didn&#x27;t use if for very long. But I didn&#x27;t notice it to work any better for me in that time than Nail Envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Nail Envy after my second pregnancy, and it was the only thing that worked for me. My nails grow just fine on their own, but began to break very easily after my youngest was born. Nailtiques is the *only* other product I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s comparable to Nail Envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you ask my mother she&#x27;ll say that this product is actually better than OPI. I&#x27;m not convinced that she really used the Nail Envy as directed, and religiously for at least 2 weeks straight lol. She says she did, but in any event it didn&#x27;t help her. All of my life, my mother&#x27;s nails have been short. She blames me for \\&quot;stealing her protein\\&quot; as she was never able to grow her nails long again after having me. Fast forward to now, and she has CLAWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her nails are just entirely too long now, but she won&#x27;t file them down as she&#x27;s having fun. It&#x27;s the first time she&#x27;s had long nails in 3 decades and she&#x27;s loving it. So, if you didn&#x27;t like OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy, definitely try this product. While Nailiques is lower in price in the stores, it&#x27;s also smaller in size. While the directions call for only one coat, I still feel the need to apply two, as it paints on rather thinly. By comparison, Nail Envy is thick enough with only one coat, but calls for two for the initial application. Even then I still feel the OPI bottles last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that while the directions in both brands now state that you can apply over nail color after initial application, I would strongly recommend that you stayaway from nail color for two weeks when you&#x27;re first starting out. Just stick to the nail strengthener and reapplications till you notice some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to file/cut/buff any cracks or splits that are already in your nails. This product will not mend damage that has already occurred.</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I found such an effective product!!!  I never had beautiful nails; always soft and very weak. After using this product, which I found by chance, I can&#x27;t live without it.  Believe me, it is marvelous. My only regret is that I found Nailtiques  Formula 2 so late in life.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any results from this product.  In fact, it seems to wear off and chip rather easily.</li>
