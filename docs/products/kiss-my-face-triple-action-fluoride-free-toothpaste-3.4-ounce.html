            <li>Though, what makes this paste the best is it leaves your mouth</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT!!</li>
            <li>And the minty taste is very pleasant and not at all</li>
            <li>My Face toothpaste tastes great.  </li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I tried this and although it is a bit pricey for the quantity, it cleans well, seems to control tartar well, tastes very good and is everything I want my new toothpaste to be.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, but not sugary.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this brand many times</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>it dissolves almost immediately, so you have to use more.  </li>
            <li>great paste gentle on erroded gums</li>
            <li>I bought it on Amazon because of the price, but turned out Tom of Maine is better than Kiss My Face in my opinion.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>It tastes good, doesnt leave a wierd aftertaste and it leaves your teeth feeling super clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>SO, SO, clean, and the taste does not stick with you for hours!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes using cruelty free products so easy.</li>
            <li>It tastes ok and seems to clean</li>
            <li>My toddler loved it and it was a good alternative to the other brands.</li>
            <li>Bought it because it is flouride free.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feels clean without the strong taste.  </li>
            <li>Good flavor, whitening is (mildly) effective, and unlike many natural/organic toothpastes, you can actually get this one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth really clean</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>We love that this is not gritty like many of the other brands out there, and it has a great taste as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves mouth feeling fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a brand loyal customer since 2005.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean, love the taste( better than all the other toxin free</li>
            <li>So many of the natural toothpastes out there just don&#x27;t make the grade for me.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and keeps my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is ok if you have no other toothpaste in the house to use</li>
            <li>so you have an effective but not too long brushing session.</li>
            <li>Normal toothpastes that do not share this weak-foam issue greatly cut down the work of the toothbrush, thereby decreasing the problem of weakening bristles.</li>
            <li>In that sense, this toothpaste is neither economical nor truly practical for consumers with large households.</li>
            <li>Finally, and most troubling, there was no seal on the tube</li>
            <li>And it is necessary to brush more vigorously, to ensure that whatever plaque that has settled in the gumlines is thoroughly removed (I assume that also has to do with the diminished foam levels.)  </li>
            <li>This disappears so you have to apply more to your brush or else use double or triple the first time.</li>
            <li>I love this especially knowing I am not putting a toxic substance in my body.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use an inch long each time as the directions says</li>
            <li>the peppermint was so strong that we fought her tooth and nail to use it then finally gave up.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this toothpaste Relies on the toothbrush to do a greater portion of its own work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not economical at all and takes more time.  </li>
            <li>This was the main reason I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>Decent taste.</li>
            <li>It is important in our family to use a fluoride-free toothpaste, but there are limited options out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>only ironic caveat to this paste is that because a substantial amount must be used for each brushing, the entire tube goes pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is worth the extra price!!</li>
            <li>normal toothpaste...</li>
            <li>I did not experience any of the &amp;#34;burn-a-hole-through-your-tongue&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dry-up-my-saliva-glands&amp;#34; sensations delivered by normal toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>i guess its for people who have sensitive gums</li>
            <li>Love it not too thick</li>
            <li>Aside from this and the cruelty of animal testing, most toothpastes seem the same to me, Although this toothpaste is somewhat expensive, comparatively speaking, it&#x27;s worth it to me to abstain from buying toothpaste that senselessly requires the subjugation and torture of animals.</li>
            <li>Its ingredients (when fully released) are just as effective as those found in its regular counterparts, but are far less harsh to the enamel and mucous lining of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Its weird how regular chemical toothpaste does not compare to the clean, fresh feeling at each brush!</li>
            <li>IS AMAZING MINT REFRESHING FOR A LONG TIME AND ELIMINATES BAD BREATH FOR LONG TIME</li>
            <li>The taste is not as intense as other mainstream branded toothpaste.</li>

            <li> Fluoride may be great for your teeth, but is absolutely awful for everything else in your body, especially your brain...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the packaging was crushed.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about getting it.</li>
            <li> but i find no difference between this and other brands...  </li>
            <li> I search far and wide for ethical brands that aren&#x27;t distributed by P&amp;G.  Some natural brands taste terrible.  </li>
            <li> like there typically would be.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, please look after what you sell.</li>
            <li> I typically brush my teeth for about two minutes using a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste and medium-bristle toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It must also be said that the effectiveness of this toothpaste is tightly correlated to the newness of the toothbrush being used.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m dumb enough</li>
            <li> Given that this toothpaste does not easily foam and that an inch of paste must be used in order to feel any lather at all, a longer brushing time was required.  </li>
            <li> This might have a weird taste and it does not sud like other toothpastes when you use it and compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li> not a good flavor for the little kids.</li>
            <li> Now that Tom&#x27;s has sold out and includes fluoride, I had a hard time finding a toothpaste that did not include fluoride.</li>
            <li> all natural toothpaste and it does not have flouride and does not leave a bad aftertaste</li>
            <li> bought this for my 2 year old and she hated the flavor.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes using cruelty free products so easy.</li>
            <li> Bought it because it is flouride free.  There is no discernible difference without the flouride.  Good product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Love it not too thick so you have an effective but not too long brushing session. Just make sure you use an inch long each time as the directions says</li>
            <li> So many of the natural toothpastes out there just don&#x27;t make the grade for me. It is important in our family to use a fluoride-free toothpaste, but there are limited options out there. We love that this is not gritty like many of the other brands out there, and it has a great taste as well. The only thing keeping it from a five-star rating would be an even stronger mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I grew up using crest, but now i want something without fluoride.. This tastes good. i will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is worth the extra price!! Love the non chemicals as no SRS or Fluoride!! Though, what makes this paste the best is it leaves your mouth SO, SO, clean, and the taste does not stick with you for hours! Its weird how regular chemical toothpaste does not compare to the clean, fresh feeling at each brush! I will be buying it again, and again!!!</li>
            <li> I search far and wide for ethical brands that aren&#x27;t distributed by P&amp;G.  Some natural brands taste terrible.  But Kiss My Face toothpaste tastes great.  Refreshing, but not sugary.  Love it.  I&#x27;ve been a brand loyal customer since 2005.</li>
            <li> Taste is good. Not abrasive to gums. Tea tree oil good for healing in case you brush your teeth too briskly. It does the job.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 2 year old and she hated the flavor. the peppermint was so strong that we fought her tooth and nail to use it then finally gave up. not a good flavor for the little kids.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about getting it. Now ive been using it for a month I like it a lot. It tastes good, doesnt leave a wierd aftertaste and it leaves your teeth feeling super clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This was a knock-off. I have bought this brand many times and I knew something was off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;First, the packaging was crushed. Then, when I opened it and examined the tube the labeling was peeling off and was printed off-center. Finally, and most troubling, there was no seal on the tube like there typically would be.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, please look after what you sell. Doing business this way undermines consumer confidence and this level of neglect is a safety issue.</li>
            <li> cleans well... normal toothpaste... i guess its for people who have sensitive gums but i find no difference between this and other brands...  took 1 star off for pricing</li>
            <li> I typically brush my teeth for about two minutes using a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste and medium-bristle toothbrush.  Given that this toothpaste does not easily foam and that an inch of paste must be used in order to feel any lather at all, a longer brushing time was required.  And it is necessary to brush more vigorously, to ensure that whatever plaque that has settled in the gumlines is thoroughly removed (I assume that also has to do with the diminished foam levels.)  It must also be said that the effectiveness of this toothpaste is tightly correlated to the newness of the toothbrush being used.  As the bristles lose their firmness, it becomes more difficult to generate the already-elusive foam and evenly distribute this foam into the crevices around teeth.  Normal toothpastes that do not share this weak-foam issue greatly cut down the work of the toothbrush, thereby decreasing the problem of weakening bristles. Unfortunately, this toothpaste Relies on the toothbrush to do a greater portion of its own work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, that is not to say that using this toothpaste warrants inconvenience.  Its ingredients (when fully released) are just as effective as those found in its regular counterparts, but are far less harsh to the enamel and mucous lining of the mouth.  I did not experience any of the &amp;#34;burn-a-hole-through-your-tongue&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dry-up-my-saliva-glands&amp;#34; sensations delivered by normal toothpastes.  And the minty taste is very pleasant and not at all overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ironic caveat to this paste is that because a substantial amount must be used for each brushing, the entire tube goes pretty quickly.  In that sense, this toothpaste is neither economical nor truly practical for consumers with large households.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste to have no fluoride. This was the main reason I bought this stuff. Fluoride may be great for your teeth, but is absolutely awful for everything else in your body, especially your brain... And I&#x27;m dumb enough</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is ok if you have no other toothpaste in the house to use but it is inferior to Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Arm &amp; Hammer, etc.  It tastes ok and seems to clean ok but the problem is that it disappears as soon as water hits it.  If you pre-wet your toothbrush and then put it in your mouth it dissolves almost immediately, so you have to use more.  I am used to only applying toothpaste to my brush once per toothbrushing session.  This disappears so you have to apply more to your brush or else use double or triple the first time. This is not economical at all and takes more time.  Will not be buying again!</li>
            <li> Not bad. The taste is not as intense as other mainstream branded toothpaste. My teeth feels clean without the strong taste.  This might have a weird taste and it does not sud like other toothpastes when you use it and compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li> Good flavor, whitening is (mildly) effective, and unlike many natural/organic toothpastes, you can actually get this one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Now that Tom&#x27;s has sold out and includes fluoride, I had a hard time finding a toothpaste that did not include fluoride. I tried this and although it is a bit pricey for the quantity, it cleans well, seems to control tartar well, tastes very good and is everything I want my new toothpaste to be.</li>
            <li> I am not well enough informed to know why people might not want to be exposed to fluouride.  Aside from this and the cruelty of animal testing, most toothpastes seem the same to me, Although this toothpaste is somewhat expensive, comparatively speaking, it&#x27;s worth it to me to abstain from buying toothpaste that senselessly requires the subjugation and torture of animals.</li>
            <li> Kids seem to like it.</li>
            <li> Love this! My mouth feels so clean, love the taste( better than all the other toxin free I&#x27;ve tried) and no toxic chemicals or fluoride!</li>
            <li> No fluoride! Decent taste. Great if its on sale. Otherwise I stick with Toms.</li>
            <li> great paste gentle on erroded gums</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this toothpaste. Didn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing. I saw this brand at Kroger in the organic section together with Tom of Maine (which I use for quite a long time). I bought it on Amazon because of the price, but turned out Tom of Maine is better than Kiss My Face in my opinion.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!! I RE ORDERED AGAIN!! IS AMAZING MINT REFRESHING FOR A LONG TIME AND ELIMINATES BAD BREATH FOR LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I love this especially knowing I am not putting a toxic substance in my body.  It gets my teeth really clean&lt;br /&gt;and keeps my mouth fresh. Love it!</li>
            <li> My toddler loved it and it was a good alternative to the other brands. affordable and taste ok. gives her something she can try</li>
            <li> all natural toothpaste and it does not have flouride and does not leave a bad aftertaste</li>
            <li> Leaves mouth feeling fresh, and clean.</li>
