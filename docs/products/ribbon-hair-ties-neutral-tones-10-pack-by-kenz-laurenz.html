            <li>Great price when you consider these as a disposable product.</li>
            <li>The knot at the end isn&#x27;t attractive.</li>
            <li>I think we can all agree that people need to stop writing reviews after using a product once and telling everyone how great and durable it is.</li>

            <li>I love the selection, the fabric and the fact that they do not rip hair out!</li>
            <li>The kind with the metal fastener always either breaks my hair or it breaks itself where the elastic meets the metal.</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY LIKED THEM</li>

            <li>Very comfortable,  doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and holds well.</li>
            <li>look much better in the photo.</li>
            <li>Price was excellent compared to the set of 3 I purchased for $12.00 at a local retailer</li>
            <li>They make pony tails look more dressy.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I need it out of my face and most hair ties pull and break my hair.</li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>Okay-</li>
            <li>I love these ribbon hair ties because they dont leave a crease and break my hair when I use them.</li>
            <li>I have found a pretty good hair tie in these ribbon hair ties.</li>
            <li>Work fine and colors are ok</li>
            <li>These ties are very nice Very hair friendly.</li>
            <li>They look cool on the wrist too!  </li>
            <li>Bought 10 packs of these to give as small Christmas gifts, great quality and every woman I gifted them too loved the colors.</li>
            <li>These are much more gentle on your hair and also greatly reduce/eliminate the &amp;#34;kink&amp;#34; you get from classic style hair ties.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless they work fine.  </li>
            <li>They are ultra comfortable</li>
            <li>Great value, second time I have bought them</li>
            <li>The material is very nice and these don&#x27;t cause any discomfort when leaning back on a pillow or car headrest.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>- I ordered another one with brighter colors and don&#x27;t love those as much.  </li>
            <li>- it is MUCH easier on the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull as many out  -</li>
            <li>I tried the cool silicone ones and they just ripped my hair.</li>
            <li>I love them, soft on my hair, easy to use.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE PRETTY, EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>Great selection of the basic colors and the quality was better than expected.</li>
            <li>Not the size I expected, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li>I gave the second star because they are kind of cute, even though it&#x27;s hard to pay so much more for a product that works like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Its pretty nice, very simple and well done product.</li>
            <li>They are colorful, look pretty, and don&#x27;t leave a crease in my hair.</li>
            <li>This item came super fast and was exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of these hair ties (they really don&#x27;t leave a crease!)</li>
            <li>They seem more appropriate for a small child which was not mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty, neutral palette.</li>
            <li>The quality is just ok, they look much thicker/wider than they actually are.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and the ends always get tangled in most hair ties.</li>
            <li>Great hair ties--and half the price of the same thing elsewhere!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>These are just as good as any other I have tried and are cheaper than the last brand I used.  </li>
            <li>I would not switch exclusively over to these -- you still can&#x27;t beat the pricing if traditional rubber bands, and these would not hold your hair up during strenuous activity like running -- however, these are great hair ties for normal, everyday use.</li>
            <li>This causes the problem of finding a hair tie that will actually stay in and go around three times without breaking, becoming super stretched out, or just failing to keep a pony tail up.</li>
            <li>I fall into a particular category of hair.</li>
            <li>LIGHT - MORE FOR THICKER HAIR, MY HAIR IS THIN</li>
            <li>This one is not sure firm-secure as the elastic you find in cvs etc but is good enought if you not going to be doing some hard sport etc better for your hair.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They are cute for little girls.  </li>
            <li>I like the fun to have different colors to choose and the look and feeling that it brings.</li>
            <li>I received a pack of these for a gift, and after losing a few here and there decided to get more.  </li>
            <li>I think these are my new go-to brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I live in the Southwest.  </li>
            <li>I got this ten pack after seeing a four pack at Loft for almost twice the price of these and they&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These hair ties have a bit of a silky texture and it does not always stay in at the bottom of braids as well as some of the other more basic hair ties do.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really hold my hair any better or worse than your average scuncii, but, other people simply loved them.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>A lot less stress on my hair and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Since these are billed as &amp;#34;no crease hair ties&amp;#34; it is hard to give more than one star because they leave a crease in my hair.  </li>
            <li>These are soft and hold my hair well.  </li>
            <li>First, there is no painful pulling that is often common with hair ties.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used the thick covered elastics and while they&#x27;re not bad, I like these so much better.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have a rubber band around your wrist nearly 24/7, you&#x27;ll prefer the look of these vs a traditional rubber band&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I kind of feel silly for spending the money on something that I probably could have made myself.</li>
            <li>I typically purchase standard Goody rubber bands for my hair which work fine, except for my constantly having to replace them due to stretching out, hair getting caught around them, losing them, etc.</li>

            <li> I would send them back, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble or shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Although the drugstore ones were much cheaper, they were pretty much worthless</li>
            <li> These are extremely overpriced.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re still using conventional hair ties its time to upgrade.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I feel like they keep me from popping my hair out, but at the same time, they are way overpriced.</li>
            <li> Pretty, neutral colors, perfect for the office.  Some of them are stretchier than others from the same pack, but it&#x27;s not a significant issue.</li>
            <li> Great price when you consider these as a disposable product. They stretch out very easily.</li>
            <li> good quality. Would buy again and recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was really cute, too!</li>
            <li> gift for the wife. she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking I was buying hair ribbons. If I knew they were these flimsy hairties I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. They&#x27;re way too overpriced and They&#x27;re so tiny. look much better in the photo. The knot at the end isn&#x27;t attractive. It looks like something I made myself. $6...smh.</li>
            <li> These head ties were not at all what I expected. I wanted a headband that would pull my head back, like any elastic band. These a small and they&#x27;re hair ties. To make ponytails, and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of $$</li>
            <li> These are supposed to not leave a mark in your hair.  They do leave a mark in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair ties--and half the price of the same thing elsewhere! I got this ten pack after seeing a four pack at Loft for almost twice the price of these and they&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>

            <li> They are as described and seen.  The material is very nice and these don&#x27;t cause any discomfort when leaning back on a pillow or car headrest. I will order other colors in the future.</li>
            <li> I previously used a different brand that I found on Amazon (EmiJay?..something like that).  I also tried to buy some at the drugstore.  Although the drugstore ones were much cheaper, they were pretty much worthless so I figured I was stuck buying the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to replenish my stock and I was browsing on Amazon and decided to give these a try.  These are just as good as any other I have tried and are cheaper than the last brand I used.  I think these are my new go-to brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still using conventional hair ties its time to upgrade.  These are much more gentle on your hair and also greatly reduce/eliminate the &amp;#34;kink&amp;#34; you get from classic style hair ties.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are perfect for fine hair. I have to twist them three to four times for a pony tail and don&#x27;t have to deal with the discomfort and traces conventional hair ties give me. No headaches, no creases in the hair!</li>
            <li> Well made, good quality. Don&#x27;t catch your hair like some elastics does even those with no metals, that glue part which stickers the elastic together sometimes catches on my hair and hurts! Sometimes pulls off-breaking my hair. This one is not sure firm-secure as the elastic you find in cvs etc but is good enought if you not going to be doing some hard sport etc better for your hair. I like the fun to have different colors to choose and the look and feeling that it brings. Its pretty nice, very simple and well done product. havent seen anything like that on the market yet. I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I received a pack of these for a gift, and after losing a few here and there decided to get more.  I like the colors in this packet - I ordered another one with brighter colors and don&#x27;t love those as much.  I like this type of hair tie - it is MUCH easier on the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull as many out  - In the past I&#x27;ve used the thick covered elastics and while they&#x27;re not bad, I like these so much better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these rubberbands to anyone.  They are the best rubberbands I have ever owned.  I want to buy more!  I can&#x27;t even feel them in my hair.  I sleep with my hair in a pony tail everynight and never feel the rubberband.  I love these rubberbands!  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> They are colorful, look pretty, and don&#x27;t leave a crease in my hair. They make pony tails look more dressy. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I fall into a particular category of hair. it is super thick, long, curly, and there is a lot of it. This causes the problem of finding a hair tie that will actually stay in and go around three times without breaking, becoming super stretched out, or just failing to keep a pony tail up. I know I am not alone in the search for a hair tie that actually works. For years I have searched. The kind with the metal fastener always either breaks my hair or it breaks itself where the elastic meets the metal. I tried the cool silicone ones and they just ripped my hair. The ones that have no fastener always stretch or just break when trying to  make that elusive third time around the pony tail for ultimate hold. I have found a pretty good hair tie in these ribbon hair ties. I waited for a couple of months before writing this review. I think we can all agree that people need to stop writing reviews after using a product once and telling everyone how great and durable it is. So now that I have been using the same tie for two months, here is my opinion. First, there is no painful pulling that is often common with hair ties. It has stretched out a bit, but it still works well and I can get it around a third time. The color has faded a bit, but that in no way effects performance of the hair tie. The only issue I have had is when I try to use these hairs ties at the bottom of a braid. These hair ties have a bit of a silky texture and it does not always stay in at the bottom of braids as well as some of the other more basic hair ties do. I still say these are the best hair ties I have used  yet and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I thought I wa getting a package of all black hair ties but I was mistaken, I guess. Nonetheless they work fine.  A lot less stress on my hair and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These ties are very nice Very hair friendly. They are extremely easy to use and i will be getting a lot more!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. I love them, soft on my hair, easy to use. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Still wear these after a year.  Love them. since they are versatile.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  They need to be tied an extra loop around to keep from slipping.  I have had less than a month and two are already stretched out.</li>
            <li> Work fine and colors are ok</li>
            <li> Since these are billed as &amp;#34;no crease hair ties&amp;#34; it is hard to give more than one star because they leave a crease in my hair.  I gave the second star because they are kind of cute, even though it&#x27;s hard to pay so much more for a product that works like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> LIGHT - MORE FOR THICKER HAIR, MY HAIR IS THIN AND IT TAKES 3 WRAPS WHICH MAKES IT A LITTLE TIGHT.  THEY ARE PRETTY, EASY TO USE AND I REALLY LIKED THEM</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and the ends always get tangled in most hair ties. These are easy on your hair, no knots, awesome!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable,  doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and holds well.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase standard Goody rubber bands for my hair which work fine, except for my constantly having to replace them due to stretching out, hair getting caught around them, losing them, etc. I like these ribbon hair ties for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- They don&#x27;t seem to have issues stretching out or collecting hair that is impossible to remove (not yet, at least)&lt;br /&gt;- They are ultra comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- The neutral tones in this pack all look great&lt;br /&gt;- If you are like me and have a rubber band around your wrist nearly 24/7, you&#x27;ll prefer the look of these vs a traditional rubber band&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I would not switch exclusively over to these -- you still can&#x27;t beat the pricing if traditional rubber bands, and these would not hold your hair up during strenuous activity like running -- however, these are great hair ties for normal, everyday use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking... These are extremely overpriced. $6.00 for these flemsy ponytail holders? Should be 99 cents. The quality is just ok, they look much thicker/wider than they actually are. I would send them back, but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble or shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair. Fine, delicate, limp. I need it out of my face and most hair ties pull and break my hair. Not these! They stay put and don&#x27;t pull or hurt my hair. I want more.</li>
            <li> These were terrific and 1/3 the price of Anthropology for same product.  Great find.  I wear these constantly and have shared with friends.</li>
            <li> Okay- they are a bit pricey but I do love them! I have thick curly hair and I live in the Southwest.  I need to put my hair up for sleeping and these are the best.  They do not pull on your hair and leave no mark in your hair when you take them off! Watch out- the cats love them and they will disappear!</li>
            <li> I love these ribbon hair ties because they dont leave a crease and break my hair when I use them.</li>
            <li> They are cute for little girls.  I thought they were much bigger.  It should state that in the title.  I gave them to my grandbabies.</li>
            <li> These are soft and hold my hair well.  They look cool on the wrist too!  Pretty, neutral palette. Will order more!</li>
            <li> This item came super fast and was exactly as I had hoped. The size is perfect and consistent.  Colors are nice and they do not pull my hair.  I plan to add beads to these ties as a craft project with a bunch of girls.</li>
            <li> Bought 10 packs of these to give as small Christmas gifts, great quality and every woman I gifted them too loved the colors.</li>
            <li> Not the size I expected, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> I love the selection, the fabric and the fact that they do not rip hair out! I like wearing them on wrist too, they don&#x27;t dig into my arm.</li>
            <li> Assorted color hair ties in neutral colors - nice and stretchy!</li>
            <li> Great value, second time I have bought them</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really hold my hair any better or worse than your average scuncii, but, other people simply loved them.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be disappointed if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle hair band and they don&#x27;t turn out to be the ones for you.</li>
