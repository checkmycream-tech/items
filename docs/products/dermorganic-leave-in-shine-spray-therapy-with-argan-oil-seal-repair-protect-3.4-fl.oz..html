            <li>bought this because of the reviews - certainly their experience was not mine.  </li>
            <li>I use after blow drying, on wet hair that will air-dry, and to refresh hair if going out at night (very lightly).</li>

            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and other hair products from this line.</li>
            <li>My hair is aging, coarse, dry, processed, and I style it most days.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ooh là là!  Nice shiny hair, organic, cruelty-free(CF)!  Great stuff! Found on Leaping Bunny founder&#x27;s list of Top Ten CF products fall 2014.</li>
            <li> Love the whole line. Rinse out the shampoo and conditioner well and you will have feel good hair.&lt;br /&gt;(white chick, mid 30s, A LOT  of thin hairs)</li>
            <li> Its OK. Nothing special! Can get really greasy if you use too much!</li>
            <li> I have been buying and using this product for years and it makes my hair behave and shine.  Not easy for naturally curly hair.  It just makes me feel prettier.  Great quality and consistently good.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.   I have coarse, thick, somewhat dry long hair and always struggle with it, especially on humid days.    This product is easy to apply, and leaves my hair soft, very shiny and manageable.   I am already ordering another bottle, so I don&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Im sorry to say but this leave-in-shine therapy  means nothing !leave in YES, but shine ? No !!!It actually made my hair very dry instead.</li>
            <li> This product does not produce shine.  With the smllest spritz, it leaves my hair dirty and greasy looking.  It also smells like some kind of automovive engine grease. I would like to give it ZERO stars.  i am angry that this product catagory is not returnable. it and the supposed Firm Hold Foam i reviewed are a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Small amount leaves my hair shiny and soft. Learned about Dermorganic Shine Therapy when my hair stylist said she would use an argan oil finishing spray. I thought it would make my hair oily. It did not. If you&#x27;re concerned, I suggest starting with just 1 pump to judge how much you need. I use 2 pumps for thick, shoulder-length hair. Spray in palm of hand, rub palms together, and distribute through hair. I use after blow drying, on wet hair that will air-dry, and to refresh hair if going out at night (very lightly). Any argon oil left on my hands I massage onto my hands. Hope it works for you, too. If so, try the Dermorganic conditioning shampoo and the Masque intensive hair repair (conditioner). I use all three and am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I love all the Dermorganic products. This shine sprays leaves your hair soft and silky without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this, the positive reviews are in alignment with my views.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever smelled and felt so good for so long.  Visititing my Grandmother I dident bring my new miracle coconut oil... that I replased my conditioner with, she handed me this stuff and I have no ac, so I constantly roll my hair up and spray it down running errands. . I havent had to worry I know I smell great and look great all day no fuss. As a single mom 1 less problem.</li>
            <li> Love this product and other hair products from this line. Perfect for before blow dry or after hair wash on wet hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this and I immediately came home and ordered it. My hair was silky, not oily, and shiny. Honestly, my hair has never looked or felt so nice. I would and do recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Leave-In Shine Therapy. Good stuff...great complement to the other Dermorganic hair products like Leave-In Treatment and Masque.</li>
            <li> My hair finally has some shine to it, cants wait to try the shampoo. it sucks that they tell you how many words you must use.</li>
            <li> this product works great for pre blow-drying and for flat iron use.  I love how great it works at protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to dry out quickly.  This product hydrates nicely with a light sheen.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair strong and soft</li>
            <li> DermOrganic is just their name brand, the product is not actually organic. That being said, I do like it. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair &amp; it smells like cherries! Made in the USA. Ingredients are: Cyclopentasiloxane,  Dimethicone, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Panthenol B5,  Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Glycereth-2 Cocoate/ Benzoic Acid, Parfum/ Fragrance. Vegan, No Animal Testing, No Artificial Preservatives, Paraben-Free,  Propylene Glycol-Free, Sulfate-Free, Gluten-Free, No Sodium Chloride, Salt, MEA, DEA or Dyes.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description more closely before purchasing. I love argan oil and use it on my skin and hair. This product though, has so many other ingredients that it is not recognizable as argan oil at all. And it smells terribly artificial.</li>
            <li> Got for my daughters hair (long and curly) and I used it more. Smells amazing and makes your hair very silky.</li>
            <li> works great to reduce hair drying time- I buy regularly and can also find at TJ Maxx at a reduced price</li>
            <li> This works great! I use it in my little girl&#x27;s fine hair to remove tangles every day. It does not leave any oily residue. It makes her hair shiny, smooth and it is finally starting to grow longer. It smells great. It is the best hair product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Nice aroma, goes into hair, smooths, frizz gone! Use very little so it lasts a long time, economical and easy to take on trips.</li>
            <li> nice product, I have to use in moderation or it leaves by hair looking greesy but overall I like the smell and feel of my hair when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Works good, just use lightly</li>
            <li> smells great, easy to apply, makes my hair soft and shiny works good with other dermorganic products. I will buy more</li>
            <li> This leaves our hair VERY greasy looking.  I have figured out that if i spray a little on my hand and put it on hair ends manually, it doesnt look greasy.</li>
            <li> First became acquainted with Leave-in shine Therapy shiny when my hairdresser used a small amount on my dry split ends.  Voila! smooth, hair without a heavy greasy feel.  This product miraculously turns a bad hair day into a good hair day with a simple spray.  A little goes a long way so use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Dermorganic Shampoo and Masque Conditioner to keep my color-treated hair softer than it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, hair products I can really get excited about!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky!!!! I swear by the stuff.</li>
            <li> Very light even on my thin hair, but leaves a nice conditioned feel after blow drying without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> ...that was not my experience.  If you want an oil for your hair use the more economical and effective Macadamia Oil from Organix.  My absolute favorite is Macadamia Healing Oil Treatment.  It can&#x27;t be beat, takes just a little, and smells like heaven on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Macadamia-Oil-Healing-Treatment-ounces/dp/B002WTC37U/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362344488&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;macadamia+healing+oil+treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because of the reviews - certainly their experience was not mine.  My hair is aging, coarse, dry, processed, and I style it most days.  Check out the Macadamia Oil products - ESPECIALLY &amp;#34;Flawless&amp;#34;, and the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi styling products.  These are products which work well for hair such as mine... unless your style requires crunchiness and wildness.  I like mine to be touchable... that&#x27;s sexy.  :-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have bought bottle after bottle of this. It smells nice, makes my hair soft and helps it dry quick</li>
            <li> Good detangler and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the same as the Leave-in Treatment but in a more convenient dispenser. It isn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as soft. Meh. I will give it to my niece who has lots and lots of thick curls. For straight hair, probably not ideal -- get the Dermorganic Leave-in Treatment instead.</li>
            <li> This product meets my needs so well ! I find it works with heat styling and also lightly spritzed on my hands to smooth flyaways or any frizz...</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW MUCH YOU SPRAY ON, ALL OIL IT SEEMS.  LEAVES A NICE SHINE TO THE HAIR AND MAKES IT EASIER TO CONTROL THE FLY AWAYS OR FRIZZ</li>
    </ol>
