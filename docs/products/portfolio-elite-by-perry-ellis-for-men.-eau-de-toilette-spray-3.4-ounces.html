            <li>,GOOD FRAGANCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE</li>
            <li>My husband has tried other Perry Ellis colognes that have a very good scent ,but when I got him this one he said he didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I like the aroma of this perfume, specially cause</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic smell that I love too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to apply sparsely, and lasts throughout most of the day.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle last September from this Vendor PerfumesWorld, but didn&#x27;t open it since I figured it&#x27;s a reputable source and has good reviews.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells fresh and clean and very afordable for Perry Elli</li>
            <li>Well, they couldn&#x27;t have been nastier, saying it had to be authentic, and they wouldn&#x27;t swap it out if I sent it back.  </li>
            <li>Light and masculine.  </li>
            <li>The frangrance is pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real product, not a fake (shipped by Amazon).</li>

            <li>I prefer it more than any other brand and have always received compliments for the same.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the smell, but it definitely gets you a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>Shipping was amazingly fast, we got it next day after ordering.</li>
            <li>I used this perfume for years, talk of fragrances is a matter of taste, not all people become familiarized with the different types of these, but in my opinion this scent is very masculine and sober ...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My husband loves the crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real product, not a fake (shipped by Amazon). It&#x27;s way cheaper than you&#x27;ll find at the mall or in stores. I can&#x27;t really describe the smell, but it definitely gets you a lot of compliments. It&#x27;s strong enough to apply sparsely, and lasts throughout most of the day. This is now my second time buying this (as a gift this time).</li>
            <li> My husband has tried other Perry Ellis colognes that have a very good scent ,but when I got him this one he said he didn&#x27;t like it at all. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> smells really good, spicy kind of smell like cinnamon. i like it the aroma is moderate and not on your face. i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologn, he will not wear anything else. The scent smells fresh and clean and very afordable for Perry Elli</li>
            <li> PERFECT PRODUCT I RECOMENDED FOR EVERYBODY,GOOD FRAGANCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE I WILL GIVE TO MY FOR HOLIDAYS I LIKE A LOTS</li>

            <li> I have been using the same scent since it came out in 2001 or so - Perry Ellis Portfolio Elite.  I like it so much I usually keep a spare bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.  I bought a bottle last September from this Vendor PerfumesWorld, but didn&#x27;t open it since I figured it&#x27;s a reputable source and has good reviews.  Well, I just opened the box - this stuff smells like krap.  I knew I didn&#x27;t have a leg to stand on, but I contacted this vendor to let them know that I think they had counterfeit supply.  Well, they couldn&#x27;t have been nastier, saying it had to be authentic, and they wouldn&#x27;t swap it out if I sent it back.  They didn&#x27;t even offer a discount on another bottle, or even free shipping.  I&#x27;ve used numerous bottles of this stuff from other sources and I know what it smells like.  I just didn&#x27;t like their attitude, as if I was crazy. Not even saying that maybe the supplier had put the wrong fragrance in the bottle (this same shape bottle comes in several colors and scents), or even sorry that I was disappointed.  Arrogant.  Last order they get from me.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome</li>
            <li> PE is the best scent I have experienced in a long time.  Light and masculine.  This is my new scent, no kidding!</li>
            <li> I prefer it more than any other brand and have always received compliments for the same. Just love it. The frangrance is pleasant and long lasting. Price is great!</li>
            <li> Smells great and it works all day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great and I get compliments from friends and strangers about it all the time.</li>
            <li> One of the best EDT I ever had. It smells really good and does last.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Cologne for over 6 years, maybe even longer. I love it. My girlfriend loves it. It is one of my two trademarks scents.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. Wont find a better price</li>
