            <li>I love this lotion</li>

            <li>I reviewed this product for I love to review.</li>
            <li>This one works better than the drug store products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I and my wife absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>even more excited to do so for nothing more than my honest opinion/review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This body butter has a hint of sweet almond oil scent which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>that the top is very secure so it can be thrown into a purse or a book bag for easy travel without the fear of opening and ruining everything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how creamy and rich this butter is!</li>
            <li>I did order mine through a  special deal to try it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I will attest that this is a lotion that I will keep purchasing, because it really makes my skin feel radiant and amazing!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazingly moisturizing, super rich and creamy!</li>
            <li>but it spreads nicely and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>blend of oils and other mostly botanical ingredients provides excellent protection against loss of moisture</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of it and how smooth her skin feels after she uses it.</li>
            <li>I use this along with the Nourishing Souffle for great, soft skin.</li>
            <li>And I love that, like all OZ Naturals products, it is cruelty free and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>One of the great things that always gets me is that oz naturals is just that, natural products that&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I also love OZ Naturals because they are 100% vegan and cruelty free.    </li>
            <li>We both love the smell of the butter and how it makes our skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this product complimentary  to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>This body cream has a light pleasant lotion-y smell in the tube that isnâ€™t an overpowering fragrance that once rubbed into the skin really isnâ€</li>
            <li>I love how smooth everything became so quickly!</li>
            <li>Awesome product as well as all their other products.</li>
            <li>Why eat a clean healthy diet and then slather yourself in chemicals and toxins?</li>
            <li>I like that it does not have a strong scent to it.</li>
            <li>this OZ Naturals Body Butter has been amazing, soothing and giving my skin relief from the super-dry hot air.</li>
            <li>I am switching brands from a high end line (natural) to OZ Naturals and decided to give their body butter a test run - it is perfect!!</li>
            <li>It works incredibly well even with my excessively dry skin.</li>
            <li>First, the tube is HUGE - that is a good thing but don&#x27;t expect to be able to put this in your purse unless you are carrying a large bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Its also rich but not so rick that it&#x27;s at all greasy or doesn&#x27;t rub into my skin easily.</li>
            <li>The product itself is really nice; a bit too greasy for my hands (which don’t tend to get as dry as other parts), but was perfect for my elbows and legs, and AMAZING for my feet.</li>
            <li>Overall it smells great and feels smooth when it&#x27;s rubbed on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, non greasy and has no scent.  </li>
            <li>I am reviewing this product that I got for free to review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is scent free</li>
            <li>The body butter is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I use this at night before I go to sleep and wake up with perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Another great body and facial moisturizer by OZ Naturals.  </li>
            <li>It has fantastic skin healing ingredients.</li>
            <li>This item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This body butter has a light nutty scent and is heavenly on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is quite creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li>Wish it  had a light scent</li>
            <li>The tube is pretty large and a good value.</li>
            <li>super easy .This is a brand you can buy with confidence.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and is quickly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that is not greasy at all and no harsh smells and goes into the skin</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to moisturize just fine, but it would be nice to leave the natural fragrances.</li>
            <li>My skin was super smooth.</li>
            <li>This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It also has good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; - so it spread on our hands easily and absorbed quickly with no greasy film left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>and although I really like them both this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I put it on one day and my skin still looks good the next day.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, love it.</li>
            <li>(it seemed to be about 85-90% full, IMO).</li>
            <li>The body butter contains sweet almond oil and macadamia nut.</li>
            <li>While I did get this at discount for my review, I have to say that the sweet almond &amp; macadamia nut, along with shea butter.</li>
            <li>it  truly is very hydrating my skin looks and feels so much better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: Organic herbal infusion, palm oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that it doesn’t have a strong smell (which I prefer, so as not to clash with any perfume I may be wearing).</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and not overpowering which I can really appreciate.</li>
            <li>super absorption-non sticky-non fragrant-does not feel sticky on the skin</li>
            <li>It could also use a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a white lotion has a nice smooth and creamy texture</li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>And I also love that they don&#x27;t test on animals and everything is natural!!</li>
            <li>Given that dry skin needs water, I don&#x27;t mind that this is the first ingredient (followed by palm oil and sweet almond oil), but I would find more forthcoming to say &amp;#34;organic herbal-infused water.&amp;#34; (Also, what kind of water?</li>
            <li>I have an immense love for great lotions, and I am actually blown away by this formula.</li>
            <li>have the most sensitive and dry skin and this works amazingly!</li>
            <li>This lotion is huge first of all, great price for even better quality, because it goes on so velvety smooth and has a light fragrance of the ingredients, it absorbs into the skins fast but leaves behind moisturized, nourished skin that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>This body butter goes on easily and leaves my skin soft and smooth without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Smell could be better but stuff has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>By contrast, this product (applied twice, a few minutes apart) leave a non-greasy, nice, soft feeling that is more appropriate for day use, especially when I have business engagements or don&#x27;t want to smear cream on nice clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was fun and all, but my skin isnt agreeing with me.</li>
            <li>All products received are complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It also really worked great on my dry feet, thanks to all the sock-wearing this winter!</li>
            <li>The sweet almond &amp; macadamia nut body butter leaves the skin very soft with light to no scent.  </li>
            <li>So, after I developed a “love-at-first-use” relationship with another of OZ Naturals products, I was super excited to give their Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Nut body butter a try, and</li>
            <li>It does not have a smell to it which is good because it won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes or other scented body products.</li>
            <li>It soaks in right away with no greasy film over my skin.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time deciding which I liked better, the body butter or the lotion from OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance which is great because I don&#x27;t always want something that is heavy with smell if I am using it daily.</li>
            <li>As with all of the Oz Natural products I use this body cream because it is free of toxins and the majority of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li>I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  </li>
            <li>I really like tthe feel, scent and moisturizing of this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love all the oz naturals products that I&#x27;ve used, and this is no different.</li>
            <li>Just smells like &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; when you are putting it on but doesn&#x27;t leave a scent just smooth, soft, skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s not tested on animals and does exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>The body butter is a thicker more penetrating product than just a lotion and it instantly, deeply moisturizes your skin leaving it feeling extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You can really tell that it&#x27;s made with quality products!</li>
            <li>It is really moisturizing as well!</li>
            <li>All natural and Gluten free.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skins fast, but  has my skin feeling amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and feels luxurious, but without that oily feeling I&#x27;ve felt with other body butters and definitely not with the accompanying hefty price:) it has a pleasant, light scent and is absorbed into the skin rather quickly which I like.</li>
            <li>We use it every day and even more now that it is so dry here in Ohio.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil in particular is one of my favorites for the skin, because it is a liquid wax rather than a triglyceride and functions very similarly to the skin&#x27;s own natural sebum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would even certainly trust this&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>This is a large size container I posted a picture with my hand on the side for size reference .</li>
            <li>As a guy, my hands get dry and crack pretty easily but the softness stayed on my skin for quite some time after applying.  </li>
            <li>If you are putting it on your skin it is absorbing into your body.</li>
            <li>very well too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact this is vegan and cruelty free is a big deal for</li>
            <li>It is creamy and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this body butter.</li>
            <li>I really like them both</li>
            <li>The smell is very neutral</li>
            <li>It really keeps your skin moisturized without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The quantity of lotion is very generous.</li>
            <li>I really like this body butter.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t really have a sent</li>
            <li>I could really see a difference between my hands even after one use.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very silky feeling and hydrated looking.</li>
            <li>I can never get enough of this product, and I have been applying it all over especially after a warm bath.  </li>
            <li>I think that once you try a natural organic product you will not be able to stand the feel of any of the commercial creams.</li>
            <li>Another winner from this line of products as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!!</li>
            <li>all in one product for a rich deeply nourishing lotion.</li>
            <li>I applied this body butter right out of the shower and my skin felt so smooth and soft all day long!</li>
            <li>It does leave a slight residue that is hard to describe, but it feels great!</li>
            <li>It is very runny, and not a thick consistency that you would expect from a body butter.  </li>
            <li>After just the first use my boyfriend commented on how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it left my skin shiny, smooth and COMPLETELY moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not at its current price, since for the same money you can buy some top shelf lotions.  </li>
            <li>I am not big on a heavily perfumed type of lotion and this one was good in that respect.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone...........</li>
            <li>but I think I have decided that I like the body butter a little better.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy buildup or a weird shine- which is great because the shine attracts dust throughout the day and the greasy buildup leaves residue everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating, even in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s already asked me to buy a &#x27;few&#x27; more tubes</li>
            <li>This body butter is super moisturizing and leaves your skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>:-)) also seemed to last much longer than any other lotion I’ve tried.</li>
            <li>It was very rich and creamy going on, which always is a plus for someone with extra dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a light scent because sometimes I like to apply other perfumes</li>
            <li>I will update my review over longer term use if I have any new observations on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice, light cream for skin that is probably less dry, sun damaged, and aged than mine.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>So, they’ve all ended up being passed on to my Sister (who is much easier to please when it comes to such things), while I stay on a perpetual look-out for a good one (especially one that doesn’t come with a price tag that rivals the rent on a small apartment).</li>
            <li>My other shea-butter products leave a more lasting &amp;#34;deeply moisturized&amp;#34; feeling on my arms and chest.</li>
            <li>The benefits of use (soft skin!</li>
            <li>This body butter has a relatively neutral odor that is only slightly sweet and nutty.  </li>
            <li>My skin soaks it right up, but I&#x27;m left with no dry skin afterwards!</li>
            <li>(only about a dime size amount) will moisturized a fairly large area of my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using on my hands too and they have been feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>, this went on and left my hands non-greasy and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>His legs feel velvety soft.</li>
            <li>natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, just soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients and the fact that this company doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals.  </li>
            <li>Some may find this a negative, but I&#x27;m OK with it.  </li>
            <li>I have started to use this on my 9 month old baby.</li>
            <li>My skin feels instantly soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are al natural and being from Hawaii</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is not greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so incredibly soft and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>but then it wouldn&#x27;t be all natural</li>
            <li>I can put it on in the morning, and at the end of the day my skin is still soft..</li>
            <li>There is a faint and very pleasant scent, but the product is in no way perfumed and the scent isn&#x27;t present very long.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was living up north when I first bought this and had dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin pretty quickly, but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent of the Oz Naturals Body Butter is light and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I just love the texture and how thick this body cream is!</li>
            <li>I keep this by my desk and use it as a hand cream because it really moisturizes my dry skin to the max!</li>
            <li>It take a little while for it to get completely absorbed into the skin, but I expect that from a body butter.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin, especially on my legs, and my skin has been moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>The second thing I noticed was that it didn’t seem to be quite as full as the bottle would lead you to expect :-/</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion to anyone, especially those who live in dry climates, and those with dry skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had little luck in finding on the Oz Naturals website the precise meaning of the first ingredient, &amp;#34;organic herbal infusion.&amp;#34; A few other consumer websites conclude that the term refers to water in which herbs have been macerated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li>he has insanely sensitive skin, and gets dry scaly cheeks.</li>
            <li>I use this after his baths now, and it really seems to moisturize well and doesn&#x27;t mess with his skin issues.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to report on extensive use, but so far I like the product and believe that I would order it again.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly dry skin and finding a good lotion is always hard for me, especially this time of year when my skin is even drier than usual!</li>

            <li> even more excited to do so for nothing more than my honest opinion/review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This body butter has a hint of sweet almond oil scent which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li> that the top is very secure so it can be thrown into a purse or a book bag for easy travel without the fear of opening and ruining everything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how creamy and rich this butter is!</li>
            <li> I did order mine through a  special deal to try it and share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I will attest that this is a lotion that I will keep purchasing, because it really makes my skin feel radiant and amazing!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazingly moisturizing, super rich and creamy!</li>
            <li> but it spreads nicely and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> blend of oils and other mostly botanical ingredients provides excellent protection against loss of moisture</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of it and how smooth her skin feels after she uses it.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Nourishing Souffle for great, soft skin.</li>
            <li> And I love that, like all OZ Naturals products, it is cruelty free and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> One of the great things that always gets me is that oz naturals is just that, natural products that&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I also love OZ Naturals because they are 100% vegan and cruelty free.    </li>
            <li> We both love the smell of the butter and how it makes our skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary  to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This body cream has a light pleasant lotion-y smell in the tube that isnâ€™t an overpowering fragrance that once rubbed into the skin really isnâ€</li>
            <li> I love how smooth everything became so quickly!</li>
            <li> Awesome product as well as all their other products.</li>
            <li> Why eat a clean healthy diet and then slather yourself in chemicals and toxins?</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a strong scent to it.</li>
            <li> this OZ Naturals Body Butter has been amazing, soothing and giving my skin relief from the super-dry hot air.</li>
            <li> I am switching brands from a high end line (natural) to OZ Naturals and decided to give their body butter a test run - it is perfect!!</li>
            <li> It works incredibly well even with my excessively dry skin.</li>
            <li> First, the tube is HUGE - that is a good thing but don&#x27;t expect to be able to put this in your purse unless you are carrying a large bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Its also rich but not so rick that it&#x27;s at all greasy or doesn&#x27;t rub into my skin easily.</li>
            <li> The product itself is really nice; a bit too greasy for my hands (which don’t tend to get as dry as other parts), but was perfect for my elbows and legs, and AMAZING for my feet.</li>
            <li> Overall it smells great and feels smooth when it&#x27;s rubbed on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, non greasy and has no scent.  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product that I got for free to review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is scent free</li>
            <li> The body butter is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this at night before I go to sleep and wake up with perfectly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Another great body and facial moisturizer by OZ Naturals.  </li>
            <li> It has fantastic skin healing ingredients.</li>
            <li> This item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This body butter has a light nutty scent and is heavenly on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is quite creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li> Wish it  had a light scent</li>
            <li> The tube is pretty large and a good value.</li>
            <li> super easy .This is a brand you can buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and is quickly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that is not greasy at all and no harsh smells and goes into the skin</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to moisturize just fine, but it would be nice to leave the natural fragrances.</li>
            <li> My skin was super smooth.</li>
            <li> This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It also has good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; - so it spread on our hands easily and absorbed quickly with no greasy film left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> and although I really like them both this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I put it on one day and my skin still looks good the next day.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, love it.</li>
            <li> (it seemed to be about 85-90% full, IMO).</li>
            <li> The body butter contains sweet almond oil and macadamia nut.</li>
            <li> While I did get this at discount for my review, I have to say that the sweet almond &amp; macadamia nut, along with shea butter.</li>
            <li> it  truly is very hydrating my skin looks and feels so much better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: Organic herbal infusion, palm oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that it doesn’t have a strong smell (which I prefer, so as not to clash with any perfume I may be wearing).</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and not overpowering which I can really appreciate.</li>
            <li> super absorption-non sticky-non fragrant-does not feel sticky on the skin</li>
            <li> It could also use a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a white lotion has a nice smooth and creamy texture</li>
            <li> The cream is not greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> And I also love that they don&#x27;t test on animals and everything is natural!!</li>
            <li> Given that dry skin needs water, I don&#x27;t mind that this is the first ingredient (followed by palm oil and sweet almond oil), but I would find more forthcoming to say &amp;#34;organic herbal-infused water.&amp;#34; (Also, what kind of water?</li>
            <li> I have an immense love for great lotions, and I am actually blown away by this formula.</li>
            <li> have the most sensitive and dry skin and this works amazingly!</li>
            <li> This lotion is huge first of all, great price for even better quality, because it goes on so velvety smooth and has a light fragrance of the ingredients, it absorbs into the skins fast but leaves behind moisturized, nourished skin that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> This body butter goes on easily and leaves my skin soft and smooth without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Smell could be better but stuff has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> By contrast, this product (applied twice, a few minutes apart) leave a non-greasy, nice, soft feeling that is more appropriate for day use, especially when I have business engagements or don&#x27;t want to smear cream on nice clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was fun and all, but my skin isnt agreeing with me.</li>
            <li> All products received are complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It also really worked great on my dry feet, thanks to all the sock-wearing this winter!</li>
            <li> The sweet almond &amp; macadamia nut body butter leaves the skin very soft with light to no scent.  </li>
            <li> So, after I developed a “love-at-first-use” relationship with another of OZ Naturals products, I was super excited to give their Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Nut body butter a try, and</li>
            <li> It does not have a smell to it which is good because it won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes or other scented body products.</li>
            <li> It soaks in right away with no greasy film over my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time deciding which I liked better, the body butter or the lotion from OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance which is great because I don&#x27;t always want something that is heavy with smell if I am using it daily.</li>
            <li> As with all of the Oz Natural products I use this body cream because it is free of toxins and the majority of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  </li>
            <li> I really like tthe feel, scent and moisturizing of this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love all the oz naturals products that I&#x27;ve used, and this is no different.</li>
            <li> Just smells like &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; when you are putting it on but doesn&#x27;t leave a scent just smooth, soft, skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s not tested on animals and does exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> The body butter is a thicker more penetrating product than just a lotion and it instantly, deeply moisturizes your skin leaving it feeling extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You can really tell that it&#x27;s made with quality products!</li>
            <li> It is really moisturizing as well!</li>
            <li> All natural and Gluten free.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skins fast, but  has my skin feeling amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and feels luxurious, but without that oily feeling I&#x27;ve felt with other body butters and definitely not with the accompanying hefty price:) it has a pleasant, light scent and is absorbed into the skin rather quickly which I like.</li>
            <li> We use it every day and even more now that it is so dry here in Ohio.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jojoba oil in particular is one of my favorites for the skin, because it is a liquid wax rather than a triglyceride and functions very similarly to the skin&#x27;s own natural sebum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would even certainly trust this&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> This is a large size container I posted a picture with my hand on the side for size reference .</li>
            <li> As a guy, my hands get dry and crack pretty easily but the softness stayed on my skin for quite some time after applying.  </li>
            <li> If you are putting it on your skin it is absorbing into your body.</li>
            <li> very well too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Also, the fact this is vegan and cruelty free is a big deal for</li>
            <li> It is creamy and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this body butter.</li>
            <li> I really like them both</li>
            <li> The smell is very neutral</li>
            <li> It really keeps your skin moisturized without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The quantity of lotion is very generous.</li>
            <li> I really like this body butter.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t really have a sent</li>
            <li> I could really see a difference between my hands even after one use.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very silky feeling and hydrated looking.</li>
            <li> I can never get enough of this product, and I have been applying it all over especially after a warm bath.  </li>
            <li> I think that once you try a natural organic product you will not be able to stand the feel of any of the commercial creams.</li>
            <li> Another winner from this line of products as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!!</li>
            <li> all in one product for a rich deeply nourishing lotion.</li>
            <li> I applied this body butter right out of the shower and my skin felt so smooth and soft all day long!</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight residue that is hard to describe, but it feels great!</li>
            <li> It is very runny, and not a thick consistency that you would expect from a body butter.  </li>
            <li> After just the first use my boyfriend commented on how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it left my skin shiny, smooth and COMPLETELY moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not at its current price, since for the same money you can buy some top shelf lotions.  </li>
            <li> I am not big on a heavily perfumed type of lotion and this one was good in that respect.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone...........</li>
            <li> but I think I have decided that I like the body butter a little better.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy buildup or a weird shine- which is great because the shine attracts dust throughout the day and the greasy buildup leaves residue everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is not irritating, even in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s already asked me to buy a &#x27;few&#x27; more tubes</li>
            <li> This body butter is super moisturizing and leaves your skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> :-)) also seemed to last much longer than any other lotion I’ve tried.</li>
            <li> It was very rich and creamy going on, which always is a plus for someone with extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a light scent because sometimes I like to apply other perfumes</li>
            <li> I will update my review over longer term use if I have any new observations on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice, light cream for skin that is probably less dry, sun damaged, and aged than mine.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> So, they’ve all ended up being passed on to my Sister (who is much easier to please when it comes to such things), while I stay on a perpetual look-out for a good one (especially one that doesn’t come with a price tag that rivals the rent on a small apartment).</li>
            <li> My other shea-butter products leave a more lasting &amp;#34;deeply moisturized&amp;#34; feeling on my arms and chest.</li>
            <li> The benefits of use (soft skin!</li>
            <li> This body butter has a relatively neutral odor that is only slightly sweet and nutty.  </li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right up, but I&#x27;m left with no dry skin afterwards!</li>
            <li> (only about a dime size amount) will moisturized a fairly large area of my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using on my hands too and they have been feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> , this went on and left my hands non-greasy and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> His legs feel velvety soft.</li>
            <li> natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, just soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients and the fact that this company doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals.  </li>
            <li> Some may find this a negative, but I&#x27;m OK with it.  </li>
            <li> I have started to use this on my 9 month old baby.</li>
            <li> My skin feels instantly soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are al natural and being from Hawaii</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is not greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so incredibly soft and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> but then it wouldn&#x27;t be all natural</li>
            <li> I can put it on in the morning, and at the end of the day my skin is still soft..</li>
            <li> There is a faint and very pleasant scent, but the product is in no way perfumed and the scent isn&#x27;t present very long.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light scent and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was living up north when I first bought this and had dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin pretty quickly, but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of the Oz Naturals Body Butter is light and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I just love the texture and how thick this body cream is!</li>
            <li> I keep this by my desk and use it as a hand cream because it really moisturizes my dry skin to the max!</li>
            <li> It take a little while for it to get completely absorbed into the skin, but I expect that from a body butter.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, especially on my legs, and my skin has been moisturized very well.</li>
            <li> The second thing I noticed was that it didn’t seem to be quite as full as the bottle would lead you to expect :-/</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion to anyone, especially those who live in dry climates, and those with dry skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had little luck in finding on the Oz Naturals website the precise meaning of the first ingredient, &amp;#34;organic herbal infusion.&amp;#34; A few other consumer websites conclude that the term refers to water in which herbs have been macerated.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li> he has insanely sensitive skin, and gets dry scaly cheeks.</li>
            <li> I use this after his baths now, and it really seems to moisturize well and doesn&#x27;t mess with his skin issues.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to report on extensive use, but so far I like the product and believe that I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and finding a good lotion is always hard for me, especially this time of year when my skin is even drier than usual!</li>
            <li> but this butter is thick and creamy and the natural ingredients really moisturized my skin but did not leave it greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> After only a few nights of application before bed, my rough heels had softened and I felt ready to wear sandals again even though it was winter!</li>
            <li> but I think only if you have very dry facial skin for daytime but any skin type for nighttime.</li>
            <li> Since this is a body butter it goes on greasy like but takes about 5 minutes or so to absorb into the skin and dry then left no greasy feel after that.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my dry elbows, hands, and legs especially.</li>
            <li> It made me sad because when I put it on, it smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I am right behind her</li>
            <li> I bought another lotion from oz naturals and it seems to be very similar to the other one.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s legs are so dry all the time</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to moisturizer my dry winter skin and it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> After the weekend, I got a tan and a dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few creams that I have tried that not only makes my skin feel softer but that my hand actually had a â€œshiny moistâ€ smoother, softer look.  </li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way so this tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Which I guess isn&#x27;t so bad since I really liked the other one.</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel the Shea Butter absorbing into my skin for a long lasting moisture, especially in this cold weather.  </li>
            <li> expected, it soothes and improves the texture and appearance of dry, flaky skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> (237 ml) tube should last a long time if used mostly on trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did feel slightly greasy and left a residue after using it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Living in Utah where the heat is very dry and damaging to the skin</li>
            <li> It worked very well for my severely dry broken skin.</li>
            <li> used it everyday for the last three days</li>
            <li> As expected with this line of products, this body butter does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Not really a smell to it,</li>
            <li> Not much for a scent though</li>
            <li> that the Body Butter does not try to take over my other perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I will and have recommended it to other members of my family and friends as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky like some other kinds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth 25.00.  </li>
            <li> It also provides a wide range of vitamins and fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The odor is also less than desirable.  </li>
            <li> , I like a little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I feel I don&#x27;t have to put lotion on every few hours after using this body butter.</li>
            <li> This Body Butter is not greasy or heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning when I get up because my skin gets dried out from the heater</li>
            <li> I use this body butter when I get out of the shower and on my hands after I wash them and my skin is moisturized, it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume and it is not greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried a few times to use this product, but because of the scent, I just could not do it.</li>
            <li> My body butter arrived  a few days ago</li>
            <li> but the same night my whole entire body broke out in the WORST rash ever!!!</li>
            <li> but I wouldnâ€™t say as thick as other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Other body butters I have tried in the past are too thick and too sticky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not super thick like the body butters that come in a jar.</li>
            <li> However, how overpowering can the small be when you are using oils and all</li>
            <li> Although it tends to lean a small bit on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> It is thick without being heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I usually just use a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s winter in the northeast</li>
            <li> It is a thick body butter not super thin like some.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would leave a greasy film on my skin, but it definitely does not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> I recently tried hormone replacement cream from a compounding pharmacy and the base that they put the hormones in was some kind of nasty chemically cream that made me feel like I had a layer of grease on me all day.</li>
            <li> But if it was less expensive I would consider it.</li>
            <li> and i never experienced any skin peeling from my sun burned areas.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried were either too thin/runny and basically useless, or way too thick, making it feel like it just sits on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to faint for me.</li>
            <li> Included gratuitous baby picture, because he loves to play with the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive and has a toxic ingredient in it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a severe reaction to this body butter.</li>
            <li> and I felt the need to step up my game!</li>
            <li> but i was shocked.</li>
            <li> All of that adds up and you end up sick.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I have the worst elbows in the winter and they crack and burn.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am really enjoying this body butter.  It is smooth, non greasy and has no scent.  It is perfect for this time of the year in Southern Ca where the weather has been colder and drier.  My skin feels smoother after using for about a week.  I have been using on my hands too and they have been feeling so soft.  I feel I don&#x27;t have to put lotion on every few hours after using this body butter.</li>
            <li> The Oz Naturals Body Butter is amazing!  I can never get enough of this product, and I have been applying it all over especially after a warm bath.  This Body Butter is not greasy or heavy at all.  It absorbs into the skin pretty quickly, but a little bit goes a long way (only about a dime size amount) will moisturized a fairly large area of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the Oz Naturals Body Butter is light and not overwhelming.  I like that it has a light scent because sometimes I like to apply other perfumes and I like that the Body Butter does not try to take over my other perfumes.  I can definitely feel the Shea Butter absorbing into my skin for a long lasting moisture, especially in this cold weather.  Most highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This one will remain here at the office with me.  I received this at my work and looked forward to checking it out.  I will leave it here and get another one for home.  This is so non-greasy, I love it.  Most lotions leave me wishing I could just wipe it off before I start typing, I do not like the feel of grease on the mouse and keyboard, yuk, this went on and left my hands non-greasy and ready to go.  It does leave a slight residue that is hard to describe, but it feels great!</li>
            <li> I have this body butter and also the Oz Naturals regular lotion and although I really like them both this one is my favorite.  This body butter is very creamy and it leaves my skin feeling awesome. It&#x27;s thick but it&#x27;s not super thick like the body butters that come in a jar. I use it after shaving and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s also good on feet and elbows.  It leaves you moisturized and not greasy. The tube is HUGE and the best part is that it&#x27;s organic and cruelty free!</li>
            <li> This body butter has a hint of sweet almond oil scent which I absolutely love! After only a few nights of application before bed, my rough heels had softened and I felt ready to wear sandals again even though it was winter! I will be recommending this product to all my friends looking for cruelty-free products that actually work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. I personally love the smell of it and how smooth her skin feels after she uses it. She&#x27;s already asked me to buy a &#x27;few&#x27; more tubes so she doesn&#x27;t &#x27;run out&#x27;. Great product, keep &#x27;em coming.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body butter. I have very dry skin and this product works wonderfully. I put it on one day and my skin still looks good the next day. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy either and I was concerned it might with the oils it&#x27;s made out of. This is a product I will be buying over and over and a great product to give for gifts.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazingly moisturizing, super rich and creamy! I have incredibly dry skin and finding a good lotion is always hard for me, especially this time of year when my skin is even drier than usual! I applied this body butter right out of the shower and my skin felt so smooth and soft all day long! Its also rich but not so rick that it&#x27;s at all greasy or doesn&#x27;t rub into my skin easily. My skin soaks it right up, but I&#x27;m left with no dry skin afterwards! It also really worked great on my dry feet, thanks to all the sock-wearing this winter! I keep this by my desk and use it as a hand cream because it really moisturizes my dry skin to the max! I highly recommend this lotion to anyone, especially those who live in dry climates, and those with dry skin! You will love this body body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was given this product for free for the purpose of review, however, all thoughts and opinions expressed are solely my own. I only share reviews I feel will be helpful or informative to consumers.</li>
            <li> Smell could be better but stuff has worked well so far. I use it in the morning when I get up because my skin gets dried out from the heater being on at night.</li>
            <li> super absorption-non sticky-non fragrant-does not feel sticky on the skin</li>
            <li> This body butter goes on easily and leaves my skin soft and smooth without feeling greasy. The light scent is also pleasant</li>
            <li> (This product was sent to me for review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice, light cream for skin that is probably less dry, sun damaged, and aged than mine. My other shea-butter products leave a more lasting &amp;#34;deeply moisturized&amp;#34; feeling on my arms and chest. By contrast, this product (applied twice, a few minutes apart) leave a non-greasy, nice, soft feeling that is more appropriate for day use, especially when I have business engagements or don&#x27;t want to smear cream on nice clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had little luck in finding on the Oz Naturals website the precise meaning of the first ingredient, &amp;#34;organic herbal infusion.&amp;#34; A few other consumer websites conclude that the term refers to water in which herbs have been macerated. Given that dry skin needs water, I don&#x27;t mind that this is the first ingredient (followed by palm oil and sweet almond oil), but I would find more forthcoming to say &amp;#34;organic herbal-infused water.&amp;#34; (Also, what kind of water? Tap water? Filtered water?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the gluten-sensitive folks should note that this product contains wheat germ.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  Clean, seemingly fragrance-free option, and I great appreciate that this is mostly vegan product.  I use this along with the Nourishing Souffle for great, soft skin.</li>
            <li> As with all of the Oz Natural products I use this body cream because it is free of toxins and the majority of the ingredients are organic. If you are putting it on your skin it is absorbing into your body. Why eat a clean healthy diet and then slather yourself in chemicals and toxins? All of that adds up and you end up sick. I use this body butter when I get out of the shower and on my hands after I wash them and my skin is moisturized, it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume and it is not greasy or heavy feeling. I recently tried hormone replacement cream from a compounding pharmacy and the base that they put the hormones in was some kind of nasty chemically cream that made me feel like I had a layer of grease on me all day. I think that once you try a natural organic product you will not be able to stand the feel of any of the commercial creams. Plus you will have softer healthier skin!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need anything else....  this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I really love all of the Oz products. This Oz body butter with almond and macadamia nut is really good. It works wonders on dry skin. My husband&#x27;s legs are so dry all the time so I had him try it. It has a very light scent and absorbs in his skin immediately. His legs feel velvety soft. It really is a deep moisturizer to the skin and non-greasy. It is a thick body butter not super thin like some. The best part it&#x27;s made in USA.  I got this product complimentary  to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product that I got for free to review.  This product is not a body butter as is stated.  It is very runny, and not a thick consistency that you would expect from a body butter.  The odor is also less than desirable.  I tried a few times to use this product, but because of the scent, I just could not do it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Its so moisturizing and it leaves my skin feeling and looking healthy with a nice glow. The fact that is has avocado its just great! Its amazing for the skin! After i use the moisturizer my skin is moist all day.  I have stratch marks and honestly i can see them fading away, i dont know if its because the avacado or something else in the ingridients but i was shocked. I just ordered another body butter even though i stull have alot. Disclaimer: i was given this product for an exchange of an honest oppinion. And unbiased.</li>
            <li> Please note i reveived this as a promotional item.&lt;br /&gt;I have the most sensitive and dry skin and this works amazingly! It has a very light scent, nothing over powering. However, how overpowering can the small be when you are using oils and all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;it left my skin shiny, smooth and COMPLETELY moisturized. I would highly recommend this for anyone...........I would even certainly trust this&lt;br /&gt;on an infants as well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin but this butter is thick and creamy and the natural ingredients really moisturized my skin but did not leave it greasy or oily.  It does not have a smell to it which is good because it won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes or other scented body products. I would order again for myself and gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter! I am switching brands from a high end line (natural) to OZ Naturals and decided to give their body butter a test run - it is perfect!!</li>
            <li> My body butter arrived  a few days ago and I decided  to use it daily  on my entire  body. I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  such  as Shea Butter, avocado  oil, and kukui nut oil. I applied  it every  night  before  bed. This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don&#x27;t. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It&#x27;s to faint for me. Also this  butter absorbs  at a slower rate. That&#x27;s why  I  choose  to apply  at night. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to moisturizer my dry winter skin and it does the trick.  It has a very light scent and a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, just soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I recently had a wonderful 4th of July weekend with my husband and we decided to celebrate it on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;We rented some bikes and decided to bike for hours under the sun. It was fun and all, but my skin isnt agreeing with me. After the weekend, I got a tan and a dry skin. This body cream saved my life.&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday for the last three days and i never experienced any skin peeling from my sun burned areas. My skin is healing very well too.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturize and healthy, I am so grateful to have discovered this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is scent free and it isnt greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I used a promo code to purchase this for testing.</li>
            <li> As expected with this line of products, this body butter does not disappoint. It goes on thick and feels luxurious, but without that oily feeling I&#x27;ve felt with other body butters and definitely not with the accompanying hefty price:) it has a pleasant, light scent and is absorbed into the skin rather quickly which I like. Another winner from this line of products as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome body butter! Living in Utah where the heat is very dry and damaging to the skin this OZ Naturals Body Butter has been amazing, soothing and giving my skin relief from the super-dry hot air. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I definitely like this body butter.  I was afraid that it would leave a greasy film on my skin, but it definitely does not. I like the natural ingredients and the fact that this company doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals.  There is a faint and very pleasant scent, but the product is in no way perfumed and the scent isn&#x27;t present very long.  Some may find this a negative, but I&#x27;m OK with it.  I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to report on extensive use, but so far I like the product and believe that I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I was living up north when I first bought this and had dry winter skin. I tried many over the counter brand name body creams and body butters but they still didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough. This product is pricey but it works great! It spreads nicely, so it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, love it.</li>
            <li> I am such a “Goldilocks” when it comes to lotion (body butters, creams, etc.); 99% of the one’s I’ve tried were either too thin/runny and basically useless, or way too thick, making it feel like it just sits on my skin. So, they’ve all ended up being passed on to my Sister (who is much easier to please when it comes to such things), while I stay on a perpetual look-out for a good one (especially one that doesn’t come with a price tag that rivals the rent on a small apartment). So, after I developed a “love-at-first-use” relationship with another of OZ Naturals products, I was super excited to give their Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Nut body butter a try, and even more excited to do so for nothing more than my honest opinion/review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that it doesn’t have a strong smell (which I prefer, so as not to clash with any perfume I may be wearing). The second thing I noticed was that it didn’t seem to be quite as full as the bottle would lead you to expect :-/ (it seemed to be about 85-90% full, IMO). The product itself is really nice; a bit too greasy for my hands (which don’t tend to get as dry as other parts), but was perfect for my elbows and legs, and AMAZING for my feet. The benefits of use (soft skin! :-)) also seemed to last much longer than any other lotion I’ve tried. And I love that, like all OZ Naturals products, it is cruelty free and made in the USA. Overall it definitely gets a “thumbs up” from me.</li>
            <li> I really like tthe feel, scent and moisturizing of this lotion!</li>
            <li> I loved this OZ naturals body butter. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance which is great because I don&#x27;t always want something that is heavy with smell if I am using it daily. This body butter is super moisturizing and leaves your skin extra soft. I have extremely dry skin, especially on my legs, and my skin has been moisturized very well. A big thing f or me too, is it is does not leave a greasy feel to the skin. It soaks in right away with no greasy film over my skin. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I TOTALLY love the Oz Naturals Best Body Butter. It was very rich and creamy going on, which always is a plus for someone with extra dry skin. However, it didn&#x27;t leave a greasy buildup or a weird shine- which is great because the shine attracts dust throughout the day and the greasy buildup leaves residue everywhere.  I applied it once in the morning after showering, and it lasted all day in 98 degree sun at an art showcase and outside concert. the smell is light and pleasant as well. Also a PLUS PLUS PLUS that the top is very secure so it can be thrown into a purse or a book bag for easy travel without the fear of opening and ruining everything.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to moisturize just fine, but it would be nice to leave the natural fragrances. The tube is pretty large and a good value. I have started to use this on my 9 month old baby. he has insanely sensitive skin, and gets dry scaly cheeks. I use this after his baths now, and it really seems to moisturize well and doesn&#x27;t mess with his skin issues. Included gratuitous baby picture, because he loves to play with the tube. Also, the fact this is vegan and cruelty free is a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
            <li> Yay it finally came. So happy how the lotion feels on my skin. The lotion is nice has scent and goes on the skin really nicely. My skin feels instantly soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This body butter is amazeballs! The ingredients are al natural and being from Hawaii I can tell the Kukui nut oil combined with avo and shea makes this a very effective moisturizer. I am very pleased that is not greasy at all and no harsh smells and goes into the skin super easy .This is a brand you can buy with confidence. It is organic and makes me happy they are cruelty free company. I did order mine through a  special deal to try it and share my honest opinion. This is a large size container I posted a picture with my hand on the side for size reference .</li>
            <li> This cream has Phenoxyethanol in it which the FDA says is a central nervous system depressant.  I ordered it anyway.  It made my eyes burn and caused me to get &amp;#34;crazy&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not worth 25.00.  It&#x27;s too expensive and has a toxic ingredient in it.  Remember we absorb over 60% of what we rub into our skin.</li>
            <li> Oz naturals was first introduced to me by my best friend, she swears by the stuff and I am right behind her, this is my 4th Oz Naturals product and it keeps getting better. This lotion is huge first of all, great price for even better quality, because it goes on so velvety smooth and has a light fragrance of the ingredients, it absorbs into the skins fast but leaves behind moisturized, nourished skin that lasts for hours. One of the great things that always gets me is that oz naturals is just that, natural products that&#x27;s not tested on animals. I am very happy with this and will be picking up some more Oz Naturals products.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this Oz Naturals Almond and Macadamia Nut Body Butter all over my body.  The body butter is light and not greasy. It is creamy and moisturizes my skin very well. It absorbs into the skins fast, but  has my skin feeling amazingly soft and smooth. The body butter contains sweet almond oil and macadamia nut. The scent is very light. My husband even uses it on his skin</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a severe reaction to this body butter. It made me sad because when I put it on, it smelled fantastic. My skin was super smooth. And I loved it... but the same night my whole entire body broke out in the WORST rash ever!!! I have used it on my daughter and she enjoys it. Which is why I gave it 3 stars and not a 1.... This reaction might not happen with everyone. This is just what happened to me. Great product over all though.&lt;br /&gt;  DISCLAIMER: All products received are complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions stated are my own and are not influenced by any affiliates.</li>
            <li> I love all the oz naturals products that I&#x27;ve used, and this is no different. It works incredibly well even with my excessively dry skin. I use this at night before I go to sleep and wake up with perfectly smooth skin. Would definitely recommend the entire oz naturals line of products.</li>
            <li> I really like this body butter. I had a hard time deciding which I liked better, the body butter or the lotion from OZ Naturals. I really like them both but I think I have decided that I like the body butter a little better. It&#x27;s a tad thicker but it spreads nicely and dries quickly. The smell is very neutral I would actually say it is unscented. Just smells like &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; when you are putting it on but doesn&#x27;t leave a scent just smooth, soft, skin.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. Pleasant aroma. Highly recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li> On a scale of  1-10,  I would give this item an 8. Overall it smells great and feels smooth when it&#x27;s rubbed on your skin. I will and have recommended it to other members of my family and friends as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s not tested on animals and does exactly what its supposed to do.  It has a great smell, its perfect for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after its used..</li>
            <li> Another great body and facial moisturizer by OZ Naturals.  The sweet almond &amp; macadamia nut body butter leaves the skin very soft with light to no scent.  Since this is a body butter it goes on greasy like but takes about 5 minutes or so to absorb into the skin and dry then left no greasy feel after that.  It can also be used on face but I think only if you have very dry facial skin for daytime but any skin type for nighttime. It&#x27;s only 60% organic but the great thing about it is it&#x27;s 100% vegan, animal cruelty free and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Not really a smell to it, its okay.  Keep me from being ashy.</li>
            <li> This body butter is awesome!  It really keeps your skin moisturized without a greasy feel.  Ideal for winter time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- buttery -- but not greasy.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> First, the tube is HUGE - that is a good thing but don&#x27;t expect to be able to put this in your purse unless you are carrying a large bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, a little goes a long way so this tube will last a long time. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong feminine scent so it is good for men too. My son tried it out and he liked it a lot. It also has good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; - so it spread on our hands easily and absorbed quickly with no greasy film left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I kinda wished it had a scent, but again because it doesn&#x27;t it is definitely a unisex product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atlas Supply Chain Consulting Services provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer/body lotion is great! Goes on smoothly and is not greasy or heavy feeling. I use it on my face as well. Awesome product as well as all their other products. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I received this at a great discount to review.  I bought another lotion from oz naturals and it seems to be very similar to the other one. Which I guess isn&#x27;t so bad since I really liked the other one. It&#x27;s very thick and creamy makes my skin very soft. I think it would be a great winter lotion. Not much for a scent though, I like a little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter. I have an immense love for great lotions, and I am actually blown away by this formula. My skin feels so incredibly soft and lasts all day. While I did get this at discount for my review, I have to say that the sweet almond &amp; macadamia nut, along with shea butter., avocado oil and kukui nut oil just drenches your skin in luxury!! The scent is very clean and not overpowering which I can really appreciate. The quantity of lotion is very generous. I will attest that this is a lotion that I will keep purchasing, because it really makes my skin feel radiant and amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like this body butter. The longer I use it the more I like it. Oz Naturals is a great brand.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it  truly is very hydrating my skin looks and feels so much better</li>
            <li> This body butter has a relatively neutral odor that is only slightly sweet and nutty.  It is white and moderately viscous.  It is easy to apply and is quickly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, it soothes and improves the texture and appearance of dry, flaky skin immediately.  It is not irritating, even in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blend of oils and other mostly botanical ingredients provides excellent protection against loss of moisture It also provides a wide range of vitamins and fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil in particular is one of my favorites for the skin, because it is a liquid wax rather than a triglyceride and functions very similarly to the skin&#x27;s own natural sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous 8 oz. (237 ml) tube should last a long time if used mostly on trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic herbal infusion, palm oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, stearic acid, kosher vegetable glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, Triticum vulgare (wheat germ) oil, Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, Macadamia ternifolia seed (macadamia nut) oil, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, Aleurites moluccana seed (kukui nut) oil, ceteareth-20, triethanolamine, carbomer, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided body butter for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I love the OZ Naturals body butter! It has fantastic skin healing ingredients. I love that it has shea butter, avocado oil, kukui oil, and almond oil all in one product for a rich deeply nourishing lotion. It worked very well for my severely dry broken skin. It did feel slightly greasy and left a residue after using it. The body butter is a thicker more penetrating product than just a lotion and it instantly, deeply moisturizes your skin leaving it feeling extremely soft and smooth. It even lasted after washing my hands and they still felt silky.  I also love OZ Naturals because they are 100% vegan and cruelty free.    This item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I just love the texture and how thick this body cream is! Not only that but it also smells amazing! You can really tell that it&#x27;s made with quality products! And I also love that they don&#x27;t test on animals and everything is natural!! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. OMG!!! I am never using another moisturizer. After just the first use my boyfriend commented on how soft my skin felt. I just love this product! Plus it doesn&#x27;t really have a sent so it won&#x27;t clash with your perfume.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! I am inlove with this body butter smell and I will be using every bit of this. It is really moisturizing as well! I received this to review and my opinions are 100% honest and unbiased</li>
            <li> This product is what body butter should be like. It smells amazing. Not greasy and feels very natural. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky like some other kinds. Must try! I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> this body butter smell so good. I use it after shower before going to bed. so moisturizing</li>
            <li> Has a bit of an oily finish but your skin WILL be moisturized! It smooths skin, especially the feet!</li>
            <li> Received this product with a substantial discount for my review.  I have tried a lot of body creams since I am a skincare addict.  This one works better than the drug store products that I have tried.  Although it tends to lean a small bit on the oily side.  Because of this, I would only use this on my legs and not my arms etc....  It could also use a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again?  Not at its current price, since for the same money you can buy some top shelf lotions.  But if it was less expensive I would consider it.</li>
            <li> This body cream has a light pleasant lotion-y smell in the tube that isnâ€™t an overpowering fragrance that once rubbed into the skin really isnâ€™t noticeable.  I am not big on a heavily perfumed type of lotion and this one was good in that respect.  This is a white lotion has a nice smooth and creamy texture but I wouldnâ€™t say as thick as other lotions.  I initially tried this on one hand so I could see if there were any noticeable differences.  The cream is not greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly.  This is one of the few creams that I have tried that not only makes my skin feel softer but that my hand actually had a â€œshiny moistâ€ smoother, softer look.  I could really see a difference between my hands even after one use.  As a guy, my hands get dry and crack pretty easily but the softness stayed on my skin for quite some time after applying.  I have sensitive skin and this didnâ€™t bother or irritate my skin in any way.  I will update my review over longer term use if I have any new observations on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice body cream.  It lasts all day and has very nice fregragrance.  All natural and Gluten free.</li>
            <li> This body butter has a light nutty scent and is heavenly on the skin. It is thick without being heavy and sticky. It is quite creamy and smooth. It take a little while for it to get completely absorbed into the skin, but I expect that from a body butter. It leaves my skin very silky feeling and hydrated looking. If you are looking for something that will leave you hydrated all day without the need to reapply something again throughout the day this is a great choice. Other body butters I have tried in the past are too thick and too sticky. This is a great consistency. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and it&#x27;s not greasy. I love it! I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I and my wife absolutely love this product.  We both love the smell of the butter and how it makes our skin feel so smooth. We use it every day and even more now that it is so dry here in Ohio. Helps keep our skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> A nice body butter that absorbs quickly..,..my skin feels softer :)  Wish it  had a light scent but then it wouldn&#x27;t be all natural</li>
            <li> I love how creamy and rich this butter is! It instantly makes my skin feel nourished. I usually just use a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s winter in the northeast and I felt the need to step up my game! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest cream! I have the worst elbows in the winter and they crack and burn. I have been using this cream on my dry elbows, hands, and legs especially. I love how smooth everything became so quickly! I wish I could give more than five stars! Love love LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> Great body moisturizer. I can put it on in the morning, and at the end of the day my skin is still soft.. I don&#x27;t get the end of the day dryness with this. I like that it does not have a strong scent to it. Great product from Oz Naturals.</li>
