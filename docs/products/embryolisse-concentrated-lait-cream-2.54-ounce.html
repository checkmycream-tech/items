            <li>This moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li>I use retin a at night and this during day and I am loving it!</li>
            <li>It would make a great hand cream for anyone though, but Nivea is probablly just as good, and not as pricey.  </li>
            <li>One of the best moisturizers I have tried.. light weight and hydrating!</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful primer for makeup and does not leave an oily, greasy residue on the skin like most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It lasts 6 months easily and the best at any price for morning and night.</li>
            <li>This is a really good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>This does a good job, does not clog pores or make face feel sweaty.</li>
            <li>Excellent cream, not too heavy--not too light.  </li>

            <li>I read all the reviews on this product, and am thrilled that it seems to hydrate and do all that customers say it does.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely be repurchasing from Amazon as they have the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent all-around moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>I have a good feeling this is going to be a life-long love affair.</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Texture is nice and goes on</li>
            <li>My skin feels protected and my makeup application is perfect (I do use a primer after the moisturizer, which helps keep my makeup looking freshly applied for many hours).  </li>
            <li>I can see why it&#x27;s so popular backstage during fashion shows.</li>
            <li>The absolute best.</li>
            <li>I am LOVING this product.</li>

            <li>Very happy and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i normally don&#x27;t like smells in moisturizers, this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells great, and feels super silky.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that breaks out very easily.</li>
            <li>I love to use it as a makeup primer, but it&#x27;s also very moisturizing, it&#x27;s great on its own also!</li>
            <li>I love the product and am looking foreword to using it more often!</li>
            <li>So glad I don&#x27;t have to plan another trip to Paris just to get some more!</li>
            <li>It does feel great on the skin and has a nice light scent, but I would not recomend this if you have oily skin or skin that breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice touch on top of my oils/serums.</li>
            <li>Perfect to use as a primer, I felt like my skin was soft and supple and poreless.</li>
            <li>Search is still on for a good paraben free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>: This cream is the best creme I&#x27;ve used since I discovered Neutrogena sensitive skin face lotin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best thing I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>I found this product thru a You Tube review and i&#x27;m glad I did, by far the best moisuturizer i&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li>Not to oily, nice &amp; light, it also smells nice.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly into the skin…I can put  my primer and foundation on pretty quick after and it&#x27;s not greasy at all!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I want it more rich than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten to where I use a very light layer (about a pea sized) spread over the driest areas for the day, under makeup.</li>
            <li>I like the very light smell.</li>
            <li>It has not caused any break outs and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on your skin very smoothly and is not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Just what my skin needed, a lightweight effective silky sensation that lasts a long time, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super allergic and break out when not using a good product.  </li>
            <li>First bought this cream in Nice, and loved it then.  </li>
            <li>After gently rubbing it in your skin, it makes your face super hydrated and leaves it smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of it in a Birchbox and was so happy to find a large tube of it.</li>
            <li>With free shipping over $25 purchase, very worth it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consider me a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li>I had no irritation from this and love the improved texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So I definitely do love the texture</li>
            <li>Suffice to say that I&#x27;m more in love with the feeling (texture) of the moisturizer than its performance as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>If performance is more of a concern for you (e.g., hydration is your #1 priority, regardless of moisturizer texture), then you may or may not want to try this out.</li>
            <li>I love love love this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite morning moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Saw this product on the Today show by a Hollywood makeup artist who said most celebrities demand it.</li>
            <li>I have oil skin and when I use it my skin gets more oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do not use a primer (never have anyway) and my makeup goes on SO smoothly!</li>
            <li>It will just sit on top and that is where you run into problems.</li>
            <li>Love this as a moisturizer and primer.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks so much better with this stuff underneath.</li>
            <li>My foundation lasts longer and the color just looks better.</li>
            <li>then you see the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; on yoiur face for hours or more without the greesy feeling.</li>
            <li>It spreads and absorbs very well, and feels great to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li>but once it absorbs you just look healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, it didn&#x27;t feel more moisturized, more silky..</li>
            <li>Over the years I have searched for a multipurpose skin product and have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I am 60+ years and have put many to the test.  </li>
            <li>My favorite cream.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than anything besides lamer</li>
            <li>Found out about this product via Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s blog and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Compliments came from many people.</li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this is for the  skin on my face.</li>

            <li>I. LOVE.</li>

            <li>I like Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries Embryolisse</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>would be better in a pot</li>
            <li>It is most without being oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It was ok but not what I needed.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My roommate found by hersel i am different,my make-update looks better before i told her.and</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer to use before putting on makeup!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this lotion in my Birchbox and immediately fell in love with</li>

            <li>Lovely scent, not greasy and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in my birchbox and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure how it will work in the summer, it is a thicker moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and use it every morning.</li>
            <li>perfect for foundation of a daily makeup</li>
            <li>I heard this product is used by many celebrity makeup artists</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It almost has a matte finish, which prevents the t-zone shine, but still keeps my face hydrated and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>After cleansing and toning, I apply this cream all over my face and neck and jaw, and I kid you not, my skin feels unbelievably smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>very hydrating but not oily makes skin feel great.</li>
            <li>(i had to give up so many of my favorite moisturizer because they don&#x27;t go under my makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do recommend it and will repurchase when im done with this tube for sure.</li>
            <li>Most the time I go without a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I used it for a week just to see if would get better, wore it under my airbrush make up</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is MUCH better than the price they were selling it for.</li>
            <li>No wonder it&#x27;s an industry favorite.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a cream so it can feel that it just sits on top of your skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 4 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>but when I do I use this under as a primer which works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used in 30 years.</li>
            <li>This is the most luxurious cream I have ever encountered - my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>sure has them mentioned.</li>
            <li>I reccomend and aldo the shopping and buying experience overall was very good!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this product is prefect</li>

            <li>and I was so glad to see that Amazon carried it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase on amazon and the seller..</li>
            <li>I like this Embryolisse moisturizer more than Cerave and Clinique.</li>
            <li>With Cerave moisturizers, they either broke me out or just sat on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I also find it to be more moisturizing than something like Clinique</li>
            <li>a makeup primer: I read somewhere that many people use this as a makeup primer.</li>
            <li>then you see the glow on your face for hours or more without the greesy feeling.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t break out with it :)</li>
            <li>I love this cream...  </li>
            <li>Have bought it more times than I can remember as in the end</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Have used for years since discovering in a favorite Parisienne pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the texture of this moisturizer.</li>

            <li>My favorite ever moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Embryolisse works for all of these issues, and more.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>I loved it at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, creamy and works into the skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price per tube!!</li>
            <li>But for dry skin is very good!!</li>
            <li>I use this cream as a day cream, and it is perfect for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and after put this on, foundation is more easily to put on face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, not too strong, very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Fine lines have disappeared and my skin looks plumper and more youthful.</li>
            <li>i like this cream, rich, velvety, smooth and it smells v. nice.  </li>
            <li>i am very dry during the winter season so this is excellent for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to high in cost, So this was nice and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product in a huge size!</li>
            <li>This cream is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far so great.</li>
            <li>I love how hydrated and smooth my skin feels throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love how smooth it goes on</li>
            <li>So far is working great..</li>
            <li>Love the consistency and absorbs quickly without leaving a shine- just dewey freshness that lasts for 10 hours or more.</li>
            <li>....went back to my good ol&#x27; eucerin lotion which i love!</li>
            <li>This is the most make-up friendly face cream ever.</li>
            <li>I use this wonderful product at night along my other moisturizer</li>
            <li>So excited to be able to find this product on amazon.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a great moisturizer because it sinks in quickly and acts as a good primer for makeup.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily at all.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to squeeze all the product out of it.</li>
            <li>Good basic moisturizer, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of product that doesn&#x27;t just feel good on my skin, but it is improving it overall.</li>
            <li>This was ranked highly and had good reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging on this product is great, in original box with plastic cover, just as when I order directly from Embryolisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>it really is the most versatile comfortable effective cream I have used.  </li>
            <li>and I convinced myself that French women all get their beautiful skin from using it, but I was fooling myself and now my skin is all flaky.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this lotion in a birchbox about a year ago, fell in love with it, then found the full size on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The texture is lovely after you put it on - very velvety, not greasy and nice under makeup (still need SPF in the day if this is your primary day moisturizer).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good heavy moisturizer in the winter, but what I love about it most is that it cures my kids chapped lips like some kind of medicated cream.</li>
            <li>it is fine, they sent me the 65th anniversary one instead of</li>
            <li>I read all the comments below and it looks just fine.</li>
            <li>my wife love it very much!</li>
            <li>moisturizing is good for peope who have a dry skin or is taking care the skin with some kind of acid.</li>
            <li>It has a light, but pleasant, scent (and nothing noticeable orlingering), and again, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and doubles as a primer, which is nice because that&#x27;s one less step</li>
            <li>does very good if you use it as the foundation primer.my make-up does really nature and looks clearly.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream really is a wonder product - as a moisturiser, it leaves skin incredibly supple, plumped and soft.  </li>
            <li>I use cream, oil or soap free cleaners to minimize the dryness of washing my face.</li>
            <li>No scent, lightweight and my face feels smooth.</li>
            <li>but it feels so light on the face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel nice and silky.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is totally repaired from anything it experienced during the day after using this overnight.</li>
            <li>It kind of just sits on your skin without absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>As a primer, the canvas of my skin after makeup application is like smooth porcelain finish.</li>
            <li>Got a free sample one day and think it&#x27;s a miracle cream.</li>
            <li>But, as a moisturizer and makeup primer it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>work like a primer and make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li>have tried so many different products and this is among the best for leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>As a makeup remover, it is highly effective and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>#34;Crumb Face&amp;#34; free all day</li>
            <li>This works as a night cream or day,  if used lightly.</li>
            <li>the cream feels light--</li>
            <li>I have been seeing a lot about this cream especially on youtube thought I would try it and its great.  </li>
            <li>This product is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>(ELF HD powder is fantastic, btw).  </li>
            <li>(ELF HD powder is fantastic, btw).  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I did not see much of difference.</li>
            <li>It allows a smooth application of makeup.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist, I love it because it&#x27;s great for even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Read reviews over several sites and chose this based on great reviews.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs into the skin in a matter of minutes and my skin feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle and super-moisturizing face cream that is perfect especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>This cream has the perfect texture, not too thick not too watery and it smells kind of like fresh and floral baby powder.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive combination skin and have been looking for a quality moisturizer forever.</li>
            <li>so I knew right when I opened it and smelled it that I would not be able to use on my face</li>
            <li>I very rarely use foundation</li>
            <li>This lotion is very nice, and actually has reduced the amount of acne I get during the winter.</li>
            <li>Has a light clean fragrance that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, yet light and creamy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs beautifully unlike many &amp;#34;classic creams&amp;#34; which are heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a light, clean scent but does not cause any reaction whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and easily into skin.  </li>
            <li>Is rose scented and kinda smells like old lady lotion, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time reordering, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it just to use as a moisturiser</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product after hearing and reading about it.</li>
            <li>It is not too rich.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it to try this out!</li>
            <li>the original one.it is fine.i</li>
            <li>Bought it based on all the stellar reviews and the fact that many professionals use it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much!</li>
            <li>In the original product, as seen from the Embryolisse website, it does NOT contain parabens.</li>
            <li>Does there need to be an ingredient list update or is this NOT THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
            <li>of all, this is the original product.</li>
            <li>Rich.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this cream and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I purchased the cream in Paris last summer and fell in love, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere here in the states!</li>
            <li>From first application I fell in love with this product and will continue to use for life.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a gorgeous cream, lightly scented, but that fades right away, I&#x27;m really sensitive to perfumed products and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I believe this product is great if you have dry or combination skin like me.  </li>
            <li>I just patted the excess off with a clean tissue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for winter because my skin is so dry.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica w/c is more effective for my specific skin needs( moisturizer/skin brightener/ sunscreen).</li>
            <li>This stuff is so great if you have dry skin like I do.</li>
            <li>These procedures can leave my skin a bit dry so the embryolisse is great for holding in the moisture &amp; it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>I have almost finished my first tube , my skin is so soft, very good under any makeup, very hidrating.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t gave up on this product since I heard a lot of positive feedback from many people,,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my normal to dry skin.</li>

            <li>What everyone says about this cream is true.</li>
            <li>It has a light oil-based texture that is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer to wear right before putting on foundation and full make up.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I depend on a good face lotion absolutely every day.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is fantastic in the morning right after shaving.</li>
            <li>Personally, I see how some tiny lines smooth out better, this works great as a moisturizer and primer</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;ve had no breakouts from this product, no allergic reaction, my skin seems to enjoy it, the smell is very light.  </li>

            <li>It is super moisturizing and mild on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But I recommend putting this on straight out the shower when your skin is still warm, and let it really soak in before applying any makeup.</li>
            <li>It works super well with my oily skin.</li>

            <li>Absorbs quickly and keeps face moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is what the beauty world would call a &amp;#34;beautiful product.&amp;#34; I liked this product from day one and about 2 months later, I still really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>this cream was worthy of tossing them to the curb FOREVER.</li>
            <li>I used many high end products and didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin hydration and softer texture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will be purchasing more.  </li>

            <li>Sure, I do little touch-ups with a clear mattifying gel (Thank you Mally Evercolor Poreless Face Defender!!!), but I don&#x27;t at any time feel truly oily or shiny, just that perfect amount of matte and dewy that looks natural and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.o use a primer after the moisturizer, which helps keep my makeup looking freshly applied for many hours).  </li>

            <li>This works great for sensitive skin and is very light with a slight fragrant smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It did exactly that!</li>
            <li>best moisturize ive ever used...gets rid of dry skin instantly</li>
            <li>It is perfect for normal as well as normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, slightly floral.</li>

            <li>I use it day and night and my skin instantly feels amazingly moisturized.</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders on my skin and is a great everyday product</li>
            <li>Your getting a great value, I have used creams that cost over $150.00 and did not get the results I have from switching to this product, a few years ago.</li>
            <li>It was nice to have extra moisture, for a change.</li>
            <li>No crazy claims like wrinkle reduction, brightening, or skin refinement.</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit thin, so it&#x27;s perfect for day time under makeup.  </li>
            <li>Honestly surprised, my skin had never looked better.</li>
            <li>I will be buying ti again, but the tube is lasting me a while which is nice.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth in regards to my experience:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth every bit of the hype</li>
            <li>check out you tube videos on this-all the rave and worth it.</li>
            <li>It makes my face sooooo soft and i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not have matt finish, so you need to give it some time before it gets completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>The tube packaging is nice for freshness concerns, though overall I prefer the jars.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My makeup seems to last longer and go on more smoothly when I use this.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin fresh</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally bit the bullet and gave it a try, and even more pleased that I got the 2.6 ounce tube for the first buy, instead of the smaller size.</li>
            <li>Rich to soothe skin but not oily for my very oily skin</li>
            <li>Works out well for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in to the skin.</li>
            <li>but if you prep your skin right your skin will drink it up.</li>
            <li>My skin feels just the right amount of hydrated and the scent is divine.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and just right.</li>
            <li>: soaks right in with no greasy residue</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit greasy right when you put it on</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best basic moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My experience was great as I received this much sooner than expected!!  </li>
            <li>Oil of Olay does a fantastic day product that I adore without the high cost.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream which has now become a staple item in my bathroom due to its effectiveness as a great multi-purpose all rounder.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry and sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Great product for people with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This item works very well on dry / combination skin and it feels really good on..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this cream, that makeup artists (such as Lisa Eldrige and many others) really enjoy using this product because of its properties in terms of skincare and priming the skin for makeup.</li>
            <li>usually use it after I shave and its really great on the skin.</li>
            <li>a good basic moistuaizer, does not work for my sensitive eczema skin because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only great as a night cream, but I use it daily as my moisturizer and  </li>
            <li>In short: I think this is a great, basic moisturizer that does not breakout my dehydrated, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisture and make my whole face comfortable.</li>
            <li>and it made me look older!!</li>
            <li>It is dermatologist tested and very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product for dry dehydrated skin!</li>
            <li>Since it can be replaced by other more cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>No break outs and very soft feeling skin!!!</li>
            <li>Freshly scrubbed, gently toned, and richly moisturized, it feels like brand new skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried it for myself I can report that it&#x27;s pretty much exactly as described in the magazine.</li>
            <li>The real star of this product is the texture--it feels luxurious!  </li>
            <li>At first, I did not like it because I have oily skin</li>
            <li>and I really do stay matte all day!</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin too and this has not broken me out at all!</li>
            <li>I first found out about this from a blog i was reading.</li>
            <li>and so i snapped it up straight away!     </li>
            <li>When I first started the regimen, it seemed to have an impact on my skin.</li>
            <li>It can have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look on your face at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny to watch beauty snobs pooh-pooh petrochemicals in their products.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was from a sample given to me.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial creme.</li>
            <li>I use it at night before bed and wake up with smooth, baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this cream because it is French</li>
            <li>I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and regret not reading the reviews first.</li>
            <li>Love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>was hearing about this cream from many different sources, so I looked it up on an article about Top French Pharmacy products I found on Pinterest.</li>
            <li>probably last me 3 mos.tube is not plastic, its more of aluminum container.  </li>
            <li>First off I read a lot of blogs that said this was the Crème de la Crème of the drugstore moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I first found this in my Birchbox.</li>
            <li>It is the first moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t drench my skin.</li>
            <li>I think the luxurious feel is even more than the hydrating feel it provides and at times it does need extra help if your skin is on the dryer side, but all in all for the price on Amazon</li>
            <li>I first brought this cream from a pharmacy in Paris.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin in the T-zone, and this cream kept me look like I just applied my fresh makeup the whole 12hrs day.    </li>
            <li>This is just an exciting discovery that I will be very thankful for the years to come.</li>
            <li>It was 17.50 and up no matter how much you spend!</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and it does the job, moisturizes!</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin from using acne medications and this helps foundation to go on super smooth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell, awesome.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly nourishing without being greasy or irritating.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use just once a day, but find this is all I need to keep my face soft and comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends because I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating!</li>
            <li>because this is a great product especially for the winter, my skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li>I combine this with a little Argan Nut Oil and wow my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Rich but not greasy, it makes my skin feel  dewy soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Good for dry winter weather, but a little more greasy than I like for my face.</li>
            <li>I have switched over to the Clinique Lotion + and for my skin it works a lot better since it hydrates more and isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li>I also saw this moisturizer recommended in several fashion magazines, which only confirms my good opinion.</li>
            <li>I also saw this moisturizer recommended in several fashion magazines, which only confirms my good opinion.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, so all I&#x27;ve ever really used were the simple Proactiv moisturizers because I didn&#x27;t want to put something on my skin that would cause it to act up even more.</li>
            <li>However, I read the multitude of positive reviews and comments and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have heard too much positive feedbacks about this product..</li>
            <li>My skin feels very healthy after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s quite as good..</li>
            <li>but a really good basic, like that classic black pencil skirt that makes you look fabulous each time.  </li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this is for the dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li>This might work well during winter seasons when your skin is more dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better with summer, but with all the air conditioning, I have had uncomfortably dry skin.</li>
            <li>packaging is also a metal tube that easily bends and cracks open exposing the moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li>You do not need to use a large amount,</li>
            <li>and I know for certain they are not caused by this product.)</li>
            <li>nice cream for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I suppose i will say that i have got normal skin that could be a bit on the sensitive side if i use too rich of a cream.</li>
            <li>For me it also diminished tiny fine lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>This cream is big in Europe, we are lucky to be able to buy it here at about the same price as over there.</li>
            <li>I have very high expectation of this product bec.</li>
            <li>but for the most part I use this on every single one of my clients!  </li>
            <li>I find, however, it is best applied at night as it is quite heavy and may look a little greasy during the day.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say how this compares to fancier, pricier creams (my skin regime is ultra minimal), I can tell you that I really love this one.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and hydrating.</li>
            <li>Since I am over 40, my skin is much drier.</li>
            <li>If I use too much, I look oily</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order another one when I run out.</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li>It really can&#x27;t do those things because 1)</li>
            <li>I felt rejuvenated and my skin felt very nourished.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>This really has worked.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>REALLY gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li>Also, if it feels greasy, you are using too much.</li>
            <li>As a makeup remover, not so much.</li>
            <li>Has a very neutral smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cream</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>use required more product than expected</li>
            <li>The quality and glow to my skin has improved so much.  </li>
            <li>This really helps to moisturize overnight and it works well under make up too.</li>
            <li>However, it really beats the Olay and Burt&#x27;s Bees  </li>
            <li>Too much, even for winter.</li>
            <li>This cream is gentle and non pore clogging.</li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing evening product.</li>
            <li>As a primer underneath makeup, it holds on to foundation really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and can be used all over the face, even eyes.</li>
            <li>Very luxe and creamy.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer really balances everything out.</li>
            <li>it goes fast.</li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>Its very smoothing.  </li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t apply too much or it will make you really greasy.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very hydrating and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I really like ti</li>
            <li>It has never broken me out</li>
            <li>and it soaks in fast, been using it for years now.</li>
            <li>From what I could glean from YouTube, this product seemed suited for my very finicky skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the pro MUA that recommended amazon and the seller to me..</li>
            <li>No odor, gentle and soothing -</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it looks so fresh and glowing  and alt of professional use it&lt;</li>
            <li>If they came out with a fragrance free version I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m really nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to redness and irritation, even after gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li>Soaks in nicely, so can apply makeup within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>but I think there are far better options that actually contain ingredients that improve your skin&#x27;s barrier and also don&#x27;t contain skin irritants</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the near future!</li>
            <li>Original one is a little light.</li>
            <li>Really surprised!!!</li>
            <li>I smooth it over my face &amp; it sinks right in, without me having to rub it in or anything.</li>
            <li>It looks a bit greasy the first 15 seconds you put it on, but after that it absorbs QUICKLY and TOTALLY.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and a little goes a long way with this cream.</li>
            <li>On first opening the tube, the smell instantly reminded me of a purfume my grandmother used to wear and it made me so nostalgic and made me feel happy!     </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t contain a sunscreen, so you&#x27;d need an extra step/layer if you were headed out into any significant sun.</li>
            <li>I have never been so excited about a simple moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other lotions and creams, but nothing compares.</li>
            <li>and this works better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It may be a bit too rich for summer, but we&#x27;ll see if it actually becomes an issue.</li>
            <li>I have used French skincare products in the past and have always been happy with the results</li>
            <li>I think it is a good lotion overall but probably not worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there aren&#x27;t high % of actives to make those claims, and 2) it&#x27;s just meant to do one thing really well:</li>
            <li>But if you have dry skin and have issues with makeup going on smooth, this could really help.</li>
            <li>While it did just as good a job keeping my skin hydrated, every time I used it, I broke out - one or two significant blemishes - usually one on my forehead and the other on my cheek.</li>
            <li>This just glides right on, sinks in quickly and never makes me break out.</li>
            <li>But after the initial squeeze from the tube and slathering it on my face, I&#x27;m a little less certain of its legendary status as a *</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t sting, not a little, not even one bit.</li>
            <li>It was as good as any I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve certainly used worse.</li>
            <li>A little heavier and more intense amount before bed, all over my face and neck, massaged in well.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without it anymore!</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is hands down the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout to try new beauty products, in search of my holy grail items haha.</li>
            <li>I would describe my skin as acne prone, but not overly oily or dry and this moisturizer is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Lucky magazine recommended this product and I have to admit they did not fall short.</li>
            <li>and - particularly in the winter months - stops the skin from dying out during the course of the day.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m too lazy to write reviews, I usually just read them but this moisturizer is so awesome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with my oily T-zone for years, and I have plenty of tricks to take care of that particular issue, so to be assaulted by dryness and flaking and itching</li>
            <li>While my makeup stays on longer and looks better than without it or with a different moisturizer; it does not beat an actual makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and is making my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it feels very nice and rich when putting it on (be careful of squeezing out too much--a little goes a long way).  </li>
            <li>When I use it in the morning, I put it on right after shower, have breakfast, get ready, and then go back and put foundation on.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and use a host of other products to treat various things, so I was happy that this was moisturizing yet gentle.</li>
            <li>sinks in pretty quickly  </li>
            <li>My new favorite moisturizer hands down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for all types of skins.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this which is why I am taking the time to write this review.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have drugstore &amp; high end creams in my arsenal and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love that I can do that- use a lot, if I have a day in the sun or my skin feels particularly parched, or a little if my skin is behaving itself.</li>
            <li>Rich enough to nourish my mature skin but not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>There is a very light fragrance that does not last long.</li>
            <li>It might be more suited for the winter since it&#x27;s a little bit thicker, but I imagine I&#x27;ll use it in the summer as well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the reasonable price but decided to try.</li>
            <li>It really makes my face feel soft and pampered.  </li>
            <li>very reactive, sensitive skin and Embryolisse  is my go to brand.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing after a shower, and practically scentless for sensitive skins/</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend it for daily use for those with oily skin as it can sit heavy if one uses too much, but it&#x27;s absolutely amazing as a night cream.</li>
            <li>Seems kinda harsh, but over time my skin&#x27;s gotten better.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding a moisturizer that doesnt roll off/ rub off when i apply foundation on top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs into my skin leaving a lovely dewy result, plus it doesn&#x27;t have a offensive or heavy scent.</li>
            <li>I have normal combination skin</li>
            <li>The secret to Embroylisse&#x27;s popularity lies in a truly superior composition that is feather-light.</li>
            <li>A bit less than a night application before bed (which ends up sinking so wonderfully into my face as I sleep, so no more waking up greasy or gummy), and it takes care of all the dryness left over from the acne treatments, so nothing is flaking up underneath my foundation.</li>
            <li>This is outstanding, especially for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered my third one three days ago and Amazon shipped it right away.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about a new moisturizer, give this a try.</li>
            <li>My new to go product</li>
            <li>I live in a colder climate and have been plagued with combinations skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to moisturizer</li>
            <li>May have even improved neck lines, though used in conjunction with new Elizabeth Arden serum, so this was not a controlled experiment.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without you now.</li>
            <li>it is a great base for helping my foundation go on smooth and refined.</li>
            <li>I use it in all seasons as it is  moisturizing enough for winter weather but light enough for summer.</li>
            <li>I put it on when I am feeling super dry</li>
            <li>For what you&#x27;re paying and how much you really need to use daily for your skincare needs, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li>I get super dry in patches on my face during the winter</li>
            <li>It used to be quite difficult to get in the States, but since it is growing in popularity it is more readily available now.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive, acne prone skin, so this was not good for me, but I would think it would be lovely for more mature or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very Soft cream</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>since that time, my skin has become very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin and struggle to find products that work for me and are affordable.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft after applying it.  </li>
            <li>It never irritates my very sensitive skin (I use a retinoid cream, which adds to my skin sensitivity).</li>
            <li>There was some residual cream left on my skin the first time, but I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I saw a big improvement after the first use.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it I broke out the next day</li>
            <li>This product is a complete life saver for my skin!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this one!</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this keeps my skin soft without causing breakouts!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Although it is costlier than other creams, I think it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, and keeps my face baby soft all day!</li>
            <li>Embroylisse&lt;br /&gt;has made his skin much more moist than any other product he has used in the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>I had been waking up with more dryness than usual and wanting something just for overnight moisture, to &#x27;seal&#x27; in my treatment layers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as rich as the more expensive brands without having to pay hundreds .</li>
            <li>I give it five stars in spite of the fact that I can&#x27;t really regularly use it for daytime, but it is a stellar product nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Now it is summer,a little too strong.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, that gets even more dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for just the right moisturizer for a really long time now.</li>
            <li>This was strange to me at first, but after a while it really does go on easier and sinks right in.</li>
            <li>then I expected, but quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough positive things about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer after seeing multiple positive reviews and articles online.</li>
            <li>I previously used a quite expensive moisturizer, so am very happy to have found this.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t see anything special about it compared to other moisturizers in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Although it is a little pricey, it so worth it considering how much it has helped me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer and did not have very high expectations as my skin is definitely in the \\&quot;fussy\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable considering it&#x27;s an imported product and the large tube will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream, and I personally don&#x27;t call it lotion because it&#x27;s thick and super rich.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is extremely light and fluffy in texture, not heavy at all or loaded with grease/petroleum/vaseline.</li>
            <li>I got that really soft texture on my skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>It lives your skin softly and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>this early morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s and my skin just hasn&#x27;t been \\&quot;right\\&quot; for some time now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy at all</li>
            <li>an oil + water emulsion, developed years before anti-aging peptides and high-tech delivery systems.</li>
            <li>This luxurious cream makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>No heavy or residual feeling.</li>
            <li>Wish I could return this back but its too much of hassle.</li>
            <li>soft sand supple skin from using this</li>
            <li>A professional TV makeup artist recommended this cream to me for skin hydration &amp; foundation priming.</li>
            <li>As a space cream, it makes my skin appear plumper while the texture of my skin is baby soft.</li>
            <li>It was recomnended by my professional makeup artist</li>
            <li>makes skin look alive</li>
            <li>I have used it as an eye cream when my sensitive skin got rashy, as well.  </li>
            <li>But this combo has brought back so much youth to my skin.  </li>
            <li>So i just wear the lotion and wear it directly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unseemly odor.</li>
            <li>your skin will feel soft.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>especially, when i use ample amount at night, my face literally glows in the morning and looks very plumped.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have this my whole life.</li>
            <li>he was young.</li>
            <li>I use some Avene products and this cream which is so gentle and one of these tubes last a while.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moist, without the greasy texture or feel.  </li>
            <li>This product surprised me.</li>
            <li>It takes just a couple of minutes for the lotion to absorb completely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 2 minutes to completely absorb.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 2 minutes to completely absorb.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and then softly disappears into skin.  </li>
            <li>makes the skins so soft that you won&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li>for mature skin</li>
            <li>This cream plumps up my skin to a bouncy and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft &amp; hydrated and will forever be a staple.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my sensitive skin was allergic to the fragrance</li>
            <li>THE perfect base for makeup application.</li>
            <li>Perfect base for makeup.</li>
            <li>Thick enough to be effective, but doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause you to be too shinny.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal, sometimes a little dry from using my Clairsonic 2 times a day - this stuff makes my face feel healthy and works well under my make up foundation</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also above freezing right now, and what is the use of a &amp;#34;24-Hour Miracle&amp;#34; cream if it doesn&#x27;t even last two hours?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different moisturizers ranging from Proactiv to plain Grapeseed and/or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I have had no adverse skin reactions &amp;  I do use retinoids so my skin can get pretty dry in winter.</li>
            <li>It is a  very  light lotion and you only need a small amount of it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin about 5 months of the year in the Midwest where I currently live and nothing helps it much: oils, serums....</li>
            <li>When I stopped being able to spend $100 on moisturizers, I searched long and hard for a high-quality, reasonably priced substitute.</li>
            <li>I had been watching some YouTube videos by several high profile, working, professional makeup artists, and this is the moisturizer they use on themselves and their clients.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit since it&#x27;s creamy and goes in easily.</li>
            <li>my skin feels baby smooth no more dryness</li>
            <li>Once I started to use this one, my skin went back to its normal self within days.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s back to normal now.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out how much product my face needed (and a little goes a very long way) in order to achieve the right moisture balance without looking like a newly waxed floor (shiny) by the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>I live in southern CA</li>
            <li>It really hydrates and moisturizes my skin, no longer do I have flaky dry skin</li>
            <li>very moisturizing for my dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>This cream is meant for super dry skin, so if you are just dry use it sparingly</li>
            <li>I have noticed that when I do break out, when using this product regularly, the breakouts heal much faster and stay red and puffy for a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have used almost the entire tube now, to give it a fair review, and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li>This product melts into the skin very quickly for how thick it is &amp; is basically odorless.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that if you have very sensitive skin the fragrance may bother you.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li>I had been using a major name brand moisturizer system, consisting of a 7 step day moisturizer, an anti aging serum, and then a regenerating night cream.</li>
            <li>I am interested in trying the other embryolisse products as well..</li>
            <li>It will soothe your skin like no other.</li>
            <li>but the major selling point is that it moisturizes</li>
            <li>If I am feeling on the dry side, I will use the lotion on my entire face, let it soak in a while, then mix a little more in with my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is quite rich enough for those with dry or really dry skin, however.  </li>
            <li>I only use it for under foundation because it&#x27;s so expensive, so I&#x27;ve never used it daily, but it&#x27;d probably work great as a daily moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li>(Thanks Polar Vortex)</li>
            <li>If you go to their actual website, embryolisse.com ,it clearly states that its \\&quot;Paraben-free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My skin has been clear, softer, brighter, and I have noticed the tiny lines that were beginning to appear around my eyes are gone.  </li>
            <li>It not only helps but my skin is not has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>Apparently this cream can also be used as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old and starting to show my age.  </li>
            <li>This is really a case of &amp;#34;shame on me&amp;#34; for believing the press behind this, but it&#x27;s really just your absolute run-of-the-mill cream that doesn&#x27;t add anything to your skincare quality.</li>
            <li>Their is a reason these 2 creams are so popular in France, together you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I have dry-combination skin (mildly oily on t zone, but dry on the other).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean matte, but light as in texture.</li>
            <li>I put it on last night and my skin felt very soft and moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li>No dry when wearing powder of my face!</li>
            <li>If used as primer, it can help reduce the dryness of the foundation - highly recommended if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li>In the very beginning it feels a little greesy but it absorbs within 20 minutes completely</li>
            <li>In the very beginning it feels a little greesy but it absorbs within 20 minutes completely</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get a second one just in case, for less than $20 its worth trying.</li>
            <li>meaning it&#x27;s not dry or oily.  </li>
            <li>No dry patches even during winter time.</li>
            <li>My skin was not dry or irritated at the time I started using this.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth the few extra minutes.</li>
            <li>I only gave this a 4 right now, I found it to make my skin a little oily now that the heat is on.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin type (dry and oil in the forehead and nose area, redness and itchy when the weather changes)</li>
            <li>Major mistake, the second ingredient is liquid paraffin.</li>
            <li>Just absorbs in fairly quickly and leaves me without a tight, dry face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that mentioned the tendency to get greasy, but that is only when too much is applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mixed this with Bare Minerals foundation and it gives me a dooey skin finish.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty heavy cream</li>
            <li>Its a pretty heavy cream</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my skin recently has become quite sensitive to many cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick &amp; creamy, but can be easily thinned down with a little spritz of water.</li>
            <li>I try a LOT of different things for my skin and rarely can find the right product for my complicated issues.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it in my opinion.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for about a year and my very dry, 42 year old skin has never looked or felt healthier!</li>
            <li>My skin is dry, sensitive and I have rosacea on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think a moisturizer that&#x27;s meant for dry, mature skin would work on someone that has oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li>My face feels much smoother and hydrated after less than a week of using it.</li>
            <li>I have dry to sensitive skin and this helped my skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it in winter, but occasionally use it in other seasons too.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking a little pale.</li>
            <li>especially for dry sensitive cream.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wanted to take this cream for a real workout, so lately I&#x27;ve been stepping up my acne regiment to help my skin&#x27;s condition, and this unfortunately can be very drying as I&#x27;m using pure salicylic acid mixed with a gentle, soap-free cleanser.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin, good or bad, and I would not recommend it or repurchase it.</li>
            <li>Nothing good or bad.</li>

            <li> This moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use retin a at night and this during day and I am loving it!</li>
            <li> It would make a great hand cream for anyone though, but Nivea is probablly just as good, and not as pricey.  </li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizers I have tried.. light weight and hydrating!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful primer for makeup and does not leave an oily, greasy residue on the skin like most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It lasts 6 months easily and the best at any price for morning and night.</li>
            <li> This is a really good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This does a good job, does not clog pores or make face feel sweaty.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream, not too heavy--not too light.  </li>

            <li> and you get a good amount for the price.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of guy to ever put moisturizer on</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and it does well</li>
            <li> I use this under my makeup and it keeps my face nicely hydrated, I&#x27;ve also noticed how well it works with my primer.</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail item for me, I honestly can&#x27;t see my life without</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice</li>
            <li> and my friends have notice how my skin has a nice, dewy glow these days.</li>
            <li> After reading all these good reviews i desided to try, so glad i did.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product, and am thrilled that it seems to hydrate and do all that customers say it does.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely be repurchasing from Amazon as they have the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent all-around moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> I have a good feeling this is going to be a life-long love affair.</li>
            <li> so I am thrilled it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Texture is nice and goes on</li>
            <li> My skin feels protected and my makeup application is perfect (I do use a primer after the moisturizer, which helps keep my makeup looking freshly applied for many hours).  </li>
            <li> I can see why it&#x27;s so popular backstage during fashion shows.</li>
            <li> The absolute best.</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this product.</li>
            <li> Thrilled Amazon carries</li>
            <li> This product is super emollient and beautifully priced.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product through another website and was happy to see that Amazon had it for a significantly reduced price.  </li>
            <li> Very happy and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i normally don&#x27;t like smells in moisturizers, this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells great, and feels super silky.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that breaks out very easily.</li>
            <li> I love to use it as a makeup primer, but it&#x27;s also very moisturizing, it&#x27;s great on its own also!</li>
            <li> I love the product and am looking foreword to using it more often!</li>
            <li> So glad I don&#x27;t have to plan another trip to Paris just to get some more!</li>
            <li> It does feel great on the skin and has a nice light scent, but I would not recomend this if you have oily skin or skin that breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li> this is a nice touch on top of my oils/serums.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use as a primer, I felt like my skin was soft and supple and poreless.</li>
            <li> Search is still on for a good paraben free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> : This cream is the best creme I&#x27;ve used since I discovered Neutrogena sensitive skin face lotin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> I found this product thru a You Tube review and i&#x27;m glad I did, by far the best moisuturizer i&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li> Not to oily, nice &amp; light, it also smells nice.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly into the skin…I can put  my primer and foundation on pretty quick after and it&#x27;s not greasy at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I want it more rich than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to where I use a very light layer (about a pea sized) spread over the driest areas for the day, under makeup.</li>
            <li> I like the very light smell.</li>
            <li> It has not caused any break outs and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> It goes on your skin very smoothly and is not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Just what my skin needed, a lightweight effective silky sensation that lasts a long time, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super allergic and break out when not using a good product.  </li>
            <li> First bought this cream in Nice, and loved it then.  </li>
            <li> After gently rubbing it in your skin, it makes your face super hydrated and leaves it smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of it in a Birchbox and was so happy to find a large tube of it.</li>
            <li> With free shipping over $25 purchase, very worth it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consider me a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li> I had no irritation from this and love the improved texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So I definitely do love the texture</li>
            <li> Suffice to say that I&#x27;m more in love with the feeling (texture) of the moisturizer than its performance as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> If performance is more of a concern for you (e.g., hydration is your #1 priority, regardless of moisturizer texture), then you may or may not want to try this out.</li>
            <li> I love love love this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite morning moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on the Today show by a Hollywood makeup artist who said most celebrities demand it.</li>
            <li> I have oil skin and when I use it my skin gets more oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I do not use a primer (never have anyway) and my makeup goes on SO smoothly!</li>
            <li> It will just sit on top and that is where you run into problems.</li>
            <li> Love this as a moisturizer and primer.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks so much better with this stuff underneath.</li>
            <li> My foundation lasts longer and the color just looks better.</li>
            <li> then you see the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; on yoiur face for hours or more without the greesy feeling.</li>
            <li> It spreads and absorbs very well, and feels great to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li> but once it absorbs you just look healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, it didn&#x27;t feel more moisturized, more silky..</li>
            <li> Over the years I have searched for a multipurpose skin product and have tried many.  </li>
            <li> I am 60+ years and have put many to the test.  </li>
            <li> My favorite cream.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than anything besides lamer</li>
            <li> Found out about this product via Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s blog and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Compliments came from many people.</li>

            <li> My face has never felt so moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how it will work in the summer, it is a thicker moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and use it every morning.</li>
            <li> perfect for foundation of a daily makeup</li>
            <li> I heard this product is used by many celebrity makeup artists</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It almost has a matte finish, which prevents the t-zone shine, but still keeps my face hydrated and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> After cleansing and toning, I apply this cream all over my face and neck and jaw, and I kid you not, my skin feels unbelievably smooth!</li>

            <li> (i had to give up so many of my favorite moisturizer because they don&#x27;t go under my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I do recommend it and will repurchase when im done with this tube for sure.</li>
            <li> Most the time I go without a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I used it for a week just to see if would get better, wore it under my airbrush make up</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is MUCH better than the price they were selling it for.</li>
            <li> No wonder it&#x27;s an industry favorite.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a cream so it can feel that it just sits on top of your skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> but when I do I use this under as a primer which works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used in 30 years.</li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious cream I have ever encountered - my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> sure has them mentioned.</li>
            <li> I reccomend and aldo the shopping and buying experience overall was very good!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this product is prefect</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase on amazon and the seller..</li>
            <li> I like this Embryolisse moisturizer more than Cerave and Clinique.</li>
            <li> With Cerave moisturizers, they either broke me out or just sat on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I also find it to be more moisturizing than something like Clinique</li>
            <li> a makeup primer: I read somewhere that many people use this as a makeup primer.</li>
            <li> then you see the glow on your face for hours or more without the greesy feeling.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t break out with it :)</li>
            <li> I love this cream...  </li>

            <li> Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, creamy and works into the skin very easily.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price per tube!!</li>
            <li> But for dry skin is very good!!</li>
            <li> I use this cream as a day cream, and it is perfect for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> and after put this on, foundation is more easily to put on face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, not too strong, very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Fine lines have disappeared and my skin looks plumper and more youthful.</li>
            <li> i like this cream, rich, velvety, smooth and it smells v. nice.  </li>
            <li> i am very dry during the winter season so this is excellent for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to high in cost, So this was nice and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product in a huge size!</li>
            <li> This cream is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far so great.</li>
            <li> I love how hydrated and smooth my skin feels throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love how smooth it goes on</li>
            <li> So far is working great..</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and absorbs quickly without leaving a shine- just dewey freshness that lasts for 10 hours or more.</li>
            <li> ....went back to my good ol&#x27; eucerin lotion which i love!</li>
            <li> This is the most make-up friendly face cream ever.</li>
            <li> I use this wonderful product at night along my other moisturizer</li>
            <li> So excited to be able to find this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a great moisturizer because it sinks in quickly and acts as a good primer for makeup.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily at all.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to squeeze all the product out of it.</li>
            <li> Good basic moisturizer, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of product that doesn&#x27;t just feel good on my skin, but it is improving it overall.</li>
            <li> This was ranked highly and had good reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging on this product is great, in original box with plastic cover, just as when I order directly from Embryolisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> it really is the most versatile comfortable effective cream I have used.  </li>
            <li> and I convinced myself that French women all get their beautiful skin from using it, but I was fooling myself and now my skin is all flaky.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lotion in a birchbox about a year ago, fell in love with it, then found the full size on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The texture is lovely after you put it on - very velvety, not greasy and nice under makeup (still need SPF in the day if this is your primary day moisturizer).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good heavy moisturizer in the winter, but what I love about it most is that it cures my kids chapped lips like some kind of medicated cream.</li>
            <li> it is fine, they sent me the 65th anniversary one instead of</li>
            <li> I read all the comments below and it looks just fine.</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much!</li>
            <li> moisturizing is good for peope who have a dry skin or is taking care the skin with some kind of acid.</li>
            <li> It has a light, but pleasant, scent (and nothing noticeable orlingering), and again, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and doubles as a primer, which is nice because that&#x27;s one less step</li>
            <li> does very good if you use it as the foundation primer.my make-up does really nature and looks clearly.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream really is a wonder product - as a moisturiser, it leaves skin incredibly supple, plumped and soft.  </li>
            <li> I use cream, oil or soap free cleaners to minimize the dryness of washing my face.</li>
            <li> No scent, lightweight and my face feels smooth.</li>
            <li> but it feels so light on the face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel nice and silky.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is totally repaired from anything it experienced during the day after using this overnight.</li>
            <li> It kind of just sits on your skin without absorbing.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> As a primer, the canvas of my skin after makeup application is like smooth porcelain finish.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample one day and think it&#x27;s a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> But, as a moisturizer and makeup primer it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> work like a primer and make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> have tried so many different products and this is among the best for leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> As a makeup remover, it is highly effective and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> #34;Crumb Face&amp;#34; free all day</li>
            <li> This works as a night cream or day,  if used lightly.</li>
            <li> the cream feels light--</li>
            <li> I have been seeing a lot about this cream especially on youtube thought I would try it and its great.  </li>
            <li> This product is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> (ELF HD powder is fantastic, btw).  </li>
            <li> (ELF HD powder is fantastic, btw).  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I did not see much of difference.</li>
            <li> It allows a smooth application of makeup.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, I love it because it&#x27;s great for even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Read reviews over several sites and chose this based on great reviews.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs into the skin in a matter of minutes and my skin feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle and super-moisturizing face cream that is perfect especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> This cream has the perfect texture, not too thick not too watery and it smells kind of like fresh and floral baby powder.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive combination skin and have been looking for a quality moisturizer forever.</li>
            <li> so I knew right when I opened it and smelled it that I would not be able to use on my face</li>
            <li> I very rarely use foundation</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice, and actually has reduced the amount of acne I get during the winter.</li>
            <li> Has a light clean fragrance that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, yet light and creamy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs beautifully unlike many &amp;#34;classic creams&amp;#34; which are heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a light, clean scent but does not cause any reaction whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and easily into skin.  </li>
            <li> Is rose scented and kinda smells like old lady lotion, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time reordering, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it just to use as a moisturiser</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after hearing and reading about it.</li>
            <li> It is not too rich.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it to try this out!</li>
            <li> the original one.it is fine.i</li>
            <li> Bought it based on all the stellar reviews and the fact that many professionals use it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much!</li>
            <li> In the original product, as seen from the Embryolisse website, it does NOT contain parabens.</li>
            <li> Does there need to be an ingredient list update or is this NOT THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
            <li> of all, this is the original product.</li>
            <li> Rich.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this cream and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream in Paris last summer and fell in love, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere here in the states!</li>
            <li> From first application I fell in love with this product and will continue to use for life.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a gorgeous cream, lightly scented, but that fades right away, I&#x27;m really sensitive to perfumed products and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I believe this product is great if you have dry or combination skin like me.  </li>
            <li> I just patted the excess off with a clean tissue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for winter because my skin is so dry.</li>

            <li> I love this product so much I make husband use it</li>
            <li> I bought it as a multi-use product with full breakdown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What everyone says about this cream is true.</li>
            <li> It has a light oil-based texture that is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer to wear right before putting on foundation and full make up.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I depend on a good face lotion absolutely every day.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is fantastic in the morning right after shaving.</li>
            <li> Personally, I see how some tiny lines smooth out better, this works great as a moisturizer and primer</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve had no breakouts from this product, no allergic reaction, my skin seems to enjoy it, the smell is very light.  </li>
            <li> I used this based off of the great reviews other amazon users gave this product.  </li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing and mild on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But I recommend putting this on straight out the shower when your skin is still warm, and let it really soak in before applying any makeup.</li>
            <li> It works super well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>

            <li> So glad we can get this in the US and the price is decent.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and keeps face moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is what the beauty world would call a &amp;#34;beautiful product.&amp;#34; I liked this product from day one and about 2 months later, I still really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> this cream was worthy of tossing them to the curb FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I used many high end products and didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin hydration and softer texture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will be purchasing more.  </li>

            <li> Sure, I do little touch-ups with a clear mattifying gel (Thank you Mally Evercolor Poreless Face Defender!!!), but I don&#x27;t at any time feel truly oily or shiny, just that perfect amount of matte and dewy that looks natural and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.o use a primer after the moisturizer, which helps keep my makeup looking freshly applied for many hours).  </li>

            <li> Still too strong somehow.i think winter will be very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works great for sensitive skin and is very light with a slight fragrant smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It did exactly that!</li>
            <li> best moisturize ive ever used...gets rid of dry skin instantly</li>
            <li> It is perfect for normal as well as normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, slightly floral.</li>
            <li> I have Lupus and this keep my skin calm as well.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night and my skin instantly feels amazingly moisturized.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my skin and is a great everyday product</li>
            <li> Your getting a great value, I have used creams that cost over $150.00 and did not get the results I have from switching to this product, a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It was nice to have extra moisture, for a change.</li>
            <li> No crazy claims like wrinkle reduction, brightening, or skin refinement.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit thin, so it&#x27;s perfect for day time under makeup.  </li>
            <li> Honestly surprised, my skin had never looked better.</li>
            <li> I will be buying ti again, but the tube is lasting me a while which is nice.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth in regards to my experience:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Worth every bit of the hype</li>
            <li> check out you tube videos on this-all the rave and worth it.</li>
            <li> It makes my face sooooo soft and i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not have matt finish, so you need to give it some time before it gets completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> The tube packaging is nice for freshness concerns, though overall I prefer the jars.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My makeup seems to last longer and go on more smoothly when I use this.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin fresh</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally bit the bullet and gave it a try, and even more pleased that I got the 2.6 ounce tube for the first buy, instead of the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Rich to soothe skin but not oily for my very oily skin</li>
            <li> Works out well for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in to the skin.</li>
            <li> but if you prep your skin right your skin will drink it up.</li>
            <li> My skin feels just the right amount of hydrated and the scent is divine.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and just right.</li>
            <li> : soaks right in with no greasy residue</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit greasy right when you put it on</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best basic moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My experience was great as I received this much sooner than expected!!  </li>
            <li> Oil of Olay does a fantastic day product that I adore without the high cost.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream which has now become a staple item in my bathroom due to its effectiveness as a great multi-purpose all rounder.</li>
            <li> It is great for dry and sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Great product for people with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This item works very well on dry / combination skin and it feels really good on..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this cream, that makeup artists (such as Lisa Eldrige and many others) really enjoy using this product because of its properties in terms of skincare and priming the skin for makeup.</li>
            <li> usually use it after I shave and its really great on the skin.</li>
            <li> a good basic moistuaizer, does not work for my sensitive eczema skin because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only great as a night cream, but I use it daily as my moisturizer and  </li>
            <li> In short: I think this is a great, basic moisturizer that does not breakout my dehydrated, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisture and make my whole face comfortable.</li>
            <li> and it made me look older!!</li>
            <li> It is dermatologist tested and very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product for dry dehydrated skin!</li>
            <li> Since it can be replaced by other more cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> No break outs and very soft feeling skin!!!</li>
            <li> Freshly scrubbed, gently toned, and richly moisturized, it feels like brand new skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried it for myself I can report that it&#x27;s pretty much exactly as described in the magazine.</li>
            <li> The real star of this product is the texture--it feels luxurious!  </li>
            <li> At first, I did not like it because I have oily skin</li>
            <li> and I really do stay matte all day!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin too and this has not broken me out at all!</li>
            <li> I first found out about this from a blog i was reading.</li>
            <li> and so i snapped it up straight away!     </li>
            <li> When I first started the regimen, it seemed to have an impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> It can have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look on your face at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to watch beauty snobs pooh-pooh petrochemicals in their products.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was from a sample given to me.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial creme.</li>
            <li> I use it at night before bed and wake up with smooth, baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this cream because it is French</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and regret not reading the reviews first.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> was hearing about this cream from many different sources, so I looked it up on an article about Top French Pharmacy products I found on Pinterest.</li>
            <li> probably last me 3 mos.tube is not plastic, its more of aluminum container.  </li>
            <li> First off I read a lot of blogs that said this was the Crème de la Crème of the drugstore moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I first found this in my Birchbox.</li>
            <li> It is the first moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t drench my skin.</li>
            <li> I think the luxurious feel is even more than the hydrating feel it provides and at times it does need extra help if your skin is on the dryer side, but all in all for the price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I first brought this cream from a pharmacy in Paris.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin in the T-zone, and this cream kept me look like I just applied my fresh makeup the whole 12hrs day.    </li>
            <li> This is just an exciting discovery that I will be very thankful for the years to come.</li>
            <li> It was 17.50 and up no matter how much you spend!</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it does the job, moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin from using acne medications and this helps foundation to go on super smooth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell, awesome.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly nourishing without being greasy or irritating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use just once a day, but find this is all I need to keep my face soft and comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends because I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating!</li>
            <li> because this is a great product especially for the winter, my skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li> I combine this with a little Argan Nut Oil and wow my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> Rich but not greasy, it makes my skin feel  dewy soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Good for dry winter weather, but a little more greasy than I like for my face.</li>
            <li> I have switched over to the Clinique Lotion + and for my skin it works a lot better since it hydrates more and isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> I also saw this moisturizer recommended in several fashion magazines, which only confirms my good opinion.</li>
            <li> I also saw this moisturizer recommended in several fashion magazines, which only confirms my good opinion.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, so all I&#x27;ve ever really used were the simple Proactiv moisturizers because I didn&#x27;t want to put something on my skin that would cause it to act up even more.</li>
            <li> However, I read the multitude of positive reviews and comments and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have heard too much positive feedbacks about this product..</li>
            <li> My skin feels very healthy after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s quite as good..</li>
            <li> but a really good basic, like that classic black pencil skirt that makes you look fabulous each time.  </li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this is for the dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> This might work well during winter seasons when your skin is more dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better with summer, but with all the air conditioning, I have had uncomfortably dry skin.</li>
            <li> packaging is also a metal tube that easily bends and cracks open exposing the moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li> You do not need to use a large amount,</li>
            <li> and I know for certain they are not caused by this product.)</li>
            <li> nice cream for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I suppose i will say that i have got normal skin that could be a bit on the sensitive side if i use too rich of a cream.</li>
            <li> For me it also diminished tiny fine lines around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream is big in Europe, we are lucky to be able to buy it here at about the same price as over there.</li>
            <li> I have very high expectation of this product bec.</li>
            <li> but for the most part I use this on every single one of my clients!  </li>
            <li> I find, however, it is best applied at night as it is quite heavy and may look a little greasy during the day.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say how this compares to fancier, pricier creams (my skin regime is ultra minimal), I can tell you that I really love this one.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and hydrating.</li>
            <li> Since I am over 40, my skin is much drier.</li>
            <li> If I use too much, I look oily</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order another one when I run out.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t do those things because 1)</li>
            <li> I felt rejuvenated and my skin felt very nourished.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This really has worked.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> REALLY gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> Also, if it feels greasy, you are using too much.</li>
            <li> As a makeup remover, not so much.</li>
            <li> Has a very neutral smell.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cream</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> use required more product than expected</li>
            <li> The quality and glow to my skin has improved so much.  </li>
            <li> This really helps to moisturize overnight and it works well under make up too.</li>
            <li> However, it really beats the Olay and Burt&#x27;s Bees  </li>
            <li> Too much, even for winter.</li>
            <li> This cream is gentle and non pore clogging.</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing evening product.</li>
            <li> As a primer underneath makeup, it holds on to foundation really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and can be used all over the face, even eyes.</li>
            <li> Very luxe and creamy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really balances everything out.</li>
            <li> it goes fast.</li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> Its very smoothing.  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t apply too much or it will make you really greasy.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very hydrating and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I really like ti</li>
            <li> It has never broken me out</li>
            <li> and it soaks in fast, been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> From what I could glean from YouTube, this product seemed suited for my very finicky skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the pro MUA that recommended amazon and the seller to me..</li>
            <li> No odor, gentle and soothing -</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it looks so fresh and glowing  and alt of professional use it&lt;</li>
            <li> If they came out with a fragrance free version I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m really nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to redness and irritation, even after gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> Soaks in nicely, so can apply makeup within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I think there are far better options that actually contain ingredients that improve your skin&#x27;s barrier and also don&#x27;t contain skin irritants</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the near future!</li>
            <li> Original one is a little light.</li>
            <li> Really surprised!!!</li>
            <li> I smooth it over my face &amp; it sinks right in, without me having to rub it in or anything.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit greasy the first 15 seconds you put it on, but after that it absorbs QUICKLY and TOTALLY.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and a little goes a long way with this cream.</li>
            <li> On first opening the tube, the smell instantly reminded me of a purfume my grandmother used to wear and it made me so nostalgic and made me feel happy!     </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t contain a sunscreen, so you&#x27;d need an extra step/layer if you were headed out into any significant sun.</li>
            <li> I have never been so excited about a simple moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other lotions and creams, but nothing compares.</li>
            <li> and this works better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It may be a bit too rich for summer, but we&#x27;ll see if it actually becomes an issue.</li>
            <li> I have used French skincare products in the past and have always been happy with the results</li>
            <li> I think it is a good lotion overall but probably not worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there aren&#x27;t high % of actives to make those claims, and 2) it&#x27;s just meant to do one thing really well:</li>
            <li> But if you have dry skin and have issues with makeup going on smooth, this could really help.</li>
            <li> While it did just as good a job keeping my skin hydrated, every time I used it, I broke out - one or two significant blemishes - usually one on my forehead and the other on my cheek.</li>
            <li> This just glides right on, sinks in quickly and never makes me break out.</li>
            <li> But after the initial squeeze from the tube and slathering it on my face, I&#x27;m a little less certain of its legendary status as a *</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t sting, not a little, not even one bit.</li>
            <li> It was as good as any I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve certainly used worse.</li>
            <li> A little heavier and more intense amount before bed, all over my face and neck, massaged in well.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is hands down the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout to try new beauty products, in search of my holy grail items haha.</li>
            <li> I would describe my skin as acne prone, but not overly oily or dry and this moisturizer is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Lucky magazine recommended this product and I have to admit they did not fall short.</li>
            <li> and - particularly in the winter months - stops the skin from dying out during the course of the day.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m too lazy to write reviews, I usually just read them but this moisturizer is so awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with my oily T-zone for years, and I have plenty of tricks to take care of that particular issue, so to be assaulted by dryness and flaking and itching</li>
            <li> While my makeup stays on longer and looks better than without it or with a different moisturizer; it does not beat an actual makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and is making my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it feels very nice and rich when putting it on (be careful of squeezing out too much--a little goes a long way).  </li>
            <li> When I use it in the morning, I put it on right after shower, have breakfast, get ready, and then go back and put foundation on.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and use a host of other products to treat various things, so I was happy that this was moisturizing yet gentle.</li>
            <li> sinks in pretty quickly  </li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer hands down.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for all types of skins.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this which is why I am taking the time to write this review.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have drugstore &amp; high end creams in my arsenal and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love that I can do that- use a lot, if I have a day in the sun or my skin feels particularly parched, or a little if my skin is behaving itself.</li>
            <li> Rich enough to nourish my mature skin but not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> There is a very light fragrance that does not last long.</li>
            <li> It might be more suited for the winter since it&#x27;s a little bit thicker, but I imagine I&#x27;ll use it in the summer as well.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the reasonable price but decided to try.</li>
            <li> It really makes my face feel soft and pampered.  </li>
            <li> very reactive, sensitive skin and Embryolisse  is my go to brand.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing after a shower, and practically scentless for sensitive skins/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend it for daily use for those with oily skin as it can sit heavy if one uses too much, but it&#x27;s absolutely amazing as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Seems kinda harsh, but over time my skin&#x27;s gotten better.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a moisturizer that doesnt roll off/ rub off when i apply foundation on top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs into my skin leaving a lovely dewy result, plus it doesn&#x27;t have a offensive or heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I have normal combination skin</li>
            <li> The secret to Embroylisse&#x27;s popularity lies in a truly superior composition that is feather-light.</li>
            <li> A bit less than a night application before bed (which ends up sinking so wonderfully into my face as I sleep, so no more waking up greasy or gummy), and it takes care of all the dryness left over from the acne treatments, so nothing is flaking up underneath my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding, especially for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered my third one three days ago and Amazon shipped it right away.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about a new moisturizer, give this a try.</li>
            <li> My new to go product</li>
            <li> I live in a colder climate and have been plagued with combinations skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to moisturizer</li>
            <li> May have even improved neck lines, though used in conjunction with new Elizabeth Arden serum, so this was not a controlled experiment.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without you now.</li>
            <li> it is a great base for helping my foundation go on smooth and refined.</li>
            <li> I use it in all seasons as it is  moisturizing enough for winter weather but light enough for summer.</li>
            <li> I put it on when I am feeling super dry</li>
            <li> For what you&#x27;re paying and how much you really need to use daily for your skincare needs, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I get super dry in patches on my face during the winter</li>
            <li> It used to be quite difficult to get in the States, but since it is growing in popularity it is more readily available now.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive, acne prone skin, so this was not good for me, but I would think it would be lovely for more mature or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very Soft cream</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> since that time, my skin has become very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin and struggle to find products that work for me and are affordable.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft after applying it.  </li>
            <li> It never irritates my very sensitive skin (I use a retinoid cream, which adds to my skin sensitivity).</li>
            <li> There was some residual cream left on my skin the first time, but I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I saw a big improvement after the first use.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it I broke out the next day</li>
            <li> This product is a complete life saver for my skin!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this keeps my skin soft without causing breakouts!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Although it is costlier than other creams, I think it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, and keeps my face baby soft all day!</li>
            <li> Embroylisse&lt;br /&gt;has made his skin much more moist than any other product he has used in the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> I had been waking up with more dryness than usual and wanting something just for overnight moisture, to &#x27;seal&#x27; in my treatment layers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as rich as the more expensive brands without having to pay hundreds .</li>
            <li> I give it five stars in spite of the fact that I can&#x27;t really regularly use it for daytime, but it is a stellar product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Now it is summer,a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, that gets even more dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for just the right moisturizer for a really long time now.</li>
            <li> This was strange to me at first, but after a while it really does go on easier and sinks right in.</li>
            <li> then I expected, but quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough positive things about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer after seeing multiple positive reviews and articles online.</li>
            <li> I previously used a quite expensive moisturizer, so am very happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t see anything special about it compared to other moisturizers in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little pricey, it so worth it considering how much it has helped me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer and did not have very high expectations as my skin is definitely in the \\&quot;fussy\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable considering it&#x27;s an imported product and the large tube will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream, and I personally don&#x27;t call it lotion because it&#x27;s thick and super rich.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is extremely light and fluffy in texture, not heavy at all or loaded with grease/petroleum/vaseline.</li>
            <li> I got that really soft texture on my skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> It lives your skin softly and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> this early morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and my skin just hasn&#x27;t been \\&quot;right\\&quot; for some time now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy at all</li>
            <li> an oil + water emulsion, developed years before anti-aging peptides and high-tech delivery systems.</li>
            <li> This luxurious cream makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> No heavy or residual feeling.</li>
            <li> Wish I could return this back but its too much of hassle.</li>
            <li> soft sand supple skin from using this</li>
            <li> A professional TV makeup artist recommended this cream to me for skin hydration &amp; foundation priming.</li>
            <li> As a space cream, it makes my skin appear plumper while the texture of my skin is baby soft.</li>
            <li> It was recomnended by my professional makeup artist</li>
            <li> makes skin look alive</li>
            <li> I have used it as an eye cream when my sensitive skin got rashy, as well.  </li>
            <li> But this combo has brought back so much youth to my skin.  </li>
            <li> So i just wear the lotion and wear it directly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unseemly odor.</li>
            <li> your skin will feel soft.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> especially, when i use ample amount at night, my face literally glows in the morning and looks very plumped.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have this my whole life.</li>
            <li> he was young.</li>
            <li> I use some Avene products and this cream which is so gentle and one of these tubes last a while.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moist, without the greasy texture or feel.  </li>
            <li> This product surprised me.</li>
            <li> It takes just a couple of minutes for the lotion to absorb completely into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 2 minutes to completely absorb.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 2 minutes to completely absorb.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and then softly disappears into skin.  </li>
            <li> makes the skins so soft that you won&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> for mature skin</li>
            <li> This cream plumps up my skin to a bouncy and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft &amp; hydrated and will forever be a staple.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my sensitive skin was allergic to the fragrance</li>
            <li> THE perfect base for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Perfect base for makeup.</li>
            <li> Thick enough to be effective, but doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause you to be too shinny.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal, sometimes a little dry from using my Clairsonic 2 times a day - this stuff makes my face feel healthy and works well under my make up foundation</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also above freezing right now, and what is the use of a &amp;#34;24-Hour Miracle&amp;#34; cream if it doesn&#x27;t even last two hours?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different moisturizers ranging from Proactiv to plain Grapeseed and/or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I have had no adverse skin reactions &amp;  I do use retinoids so my skin can get pretty dry in winter.</li>
            <li> It is a  very  light lotion and you only need a small amount of it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin about 5 months of the year in the Midwest where I currently live and nothing helps it much: oils, serums....</li>
            <li> When I stopped being able to spend $100 on moisturizers, I searched long and hard for a high-quality, reasonably priced substitute.</li>
            <li> I had been watching some YouTube videos by several high profile, working, professional makeup artists, and this is the moisturizer they use on themselves and their clients.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit since it&#x27;s creamy and goes in easily.</li>
            <li> my skin feels baby smooth no more dryness</li>
            <li> Once I started to use this one, my skin went back to its normal self within days.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to normal now.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how much product my face needed (and a little goes a very long way) in order to achieve the right moisture balance without looking like a newly waxed floor (shiny) by the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> I live in southern CA</li>
            <li> It really hydrates and moisturizes my skin, no longer do I have flaky dry skin</li>
            <li> very moisturizing for my dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> This cream is meant for super dry skin, so if you are just dry use it sparingly</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when I do break out, when using this product regularly, the breakouts heal much faster and stay red and puffy for a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the entire tube now, to give it a fair review, and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> This product melts into the skin very quickly for how thick it is &amp; is basically odorless.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that if you have very sensitive skin the fragrance may bother you.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li> I had been using a major name brand moisturizer system, consisting of a 7 step day moisturizer, an anti aging serum, and then a regenerating night cream.</li>
            <li> I am interested in trying the other embryolisse products as well..</li>
            <li> It will soothe your skin like no other.</li>
            <li> but the major selling point is that it moisturizes</li>
            <li> If I am feeling on the dry side, I will use the lotion on my entire face, let it soak in a while, then mix a little more in with my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is quite rich enough for those with dry or really dry skin, however.  </li>
            <li> I only use it for under foundation because it&#x27;s so expensive, so I&#x27;ve never used it daily, but it&#x27;d probably work great as a daily moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li> (Thanks Polar Vortex)</li>
            <li> If you go to their actual website, embryolisse.com ,it clearly states that its \\&quot;Paraben-free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My skin has been clear, softer, brighter, and I have noticed the tiny lines that were beginning to appear around my eyes are gone.  </li>
            <li> It not only helps but my skin is not has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Apparently this cream can also be used as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old and starting to show my age.  </li>
            <li> This is really a case of &amp;#34;shame on me&amp;#34; for believing the press behind this, but it&#x27;s really just your absolute run-of-the-mill cream that doesn&#x27;t add anything to your skincare quality.</li>
            <li> Their is a reason these 2 creams are so popular in France, together you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have dry-combination skin (mildly oily on t zone, but dry on the other).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean matte, but light as in texture.</li>
            <li> I put it on last night and my skin felt very soft and moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li> No dry when wearing powder of my face!</li>
            <li> If used as primer, it can help reduce the dryness of the foundation - highly recommended if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li> In the very beginning it feels a little greesy but it absorbs within 20 minutes completely</li>
            <li> In the very beginning it feels a little greesy but it absorbs within 20 minutes completely</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get a second one just in case, for less than $20 its worth trying.</li>
            <li> meaning it&#x27;s not dry or oily.  </li>
            <li> No dry patches even during winter time.</li>
            <li> My skin was not dry or irritated at the time I started using this.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth the few extra minutes.</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 4 right now, I found it to make my skin a little oily now that the heat is on.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin type (dry and oil in the forehead and nose area, redness and itchy when the weather changes)</li>
            <li> Major mistake, the second ingredient is liquid paraffin.</li>
            <li> Just absorbs in fairly quickly and leaves me without a tight, dry face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that mentioned the tendency to get greasy, but that is only when too much is applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed this with Bare Minerals foundation and it gives me a dooey skin finish.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty heavy cream</li>
            <li> Its a pretty heavy cream</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin recently has become quite sensitive to many cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick &amp; creamy, but can be easily thinned down with a little spritz of water.</li>
            <li> I try a LOT of different things for my skin and rarely can find the right product for my complicated issues.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it in my opinion.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about a year and my very dry, 42 year old skin has never looked or felt healthier!</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, sensitive and I have rosacea on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think a moisturizer that&#x27;s meant for dry, mature skin would work on someone that has oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li> My face feels much smoother and hydrated after less than a week of using it.</li>
            <li> I have dry to sensitive skin and this helped my skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it in winter, but occasionally use it in other seasons too.</li>
            <li> It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking a little pale.</li>
            <li> especially for dry sensitive cream.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> wanted to take this cream for a real workout, so lately I&#x27;ve been stepping up my acne regiment to help my skin&#x27;s condition, and this unfortunately can be very drying as I&#x27;m using pure salicylic acid mixed with a gentle, soap-free cleanser.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin, good or bad, and I would not recommend it or repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Nothing good or bad.</li>
            <li> I have early thirties, pale, white-person skin that is sensitive and breaks out if I don&#x27;t use Differin gel every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for those with normal or combination skin or those like me with slightly oily skin who prefer a dewy look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read articles that say its not bad for skin, but regardless I was disappointed to not see as many results as other users.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick, rich cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched back and forth between a few, mainly garnier and olay.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 50 different moisturizers over the past decade, and this is the only one that moisturizes really well without causing break outs.  </li>
            <li> It is a very generous tube and because it&#x27;s concentrated, a little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The tube was metal, so serious attempts at keeping the product fresh and sterile were made.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and am on a constant lookout for facial moisturizers that actually sink into the skin.</li>
            <li> when my skin cleared up 10 days later I decided to give it a second chance but it broke me out again ,, not recommend it for those with oily or combination skin , maybe to thoses with extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> My face gets serverly dry to the point of flaking and this has been the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that actually makes a difference.</li>
            <li> The constant freezing and surgerys he has had left his skin extremely dry &amp; flaky.</li>
            <li> However, it made my fairly clear combination skin break out pretty badly after the first use.</li>
            <li> Two of these small tubes of cream lasted me a whole year.</li>
            <li> This tube will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Hydrocortizone only worked so long and anything heavier would turn my face into a grease</li>
            <li> (even though I think this will last me a long while)</li>
            <li> If your skin is not sensitive to fragrance, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> and it just sinks into your skin, no white filmy layer, no grey looking color</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, so I think this would be a bit heavy for the summer</li>
            <li> with just a simple evian spray and i pat my face dry.</li>
            <li> so I would only recommend it to people with dry skin like mine.</li>
            <li> My skin was sooooo dry, it was starting to remind me of a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> I always have dry cheeks, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> And it is addictive when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: Combo/Oily skin, Acne-prone, Oily T-zone with Dry cheeks and jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face has gotten brighter, the dry patches are gone, and redness overall has practically disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my skin hasn&#x27;t been as dry, but I feel like I will definitely be using this come winter.</li>
            <li> I carry one in my backpack for extra dry days</li>
            <li> so I would only recommend it to people with dry skin like mine.</li>
            <li> and it always helps save me when I&#x27;m facing extremely dry skin, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it at night, as it is a little too dewy to use under every day makeup, but if your skin is very dry this probably is not an issue.</li>
            <li> The packaging promotes product stability and freshness, the tiny amounts for daily use and the extensive benefits from so little product, makes your dollar go a lot further than you think.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it&#x27;s fragranced which can be irritating to skin (depends on how heavily fragranced and how sensitive your skin) and the scent is distinctly &amp;#34;old lady.&amp;#34;  If they left the fragrance out it would be unbeatable.</li>
            <li> but why do I look older in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially in the winter, and this keeps my skin hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> I usually use Dermalogica Intensive Moisture because it&#x27;s one of the only products that doesn&#x27;t break me out but thought I would give this a try since it&#x27;s slightly less expensive and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the afternoon, my t-zone will get a bit shiny, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It lasts me a long time</li>
            <li> I hesitated to get it for a long time because of the shipping fee on their website..</li>
            <li> A pea size goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, after a few continuous tries with no issues, I have been using this moisturizer every day for the past few months and LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive to harsh chemicals because of use of retinoid (tazorac).  </li>
            <li> I wish I had known of this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> and it is kind of expensive for a small tube.</li>
            <li> After several uses&#x27;s your skin will start to feel well moisturized and hydrated, skin will appear thick and plump (appose to thin skin) and will have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Good base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> Its been too much oil added to my face for the hotter months, but during those bitter cold days this stuff perks my skin right up.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from a skin melt down, it turned sensitive, my usual moisterizer was burning around my nose, mouth, and cheek area and developed some dry spots.</li>
            <li> or you will be a hot slick mess after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It left my skin a little shiner than desired, but it did have its benefits on my skin (redness reduction, for instance the following morning after application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will be using a lot of other things before I go back.</li>
            <li> And you only need to use a tiny little bit to go a long way!</li>
            <li> I can definitely notice the different in my skin, it feels smoother and idk, I feel it looks a little fresher.</li>
            <li> so I choose my facial product very carefully.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for dry skin types.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from really dry skin where there is always some sort of dry patch/peeling on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeping my skin from getting dry even with our wood stove running non-stop and all the dry heated air in the office.</li>
            <li> I have dry combination skin</li>
            <li> Today I put it on in the morning, and already my skin is not just dry, but flaking.  </li>
            <li> and it does suit for the dry skin as my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and have to wear a lot of make up to work.</li>
            <li> I have been having really dry skin since January</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, I get dry skin after shaving, one of the make up artists at my job let me use this because I looked like I stuck my face in a bag of crumbs.</li>
            <li> have dry skin all the time, and eucerin with sunscreen  </li>
            <li> By 4pm my skin felt dry and it hurt.</li>
            <li> Oily or dry</li>
            <li> Guess my skin is just too dry</li>
            <li> It helped to moisturize my dry patches and didn&#x27;t make my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> I get really dry skin around my mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: opening sealed with foil&lt;br /&gt;Smell: faint clean scent&lt;br /&gt;Color:</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and it replenishes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly dry skin, but I do have patches on my chin that are flakey.</li>
            <li> Quite simply, Embryolisse is a basic, old-school formulation of mineral oil, water, fatty alcohols and waxes.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, it&#x27;s moisturizing yet not too heavy, and it leaves my skin glowing (especially when left on overnight).</li>
            <li> Feels a little greasy going on, but it sinks in well and makes a great base for makeup.</li>
            <li> The morning after I used this, my forehead and chin were broken out, and my skin looked pretty greasy.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face feel soft and lovely for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons; I hate the metal tube,  i think a lot of cream is wasted when it gets low.  </li>
            <li> There is another formula for dry to very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> In industry-parlance, we call it &amp;#34;cosmetically elegant&amp;#34; -- a loose, whipped texture that is so pleasing, sensorially.  </li>
            <li> I do apply loose powder over my foundation, which helps set it and gives it a poreless look</li>
            <li> I do apply loose powder over my foundation, which helps set it and gives it a poreless look</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to find when you live in a humid place</li>
            <li> No breakouts, no harsh fragrance and no more dry patches!</li>
            <li> so it cuts down my daily mu routine to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> well nourished all day long!!</li>
            <li> I only use a small pea size amount and let it sink in for about ten minutes before I apply any makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable after only three weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I see that other&#x27;s have had the same problem and probably due to the mineral oil used.</li>
            <li> I swear by this moisturizer for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> , i have very dry flakey skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and before my makeup, it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not rich enough , I think it is overpriced</li>
            <li> A little goes along way only need a couple dabs.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the main ingredients is (I discovered from reading a beautypedia review) just the latin name for mineral oil, which I believe is pretty bad for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was having problems with discoloration, uneven tone and texture, very dry patches (especially under my eyes, around my nose and mouth), and even some acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> This item came in earlier then expected but the box was a little bent.</li>
            <li> Since I moved to the state lately and my old products are running out, I have to change to another brand.</li>
            <li> The cream sinks into my skin and leaves it moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I just scraped the excess into an almost empty moisturizer pot and used it from there.  </li>
            <li> This cream is not really moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> The texture is not really like a cream either.</li>
            <li> I am thinking this could possibly be used during really harsh winters.</li>
            <li> No thanks</li>
            <li> I have found several mediocre options in the same price range, and this product surpasses them all by far.</li>
            <li> on easy&lt;br /&gt;Was not very oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Was not much product for the price&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful with my face creams.</li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin.</li>
            <li> Removing makeup from skin and mixed with foundation for a moisturizing tint to name a few.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin just apply a little teeny bit and it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Beware though, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have wasted lots of money on other products in the past, but this cream far surpasses any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Other reviews had mentioned that</li>
            <li> I use it around the eyes too and it does not sting like other ones.</li>
            <li> After some consideration, I figured the cost of one 2.6 ounce tube of this was even cheaper than my three product regimen of the other brand, so I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I switch it up sometimes with other moisturizers in between and stuff</li>
            <li> of other people&#x27;s review</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> dont get the extreme hype on this cream.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use as much as other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have used other cream and works wonder, like oh la la</li>
            <li> but im using this faster than any other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other cream.</li>
            <li> (this product is extremely inexpensive in France).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> only requires a small quantity and a tube lasts up to 3 months.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have said, you just glide this over your face - don&#x27;t rub it in like you might with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> But, a little does go a very long way.</li>
            <li> This tube lasts a very long time - I have had it for over 6 months - a little goes</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and sometimes get patches of eczema and have never experienced any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Very small amounts (like about a dime size) is sufficient as it sinks so well into the skin, especially with massage and pressing into the skin with your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if it didn&#x27;t work wonders for certain others.  </li>
            <li> I typically have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, dry in the winter and combo in the summer, and use this moisturizer year round.  </li>
            <li> I can get a shiny t-zone by the end of the day, but without a moisturizer my skin is very tight and develops dry patches.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using it, I was not impressed, but continued using it anyway.  </li>
            <li> a small pea size dollop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It it not worth the money.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve had to conclude that it just doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized the way I expected.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt rough and uneven, something I never wanted to feel or experience.</li>
            <li> began by using a heavy layer of this cream, as my skin was so dry and uneven.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s unlike any other moisturizer I have tried in that respect; it glides on like a dream!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than some other creams to soak into my face before I can apply makeup</li>
            <li> Many of the largely high end products on which I once relied now cause stinging at the least and rashes at worst.  </li>
            <li> This cream is extremely hydrating, but without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> No more dry flakey skin!</li>
            <li> Rather than retaining/bringing hydration to my face (that&#x27;s where the slight let-down comes from)</li>
            <li> Wrinkles seemed much less noticable.  </li>
            <li> I less than one week</li>
            <li> I was previously using.</li>
            <li> The only thing that had worked for me was La Mer which is freakin expensive, &gt; $100 for a tiny jar of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I typically have combination/oily skin</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the Pixiwoo sisters &amp; the highly recommend this line of skin care.</li>
            <li> A makeup artist recommended this moisturizer when I complained that my cheeks are always dry.</li>
            <li> However, I prefer this as my winter moisturizer; now that its getting warmer I may find something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little bit like a primer too.</li>
            <li> I think this tube, even using once or sometimes twice a day, will last me a couple of months, at least!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit for it to absorb, so I put it on after I wash my face and let it set for a bit before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence for a little while, wondering what could this cream do that nothing in my drugstore couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little is needed for priming/daily moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit heavier</li>
            <li> It can get a little greasy looking, so just use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I had allergy a little</li>
            <li> I like this product because it moisturizes enough that my cheeks (which are very dry) do not feel tight and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> This product is a little too heavy for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on dullness and uneven patches, and of course those little flaky spots are either gone or almost gone.</li>
            <li> But wait-- tack on the words &amp;#34;French&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cult classic&amp;#34; and watch them go crazy declaring &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; status, despite those very ingredients.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wear too much makeup, or don&#x27;t like the feeling Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream leaves, then you might like this as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I think think this may be too heavy for you.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Trick Tip: To eke out every last bit of cream from this metal tube, i use a &amp;#34;wringer&amp;#34;, my secret weapon:</li>
            <li> B003XKEK50 Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> After using it 2x a day, everyday for 2 wks.</li>
            <li> Can be worn day or night, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, I apply it as a moisturizer and let it soak in for a few minutes before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> but it got to be too heavy for the warmer months.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it in makeup school a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Kind of boring to me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy...</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my skin, caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need heavy face lotion.</li>
            <li> It never feels heavy or greasy on my face, either.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that after switching to this moisturizer, my skin has been experiencing less break outs!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out any worse than normal.</li>
            <li> my  under eyes feel too rubbed and raw</li>
            <li> I live in the chilly Northeast, and started using this creme a month ago.  </li>
            <li> It bit oily for my skin, but so far it has not break me out or give me any other bad side effects yet.</li>
            <li> it use a very little and allow skin to soak it in still use a small amount of primer.</li>
            <li> I small pea size amount is all I use.</li>
            <li> Usually when i put on a cream</li>
            <li> Just a sweep of bronzer and my usual eye make up.   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so oily that my t-zone is an oil slick.</li>
            <li> but it did not lighten the small hyperpigmentation I have on my cheekbone.</li>
            <li> I usually  jump around with them, but I&#x27;ve bought this 3 times and plan to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> and it works on my skin year round!</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a face lotion for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> I dont usually use creams, I heard of this brand through a self makeup course that I did and decided to  try it.....</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the Mary Kay #2 Moisturizer of times past.</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night, and use something with spf in the morning.</li>
            <li> It hydrates without leaving you greasy or feeling oily slick after.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick but does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product will work in the humid summers we have here in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li> not sure what the hype is</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be the cure-all but sadly, it does not give me long-lasting dry skin relief.  </li>
            <li> ( i dont rub my face hard at all, i will use upward strokes to put on creams), but i can&#x27;t describe how this cream made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll also use it to take off hard to remove eye makeup and not irritate my skin</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in U.S. stores</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make me oily, at least not that I can pinpoint.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a friend, and I will honestly never buy another moisturizer ever again.</li>
            <li> skin has been put through the ringer lately.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow, especially in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> however that was secondary to me</li>
            <li> but I was a bit nervous as this seems on the thick side, but it&#x27;s not gloopy.     </li>
            <li> I like to use this cream at night because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and creamy and melts into your skin without leaving your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not sticky or thick like a paste.</li>
            <li> Everything makes me an oil slick, breaks me out or causes the scaling to be worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like the moisturizer, but I feel there is a slight mismatch between the texture of the moisturizer itself</li>
            <li> its cold and dry here in MN and this stuff works on my acne prone skin without breaking me out</li>
            <li> The dry patches would show through my makeup, flakes of skin just coming off, and the dryness would itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously like my crack.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes that it would revive my skin that had become dry and flaky with the cold winter.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have super oily skin, acne and a terrible case of Seborrheic dermatitis which causes unbearable scaling on my face.</li>
            <li> I let my son try it who has really bad eczema around his neck, it moisturized it and kept it from getting dry to cause him itchiness.</li>
            <li> A waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken me out, I have normal-combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> (He secretly loves it also).  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be addicted.</li>
            <li> I was getting breakouts and felt like every lotion/cleanser combo I was trying was making it worse.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m actually having an annoying allergy after using this product.</li>
            <li> It is very thin, but feels really bad and gross on the skin.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is to exfoliate and tone your skin before applying this and if the air is very cold and dry pat</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic change in my skin since beginning use and will continue to order this product from now on.</li>
            <li> My tube got bent somehow and now lotion oozes out from two points on the sides, making it very inconvenient to bring places.</li>
            <li> The products I had been using were costing me almost $40 (if not more), so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, its not for me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First it contains fragrance (which is completely unnecessary!)</li>
            <li> so I was unable to keep using the product.</li>
            <li> The product is bad, but it is not nearly as good as those reviews said.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive and very expensive stuff until someone recommended this.  </li>
            <li> Also considering I am from Houston, Humidity is terrible down here</li>
            <li> I use during the cold weather all over my face and neck, before I put on Daywear tint with SPF.</li>
            <li> I did not like this cream..broke me out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid this cream was a letdown.  </li>
            <li> this made me break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> For anyone who over exfoliates, uses a Dermaroller, or goes crazy with their Clarisonic; this cream is a must have.</li>
            <li> : If I&#x27;m traveling or in a rush, I use this to wash my makeup off like a cold cream.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a residue on my skin in comparison to Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream.</li>
            <li> I was just so frustrated with my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was terrible unfortunately</li>
            <li> I really hate to leave a bad comment</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> But,.... I feel stupid for spending $20 on a hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily skin, even though I&amp;#34;m in my 50s, and hate greasy, gooey moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to react badly to chemicals and perfumes can give me a headache, so when I heard about this unscented, paraben-free formula, I had to try it!</li>
            <li> I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I HATE this product!!</li>
            <li> and this helped get me through the nasty winter of 2015 with no flaky skin!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I swear by this moisturizer for my very dry skin. Never greasy, perfect amount of moisture. I&#x27;ve noticed it helps my makeup stay on longer as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer. I usually use Dermalogica Intensive Moisture because it&#x27;s one of the only products that doesn&#x27;t break me out but thought I would give this a try since it&#x27;s slightly less expensive and had good reviews. While it did just as good a job keeping my skin hydrated, every time I used it, I broke out - one or two significant blemishes - usually one on my forehead and the other on my cheek. Other reviews had mentioned that and I was hoping it would not be the case, but after giving it a try at different times over the course of a couple of months, I had to toss it in the drawer. If you have super-sensitive skin like I do, you will probably want to skip this one.</li>
            <li> This product is a dream. My makeup designer used it, and now I use it (1) as a mask once a week and (2) as a primer (over sunscreen) for a flawless foundation coverage.</li>
            <li> I read good things about this product on several beauty blogs and decided to try it. I have been using it as my daily a.m. moisturizer for a couple months and I really like it. I have dry skin and use a host of other products to treat various things, so I was happy that this was moisturizing yet gentle. A little goes a long way with this product. I had no irritation from this and love the improved texture of my skin. However, I prefer this as my winter moisturizer; now that its getting warmer I may find something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this baby has a cult following. It&#x27;s awesome! While I can&#x27;t say how this compares to fancier, pricier creams (my skin regime is ultra minimal), I can tell you that I really love this one. I always find my skin to be smoother, softer and brighter the morning after liberally applying the night before.</li>
            <li> Just love this cream!!! Smells amazing and is an excellent foundation for skin care. My skin feels amazing smoother since I&#x27;ve been using this cream.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. As soon as applied the skin absorb it like a sponge and feels immediately softer and smoother. Love it. I keep buying it as one of my favorite health product!</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer... I&#x27;ve been using Creme de La Mer as my moisturizer and let me tell you this product is just as amazing as my La Mer. I especially like using this at night, when I wake up I got that really soft texture on my skin and it feels dewy without being sticky.  I believe this product is great if you have dry or combination skin like me.  If you have oily skin I think think this may be too heavy for you. I will definitely get a second one just in case, for less than $20 its worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. I use it around the eyes too and it does not sting like other ones. I use retin a at night and this during day and I am loving it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after hearing the Pixiwoo sisters (Sam and Nic) rave about it for ages. It is an absolutely wonderful moisturizer. It smells like roses. It is very moisturizing and hydrating. My skin feels very healthy after using it for a few weeks. The only drawback is that if you have very sensitive skin the fragrance may bother you.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t see anything special about it compared to other moisturizers in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer to wear right before putting on foundation and full make up. Gives a beautiful glow finish.</li>
            <li> a good basic moistuaizer, does not work for my sensitive eczema skin because of the fragrance. i got a red and flaky reaction after applying this. will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I purchased a moisturizer from Mary Kay which burned my face and left me with pealing skin for $90.00. I have extremely sensitive skin.. I borrowed this from my sister to help with the redness and pealing. It not only helps but my skin is not has never felt so soft. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! And the price is great!</li>
            <li> nice cream for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Dewy, youthful skin at 49 IS possible.  ...Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good performance totally works a hole day of winter ! No dry when wearing powder of my face!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have extremely dry skin about 5 months of the year in the Midwest where I currently live and nothing helps it much: oils, serums.... this is a nice touch on top of my oils/serums. Works out well for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer! I put it on last night and my skin felt very soft and moisturized the next morning. Its texture reminds me of Nivea cream, which is great. I recommend it for dry skin types.</li>
            <li> This cream lives up to the hype.  It is super moisturizing and mild on my skin.  I&#x27;m now a &amp;#34;lifer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This cream is meant for super dry skin, so if you are just dry use it sparingly or you will be a hot slick mess after a couple hours. I use during the cold weather all over my face and neck, before I put on Daywear tint with SPF. But I recommend putting this on straight out the shower when your skin is still warm, and let it really soak in before applying any makeup.</li>
            <li> i really liked this product. It lives your skin softly and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for could weather, and for the price it works just perfect!.</li>
            <li> I read about this primer in a magazine. That was over 3 months ago and I&#x27;m already on my second tube. Since I am over 40, my skin is much drier. This not only moisturizes my skin it is a great base for helping my foundation go on smooth and refined.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer. Enough said. I have combination skin and this moisturizer (apart from coconut oil) is the best thing that ever happened to my skin. I use it in all seasons as it is  moisturizing enough for winter weather but light enough for summer. I just ordered my third one three days ago and Amazon shipped it right away. I recommend this to facial lotion to everybody.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine which gave it a very good review. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it for myself I can report that it&#x27;s pretty much exactly as described in the magazine. This is a really good moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this is for the dry skin on my face. I use it twice a day after cleansing and it&#x27;s just perfect. No more dry flakey skin!</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of Lait-Creme Concentre out of curiousity--it seems to have quite a buzz in online beauty circles (e.g., Pixiwoo).  The real star of this product is the texture--it feels luxurious!  Like others have said, it feels very nice and rich when putting it on (be careful of squeezing out too much--a little goes a long way).  So I definitely do love the texture--it&#x27;s unlike any other moisturizer I have tried in that respect; it glides on like a dream!  But after the initial squeeze from the tube and slathering it on my face, I&#x27;m a little less certain of its legendary status as a *moisturizer*.  Rather than retaining/bringing hydration to my face (that&#x27;s where the slight let-down comes from), it just seems to create a (slightly better than mediocre) barrier for my skin from the elements.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like the moisturizer, but I feel there is a slight mismatch between the texture of the moisturizer itself (e.g., how it *feels* when poured out and smoothed onto the skin) and its actual *performance* as a moisturizer.  Suffice to say that I&#x27;m more in love with the feeling (texture) of the moisturizer than its performance as a moisturizer.  If performance is more of a concern for you (e.g., hydration is your #1 priority, regardless of moisturizer texture), then you may or may not want to try this out.</li>
            <li> I am loving this moisturizer. I have used it every day since it&#x27;s arrival. The cream sinks into my skin and leaves it moisturized all day. I do have to say I don&#x27;t have any issues with my skin meaning it&#x27;s not dry or oily.  It&#x27;s been working great with my liquid foundation. It does feel a little bit like a primer too. Best thing about this product is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. I small pea size amount is all I use. I would definitely repurchase this product at this price point.</li>
            <li> my go to moisturizer. It works super well with my oily skin. I love love love this</li>
            <li> THE perfect base for makeup application. My skin is oily so I don&#x27;t use it for everyday wear. I only use it as a night cream. But if you have dry skin and have issues with makeup going on smooth, this could really help.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite morning moisturizer. There&#x27;s quite a lot in the tube, it lasts me about 5 months. The smell is very nice, and not too strong. I find this to be a great moisturizer because it sinks in quickly and acts as a good primer for makeup.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on the Today show by a Hollywood makeup artist who said most celebrities demand it. I was surprised at the reasonable price but decided to try. I am on my 4th tube now. It lasts 6 months easily and the best at any price for morning and night.</li>
            <li> Is a Great product,but not for oil skin!!&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizing is good for peope who have a dry skin or is taking care the skin with some kind of acid. I have oil skin and when I use it my skin gets more oil.&lt;br /&gt;Iwill not buy it cream again!!! But for dry skin is very good!!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin. I use cream, oil or soap free cleaners to minimize the dryness of washing my face. This does a good job, does not clog pores or make face feel sweaty. Just absorbs in fairly quickly and leaves me without a tight, dry face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I heard about it from YouTube makeup tutorials from Pixiwoo. My skin is normal, sometimes a little dry from using my Clairsonic 2 times a day - this stuff makes my face feel healthy and works well under my make up foundation (Laura Mercier or Make Up For Ever HD Foundation).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but this moisturizer does not make my skin breakout. No scent, lightweight and my face feels smooth. No dry patches even during winter time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  Excellent cream, not too heavy--not too light.  Found that I can use it both day and night provided I will not be outdoors as it has no spf.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I read about this in either GQ or Men&#x27;s health and I must say I use this daily. I&#x27;m not the kind of guy to ever put moisturizer on but this stuff is fantastic in the morning right after shaving. If this had sunscreen I would be set for life.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels wonderful on my skin.  Very hydrating without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Received this product yesterday&lt;br /&gt;used it last night&lt;br /&gt;and this early morning.&lt;br /&gt;Really like it.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now. At first, I did not like it because I have oily skin so it felt too moisturizing. But then after I played around with it I figured it out! I only use a small pea size amount and let it sink in for about ten minutes before I apply any makeup. I do not use a primer (never have anyway) and my makeup goes on SO smoothly! I use a \\&quot;stay matte\\&quot; foundation and I really do stay matte all day! If I use too much, I look oily but I take the extra off with a cotton towel. It takes a while to get accustomed to the amount of moisture it adds to my skin but this is now my HG moisturizer! I have acne prone skin too and this has not broken me out at all!</li>
            <li> I first found out about this from a blog i was reading. So i thought i would look up some things about it. I saw that it was good for a number of things and so i snapped it up straight away!     Since buying this, i have not been dissapointed. I have been looking for just the right moisturizer for a really long time now. I&#x27;ve switched back and forth between a few, mainly garnier and olay.   I suppose i will say that i have got normal skin that could be a bit on the sensitive side if i use too rich of a cream. I&#x27;m also 26yro and i don&#x27;t break out often, but I was a bit nervous as this seems on the thick side, but it&#x27;s not gloopy.     On first opening the tube, the smell instantly reminded me of a purfume my grandmother used to wear and it made me so nostalgic and made me feel happy!     Usually when i put on a cream my  under eyes feel too rubbed and raw ( i dont rub my face hard at all, i will use upward strokes to put on creams), but i can&#x27;t describe how this cream made my skin feel. I felt immediately &#x27;comforted&#x27;. It stays that way all day. My face feels moist but not greasy, dewy but not oily looking, ALL day. I finally feel i have found my moisturizer.     I have been using it every morning after cleansing (for over a week now), and i will &#x27;tone&#x27; my skin (if i feel like it:P) with just a simple evian spray and i pat my face dry. I then use a blob of this on my face and neck. In the evening i will take my make up off and after cleanse i will finish off with Trilogy&#x27;s Rosehip serum, which is also a great find. My pores are smaller and i do not need to use foundation! Just a sweep of bronzer and my usual eye make up.   Try it! You will love it!</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 4 right now, I found it to make my skin a little oily now that the heat is on. But come Winter I bet this is going to be great. A little goes a long way.If you use a lot, it won&#x27;t go into the skin as it&#x27;s needed. It will just sit on top and that is where you run into problems. Breakouts and oily looking skin.  But here is the thing, I found that over the counter products did just as well. Oil of Olay does a fantastic day product that I adore without the high cost. And my skin loves it.  So I won&#x27;t be ordering this again. It goes on nice and it does well, In the summer, I don&#x27;t like a lot of layers of products on my skin, it just clogs the pores. So I only use moisturizer and primer combined. This worked well..It&#x27;s to high in cost, So this was nice and smells amazing. I have Lupus and this keep my skin calm as well. So Yes, if you can afford this, it&#x27;s great. .</li>
            <li> Love this as a moisturizer and primer. I dont know how to explain it but it feels so light on the face. I originally bought it just to use as a moisturiser but I read that I could use it as a primer and OH MY GOD! My makeup looks so much better with this stuff underneath. My foundation lasts longer and the color just looks better. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I have dry/combination skin and was looking for something that could work on both skin types. I like this product because it moisturizes enough that my cheeks (which are very dry) do not feel tight and uncomfortable but it&#x27;s not so oily that my t-zone is an oil slick. It&#x27;s very lightweight and a little goes a long way. Because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF, I use this product only at night. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I use it every day.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  Leaves my skin soft.  It is great for under makeup.  I will absolutely order another one when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer for face. In the very beginning it feels a little greesy but it absorbs within 20 minutes completely amd then you see the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; on yoiur face for hours or more without the greesy feeling. Its a pretty heavy cream so I would only recommend it to people with dry skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I have been having issues for several months (maybe, years) with my skin changing. I am in my early 30s and my skin just hasn&#x27;t been \\&quot;right\\&quot; for some time now. I had been using a major name brand moisturizer system, consisting of a 7 step day moisturizer, an anti aging serum, and then a regenerating night cream. When I first started the regimen, it seemed to have an impact on my skin. However, with time, I felt like the results I had been getting were no longer showing up. I was having problems with discoloration, uneven tone and texture, very dry patches (especially under my eyes, around my nose and mouth), and even some acne breakouts. The products I had been using were costing me almost $40 (if not more), so I was disappointed. I had been watching some YouTube videos by several high profile, working, professional makeup artists, and this is the moisturizer they use on themselves and their clients. After some consideration, I figured the cost of one 2.6 ounce tube of this was even cheaper than my three product regimen of the other brand, so I would give it a try. I was just so frustrated with my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began by using a heavy layer of this cream, as my skin was so dry and uneven. Within one use, I could tell a difference. This cream is extremely hydrating, but without being heavy or greasy. There was some residual cream left on my skin the first time, but I didn&#x27;t mind. It was nice to have extra moisture, for a change. I just patted the excess off with a clean tissue. Over the days and weeks, I began to adjust the amount(s) I use. I love that I can do that- use a lot, if I have a day in the sun or my skin feels particularly parched, or a little if my skin is behaving itself. I&#x27;ve gotten to where I use a very light layer (about a pea sized) spread over the driest areas for the day, under makeup. A little heavier and more intense amount before bed, all over my face and neck, massaged in well. It has a light, but pleasant, scent (and nothing noticeable orlingering), and again, not heavy or greasy. It spreads and absorbs very well, and feels great to massage into the skin. I have noticed a dramatic change in my skin since beginning use and will continue to order this product from now on. Tone and texture have evened out. Skin feels and looks smoother and firmer. Acne has stopped appearing. I am so glad I finally bit the bullet and gave it a try, and even more pleased that I got the 2.6 ounce tube for the first buy, instead of the smaller size. I think this tube, even using once or sometimes twice a day, will last me a couple of months, at least! If you&#x27;re on the fence about a new moisturizer, give this a try. I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use this under my makeup and it keeps my face nicely hydrated, I&#x27;ve also noticed how well it works with my primer. My new to go product</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail item for me, I honestly can&#x27;t see my life without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from really dry skin where there is always some sort of dry patch/peeling on my face. This cream does the best job at keeping those issues at bay. It looks amazing under makeup and just makes your skin feel good. It can have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look on your face at first but once it absorbs you just look healthy. I only use it as a moisturizer since that&#x27;s my biggest concern and I really can&#x27;t be without it. I switch it up sometimes with other moisturizers in between and stuff but I do notice this works the best both morning and night.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!!!! It&#x27;s great for winter because my skin is so dry. It does make or feel like you face is greasy. It also removes make up!! Who knew?</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time reordering, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Wow! So moisturizing! I love this stuff. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth like a babies bottom. It&#x27;s not heavy at all and I think it would work on all skin types. If you have oily skin just apply a little teeny bit and it will go a long way. I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I was lookig for some moisturizing to apply on my face before I start with the make up and this one works perfectly. Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after hearing and reading about it. Unfortunately, its not for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, it didn&#x27;t feel more moisturized, more silky..the cream was \\&quot;just there\\&quot; on my face. I&#x27;m 35 have combo/dehydrated skin. In the back of my mind I&#x27;m also bothered that this product contains mineral oil which is essentially a by-product of petroleum. I&#x27;ve read articles that say its not bad for skin, but regardless I was disappointed to not see as many results as other users.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have searched for a multipurpose skin product and have tried many.  I am 60+ years and have put many to the test.  I came across Embryolisse Lait Crean about 2 years ago and now will never be without it.  Best product I have ever found, it does everything they claim.</li>
            <li> IT caused me to get pimples which I never do.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick, rich cream.  I got it after seeing a make up artist rave about it and thought I&#x27;d try it out.  It does feel great on the skin and has a nice light scent, but I would not recomend this if you have oily skin or skin that breaks out easily.  This might work well during winter seasons when your skin is more dry.  It would make a great hand cream for anyone though, but Nivea is probablly just as good, and not as pricey.  The morning after I used this, my forehead and chin were broken out, and my skin looked pretty greasy.  I tend to have sensitive, acne prone skin, so this was not good for me, but I would think it would be lovely for more mature or dry skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin a little shiner than desired, but it did have its benefits on my skin (redness reduction, for instance the following morning after application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite cream. Eliminates dryness without leaving an oily or tacky residue</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted! will order again. my skin feels baby smooth no more dryness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to watch beauty snobs pooh-pooh petrochemicals in their products. But wait-- tack on the words &amp;#34;French&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cult classic&amp;#34; and watch them go crazy declaring &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; status, despite those very ingredients.  Quite simply, Embryolisse is a basic, old-school formulation of mineral oil, water, fatty alcohols and waxes.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;classic cream&amp;#34;; an oil + water emulsion, developed years before anti-aging peptides and high-tech delivery systems. Think Nivea. Ponds. Rilastil (the Italian Embryolisse). Creme de la Mer. All contain mineral oil or a petrolatum derivative, water and stabilizing emulsifiers.  The secret to Embroylisse&#x27;s popularity lies in a truly superior composition that is feather-light. It absorbs beautifully unlike many &amp;#34;classic creams&amp;#34; which are heavy and greasy. In industry-parlance, we call it &amp;#34;cosmetically elegant&amp;#34; -- a loose, whipped texture that is so pleasing, sensorially.  A basic oil/water emulsion like this one will hydrate, soften and protect the skin barrier. That&#x27;s it. No crazy claims like wrinkle reduction, brightening, or skin refinement. It really can&#x27;t do those things because 1) there aren&#x27;t high % of actives to make those claims, and 2) it&#x27;s just meant to do one thing really well: Provide great moisturization.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;... but a really good basic, like that classic black pencil skirt that makes you look fabulous each time.  Trick Tip: To eke out every last bit of cream from this metal tube, i use a &amp;#34;wringer&amp;#34;, my secret weapon: [[ASIN:B003XKEK50 Heavy Duty All Metal Tube Wringer By Gill Manufacturing]]</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It really makes your skin feel nice and silky. It is great for dry and sensitive skin like mine. I love it</li>
            <li> Amazing cream for my dry-normal skin. It is light yet creamy in consistent. It is not too rich. I have also noticed that after switching to this moisturizer, my skin has been experiencing less break outs! I feel like my skincare routine has finally stabilize after this staple item. Now I am too lazy to search for another one because I know this one never fails. I love it! This is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very high expectation of this product bec. of other people&#x27;s review but I guess it did not meet mine. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but it did not lighten the small hyperpigmentation I have on my cheekbone. Unlike Dermalogica w/c almost erase it before I stop using to try this product. After using it 2x a day, everyday for 2 wks. The hyperpigmentation came back even using w/ a separate sunscreen w/c  made me switch back to Dermalogica w/c is more effective for my specific skin needs( moisturizer/skin brightener/ sunscreen).</li>
            <li> I seen this used by may YouTube Gurus and decided to give it a try.  I really like how it has shea butter and fatty acids that are beneficial to the skin.  I will continue to use this and get one to use on my body.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  It is dermatologist tested and very gentle.  My skin was sooooo dry, it was starting to remind me of a brillo pad. I saw a big improvement after the first use.  It has made a huge difference.  It is a keeper!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just the best.  I&#x27;ve tried probably 50 different moisturizers over the past decade, and this is the only one that moisturizes really well without causing break outs.  It goes on a bit thin, so it&#x27;s perfect for day time under makeup.  Well done France....</li>
            <li> Best all around face moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> I used la mer religiously before I bought this stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s quite as good.. But it&#x27;s leaps and bounds better than anything besides lamer I&#x27;ve tried.  And it&#x27;s a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> Great face cream. I will buy this all the time.</li>
            <li> Honestly surprised, my skin had never looked better. Super hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> I use this at night since it doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen. Super moisturizing without being greasy. I feel like my skin is totally repaired from anything it experienced during the day after using this overnight. I also always use it on my face before putting makeup on at night as it is a really great primer substitute.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for all types of skins. I&#x27;ve been breaking out no matter what face cream I used. Once I started to use this one, my skin went back to its normal self within days. You only need a little bit since it&#x27;s creamy and goes in easily. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t contain Parabens which can irritate your skin. This cream is big in Europe, we are lucky to be able to buy it here at about the same price as over there. This tube will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and fresh smelling.  Absorbs quickly and easily into skin.  Found out about this product via Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s blog and absolutely love it.  Be care when squeezing the tube, though.  It&#x27;s a metal tube, not plastic like I&#x27;m used to, and a big glob squirted out.  I just scraped the excess into an almost empty moisturizer pot and used it from there.  Will buy this again.  Wish they made a big tube as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, completely hydrates your skin for hours. I felt rejuvenated and my skin felt very nourished. Perfect to use as a primer, I felt like my skin was soft and supple and poreless.</li>
            <li> Not impressed... The first few days of using it, I was not impressed, but continued using it anyway.  After about a week it seemed to transform my face.  Wrinkles seemed much less noticable.  Overall color improved.  Compliments came from many people. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This cream is not really moisturizing at all. It kind of just sits on your skin without absorbing.  The texture is not really like a cream either. It is very thin, but feels really bad and gross on the skin.  Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about a year and my very dry, 42 year old skin has never looked or felt healthier! Fine lines have disappeared and my skin looks plumper and more youthful. I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. I just wish I&#x27;d found it years ago!</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this awesome moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this is for the  skin on my face. I use it twice a dayand it&#x27;s just perfect.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much! she love the corlour and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li> All the makeup artists use this…and I finally purchased it….and now I see why everyone loves it!  It absorbs so quickly into the skin…I can put  my primer and foundation on pretty quick after and it&#x27;s not greasy at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was from a sample given to me. After using for 2 days I ordered 2 tubes. There is a very light fragrance that does not last long. It is a  very  light lotion and you only need a small amount of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream after reading that a lot of makeup artists carry this in their makeup bags. I&#x27;m always on the lookout to try new beauty products, in search of my holy grail items haha. Will this be consider a HG product for me? Still not quite sure. I have been using it more often now (it had been sitting there after I bought it weeks ago). After I wash my face in the morning, I would smear some of this on my face. Don&#x27;t rub it in, just let it sit on your skin and it will drink the cream in. I was told this could be used as a primer, so even better for me! After I let it sit for a minute, I proceed to brush Laura Mercier&#x27;s mineral foundation powder all over my face and so on, with the rest of my beauty routine. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out, I have normal-combination skin. This doesn&#x27;t make me oily, at least not that I can pinpoint. In the middle of the afternoon, my t-zone will get a bit shiny, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Apparently this cream can also be used as a makeup remover. Definitely worth it to try this out!</li>
            <li> Am now a believer and on the bandwagon! This stuff rocks as a day/nigh cream and I have combination/dry skin. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My favorite facial creme. A makeup artist I used to work with turned me onto this product and I&#x27;ve been hooked every since. This is also the best price I&#x27;ve found it for.</li>
            <li> This luxurious cream makes my skin so soft. The scent is lovely. I use it at night before bed and wake up with smooth, baby soft skin. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for dry dehydrated skin!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a good night cream. Very affordable. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! best price on amazon too. It makes my skin feel so refreshed. I put it on when I am feeling super dry and instantly my skin is recharged.</li>
            <li> I HATE this product!! I have combination skin and it broke me out like hell ,, When I first tried it I broke out the next day and I didn&#x27;t gave up on this product since I heard a lot of positive feedback from many people,, when my skin cleared up 10 days later I decided to give it a second chance but it broke me out again ,, not recommend it for those with oily or combination skin , maybe to thoses with extremely dry skin might like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searching for a good moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and this is the one! I used many high end products and didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin hydration and softer texture. And the plus didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and saw a reduction in how oily my skin was and didn&#x27;t cause breakout. Great for a night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I usually  jump around with them, but I&#x27;ve bought this 3 times and plan to continue to use it.  It might be more suited for the winter since it&#x27;s a little bit thicker, but I imagine I&#x27;ll use it in the summer as well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Embryolisse on my clients for about a year and it tends to work great with all skin types, (of course moderation may be considered in some) but for the most part I use this on every single one of my clients!  I keep two at all times, one in my kit and another at home.  Personally, I see how some tiny lines smooth out better, this works great as a moisturizer and primer so it cuts down my daily mu routine to a minimum.  I have used this with products from MAC Cosmetics, Nars, Bobbi Brown, Loreal, Channel, Dior, CK, Face Atelier, Kett among various drugstore brands.  I even use to prep clients when using airbrush and they love it.  I have not had any issues combining this skin care with my airbrush foundations, I have used it on Dinair, Temptu, OCC and Kett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging on this product is great, in original box with plastic cover, just as when I order directly from Embryolisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product.  Also considering I am from Houston, Humidity is terrible down here and it still manages to work!&lt;br /&gt;ClaudiaCMUA</li>
            <li> I have tried many many products to help keep my combination skin from flaking and breaking out with acne. This really has worked. A little goes a long way. So spread it sparingly but evenly. I less than one week I noticed no flaking skin on my face. I live in a colder climate and have been plagued with combinations skin. I have had no acne breaks out either. This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is a great moisturizer and wrinkle minimizer.  As well, it is a great value when you factor in performance and price.</li>
            <li> I love how it instantly it moisturizes my face and makes my foundation application look flawless. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I tried this based off a review from the pros at Pixiwoo and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I have normal skin, so I think this would be a bit heavy for the summer and it doesn&#x27;t contain a sunscreen, so you&#x27;d need an extra step/layer if you were headed out into any significant sun. In the Winter though it&#x27;s been just lovely. It&#x27;s keeping my skin from getting dry even with our wood stove running non-stop and all the dry heated air in the office. It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily at all. No heavy or residual feeling. Love it.</li>
            <li> I did not like this cream..broke me out like crazy. I have dry combination skin and this was way too oily for me. I am thinking this could possibly be used during really harsh winters. I will not be touching this for the remainder of the summer. Wish I could return this back but its too much of hassle.</li>
            <li> soft sand supple skin from using this</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, that gets even more dry in the winter. This product is a complete life saver for my skin! I use it day and night and my skin instantly feels amazingly moisturized. I was recommended this by a friend, and I will honestly never buy another moisturizer ever again. I have found my holy grail!</li>
            <li> A professional TV makeup artist recommended this cream to me for skin hydration &amp; foundation priming. WOW! I can not say enough positive things about it. As a space cream, it makes my skin appear plumper while the texture of my skin is baby soft. As a primer, the canvas of my skin after makeup application is like smooth porcelain finish. I. LOVE. IT. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Like this lotion but I find that it leaves my skin greasy looking. I have switched over to the Clinique Lotion + and for my skin it works a lot better since it hydrates more and isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> Awesome basic moisturizer. Can be worn day or night, not too heavy. I feel like the name concentrated cream implied it is heavier than it is. I will be buying ti again, but the tube is lasting me a while which is nice.</li>
            <li> This creme is great for setting makeup as well as moisturizing the skin. It was recomnended by my professional makeup artist and I love it!</li>
            <li> Pixiwoo raved about this on a youtube video and I purchase it, thinking it would be my HG moisturizer. I have used almost the entire tube now, to give it a fair review, and I am not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin, good or bad, and I would not recommend it or repurchase it. I like Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge MUCH better.</li>
            <li> grreat skin moisturier.  I use it and have rec&#x27;d to friends and now they use it. wonderful on skin.  makes skin look alive</li>
            <li> I used this based off of the great reviews other amazon users gave this product.  I have very sensitive, dry skin.  My skin was not dry or irritated at the time I started using this.  It made my skin flaky and red.. No thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries Embryolisse, It&#x27;s wonderful for a primer and moisturizer all in one...Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I use this cream as a day cream, and it is perfect for my dry skin. It is a great moisturizer, and keeps my skin comfortable and hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> REALLY gentle and soothing. Perfect base for makeup. Not drying or sticky. Nice clean scent. I completely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer cream!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan. I have combination skin and this keeps my skin soft without causing breakouts! It takes a little bit for it to absorb, so I put it on after I wash my face and let it set for a bit before putting on makeup. This is my new go to moisturizer and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> WOW!  Amazing product!  I will definitely buy this again.  I&#x27;m purchasing another so I don&#x27;t run out because my daughter is using it now too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for yrs and it works on my skin year round! It is a primer for my makeup as well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I found this product thru a You Tube review and i&#x27;m glad I did, by far the best moisuturizer i&#x27;ve tried to date. My face has never felt so moisturized and healthy. Highly recommended for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good for dry winter weather, but a little more greasy than I like for my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer! It&#x27;s rich, yet light and creamy. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the most make-up friendly face cream ever. It goes so well with sunscreen and foundation. I have combination skin. It looks a bit greasy the first 15 seconds you put it on, but after that it absorbs QUICKLY and TOTALLY. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a self proclaimed beauty product addict and connoisseur. This product is super emollient and beautifully priced. The winter months has caused me to modify my skin regime.  Lucky magazine recommended this product and I have to admit they did not fall short. Embryolisse was emollient, non greasy and silky. I even luv the smell.</li>
            <li> When I stopped being able to spend $100 on moisturizers, I searched long and hard for a high-quality, reasonably priced substitute. I have found several mediocre options in the same price range, and this product surpasses them all by far. Also, if it feels greasy, you are using too much. A little goes a long way. I also agree that it makes a great primer for foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid this cream was a letdown.  After using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve had to conclude that it just doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized the way I expected.  Today I put it on in the morning, and already my skin is not just dry, but flaking.  Granted it&#x27;s winter - but it&#x27;s also above freezing right now, and what is the use of a &amp;#34;24-Hour Miracle&amp;#34; cream if it doesn&#x27;t even last two hours?  Or perform any sort of miracles??  It&#x27;s almost like the Chapstick effect, where the more I use it, the more I need to use it later because my skin is EVEN DRYER.  Also, one of the main ingredients is (I discovered from reading a beautypedia review) just the latin name for mineral oil, which I believe is pretty bad for the skin.  I wanted to love this cream because it is French and I convinced myself that French women all get their beautiful skin from using it, but I was fooling myself and now my skin is all flaky.  So beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth in regards to my experience:  I have early thirties, pale, white-person skin that is sensitive and breaks out if I don&#x27;t use Differin gel every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Nothing good or bad. But I won&#x27;t buy it again. Since it can be replaced by other more cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> pros: i like this cream, rich, velvety, smooth and it smells v. nice.  sinks in pretty quickly  It makes your face feel soft and lovely for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons; I hate the metal tube,  i think a lot of cream is wasted when it gets low.  would be better in a pot so you can get it all, especially at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont get the extreme hype on this cream.  It&#x27;s really nice but it&#x27;s not earth shattering.  I know where to buy it, but dont think I&#x27;d go out of my way to find this stuff and it is kind of expensive for a small tube.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have very dry skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face but makes it feel moist.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample one day and think it&#x27;s a miracle cream. It&#x27;s a good heavy moisturizer in the winter, but what I love about it most is that it cures my kids chapped lips like some kind of medicated cream. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works wonders.</li>
            <li> As a makeup remover, not so much. I have no idea how the company can make those claims. But, as a moisturizer and makeup primer it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this helped get me through the nasty winter of 2015 with no flaky skin!  The finish is matte and never greasy. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very happy and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer around, just wish it had SPF. It lasts me a long time and I use it daily in the morning and before going to bed. A little goes a long way. It is most without being oily. I pair it with an SPF during the day and with Weleda Skin Food at night. Glowing, baby skin when I wake up (I&#x27;m 31)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product. I got the recommendation from mothermag.com and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I like the very light smell. The lotion is absorbed into my skin quickly so that my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for sensitive skin.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritate skin.  Has a very neutral smell.  It is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, and also one of the cheapest.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It is great as a primer and I use it with a Q tip to remove leftover mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer- never too greasy, soaks in well. I have used it as an eye cream when my sensitive skin got rashy, as well.  Good base for makeup.  No scent.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on this moisturizer.  It is phenomenal.  It is just different than anything else I&#x27;ve tried on my face.  It makes my skin glow.  I combine this with a little Argan Nut Oil and wow my skin looks and feels great.  I am 39 years old and starting to show my age.  But this combo has brought back so much youth to my skin.  I highly recommend and will be purchasing more.  (And I have tried a lot of beauty products!)</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer under makeup if I&#x27;m going out at night..  Thats only because of the no sunscreen.  It makes my skin look dewy and my makeup seems to last forever!  Love it</li>
            <li> So far so great. Love the consistency and absorbs quickly without leaving a shine- just dewey freshness that lasts for 10 hours or more.</li>
            <li> This item came in earlier then expected but the box was a little bent. The product itself is amazing so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was ok but not what I needed.My skin always looks scaly after applying foundation but this product said it&lt;br /&gt;would work like a primer and make my skin look smooth.It did not</li>
            <li> I really like the cream, i have very dry flakey skin and this makes it feel moisturized. My only issue is the packaging.. My tube got bent somehow and now lotion oozes out from two points on the sides, making it very inconvenient to bring places.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and moisturizing, yet not too stuffy and heavy. I love it.</li>
            <li> it is fine, they sent me the 65th anniversary one instead of the original one.it is fine.i do not think it is same. Original one is a little light. and it does suit for the dry skin as my opinion.Now it is summer,a little too strong. So i just wear the lotion and wear it directly. Still too strong somehow.i think winter will be very good.&lt;br /&gt;it does very good if you use it as the foundation primer.my make-up does really nature and looks clearly. My roommate found by hersel i am different,my make-update looks better before i told her.and she just grab 2pcs. luckily i bought 5pcs. haha</li>
            <li> My GO to!  multiputpose-cleanses, tones, can be used as a primer.  Worth every bit of the hype</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have never been so excited about a simple moisturizer. My skin is super sensitive. It burns when I use even the gentlest as advertised moisturizers. This is the first moisturizer I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t sting, not a little, not even one bit.</li>
            <li> My face gets serverly dry to the point of flaking and this has been the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that actually makes a difference. Keeps my skin moist all day and works well as a makeup primer</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a face lotion for the past month or so. I think it is a good lotion overall but probably not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Went on easy&lt;br /&gt;Was not very oily&lt;br /&gt;No offensive scent&lt;br /&gt;Moisturized well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Was not much product for the price&lt;br /&gt;Each use required more product than expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product alone is probably 4 stars, factor in the cost its 3 stars</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  The quality and glow to my skin has improved so much.  Others are noticing and commenting on it as well.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and have to wear a lot of make up to work. This really helps to moisturize overnight and it works well under make up too. I have been through a couple tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many different products and this is among the best for leaving my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Bought it based on all the stellar reviews and the fact that many professionals use it. However, it made my fairly clear combination skin break out pretty badly after the first use. Upon further review, turns out the second ingredient is basically fancy talk for mineral oil/petroleum. Double whammy and so i returned it. Search is still on for a good paraben free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! I use it when I wake up and when I go to bed and my friends have notice how my skin has a nice, dewy glow these days. Beware though, a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t have to use as much as other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer to use before putting on makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much! I wear it under my makeup and every time I need some face lotion! I am so happy I found this product!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this lotion in my Birchbox and immediately fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unseemly odor. I use it on my face every morning and evening. In the mornings, I apply it as a moisturizer and let it soak in for a few minutes before applying my makeup. I love how hydrated and smooth my skin feels throughout the day. At night, I apply it after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable after only three weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to engage in lengthy nighttime rituals, but I always make sure to use my cream. Although it is costlier than other creams, I think it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
            <li> The perfect moisturizer for all skin types!</li>
            <li> My favorite face cream. Lovely scent, not greasy and your skin will feel soft. Great to wear under makeup and I&#x27;ll also use it to take off hard to remove eye makeup and not irritate my skin</li>
            <li> love this product will definitely be buying more I have combination skin works well on it use a very little and allow skin to soak it in still use a small amount of primer. Love it.</li>
            <li> Moisture!  On my face!</li>
            <li> My new favorite face cream.  It really makes my face feel soft and pampered.  Soaks in nicely, so can apply makeup within a few minutes.  I previously used a quite expensive moisturizer, so am very happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> I like to use this cream at night because it is so thick. It has a nice light scent and a little goes a long way with this cream. I got it in my birch box and loved the sample, I was using it as a morning moisturizer but it got to be too heavy for the warmer months. I would purchase this cream again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Good moisteurizing.  May have even improved neck lines, though used in conjunction with new Elizabeth Arden serum, so this was not a controlled experiment.</li>
            <li> Very good cream! Loved how my skin felt after! I wish they would do one for antiaging, becuae this one only moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer ever! I received a sample of it in a Birchbox and was so happy to find a large tube of it. I have skin that seems to be in a constant state of irritated. I use it over a serum and my foundation still stays matte all day.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this product and was thrilled to try it based on all the great reviews. I have been having really dry skin since January (Thanks Polar Vortex) and it hasn&#x27;t recovered. I thought it would be better with summer, but with all the air conditioning, I have had uncomfortably dry skin. I thought this product would be the cure-all but sadly, it does not give me long-lasting dry skin relief.  I put a lot on in layers twice a day and my skin just loves it. But then hours later, I feel like I have nothing on, yet again. Every day I wake up to a too-dry face. However, it really beats the Olay and Burt&#x27;s Bees  I was previously using. The texture is lovely after you put it on - very velvety, not greasy and nice under makeup (still need SPF in the day if this is your primary day moisturizer). I&#x27;ll keep using but will continue the search.</li>
            <li> Too much, even for winter. I feel oily after apply on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not O M G, to me. I have used other cream and works wonder, like oh la la i can feel it instantly.</li>
            <li> Not for acne prone skin. I haven&#x27;t had acne in ages yet this made me break out like crazy. Likely the mineral oil it contained.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first. It made my skin look and feel so good. That is, until a day later when I started breaking out. I haven&#x27;t had acne for years and this moisturizer was the only thing I did differently. After doing some research, I see that other&#x27;s have had the same problem and probably due to the mineral oil used. I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and regret not reading the reviews first.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I received a sample in my birchbox and fell in love. The perfect amount of moisture for me in these winter months. I&#x27;m not so sure how it will work in the summer, it is a thicker moisturizer. I&#x27;m never oily or greasy, even with makeup.</li>
            <li> I dont usually use creams, I heard of this brand through a self makeup course that I did and decided to  try it.....Very Soft cream, my skin absorve it inmediately even I have mixed skin...Really surprised!!!</li>
            <li> Staple in my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> In the original product, as seen from the Embryolisse website, it does NOT contain parabens. So why does this formula have it? Does there need to be an ingredient list update or is this NOT THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts. This cream is gentle and non pore clogging. Plus you can use it as an eye makeup remover. Absolutely love this product and use it every morning.</li>
            <li> My skin has found its soul mate. I have very reactive, sensitive skin and Embryolisse  is my go to brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face cream!! It&#x27;s so light, non greasy!! Great for any skin type!  I love this stuff! I love to use it as a makeup primer, but it&#x27;s also very moisturizing, it&#x27;s great on its own also!</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing evening product. I have combo skin and it works for me during the winter months. The price is great too!</li>
            <li> Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream really is a wonder product - as a moisturiser, it leaves skin incredibly supple, plumped and soft.  As a makeup remover, it is highly effective and gentle on the skin.  As a primer underneath makeup, it holds on to foundation really well and - particularly in the winter months - stops the skin from dying out during the course of the day.  I highly recommend this cream which has now become a staple item in my bathroom due to its effectiveness as a great multi-purpose all rounder.</li>
            <li> Boy o boy did this do the trick! I was suffering from a skin melt down, it turned sensitive, my usual moisterizer was burning around my nose, mouth, and cheek area and developed some dry spots. Did some research and came across this, bought it, and now I LOVE it! It doesn&#x27;t burn, and keeps my face baby soft all day! Best cream ever!</li>
            <li> its cold and dry here in MN and this stuff works on my acne prone skin without breaking me out</li>
            <li> This is a gentle and super-moisturizing face cream that is perfect especially during the winter. Works like an $80 cream for the price of a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I have oily skin that breaks out very easily. This just glides right on, sinks in quickly and never makes me break out. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is nice. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> perfect for foundation of a daily makeup</li>
            <li> best face cream.  especially for dry sensitive cream.  a girlfriend told me of it!  thank you girlfriend!  she&#x27;d read about it in the wall street journal (of all places!)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy name brand department store moisturizers again! This CREAM is amazing. It is very hydrating and can be used all over the face, even eyes. I have wasted lots of money on other products in the past, but this cream far surpasses any I&#x27;ve tried. It has not caused any break outs and has a very light scent. (I do not like perfumed products.)   I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s available on amazon. Beats ordering from France!</li>
            <li> Very luxe and creamy. Acts like a much more expensive product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I heard this product is used by many celebrity makeup artists and I so understand why. It is a very gentle cream , perfect under makeup.</li>
            <li> My favorite cream of all times!!!</li>
            <li> Breaks me out, but smells wonderful as a hand moisturizer. But,.... I feel stupid for spending $20 on a hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Reminds me of the Mary Kay #2 Moisturizer of times past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, I get dry skin after shaving, one of the make up artists at my job let me use this because I looked like I stuck my face in a bag of crumbs. This stuff feels great and does the job, I apply it in the morning and I&#x27;m &amp;#34;Crumb Face&amp;#34; free all day</li>
            <li> Fabulous product in a huge size! Will order again (if I ever run out that is, which won&#x27;t happen soon).</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years. I love it. No break outs and very soft feeling skin!!! Nothing else compares. I even gave it to my mom and sisters last Christmas. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone rants and raves about this moisturizer on youtube/online blogs etc&lt;br /&gt;First it contains fragrance (which is completely unnecessary!) and is a known skin irritant&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I knew right when I opened it and smelled it that I would not be able to use on my face&lt;br /&gt;So now I use it for hand creme and it&#x27;s not that great of a moisturizer/I have to repeatedly go back and re-use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do see it as a great lightweight moisturizer for models and makeup shoots when you are taking off and reapplying makeup continuously but I think there are far better options that actually contain ingredients that improve your skin&#x27;s barrier and also don&#x27;t contain skin irritants&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also a metal tube that easily bends and cracks open exposing the moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I never notice a difference with creams, but in this case I am convinced. It&#x27;s done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer and did not have very high expectations as my skin is definitely in the \\&quot;fussy\\&quot; category. However, I read the multitude of positive reviews and comments and wanted to give it a try. I try a LOT of different things for my skin and rarely can find the right product for my complicated issues. My skin is dry, sensitive and I have rosacea on my chin and nose. Well, I am completely impressed with this product. It is soothing, moisturizing and it does not exacerbate my skin redness or cause break outs. I simply love it! Makes my skin feel great. It is great for daytime under makeup and for night time as well. The scent is very nice, slightly floral. I will definitely be purchasing another tube.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m too lazy to write reviews, I usually just read them but this moisturizer is so awesome I guess I&#x27;m carving out some time. I always have dry cheeks, especially in winter. I&#x27;ve tried lots of moisturizers. The only thing that had worked for me was La Mer which is freakin expensive, &gt; $100 for a tiny jar of moisturizer. A makeup artist recommended this moisturizer when I complained that my cheeks are always dry. Love it, especially for the price. It really hydrates and moisturizes my skin, no longer do I have flaky dry skin and I don&#x27;t have to apply this multiple time a day. Once in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. My skin is dry/combination- I can get a shiny t-zone by the end of the day, but without a moisturizer my skin is very tight and develops dry patches. This moisturizer really balances everything out. It almost has a matte finish, which prevents the t-zone shine, but still keeps my face hydrated and healthy looking. I love it! It sits well under makeup and you get a good amount for the price. My new favorite moisturizer hands down.</li>
            <li> ADDICTIVE. That&#x27;s the key word for this product. I&#x27;ve heard so much about this cream, that makeup artists (such as Lisa Eldrige and many others) really enjoy using this product because of its properties in terms of skincare and priming the skin for makeup. And it is addictive when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: Combo/Oily skin, Acne-prone, Oily T-zone with Dry cheeks and jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been put through the ringer lately. If it wasn&#x27;t the acne, it was the overt dryness caused by the treatments. My skin felt rough and uneven, something I never wanted to feel or experience. The dry patches would show through my makeup, flakes of skin just coming off, and the dryness would itch like crazy. I&#x27;ve dealt with my oily T-zone for years, and I have plenty of tricks to take care of that particular issue, so to be assaulted by dryness and flaking and itching was out of my depth. Hydrocortizone only worked so long and anything heavier would turn my face into a grease ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hearing about this cream from many different sources, so I looked it up on an article about Top French Pharmacy products I found on Pinterest. I looked around, read a few blogs, and found it on Amazon, ready to order. I was on the fence for a little while, wondering what could this cream do that nothing in my drugstore couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, it could do a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is the original product. Everything checked out when I received the cream. The tube was metal, so serious attempts at keeping the product fresh and sterile were made. The cream itself is extremely light and fluffy in texture, not heavy at all or loaded with grease/petroleum/vaseline. But, a little does go a very long way. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that mentioned the tendency to get greasy, but that is only when too much is applied. Very small amounts (like about a dime size) is sufficient as it sinks so well into the skin, especially with massage and pressing into the skin with your hands. Very relaxing after a shower, and practically scentless for sensitive skins/noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to take this cream for a real workout, so lately I&#x27;ve been stepping up my acne regiment to help my skin&#x27;s condition, and this unfortunately can be very drying as I&#x27;m using pure salicylic acid mixed with a gentle, soap-free cleanser. This is both my face wash and exfoliator. Seems kinda harsh, but over time my skin&#x27;s gotten better. After cleansing and toning, I apply this cream all over my face and neck and jaw, and I kid you not, my skin feels unbelievably smooth! Freshly scrubbed, gently toned, and richly moisturized, it feels like brand new skin. My face has gotten brighter, the dry patches are gone, and redness overall has practically disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little is needed for priming/daily moisturizing too. A bit less than a night application before bed (which ends up sinking so wonderfully into my face as I sleep, so no more waking up greasy or gummy), and it takes care of all the dryness left over from the acne treatments, so nothing is flaking up underneath my foundation. Even with my oily T-zone, I don&#x27;t look greasy at all in the day! Sure, I do little touch-ups with a clear mattifying gel (Thank you Mally Evercolor Poreless Face Defender!!!), but I don&#x27;t at any time feel truly oily or shiny, just that perfect amount of matte and dewy that looks natural and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this a truly great skincare buy. For what you&#x27;re paying and how much you really need to use daily for your skincare needs, this is a bargain. The packaging promotes product stability and freshness, the tiny amounts for daily use and the extensive benefits from so little product, makes your dollar go a lot further than you think. It&#x27;s all about moderation and proper skincare practices mixed with that indulgent and luxurious feel of a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will without doubt repurchase this product. Heck, I might get 2 tubes at once just to keep tucked away for the future. I have tasted the fruits of the French pharmacy aisle and I want more!r the future. I have tasted the fruits of the French pharmacy aisle and I want more!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it would recommend</li>
            <li> I have tried everyting exept lamer.After reading all these good reviews i desided to try, so glad i did.I have almost finished my first tube , my skin is so soft, very good under any makeup, very hidrating. The only thing is where have you been?.I guess in France then.Cannot live without you now.Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was not happy. It made my skin break out. I guess not all things work for all people.</li>
            <li> This product is a little too heavy for my combination skin. We are approaching summer so my skin hasn&#x27;t been as dry, but I feel like I will definitely be using this come winter.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was introduced to it in makeup school a few years ago. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and doubles as a primer, which is nice because that&#x27;s one less step I have to do when I put on makeup. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product keep the skin very hydrate.</li>
            <li> Good basic moisturizer, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> check out you tube videos on this-all the rave and worth it. probably last me 3 mos.tube is not plastic, its more of aluminum container.  very hydrating but not oily makes skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product, and am thrilled that it seems to hydrate and do all that customers say it does.  I am over \\&quot;60\\&quot; and have de-hydrated skin.  I live in the chilly Northeast, and started using this creme a month ago.  I immediately saw results!  It&#x27;s not only great as a night cream, but I use it daily as my moisturizer and  it&#x27;s consistency is wonderful under my liquid makeup.  Now I won&#x27;t have to purchase any more expensive creams and lotions  from my esthetician.  I highly recommend this which is why I am taking the time to write this review.</li>
            <li> I used this product and while it was good, I saw no miracles; however, I&#x27;ve not seen miracles with any product.  It was as good as any I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve certainly used worse.</li>
            <li> Amazing and moisturizing. Has a light clean fragrance that I really enjoy. This works as a night cream or day,  if used lightly. I will absolutely be repurchasing from Amazon as they have the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have dry-combination skin (mildly oily on t zone, but dry on the other). I like it mostly&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. the cream feels light-- I don&#x27;t mean matte, but light as in texture. It feels almost airy and whipped.&lt;br /&gt;2. moisturizing! especially, when i use ample amount at night, my face literally glows in the morning and looks very plumped. It makes my face sooooo soft and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;3. Goes well under any foundation/bb cream/tinted moisturizer. I had trouble finding a moisturizer that doesnt roll off/ rub off when i apply foundation on top. (i had to give up so many of my favorite moisturizer because they don&#x27;t go under my makeup. i think it is just me, but if you do experience this problem, this is for you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. a bit greasy. It does not have matt finish, so you need to give it some time before it gets completely absorbed. I usually use it at night, and use something with spf in the morning. When I use it in the morning, I put it on right after shower, have breakfast, get ready, and then go back and put foundation on. otherwise, you will look greasy and feel a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;2. it goes fast. I don&#x27;t know why but im using this faster than any other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. But not too big of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do recommend it and will repurchase when im done with this tube for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s an excellent all-around moisturizer. Use on face and body! Great for traveling! Put on face before bed and see the difference in your skin! Good delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li> Great face cream! I have sensitive skin and I have to be careful with my face creams. This cream feels great on my skin and caused no irritation what so ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer after seeing multiple positive reviews and articles online. My skin tends to react badly to chemicals and perfumes can give me a headache, so when I heard about this unscented, paraben-free formula, I had to try it! It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs into my skin leaving a lovely dewy result, plus it doesn&#x27;t have a offensive or heavy scent. After 2 or 3 weeks of using this product my skin looked brighter and as an added bonus it&#x27;s one of the best eye-makeup removers I have ever used! I&#x27;ve even used this on my hands and cuticles to soften the skin in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I order from this vendor the product arrives within 3 days and is packaged securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider me a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li> Comes in 2 sizes: 1 oz and 2.6 oz. I got this at last yr&#x27;s IMATS. On their website the 2.6 oz is $28. I, too, bought into the hype. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer. Rich. I don&#x27;t detect any fragrance. The tube packaging is nice for freshness concerns, though overall I prefer the jars. It&#x27;s a nice product but I don&#x27;t see that it justifies all the hoopla. Great for the money but I will be using a lot of other things before I go back. Kind of boring to me.</li>
            <li> First off I read a lot of blogs that said this was the Crème de la Crème of the drugstore moisturizers. I thought it was just hype and that over time everyone would finally shut up about it. I received a sample of it and thought \\&quot;well here goes nothing.\\&quot; I have super oily skin, acne and a terrible case of Seborrheic dermatitis which causes unbearable scaling on my face. It&#x27;s a battle about which fight I pick when it comes to my skin. Most the time I go without a moisturizer but then my skin becomes so red. I even tried Cetaphil. Everything makes me an oil slick, breaks me out or causes the scaling to be worse. I tried the Embryolisse and my skin instantly drank it up, the scales melted and my skin plumped up. I don&#x27;t get oily but I always powder my skin. My makeup glided over my skin, which for me I thought couldn&#x27;t happen. I bought the full size in a matter of two days. I haven&#x27;t broken out any worse than normal. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have this my whole life. This for me isn&#x27;t a beauty thing, it&#x27;s a healing product. I have a good feeling this is going to be a life-long love affair.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to moisturizer. It&#x27;s perfect for my normal to dry skin. Even one of my friends who has oily skin likes it. It&#x27;s hydrating and not greasy at all. It sinks into the skin. It doesn&#x27;t break me out ever. And it&#x27;s perfect under makeup, your makeup goes on smoothly. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because a friend told me about it the reviews pushed me to buy. This feels like wax on my face!! Did not like the way it felt on my face or hands. I used it for a week just to see if would get better, wore it under my airbrush make up and it made me look older!! I kept saying to myself but why do I look older in just a few days!  I stopped using it and look like mysel again. A waste of money!!! Don&#x27;t know how it worked great for a lot of ppl and not for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin all the time, and eucerin with sunscreen  is what works for me.</li>
            <li> I discovered this moisturizer as a sample in my Birchbox. The price on Amazon is MUCH better than the price they were selling it for. I&#x27;ve used so many different moisturizers ranging from Proactiv to plain Grapeseed and/or jojoba oil. This moisturizer is the first one I&#x27;ve used that provides a perfect balance of moisture without being too greasy or making my face look oily part way through the day. Also, it smells great, and feels super silky. And you only need to use a tiny little bit to go a long way! Definitely worth the price per tube!!</li>
            <li> I first found this in my Birchbox. It is the first moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t drench my skin. It does not make my makeup oily after a 13 hour work day. Makes my skin manageable again. I would totally buy again!</li>
            <li> My second time buying this product. Great as a light moisturizer and makeup remover. No wonder it&#x27;s an industry favorite.</li>
            <li> This product does everything that it claims to do. My husband has skin that was severely damaged by sun exposure&lt;br /&gt;When he was young. The constant freezing and surgerys he has had left his skin extremely dry &amp; flaky. Embroylisse&lt;br /&gt;has made his skin much more moist than any other product he has used in the last 20 years. I will recommend it&lt;br /&gt;To my friends.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave about this moisturize enough!! This keeps my skin well nourished all day long!! I use it in the morning before I put on my make up and in the evening. Plus it goes into your skin instead of just being on the surface!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it after I shave and its really great on the skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizers I have tried.. light weight and hydrating! Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy...Even for oily-combination gals like me.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing a lot about this cream especially on youtube thought I would try it and its great.  I have normal combination skin and it gives just enough moisture and its not greasy at all.  It soaks right in to the skin.</li>
            <li> i love it! it is not oily. and after put this on, foundation is more easily to put on face.</li>
            <li> I bought this last winter&amp; I love it. I mainly use it in winter, but occasionally use it in other seasons too. I think the luxurious feel is even more than the hydrating feel it provides and at times it does need extra help if your skin is on the dryer side, but all in all for the price on Amazon this is an  excellent choice. I have had no adverse skin reactions &amp;  I do use retinoids so my skin can get pretty dry in winter. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think a moisturizer that&#x27;s meant for dry, mature skin would work on someone that has oily/acne prone skin but it works really well. I live in southern CA so I use this during winter when my skin is a bit drier but still oily, I wouldn&#x27;t use this in the summer because I feel it will melt off. This is a cream so it can feel that it just sits on top of your skin but if you prep your skin right your skin will drink it up. My suggestion is to exfoliate and tone your skin before applying this and if the air is very cold and dry pat the cream onto your skin, don&#x27;t rub it in. This cream has the perfect texture, not too thick not too watery and it smells kind of like fresh and floral baby powder. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its very smoothing.  Makes your skin very soft.  just don&#x27;t apply too much or it will make you really greasy.  i am very dry during the winter season so this is excellent for me.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product! I have been using this for about 4 years now and love it. I even got my husband and my mom hooked. This works great for sensitive skin and is very light with a slight fragrant smell that is not overpowering. I purchased because an English makeup artist and well known blogger/YouTuber recommended and has been using for years. She has tried and reviews thousands of the top products and this is still her favorite facial lotion so I thought I would also give it a try. I highly recommend. It is hard to find in U.S. stores so I am thrilled it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use some Avene products and this cream which is so gentle and one of these tubes last a while.  I am not a brand loyal person but I am with this and their face wash.  I very rarely use foundation but when I do I use this under as a primer which works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used in 30 years.</li>
            <li> This is face lotion is simply amazing! It has worked wonders on my skin and is a great everyday product</li>
            <li> Had high hopes didn&#x27;t work for me at all. By 4pm my skin felt dry and it hurt. I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other cream. It was terrible unfortunately</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased this cream, but decided to keep and use it. What a surprise! This cream is really good and healing. I will probably order it again when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers but this one seems to have the perfect balance for my skin (which is a combination skin).  It&#x27;s not too watery or too greasy.  It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking a little pale. I&#x27;ve mixed this with Bare Minerals foundation and it gives me a dooey skin finish. Definitely worth the money.  Amazon Shipping: I also just want to give a quick shout out to Amazon again for a super quick shipping! as always.</li>
            <li> This item works very well on dry / combination skin and it feels really good on..it melts right in!  I am interested in trying the other embryolisse products as well..</li>
            <li> I have found my holy grail face cream. This cream is very hydrating and makes my skin glow. It is a wonderful primer for makeup and does not leave an oily, greasy residue on the skin like most moisturizers. I wish I found this cream sooner. Next time I am in France I will come home with handfuls of this (this product is extremely inexpensive in France). This is the most luxurious cream I have ever encountered - my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The ingredients mentioned in the description here suggest that it contains all sorts of PARABENS! If you go to their actual website, embryolisse.com ,it clearly states that its \\&quot;Paraben-free\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if the actual product from amazon has these ingredients written on the box/tube or not, but the description here sure has them mentioned.</li>
            <li> I really like ti, it&#x27;s Very good for my oily skin. I reccomend and aldo the shopping and buying experience overall was very good!</li>
            <li> I first brought this cream from a pharmacy in Paris. I was so excited when I saw I could order it through Amazon. This stuff is so great if you have dry skin like I do. It hydrates without leaving you greasy or feeling oily slick after. It has never broken me out and I use this stuff for years. Love it</li>
            <li> For anyone who over exfoliates, uses a Dermaroller, or goes crazy with their Clarisonic; this cream is a must have. It will soothe your skin like no other.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> AMAZING Cream! I wish I have discovered this cream much earlier.  It leaves my skin soft and moist, without the greasy texture or feel.  I have oily skin in the T-zone, and this cream kept me look like I just applied my fresh makeup the whole 12hrs day.    I mix this cream with the Bioferment Sea Kept and it feels even better than La Mer (which I also used before!).  This is just an exciting discovery that I will be very thankful for the years to come.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my skin, caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> I heard about this moisturizer by a makeup artist samantha chapman who I watched online. And i have to say thank you! because this is a great product especially for the winter, my skin gets really dry. Great product for people with dry sensitive skin. Keeps my skin hydrated. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent shipping. I do recommend this saler.</li>
            <li> Feels great and absorbs well.... but it made me break out.  I am acne prone, but I can use olay products without problems.  So, now I just use it for my neck/throat area where it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> Oily or dry I think this could work on everyone, it&#x27;s a gorgeous cream, lightly scented, but that fades right away, I&#x27;m really sensitive to perfumed products and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me. I use it on nights I&#x27;m alternating out the Retin A and before my makeup, it only takes a little bit and it soaks in fast, been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> I love this product is prefect</li>
            <li> This product surprised me. I received a sample and decided to go with full size. It does not break me out, makes my skin glow without a greasy look. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> best moisturize ive ever used...gets rid of dry skin instantly</li>
            <li> This is really a case of &amp;#34;shame on me&amp;#34; for believing the press behind this, but it&#x27;s really just your absolute run-of-the-mill cream that doesn&#x27;t add anything to your skincare quality. (This isn&#x27;t a reflection on the seller, it&#x27;s just the product itself).</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is some of the best moisturizer I have ever used. I use this cream before I put my makeup on and my skin loves it. I stay moisturized all day and I think my makeup looks better when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great! I love the product and am looking foreword to using it more often! It provides a flawless look and smells great!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I depend on a good face lotion absolutely every day.  I was introduced to this product through another website and was happy to see that Amazon had it for a significantly reduced price.  It&#x27;s a great face cream for colder weather - it&#x27;s thick but does not feel heavy.  I will likely change to a lighter lotion for the summer, however this will be my winter face cream from here on out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously like my crack. I carry one in my backpack for extra dry days and I also use it as a night cream. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend it for daily use for those with oily skin as it can sit heavy if one uses too much, but it&#x27;s absolutely amazing as a night cream. The lack of fragrance is also something to behold.</li>
            <li> i normally don&#x27;t like smells in moisturizers, this one is perfect. i have oil-combination skin, this cream is perfect for me during winter time.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful - suits my skin in all seasons.  I apply a thicker layer in colder weather. So glad we can get this in the US and the price is decent.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and keeps face moisturized. Texture is nice and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I received a sample of this product in my BirchBox one month and immediately ordered the full size. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter, and this keeps my skin hydrated and glowing. Does not have greasy residue. Size of bottle is very good for price. I love it!</li>
            <li> Rich to soothe skin but not oily for my very oily skin</li>
            <li> I love that this moisturizing lotion is made in France, where they certainly know about skin care.  I saw two YouTube makeup gurus use this brand and I was so glad to see that Amazon carried it.  It is a very generous tube and because it&#x27;s concentrated, a little dab goes a long way.  I mix it with my Obagi 50 SPF matte sunscreen because this moisturizer has no SPF at all.  This product is light and not greasy at all.  I have somewhat oily skin, even though I&amp;#34;m in my 50s, and hate greasy, gooey moisturizers.  From what I could glean from YouTube, this product seemed suited for my very finicky skin.  I&#x27;m getting over a reaction to a retinol product I used a couple of months ago and since that time, my skin has become very sensitive.  This moisturizer has a light, clean scent but does not cause any reaction whatsoever.  I have used French skincare products in the past and have always been happy with the results so I wanted to give this one a try too.  The price is very reasonable considering it&#x27;s an imported product and the large tube will last a very long time.  It takes just a couple of minutes for the lotion to absorb completely into the skin.  I use it all over my face including my eyelids (although I do use a separate eye cream).  It is perfect under makeup; my foundation glides on very smoothly after using it.  I definitely recommend this product for those with normal or combination skin or those like me with slightly oily skin who prefer a dewy look.  I don&#x27;t think this is quite rich enough for those with dry or really dry skin, however.  There is another formula for dry to very dry skin.  I give this lotion my highest five star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 months now and have ordered a second tube.  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency.  Rich enough to nourish my mature skin but not greasy at all.  I use about a dime sized dab and mix it with the same amount of sunscreen.  My skin feels protected and my makeup application is perfect (I do use a primer after the moisturizer, which helps keep my makeup looking freshly applied for many hours).  It takes about 2 minutes to completely absorb.  Although my T zone is somewhat oily, this moisturizer does not make my face look greasy, only dewy.  I do apply loose powder over my foundation, which helps set it and gives it a poreless look (ELF HD powder is fantastic, btw).  I also saw this moisturizer recommended in several fashion magazines, which only confirms my good opinion. I&#x27;m thinking about trying the BB cream since this product has met all my expectations. I highly recommend this product.o use a primer after the moisturizer, which helps keep my makeup looking freshly applied for many hours).  It takes about 2 minutes to completely absorb.

            <li> ~~How Perfect Can It Get????!!!!~~~~</li>
            <li> I have heard too much positive feedbacks about this product.. I hesitated to get it for a long time because of the shipping fee on their website.. It was 17.50 and up no matter how much you spend! I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase on amazon and the seller.. With free shipping over $25 purchase, very worth it!! Thanks to the pro MUA that recommended amazon and the seller to me.. I highly recommend this to everyone and I don&#x27;t think I can ever live without it anymore! I will purchase more in the near future!</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night, it is an amazing product. The cream is thick and creamy and melts into your skin without leaving your skin greasy. After several uses&#x27;s your skin will start to feel well moisturized and hydrated, skin will appear thick and plump (appose to thin skin) and will have a healthy glow. For me it also diminished tiny fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I also use the Embryolisse Emulsion Hydra-mat (Hydra-mat Emulsion) for my day cream. Their is a reason these 2 creams are so popular in France, together you can&#x27;t go wrong. Your getting a great value, I have used creams that cost over $150.00 and did not get the results I have from switching to this product, a few years ago.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing for my dry skin in the winter. I also used it in the summer and it still works well. Guess my skin is just too dry</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, so here is what she has to say about it: This cream is the best creme I&#x27;ve used since I discovered Neutrogena sensitive skin face lotin. I use this cream, and I personally don&#x27;t call it lotion because it&#x27;s thick and super rich. I can see why it&#x27;s so popular backstage during fashion shows. I love this product so much I make husband use it (He secretly loves it also).  After gently rubbing it in your skin, it makes your face super hydrated and leaves it smelling wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used many other lotions and creams, but nothing compares. A pea size goes a long way. I use this wonderful product at night along my other moisturizer and I can see a difference when I wake up. I even notice the hydration difference when I forget to use it. Just a great product. You&#x27;ll be addicted.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and is making my skin very soft. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! I bought two tubes of this cream while in Paris, and it is the best face cream I have ever used. It is also a great hand cream. Not to oily, nice &amp; light, it also smells nice. Two of these small tubes of cream lasted me a whole year. You do not need to use a large amount, a small pea size dollop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great. The price is reasonable and it does the job, moisturizes! I let my son try it who has really bad eczema around his neck, it moisturized it and kept it from getting dry to cause him itchiness. So not only did it work on my face but for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, this is my GO TO moisturizer for all of my clients (I even use it on myself).  In my experience, it has worked well on EVERY skin type I&#x27;ve worked on. It&#x27;s super thick &amp; creamy, but can be easily thinned down with a little spritz of water.</li>
            <li> In short: I think this is a great, basic moisturizer that does not breakout my dehydrated, acne-prone skin. I bought it as a multi-use product with full breakdown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer: I currently use this as my morning moisturizer. It sinks into my skin, dries naturally, and does not leave any sort of shine or residue. I like this Embryolisse moisturizer more than Cerave and Clinique. With Cerave moisturizers, they either broke me out or just sat on top of my skin.  I also find it to be more moisturizing than something like Clinique Dramatically Different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a makeup primer: I read somewhere that many people use this as a makeup primer. To be honest, I did not see much of difference. While my makeup stays on longer and looks better than without it or with a different moisturizer; it does not beat an actual makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cream cleanser: If I&#x27;m traveling or in a rush, I use this to wash my makeup off like a cold cream. It works well, but I still find myself double cleansing when I do this. It does not leave a residue on my skin in comparison to Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream. If you don&#x27;t wear too much makeup, or don&#x27;t like the feeling Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream leaves, then you might like this as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> So amazing! skin feels so good!</li>
            <li> This is what the beauty world would call a &amp;#34;beautiful product.&amp;#34; I liked this product from day one and about 2 months later, I still really enjoy it. I can use it day or night and it gives my skin just enough moisture that I need. I would definitely repurchase!!!</li>
            <li> The absolute best. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night and I like the way it soaks in and is not greasy and it is a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It helped to moisturize my dry patches and didn&#x27;t make my face feel oily. It feels a little bit heavier then I expected, but quickly absorbs into my skin. I have very very sensitive skin and struggle to find products that work for me and are affordable. I have been using this product for a month now and it has been wonderful. I&#x27;m not sure how this product will work in the humid summers we have here in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li> In the very beginning it feels a little greesy but it absorbs within 20 minutes completely amd then you see the glow on your face for hours or more without the greesy feeling. Its a pretty heavy cream so I would only recommend it to people with dry skin like mine. I also used homeoplasmine and prefer it but I still use this stuff!</li>
            <li> I would describe my skin as acne prone, but not overly oily or dry and this moisturizer is fantastic.  It is the perfect weight, not too greasy and not too light.  My skin feels just the right amount of hydrated and the scent is divine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin recently has become quite sensitive to many cosmetics.  Many of the largely high end products on which I once relied now cause stinging at the least and rashes at worst.  This cream does not.  It moisturizes and then softly disappears into skin.  No odor, gentle and soothing - and it doesn&#x27;t cost the earth.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because some Youtube reviews recommanded. The product is bad, but it is not nearly as good as those reviews said. It it not worth the money. I would not repurchase it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this cream and I was not disappointed. It is perfect for normal as well as normal to dry skin. It allows a smooth application of makeup. This tube lasts a very long time - I have had it for over 6 months - a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> makes the skins so soft that you won&#x27;t believe. only requires a small quantity and a tube lasts up to 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but this cream feels great going on, not oily. It makes my skin glow, especially in the cold winter months. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great Product , I have oily skin and this works perfectly without making my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> So excited to be able to find this product on amazon. I purchased the cream in Paris last summer and fell in love, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere here in the states! It&#x27;s a perfect moisturizer for dry skin. Thick enough to be effective, but doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause you to be too shinny. Amazing product! So glad I don&#x27;t have to plan another trip to Paris just to get some more!</li>
            <li> love the smell! but the major selling point is that it moisturizes and i don&#x27;t break out with it :)</li>
            <li> not sure what the hype is about -this creme just lays on the skin -just didnt feel great....went back to my good ol&#x27; eucerin lotion which i love!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and I like it very much.  It goes on your skin very smoothly and is not at all greasy.  I would&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
            <li> Feels a little greasy going on, but it sinks in well and makes a great base for makeup. My makeup seems to last longer and go on more smoothly when I use this. Just make sure to use sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin well</li>
            <li> Just what my skin needed, a lightweight effective silky sensation that lasts a long time, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this cream...  Have bought it more times than I can remember as in the end it really is the most versatile comfortable effective cream I have used.  I use it for so many things..  Removing makeup from skin and mixed with foundation for a moisturizing tint to name a few.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful,I will use this for the rest of my life ,it&#x27;s that good. I notice an immediate difference from the moment I apply it,will never use anything else again.....LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> A must have under foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for about 2 weeks, and i have to say i really enjoy it.  It took me a while to figure out how much product my face needed (and a little goes a very long way) in order to achieve the right moisture balance without looking like a newly waxed floor (shiny) by the end of the night.  So far i&#x27;ve had no breakouts from this product, no allergic reaction, my skin seems to enjoy it, the smell is very light.  I say try it, and if you don&#x27;t like it return it.  Side note:  I have combination/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was my 2nd time buying this. It can get a little greasy looking, so just use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and just right. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another moisturizer again. I use it for my face, hands, and everything. Never greasy. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This would be a good summer cream&lt;br /&gt;But for mature skin it&#x27;s just not rich enough , I think it is overpriced&lt;br /&gt;Will not be repurchasing</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer and love this cream.  Rich but not greasy, it makes my skin feel  dewy soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The smell is amazing, not too strong, very light and fresh. Goes on smooth and my skin looks and feels great throughout the day! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best basic moisturizer I have ever used. As a professional makeup artist, I love it because it&#x27;s great for even the most sensitive skin. Also, it has a smoothing quality to it that makes your skin perfectly prepped for makeup application. I don&#x27;t know a pro artist that doesn&#x27;t carry this moisturizer in their kit.</li>
            <li> Although pricey, this is the best moisturizer I have found for using under makeup.  I have super dry skin from using acne medications and this helps foundation to go on super smooth.  It absorbs, almost melts, into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave it shiny.  I only use it for under foundation because it&#x27;s so expensive, so I&#x27;ve never used it daily, but it&#x27;d probably work great as a daily moisturizer as well.  Wish it was sold in stores in the US.  The tube is aluminum, (as opposed to plastic that springs back after you squeeze it) so it&#x27;s easy to squeeze all the product out of it.</li>
            <li> Where has this cream been all my life? Seriously, this is hands down the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I have drugstore &amp; high end creams in my arsenal and this cream was worthy of tossing them to the curb FOREVER. I gives the perfect amount of moisture without being greasy, it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, and it healed my eczema on my face! When I run out I will be buying this amazing cream in bulk!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice, and actually has reduced the amount of acne I get during the winter. Its been too much oil added to my face for the hotter months, but during those bitter cold days this stuff perks my skin right up. Is rose scented and kinda smells like old lady lotion, but easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lotion in a birchbox about a year ago, fell in love with it, then found the full size on Amazon.  At the time, my skin was all over the board.  I was getting breakouts and felt like every lotion/cleanser combo I was trying was making it worse.  This lotion, for some reason, was perfect.  I typically have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, dry in the winter and combo in the summer, and use this moisturizer year round.  If I am feeling on the dry side, I will use the lotion on my entire face, let it soak in a while, then mix a little more in with my foundation.  My skin has been clear, softer, brighter, and I have noticed the tiny lines that were beginning to appear around my eyes are gone.  Love it, recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just perfect specially before applying make up&lt;br /&gt;it looks so fresh and glowing  and alt of professional use it&lt;br /&gt;just love it</li>
            <li> I love this moistureizer! Winter and fall I get really dry skin around my mouth and it&#x27;s back to normal now. Would 100% recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, so all I&#x27;ve ever really used were the simple Proactiv moisturizers because I didn&#x27;t want to put something on my skin that would cause it to act up even more. But, after a few continuous tries with no issues, I have been using this moisturizer every day for the past few months and LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how smooth it goes on and it just sinks into your skin, no white filmy layer, no grey looking color, it&#x27;s amazing. I can definitely notice the different in my skin, it feels smoother and idk, I feel it looks a little fresher. This is especially great for the winter! But, yes since it&#x27;s a cream, I&#x27;m thinking I may need to switch to something lighter with summer approaching, but this is a must-buy. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell, awesome.</li>
            <li> This was ranked highly and had good reviews but i did not read the ingredients before my purchase. Major mistake, the second ingredient is liquid paraffin. That is mineral oil a petroleum product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing I have ever used on my face. AND I have oily skin. A little goes along way only need a couple dabs. I use it every day and night and am just now ordering my second tube from earlier this year. Sparked me to write this review. When I wear makeup my foundation looks amazing with this on</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, but I wish there wasn&#x27;t mineral oil in it. Mineral oil clogs your pores. I will not be purchasing again for only this reason. Otherwise good!</li>
            <li> From first application I fell in love with this product and will continue to use for life.  My skin is extremely sensitive to harsh chemicals because of use of retinoid (tazorac).  This cream plumps up my skin to a bouncy and soft feeling.  After hours of use alone or with makeup, you don&#x27;t look like a greaseball.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: opening sealed with foil&lt;br /&gt;Smell: faint clean scent&lt;br /&gt;Color: white&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: not too thick&lt;br /&gt;Application: soaks right in with no greasy residue</li>
            <li> this is a very nice moisturizing cream and I like it and I have used it before.</li>
            <li> I had allergy a little</li>
            <li> I really love this products. Everything came as promised. perfect!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream.  Perfect for day/evening use.  Leaves face so soft.</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this product. I get super dry in patches on my face during the winter and I am so happy to say after one week of using this moisturizer I have had wonderful results! It&#x27;s not quite working the way I hoped it would as a face makeup primer however that was secondary to me so I am VERY happy with the product. No breakouts, no harsh fragrance and no more dry patches! I will repurchase for sure. (even though I think this will last me a long while)</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  My experience was great as I received this much sooner than expected!!  I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I really hate to leave a bad comment but I&#x27;m actually having an annoying allergy after using this product. I have a very sensitive skin type (dry and oil in the forehead and nose area, redness and itchy when the weather changes) so I choose my facial product very carefully. Since I moved to the state lately and my old products are running out, I have to change to another brand. I read all the comments below and it looks just fine. But after applying this to my skin, it gets itchy and it starts to cause the redness all over the face. I thought it was the weather so I tried it again in the night and I remained the same. One of my roommates suggests me to try another brand that she has been using, and it finally helped me stop the allergy. I tried to use this product as a hand cream, but it won&#x27;t work. I can feel the itchy starts after applied several minuets. Soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great super moisturizing cream!  I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for a couple years now and it always helps save me when I&#x27;m facing extremely dry skin, especially in the winter.  I find, however, it is best applied at night as it is quite heavy and may look a little greasy during the day.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of product that doesn&#x27;t just feel good on my skin, but it is improving it overall. I have very dry skin but I have used this every day since I got it and it is improving the dryness. If you have oily skin I would not recommend this product, but for someone like me who has no oils it is great. It takes a little longer than some other creams to soak into my face before I can apply makeup but it is worth the few extra minutes.</li>
            <li> This product not only works as a moisturizer, but a makeup remover as well.  That to me is mind-boggling!  I use it under my eyes for mascara removal.  I have very sensitive skin and sometimes get patches of eczema and have never experienced any irritation.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far is working great.. still don&#x27;t know if I would repurchase</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not greedy. That&#x27;s hard to find when you live in a humid place you don&#x27;t need heavy face lotion.</li>
            <li> Going against the majority here, but this did nothing at all for me. I had been waking up with more dryness than usual and wanting something just for overnight moisture, to &#x27;seal&#x27; in my treatment layers. Read reviews over several sites and chose this based on great reviews. I tried it three nights and couldn&#x27;t take it anymore because it didn&#x27;t help at all. Should have listened to PC!</li>
            <li> Amazing! What everyone says about this cream is true. This was the best price, esp for the size. I use it on my face, neck hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I can understand now why so many people rave about this moisturizer.  My skin is on the oily side, but this product still works great.  It is incredibly nourishing without being greasy or irritating.  My skin feels very soft after applying it.  I even bought one for my mother to try.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing! I am obsessed with the Pixiwoo sisters &amp; the highly recommend this line of skin care. This product melts into the skin very quickly for how thick it is &amp; is basically odorless. I am currently undergoing microdermabrasion &amp; chemical peels to improve the texture of my acne scarred skin. These procedures can leave my skin a bit dry so the embryolisse is great for holding in the moisture &amp; it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I highly recommend this stuff &amp; plan to order more products from the line.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I wish I had known of this a long time ago.  It&#x27;s rich, creamy and works into the skin very easily.  It&#x27;s simple and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It never irritates my very sensitive skin (I use a retinoid cream, which adds to my skin sensitivity). I smooth it over my face &amp; it sinks right in, without me having to rub it in or anything. It never feels heavy or greasy on my face, either. Very fairly priced for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I want it more rich than this.</li>
            <li> Have used for years since discovering in a favorite Parisienne pharmacy.  Leaves skin soft &amp; hydrated and will forever be a staple.  Thrilled Amazon carries</li>
            <li> Good product! Good quality! Very moisture and make my whole face comfortable.</li>
            <li> It bit oily for my skin, but so far it has not break me out or give me any other bad side effects yet.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and am on a constant lookout for facial moisturizers that actually sink into the skin. I really enjoyed the texture of this moisturizer. It has a light oil-based texture that is easily absorbed into the skin. Unfortunately, my sensitive skin was allergic to the fragrance so I was unable to keep using the product. If your skin is not sensitive to fragrance, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this a try. If they came out with a fragrance free version I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes that it would revive my skin that had become dry and flaky with the cold winter. It did exactly that! My face feels much smoother and hydrated after less than a week of using it. Like other reviews have said, you just glide this over your face - don&#x27;t rub it in like you might with other moisturizers. This was strange to me at first, but after a while it really does go on easier and sinks right in. It does feel a bit greasy right when you put it on but it absorbs into the skin in a matter of minutes and my skin feels comfortable. I love that it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin and instantly soothes any irritations. It feels like I&#x27;m really nourishing my skin. A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it in my opinion.    I typically have combination/oily skin and this works better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. It may be a bit too rich for summer, but we&#x27;ll see if it actually becomes an issue.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive combination skin and have been looking for a quality moisturizer forever. This stuff works great. Like others have said, it&#x27;s moisturizing yet not too heavy, and it leaves my skin glowing (especially when left on overnight). I&#x27;ve also started wearing it under makeup now that cooler weather has arrived, and it&#x27;s amazing for daytime use too. Good value too. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for nice price. Not as good as La Mer but okay while saving some money.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer ! It&#x27;s as rich as the more expensive brands without having to pay hundreds . Goes on beautifully without feeling greasy .</li>
            <li> I bought a travel-size to try out and I must say I love it! I&#x27;ve tried all drug-store and department store moisturizer and this is one beats  all. It keeps your skin moisturized til the next day. I have dry to sensitive skin and this helped my skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super allergic and break out when not using a good product.  I have tried expensive and very expensive stuff until someone recommended this.  the best face cream possible!</li>
            <li> First bought this cream in Nice, and loved it then.  So glad to be able to get it here.  I use just once a day, but find this is all I need to keep my face soft and comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this creme. I have dry skin and it replenishes it.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my complexion!  I don&#x27;t know what is in this cream, but it has help me get rid of some of my acne.  Can you believe it?  A cream that isn&#x27;t known to help eradicate acne is doing just that in addition to replenishing one&#x27;s complexion.  I am fan; the biggest fan!  I can&#x27;t brag anymore about this cream!  I&#x27;ve already told many people about it.  Although it is a little pricey, it so worth it considering how much it has helped me.  Listen up! Your search ends here...buy it, try it and enter the world of beautiful, healthy, glowing skin.  You have to try it to believe it!  I&#x27;m sorry if it didn&#x27;t work wonders for certain others.  I guess it is a hit and miss when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding, especially for dry skin.  The problem is that it&#x27;s fragranced which can be irritating to skin (depends on how heavily fragranced and how sensitive your skin) and the scent is distinctly &amp;#34;old lady.&amp;#34;  If they left the fragrance out it would be unbeatable.</li>
            <li> My favorite ever moisturizer. Leaves my skin fresh and it&#x27;s not sticky or thick like a paste. It&#x27;s like a watery lotion almost. Will be a repeat customer when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about Embroylisse through makeup boards and YouTube gurus. I don&#x27;t have overly dry skin, but I do have patches on my chin that are flakey. I am acne-prone, and of course healing acne is always scaly and gross. My skin is prone to redness and irritation, even after gentle cleansing. Embryolisse works for all of these issues, and more. I mainly use it at night, as it is a little too dewy to use under every day makeup, but if your skin is very dry this probably is not an issue. They do make a matte cream meant to be worn under makeup, and when I&#x27;m out of my current SPF cream I&#x27;ll try that. When I use it at night, I wake up to find my skin plump, hydrated, and glowing. It works wonders on dullness and uneven patches, and of course those little flaky spots are either gone or almost gone. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a miracle product because I do still experience some breakouts (though those are likely hormonal and I know for certain they are not caused by this product.) I have noticed that when I do break out, when using this product regularly, the breakouts heal much faster and stay red and puffy for a shorter amount of time. It used to be quite difficult to get in the States, but since it is growing in popularity it is more readily available now. I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends because I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten. I give it five stars in spite of the fact that I can&#x27;t really regularly use it for daytime, but it is a stellar product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating! Can be used as daily moisturizer or as primer before make up. If used as primer, it can help reduce the dryness of the foundation - highly recommended if you have dry skin! the con is that it doesn&#x27;t help the foundation to stay longer.</li>
            <li> Love this product it moisturizes your skin so well, it great even to use as a primer for foundation. Does not make skin oily or greasy I would say it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
