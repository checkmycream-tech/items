            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try fresh minerals.  </li>
            <li>Was bought as a gift, so I dont know the quality of the stuff, butit arrived fast in a nice package.</li>
            <li>They would be great if I was a call girl, but I really just wanted some natural colors.  </li>

            <li>I love mineral make-up because i have sensative skin and when i came across this eye kit for a low price compared to BareMinerals</li>
            <li>Natural and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day long, all day strong!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the make-up, but was hoping for a little bit better quality brush.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Bare Minerals fan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing thing is that it takes very little, and then it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I only hope that I will be able to find other colors in this same brand as I plan on buying much more.  </li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and not bold so you can wear it on a daily basis and to work without looking as if your ready to go out.  </li>
            <li>and I would normally give it 4 stars</li>
            <li>Even the white shade for right below eyebrow arch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used loose mineral foundation and eyeshadow for more than ten years.  </li>

            <li>and I generally don&#x27;t use highlighter colors.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this set as I was looking for Bare Minerals and this just happened to pop up in my list.  </li>
            <li>90 percent of that time,  I have used Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals exclusively.  </li>
            <li>When priced per item,  this is somewhere around 1/4 the price of bare minerals.  </li>

            <li> This is the smoothest, prettiest eye shadow I&#x27;ve ever used.  Amazing thing is that it takes very little, and then it lasts all day.  One little tiny container will last up to 2 years, I&#x27;d guess.  And the colors are great neutrals with just a bit of sheen.</li>
            <li> The colors look like what are shown, until you use them. They have a awful orange tint. Even the white shade for right below eyebrow arch.  Shipping was on time, and the brushes are great. I would not purchase again. My advice, just purchase the brush set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as I was looking for Bare Minerals and this just happened to pop up in my list.  I am a huge Bare Minerals fan but when I saw the price on this kit, I at least had to try it.  I have been very impressed with this set.  The brushes are worth it alone.  The shadows are good colors and tend to last throughout my workday, even without a primer.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> So beautiful colors, so natural. I love it and recomended this kit</li>
            <li> I like the product so far; but it would be nice to be able to choose colors -- the lights are really light and I generally don&#x27;t use highlighter colors.  I do like the bronze and brown and the brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used loose mineral foundation and eyeshadow for more than ten years.  90 percent of that time,  I have used Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals exclusively.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try fresh minerals.  When priced per item,  this is somewhere around 1/4 the price of bare minerals.  In my opinion,  the quality of the products in Freshminerals is unparalelled.  These colors are perfect for any skintone or ethnicity.  The finish is perfect without being too matte or too shimmery.  I&#x27;m very please with this purchase.  I only hope that I will be able to find other colors in this same brand as I plan on buying much more.  Also,  the foundation collection sold on amazon is easily as good or better than bare minerals.</li>
            <li> Loved it kit.  Having the proper brushes makes all the difference.  The eye shadow went on so smooth!  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item prior and I would normally give it 4 stars however I received the product  just over a month ago. I had not opened the package as I was waiting for the previous one to run out. When I opened the package the eye shadows were completely different colors. White, pink and green clearly not the colors displayed on the outside of the box, definitely not the earth tones I requested. So I am writing to let you guys know to check what you have received because now I am left with something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the make-up, but was hoping for a little bit better quality brush. I would rate the make-up 5 out of 5 and the brushes 2 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The eyeshadows are nice and warm colors, the brushes are soft. I&#x27;m not using the eye liner, but my sister does, she dait it was ok. Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> Was bought as a gift, so I dont know the quality of the stuff, butit arrived fast in a nice package. This was a gift for a teenager, so No complaints yet..</li>
            <li> Great gift giver. My roommate loves it, shes always wearing eye make up and why not go bare :)</li>
            <li> Been using this makeup for years. I love it. It stays on all day long, all day strong!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and ordered it two days ago so it came EXTREMELY fast which i love.  So far i must admit that i love this item.  The colors are amazing and not bold so you can wear it on a daily basis and to work without looking as if your ready to go out.  It has really nice shimmer to the colors which gives your eyes this amazing look to them. I work alot of hours and i noticed that it also gives your eyes this fresh look as well. I wouldn&#x27;t say the brushes are amazing but thats because im use to BareMineral brushes which i love BUT they are still good brushes to use. I love mineral make-up because i have sensative skin and when i came across this eye kit for a low price compared to BareMinerals it was an easy buy for me.</li>
            <li> This eye makeup kit is awesome.  The shadows are versatile and can be applied with a wet or dry blush, and they stay on.  The coverage is also quite agreeable and allows for a little blending and softening.  This kit is PERFECT for achieving that smokey look for a night out, or a light dusting for a day time look.  My only complaint is that except for the detail and angle brushes, the other brushes are really cheap.  I have my own brushes though ,and would recommend the body shop makeup brushes as they are high quality, come with a lifetime warranty, and wash very nicely.  Every girl should have a good set of brushes, after all.  It makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> I love the makeup that came with this set! Being natural alone is amazing, but looking nice and easy to apply are great bonuses. I bought this product despite the reviews that said the brushes were no good. I just bought a separate set of \\&quot;good for the environment\\&quot; brushes. Haven&#x27;t tried the eyeliner yet, but loved the rest!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Natural and goes on smoothly.  Quality of appliers is supreme.  Color choices go with every skin tone.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have found the eyeshadow I will always use. There is no waste. Unlike quads. I have had several half empy quads or duos filling misc. drawers for years. The brushes are well made and outlast my old ones thus far. When you want to get another color, it&#x27;s easy to get one or as many as you want.</li>
            <li> I like and use mineral make-up</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and had chosen it based on the colors on the picture on Amazon.  The colors that were shipped are not at ALL like the colors pictured.  They would be great if I was a call girl, but I really just wanted some natural colors.  Disappointed to see that this has happened to others too.  At least the brushes are decent, so I can use them.  Wish I could use the colors!</li>
            <li> When I received this, the colors of eye shadow that came in the package are darker and not the same as what is shown on the outside of the box. One eye shadow I received in the package is dark gray / almost black. I am not sure if I received the wrong contents or if this is just how they are. Probably won&#x27;t even be able to use these at all. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love freshminerals makeup hard to find and expensive, this was a wonderful buy and the colors very nice. Thank U and will do business again!</li>
