            <li> I first purchased this product at my local Mall. Love the scent. It is a very clean smell, and when wearing it I got asked many times what it was that I had on. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> this fragrance smells great, and it arrived ahead of schedule</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Clean and Fresh.  They stopped selling it in their stores so I was glad to be able to purchase it on here.</li>
            <li> Refreshing smell, without being to heavy or floral. It smells like your clothes when you have just taken them off the clothes line. The antibacterial soap that comes in this fragrance is wonderful too. It will be my new favorite smell.</li>
            <li> very nice clean scent. My wife loves this scent and it&#x27;s not in stores anymore. Get this while you can!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I would say that it is a little bit sweet in comparison to White Citrus mist, and aroma is stronger too. Still has its own freshness. I will use it less than my White Citrus but still it is my second favorite :) Deserves 5 star!</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected, absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> ...but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I use it to freshen my sheets, shoes, clothes, and towels too.  Wish they made a perfume version.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this when I  purchase it for hr as a gift.</li>
            <li> Clean and crisp scent--just like the samples we tried in hotels on vacation.  Quick delivery.  Yes!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this doesn&#x27;t smell a thing like the bar soap of the same name. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this a couple of days ago, along with the body cream and it is great!  Getting compliments everywhere I go! Smells so clean and fresh, like springtime!  Will definitely purchase again if they don&#x27;t jack the price up :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this fragrance for quite some time.  I love the smell.  Never have liked over powering perfumes.  this is very nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do perfume but had the lotion to his smell and just had to get the spray!! I am an avid amazon.com person and this was perfectly priced, came in very quickly and is actually alot bigger than I thought. You only need two squirts to last almost all day! I applied 2 to 3 times a day, just depended on where I was going....</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean! I recommend it! Really what I was looking for. I f you want to feel the freshness of rain, this is a must!</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE with the body lotion, and wondered if they had the body spray and tada....i LOVE it even more...Thk you...its even cheaper on Amazon than BBW&#x27;s website:))) Once you have it on, ppl notice it. It&#x27;s great. Not too strong but very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I did not receive Rainkissed leaves .. It was cucumber melon.  Decided to keep it any way.  Would order from someone else next time.</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorites from Bath &amp; Body Works so when I saw you advertising it I just had to buy. I am out of it now so if you ever have RAINKISSED LEAVES again let me know. The fragrance is clean and fresh and does not over power you.</li>
            <li> Very pretty light scent I love to wear and even use it on the furniture as a fabric refresher. Smells exactly as it&#x27;s title. Great product.</li>
