            <li> it is difficult to feel comfortable using it after receiving it not sealed.</li>
            <li> the jar was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Being in Colorado it is so dry</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and this makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, so even though this says &amp;#34;Good Night&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is different from what I previously purchased in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I actually like my daytime moisturizer for evening, because it is a little bit lighter.</li>
            <li> My wife regrets that you do not carry the Elizabeth Arden Velva Moisture Film, which she&#x27;s been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> but if my skin feels a little dry this is what I go to for a night crème.  </li>
            <li> Beware of 365 Beauty, all their client real reviews are for fake counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy that sometimes I apply it under my sunscreen in the morning before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a greasy, heavy moisturizer, but I like to feel that my skin feels like the cream is still there after 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies to cream and heavy creams block my pores</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used in the past</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed the cream you sent was not the same.</li>
            <li> the smell is very subtle and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it was listed as &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; but was not sealed in plastic.  </li>

            <li> I was so pleased to find my favorite night cream on Amazon.  It was delivered almost as fast as I could have made the long trip to town and the mall.  What a convenience. Now I know I will never be out the the Elizabeth Arden I have enjoyed for years.  Good service.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer especially for dry skin! Love it! Definitely one of my favorites, if not my ultimate favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> An excellent product and was sent as estimated good provider my expectations were covered is the first time you use the product and I like his size and texture the forum shows the reality and its texture is very good</li>
            <li> the jar was smaller than I expected. The product is not lasting as long as I was expecting , I have used Elizabeth Arden night cream for many years and I was disappointed the cream you sent was not the same. I had been buying it at Costco, but they do not carry it anymore. The texture and size of jar was not the same.</li>
            <li> I actually like my daytime moisturizer for evening, because it is a little bit lighter.</li>
            <li> Good night sleep was shipped promptly! Was amazed at service in getting to my door. I like this product but haven&#x27;t used it in a number of years. It has a little more perfume than I remembered. But the product itself is good. Amazing delivery and fast shipping. Ordered Sunday and reviewed it Tues.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a box that was not sealed in plastic (as all other EA Good Night&#x27;s cream is), is not the same color of any EA Good Night&#x27;s cream that I have purchased in the past, nor does it smell the same.  It is not as &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li> Works well and I could afford it</li>
            <li> Not too heavy that sometimes I apply it under my sunscreen in the morning before putting on makeup.  Being in Colorado it is so dry and I felt it wonderful for a moisturizer in morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product and was disappointed when Arden discontinued it. They have a product that they is equivolent, but it really isn&#x27;t the same at all.  I bought 6 of these from Amazon and hope it will still be available when I run out.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden has been around for along time but is something that I always go back to.  Its very rich, has a great aroma and I will feel that it moisturizers quite well.  Don&#x27;t use it every night but if my skin feels a little dry this is what I go to for a night crème.  I love that its been around for a long time and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> OMG, I love EA, you cant imagine how long I was fighting to get rid of one funny dry-red spot above my lip. Dont know where it came from, but it took me a while since I found EA and finally stop to use foundation, because my skin look amazing, even colour. I would recommend this cream to everybody. I use daily cream also, same quality-wont change it for anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years - makes your skin feel more soft overnight.  I have really dry skin, and this makes a difference.  I have worked for Clinique and Lancome and will purchase EA Good Night cream even when I can get other products for free.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, so even though this says &amp;#34;Good Night&amp;#34; cream, I use it morning and night.  I don&#x27;t like a greasy, heavy moisturizer, but I like to feel that my skin feels like the cream is still there after 10 minutes.  Some moisturizers seem to vanish as soon as you put them on.  This does an excellent job moisturizing and has just enough staying power to make my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I like this ,make my skin wet and smooth</li>
            <li> Lovely light cream. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite night cream and leaves my skin feeling and looking better in the morning. I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using it on and off for 5 years. While wrinkles aren&#x27;t an issue for me yet, I like that it hydrates my skin, smells good and makes my face look less tired in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream, buy it over and over again and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I like it has a very nice smell and good texture, goes on very smooth. Does not leave any shiny film on your face., but that is about it. It does not do much for your skin.Its a nice cheap night cream.</li>
            <li> i got this for a gift for my mom....she loves elizabeth arden.&lt;br /&gt;it was a great hit at christmas...</li>
            <li> Great! I used it every night and when I woke up, my face looks good!</li>
            <li> Nice feel, not oily.  Good fragrance but not too strong</li>
            <li> i am very satisfied with this product.it is a very good cream for the night with a good price.Fast shipping and well receptionned.Thanks</li>
            <li> This is not a heavyweight cream.  It is light weight.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or create break-outs.  Good use for a daytime cream even though it say night sleep cream. Nice smelling, kind of flowery smelling.</li>
            <li> My wife regrets that you do not carry the Elizabeth Arden Velva Moisture Film, which she&#x27;s been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;Will you start carrying this product?  Pls advise.</li>
            <li> i love this cream my skin can actually breath with it on  and the smell is great thats all i can think of to say will purchase agian</li>
            <li> great lotion, i had no negative reactions with my sensitive skin and the smell is very subtle and relaxing. its almost aroma-theraputic.</li>
            <li> It arrived opened!! I did not feel confortable wearing this night cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and at 71 still have strangers tell me, &amp;#34;you have beautiful skin&amp;#34;. I have a lot of allergies to cream and heavy creams block my pores but this one does not. It is also so refreshing and light that I feel like I am in a spa when I apply it. I love it and hope it is always available.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product,very light not greasy on the skin.Discontinued in the stores,glad I found it here.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
