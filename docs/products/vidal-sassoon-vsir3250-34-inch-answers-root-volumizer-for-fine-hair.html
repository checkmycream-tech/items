            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>I have never been great at teasing my hair and this tool is just perfect for adding volume at the roots.</li>
            <li>Creates beautiful volume in minutes.</li>
            <li>and I have to let everyone know what a great appliance this is.  </li>
            <li>I have great hair</li>
            <li>it does give a great lift at the roots.</li>
            <li>all in all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very nice heat control</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!!!    </li>
            <li>I love this thing and will not go anywhere without it!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this.</li>
            <li>I used to own a beauty supply store and have tried everything.    </li>
            <li>Nice.      </li>
            <li>I am super happy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Not any more though :)</li>
            <li>So, in my opinion, if you tease your hair and are looking for a better alternative, this is what you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>This is such a great find!</li>
            <li>I love this crimper.  </li>
            <li>With this crimper all I have to do is part the top layer of my hair and crimp the bottom layers just at the root that is it.  </li>
            <li>It might work if you have a ton of hair on top or some volume already....</li>
            <li>&quot; look is when I did it too close to the top layer of hair, and it showed through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I used this iron to crimp UNDERNEATH the visible top layers of my hair.  </li>
            <li>: )        </li>
            <li>I think it needs more insulation.</li>
            <li>I still spray the section with a good holding hairspray, but afterwords I can brush and run my fingers right through my hair.</li>
            <li>The teeth are just too fine to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a holy grail for fine hair.    </li>
            <li>and it works like a charm for fine hair,</li>
            <li>Fabulous tool.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and nicely balanced.  </li>
            <li>It gives just enough volume (not bump its, or beauty pageant style, lol) and it stays like that all day, and takes about 2 seconds to do.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try it after watching a video on how to use it and reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li>The lesser ones, available on Amazon, not so good.</li>
            <li>The is a true mini-crimper.</li>
            <li>The root volumizer is most useful when I&#x27;m going for a smooth look -- I just clip the hair along the part out of the way and then crimp the roots of the remaining hair, particularly at the crown.  </li>
            <li>It stands on the counter without flipping over, it heats fast, and it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally fine and straight.</li>
            <li>I have fine asian wavy hair that needed some volume on top.  </li>
            <li>I use it under the top layers of my hair near the crown, and it doesn&#x27;t show at all.  </li>
            <li>They get to like 450 degrees F, but make sure you get the PROFESSIONAL GOLD series from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li>after searching (yet again) for an alternative method to the tried and true (and yet incredibly damaging) method of teasing and backcombing my hair to create volume, I stumbled upon this video of a small crimper that was placed near the roots to help stand to stand out and create a sort of bump for smooth hair to fall over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, with fast shipping!    </li>
            <li>Such an easy solution!</li>
            <li>A little pointer, the more crimps you do in a row the more volume you get</li>
            <li>I also recommend Helen of Troy professional curling irons if you have fine hair.   </li>
            <li>It does feel funny at first but the volume lasts ALL day, even in this Orlando, FL humidity.</li>
            <li>Sure, it gets hot and you can see it crimping the roots, but there was zero extra volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have never reviewed an item before but this product was exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>The higher the setting seems to give the \\&quot;better\\&quot; crimp, but then again it&#x27;s higher heat which is more damaging to hair in the long run.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful after all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>On a positive, it does heat up fast.</li>
            <li>I think this works really well, and takes a very short time to heat up,inexpensive, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This works well on really long hair to give a extra lift at the top of roots for extra fullness.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on shorter hair that is thinning to give the extra lift for fullness.</li>
            <li>Given that you do it right, your hair will be naturally voluminous!</li>
            <li>The iron feels really sturdy, and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair so much volume that I never thought I could get.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item about a month ago and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Although, a person would really have to be looking to see any sign of a crimp coming through your hair so don&#x27;t stress too much over it.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so cheap and such a hassle to return, I would.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much from this 17$ iron however its my newest fav. thing to recommend to my customers for hair</li>
            <li>Simple to use, although I did have to pinch it closed on the end to get a good crimp.</li>
            <li>I would think that if you have thinner hair you may need to be extra carefull of the placement of the crimps to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show through, but it is worth it to give it a try if you want volume that lasts, and doesn&#x27;t fall flat.</li>
            <li>Am on Amazon buying a second one for my travel case right now.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this crimper my eyes opened wide and I go so excited.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair...not hot enough.</li>
            <li>Does it get hot enough?</li>
            <li>only thing I would say the tip of the device where you hold it does get hot.</li>
            <li>I have very very straight flat hair.</li>
            <li>My volume was sideways which made my head look super wide.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I just received this in the mail</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s possible that with longer hair the zig-zags might not show as much.</li>
            <li>all in all the packaging was professional, the product arrived all in one piece and works</li>
            <li>PS it gets SO hot your hair doesn&#x27;t have to be all the way dry.  </li>
            <li>it adds so much volume to my flat hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, lifeless hair cut into an inverted bob and have been teasing my hair to create volume for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that this is a Hollywood secret to all of those celebrities with fabulous hair ;)</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is heavy and moves around alot; this may work better for someone with</li>
            <li>I was speculative at first because honestly it just sounds strange and to weird</li>
            <li>The root volumizer heats up quickly -- the only drawback is the extra time spent if you&#x27;re using another styling tool.</li>
            <li>the iron will not clamp down properly, otherwise i think it&#x27;s worth keeping.</li>
            <li>I crimp a few layers just below the top layer and the crimps are comletely hidden.</li>
            <li>but that end is a little hot and can bother my fingers periodically.     </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair that is so baby fine that, without a lot of maintenance,appears to be thin and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>I had to crimp so much for just a little volume.  </li>

            <li> I had to crimp so much for just a little volume.  </li>
            <li> I get FAR more volume when I blow dry it upside down and use a root lifter or mousse product than with this useless tool.</li>
            <li> I usually tease and fix my hair if I go out at night, but it takes too much time.  </li>
            <li> It falls flat minutes after styling.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do, gives volume to flat hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is 3-4 inches long.</li>
            <li> Hold hair up and back comb down in ONE direction (not back and forth).</li>
            <li> It works well on me because my hair is pretty thick, and needs volume because it is heavy and straightened.</li>
            <li> i have flat long heavy hair.</li>
            <li> , you want to be careful that the crimps don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> It adds such minimal volume compared to literally any other method (blow dry hair up-side-down, hair spray the wrong side while brushing against the direction hair grows, teasing, extensions, etc), that this method is not worth the money for a new product or the space it will take in your shelves.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is not really thick or thin.</li>
            <li> One note, I have dark brown hair so the crimps are not noticible.  </li>
            <li> The sizes of the crimps are well hidden if you crimp at your roots.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but hate using root volumizing products because of the sticky feel, plus they weigh my hair down halfway through the day.  </li>
            <li> A little.</li>
            <li> And if you tease just a little after you crimp, the volume will be through the roof.   </li>
            <li> try a spornette little wonder brush.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money and time, and i kept noticing little hints of crimped hair peaking from under.</li>
            <li> I have never mastered a curling iron or blow drying with a round brush to add lift.  </li>
            <li> i use this everyday no matter how i style my hair</li>
            <li> This little crimper does work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for lighter hair.  </li>
            <li> but you do have to crimp very small sections of hair or else</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a solution to covering a very thin spot that I get from sleeping or a few hours after styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Stupid concept poorly executed.</li>
            <li> I would 100% recommend this to anyone who is desperately seeking a way to get voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am debating whether or not to return this utterly worthless item.</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair...not hot enough.</li>
            <li> This tool is a must have!  Creates beautiful volume in minutes. Several different looks can be acheieved.  MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> This little crimper does work! I have fine, lifeless hair cut into an inverted bob and have been teasing my hair to create volume for the past 5 years. Not any more though :) I section my hair like i would to tease it but instead use the crimper. I still spray the section with a good holding hairspray, but afterwords I can brush and run my fingers right through my hair. It does feel funny at first but the volume lasts ALL day, even in this Orlando, FL humidity. The iron feels really sturdy, and heats up fast. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is you have to pinch the end of the iron together to close it all the way. It does stay shut once you&#x27;ve done that but that end is a little hot and can bother my fingers periodically.     So, in my opinion, if you tease your hair and are looking for a better alternative, this is what you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I am debating whether or not to return this utterly worthless item. It adds such minimal volume compared to literally any other method (blow dry hair up-side-down, hair spray the wrong side while brushing against the direction hair grows, teasing, extensions, etc), that this method is not worth the money for a new product or the space it will take in your shelves.  Does it get hot enough? Yes.  Does it crimp your hair at the roots? A little. Not enough to create any noticeable change.  Stupid concept poorly executed. Try literally Anything else.</li>
            <li> This is such a great find! The is a true mini-crimper. The sizes of the crimps are well hidden if you crimp at your roots. Given that you do it right, your hair will be naturally voluminous! No teasing needed anymore!     I&#x27;ve been using this every day for about a month now, and this is one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever purchased! It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, with fast shipping!    This is a MUST for all perfect-hair lovers.</li>
            <li> I have never been great at teasing my hair and this tool is just perfect for adding volume at the roots. Simple to use, although I did have to pinch it closed on the end to get a good crimp. Such an easy solution! I have hair that is not really thick or thin. Medium brown with blonde highlights. I crimp a few layers just below the top layer and the crimps are comletely hidden. Fabulous tool. I am super happy.The only product I used was heat protectant. No need for hairspray, mousse, or anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a solution to covering a very thin spot that I get from sleeping or a few hours after styling my hair.  I think it is because I am over 45 and I have a cowlick.  I tried setting my hair with velcro rollers,teasing, and all types of products.  This is the answer.  It lasts all day.  My hair now looks thicker and you can&#x27;t see scalp through it.  It is very well made and nicely balanced.  It stands on the counter without flipping over, it heats fast, and it is easy to use.  I have never mastered a curling iron or blow drying with a round brush to add lift.  I am thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I love this crimper.  I have very very straight flat hair. When I saw this crimper my eyes opened wide and I go so excited.  It gives my hair so much volume that I never thought I could get. I would curl it and tease it but never got the results I wanted. With this crimper all I have to do is part the top layer of my hair and crimp the bottom layers just at the root that is it.  It last a couple of days.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after all the positive reviews. I have fine asian wavy hair that needed some volume on top.  I was hoping this would give me that volume.  I was disappointed.  My volume was sideways which made my head look super wide.  I tried on 3 seperate occassions with the same result.  It might work if you have a ton of hair on top or some volume already....maybe.  The teeth are just too fine to do the job.  I had to crimp so much for just a little volume.  On a positive, it does heat up fast.</li>
            <li> I think this works really well, and takes a very short time to heat up,inexpensive, and easy to use. It gives just enough volume (not bump its, or beauty pageant style, lol) and it stays like that all day, and takes about 2 seconds to do.  I use it under the top layers of my hair near the crown, and it doesn&#x27;t show at all.  The only time I saw a \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; look is when I did it too close to the top layer of hair, and it showed through. Also, I noticed even then that it didn&#x27;t show on my brunette hair, but it did show up on my highlighted parts.      It works well on me because my hair is pretty thick, and needs volume because it is heavy and straightened. I would think that if you have thinner hair you may need to be extra carefull of the placement of the crimps to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show through, but it is worth it to give it a try if you want volume that lasts, and doesn&#x27;t fall flat.</li>
            <li> I ran into this product and thought it was an awesome idea.    There were only two reviews on amazon, but I decided to take the risk and order it.  I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s a holy grail for fine hair.    Wow, I just received this in the mail and I have to let everyone know what a great appliance this is.  I have fine hair, but hate using root volumizing products because of the sticky feel, plus they weigh my hair down halfway through the day.  I used to own a beauty supply store and have tried everything.    I used this iron to crimp UNDERNEATH the visible top layers of my hair.  I instantly have volume at my roots.  I usually tease and fix my hair if I go out at night, but it takes too much time.  Now I can get the same look in only minutes.  I&#x27;m so excited!!!    One note, I have dark brown hair so the crimps are not noticible.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for lighter hair.  Hopefully someone with blonde hair will try it out and leave a review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a month ago and really like it.  I have a lot of hair that is so baby fine that, without a lot of maintenance,appears to be thin and lifeless.  The root volumizer is most useful when I&#x27;m going for a smooth look -- I just clip the hair along the part out of the way and then crimp the roots of the remaining hair, particularly at the crown.  When it&#x27;s finished, I unclip the section at the part and style using a volumizing comb.  The root volumizer heats up quickly -- the only drawback is the extra time spent if you&#x27;re using another styling tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this crimping tool expecting it to perform as described. It did nothing to volumize my hair. What it did accomplish is another story. If you want a strange-looking zig-zag pattern in the inch or two of hair closest to the scalp, then you might want to try this. My hair is 3-4 inches long. I guess it&#x27;s possible that with longer hair the zig-zags might not show as much. But I still would not recommend this as it doesn&#x27;t deliver on the volumizing promise.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  I&#x27;ve tried volume shampoos, colorants, perms, texturizing haircuts, mousse, you name it.  Those work, but so does this (and quite well I might add).  I use it to give volume to the roots in between hair treatments.  Am on Amazon buying a second one for my travel case right now.  : )        PS it gets SO hot your hair doesn&#x27;t have to be all the way dry.  Nice.      PPS.  I also recommend Helen of Troy professional curling irons if you have fine hair.   I thought they were all the same until I tried my friend&#x27;s.  They get to like 450 degrees F, but make sure you get the PROFESSIONAL GOLD series from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  The lesser ones, available on Amazon, not so good.</li>
            <li> after searching (yet again) for an alternative method to the tried and true (and yet incredibly damaging) method of teasing and backcombing my hair to create volume, I stumbled upon this video of a small crimper that was placed near the roots to help stand to stand out and create a sort of bump for smooth hair to fall over. I was speculative at first because honestly it just sounds strange and to weird but....then I saw the video. it totally makes sense that it would/could work and...it does!   This thing is GREAT! I just place the crimper at the roots of my hair at any place that I want volume. A little pointer, the more crimps you do in a row the more volume you get HOWEVER, you want to be careful that the crimps don&#x27;t show. Although, a person would really have to be looking to see any sign of a crimp coming through your hair so don&#x27;t stress too much over it. The higher the setting seems to give the \\&quot;better\\&quot; crimp, but then again it&#x27;s higher heat which is more damaging to hair in the long run. You have to be the judge of that.  All in all I would 100% recommend this to anyone who is desperately seeking a way to get voluminous hair. And if you tease just a little after you crimp, the volume will be through the roof.   I love this thing and will not go anywhere without it! I&#x27;m convinced that this is a Hollywood secret to all of those celebrities with fabulous hair ;)</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so cheap and such a hassle to return, I would. Doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING! Sure, it gets hot and you can see it crimping the roots, but there was zero extra volume to my hair. My hair is naturally fine and straight. I get FAR more volume when I blow dry it upside down and use a root lifter or mousse product than with this useless tool. I was excited to try it after watching a video on how to use it and reading the reviews here. Save your money and skip this loser!</li>
            <li> Very nice heat control and it works like a charm for fine hair, all in all the packaging was professional, the product arrived all in one piece and works</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed an item before but this product was exactly what I have been looking for.  I have great hair but it never holds body and lift. Even when I back comb or use products. It falls flat minutes after styling. With this product I never back comb and the lift stays for days. It&#x27;s wonderful. I wish I would have found it years ago.</li>
            <li> i have flat long heavy hair. it does give a great lift at the roots. but you do have to crimp very small sections of hair or else the iron will not clamp down properly, otherwise i think it&#x27;s worth keeping. it beats teasing the hair</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do, gives volume to flat hair. only thing I would say the tip of the device where you hold it does get hot. I think it needs more insulation. all in all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from this 17$ iron however its my newest fav. thing to recommend to my customers for hair</li>
            <li> This works well on really long hair to give a extra lift at the top of roots for extra fullness.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on shorter hair that is thinning to give the extra lift for fullness.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money and time, and i kept noticing little hints of crimped hair peaking from under. I have long hair that is heavy and moves around alot; this may work better for someone with shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can do the same thing with a teasing brush. try a spornette little wonder brush. Hold hair up and back comb down in ONE direction (not back and forth).</li>
            <li> this works great! it adds so much volume to my flat hair. i use this everyday no matter how i style my hair</li>
