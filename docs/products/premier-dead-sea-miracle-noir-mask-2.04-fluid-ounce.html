            <li>I might have had better to say if they had just made an effort to help me in any way.</li>
            <li>I love how the magnet takes off the minerals.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>i like the problematic mask much better</li>
            <li>I did and paid way more than I should have.</li>
            <li>I was glad to learn on Amazon about the \\&quot;bargaining ability\\&quot; with the mall people and</li>
            <li>I love it and my daughter as well on the face.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more than a 5-fold mark-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is so fantastic!</li>
            <li>At the time, I wasn&#x27;t able to afford that price tag.</li>
            <li>Best Facial ever.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the instant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments...</li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did not fork over $175 at that time.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
            <li>What not to love about the products.  </li>
            <li>so I know when I&#x27;ve used a great product and this mask has made me look 10 years older overnight.</li>
            <li>If anyone want to try something new, this mask is definately a great choice.</li>
            <li>I had bought one at the mall (got two free products) and I bought two more on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This company has some good products but their sales tactics really stink.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and most of all the price I got it for way less than the $200 they wanted at the mall.</li>
            <li>Used once in a while --- it leaves your skin with a clean, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I do have acne, so I have seen the mask lead to break outs if I do not remove some of the excess oils, but if I pat away the excess oils my face is fine.</li>
            <li>days.&lt;br /&gt;Getting the fine iron filings off with the supplied magnet is a bit laborious....</li>
            <li>mask works really fine.</li>
            <li>and  all of  this line  of  products...  Perfect for mature sensitive  skin..  </li>
            <li>This mask is the magic&lt;br /&gt;Quickly delivered accurately</li>
            <li>It leaves your face smooth, without blotches and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exciting and you will be satisfied with its effect.</li>
            <li>The whole line is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is magic how the included stone can take just that top layer of mud off and leave that wonderful serum ingrediant behind.</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon and was thrilled to pay a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My light break outs are gone, and my skin is really healthy for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Watching the magnet remove the clay is fun too!</li>
            <li>Use this product - originally paid $200 from a &#x27;snake salesman&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I also think using the magnet is fun!</li>
            <li>and i was all excited because it looked so cool.</li>
            <li>It was more than twice as much.</li>
            <li>But contrary to evey face wash commercial you have ever seen: oil is GOOD for your skin.</li>
            <li>all I do is rinse with cool water as to not remove the oils.</li>
            <li>The jar lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, really.  </li>
            <li>At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in good condition as expected.</li>
            <li>I do not plan to purchase bother jar, but for under $30.00, it&#x27;s worth a try for the experience of using something that requires a magnet (included), to remove.  </li>
            <li>The products are well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s worth messing around with the magnet-thing.  </li>
            <li>and she promised to make it right with me.</li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>be real thing!</li>
            <li>and I love how it left my face.</li>
            <li>I first learned of this product (and sampled it), at a Women&#x27;s Expo.  </li>
            <li>(Thanks, Amazon, for the price break!)  </li>
            <li>The gimmick is the magnet that takes off the mask - it really works!</li>
            <li>I first seen this at the mall they told me you can&#x27;t buy the real thing on line for had to by&lt;br /&gt;Retailer for the company.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend several of their product line.</li>
            <li>It left my face very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please, just read a little about how to make your own products --</li>
            <li>This works great little different in how u apply and take this off as you use a magnet and the product does stick to the magnet as you remove it from the face.</li>
            <li>This product cleared it up straight away and with weekly use keeps it away.</li>
            <li>i really dont think it did anything for me at all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know what to think.  </li>
            <li>to find out the real cost &amp; availability&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Premier for the affordable product.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>International ship fee is cheap and product is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LADIES!!!</li>
            <li>and incomparable to even the thousands of dollars worth of other skincare products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li>Like the other consumers wrote - it&#x27;s nothing more han a gimmick with a lot of iron filings suspended in oil -</li>
            <li>But a few years ago, the same jar of Dead Sea formula was available only at luxury cosmetic kiosks in malls, and at high-end cosmetics stores --- for a great deal more money than they&#x27;re now offered directly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Face feels softer and shows less redness, more balanced.</li>
            <li>People compliment my skin on a daily basis (but I suppose a good portion of that is just plain genetics).  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>But the price was just too high $200.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t want that residue anywhere near your eyes.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this mask for a few months and came here to order more</li>
            <li>I do love Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li>I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li>The Premier mask gave me the exact same results but for a portion of the price.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what it does, but my skin looks moist and healthy after an application.  </li>
            <li>I have found it to be a good product just like the other dead sea products.</li>
            <li>Laugh if you will, but Dead sea cosmetics do have a healing property that many other products claim, but do not deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They told me just to use on my neck because of my facial skin sensitivity and they were right about that, the oil left behind by the magnet feels good but has to be washed off, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li>My skin still has the soft wrinkled appearance after the treatment as it does before.</li>
            <li>That said, your skin will be soft after using the mask.</li>
            <li>the skin becomes velvet  soft.  </li>
            <li>surprenante et son action peau douce par microdermabrasion après</li>
            <li>We all have natural oils that are being stripped from our skin when we wash it or expose it to the elements.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, then either you need glasses, or you are too young to know what I&#x27;m talking about because your skin recovers</li>
            <li>Ladies with mature skin, try them.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun mask to use - it is messy, but it is fun to use because of that - plus the black color is fun to put on face, the texture is gritty</li>
            <li>But I do have some, some blotchy areas, large pores, dry and sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude.</li>
            <li>I have had red sensitive cheeks (often bumpy) for years.</li>
            <li>so I assume they will be as good as the mall product and a LOT less expensive.</li>
            <li>I have always had large pores, so I began to use the Dead Sea Premiere Biox Line.</li>
            <li>While the magnet spin is very clever the actual mask is harsh and scratched my skin when i attempt to apply  \\&quot;gently\\&quot; with circular motion as directed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the mask is very good at cleaning the skin, yet leaving a moisturizing oil base, direct from the Dead Sea.</li>

            <li> (Thanks, Amazon, for the price break!)  </li>
            <li> The gimmick is the magnet that takes off the mask - it really works!</li>
            <li> I first seen this at the mall they told me you can&#x27;t buy the real thing on line for had to by&lt;br /&gt;Retailer for the company.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend several of their product line.</li>
            <li> It left my face very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please, just read a little about how to make your own products --</li>
            <li> This works great little different in how u apply and take this off as you use a magnet and the product does stick to the magnet as you remove it from the face.</li>
            <li> This product cleared it up straight away and with weekly use keeps it away.</li>
            <li> i really dont think it did anything for me at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know what to think.  </li>
            <li> to find out the real cost &amp; availability&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Premier for the affordable product.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.</li>
            <li> International ship fee is cheap and product is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LADIES!!!</li>
            <li> and incomparable to even the thousands of dollars worth of other skincare products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li> Like the other consumers wrote - it&#x27;s nothing more han a gimmick with a lot of iron filings suspended in oil -</li>
            <li> But a few years ago, the same jar of Dead Sea formula was available only at luxury cosmetic kiosks in malls, and at high-end cosmetics stores --- for a great deal more money than they&#x27;re now offered directly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Face feels softer and shows less redness, more balanced.</li>
            <li> People compliment my skin on a daily basis (but I suppose a good portion of that is just plain genetics).  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> But the price was just too high $200.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t want that residue anywhere near your eyes.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using this mask for a few months and came here to order more</li>
            <li> I do love Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li> I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li> The Premier mask gave me the exact same results but for a portion of the price.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what it does, but my skin looks moist and healthy after an application.  </li>
            <li> I have found it to be a good product just like the other dead sea products.</li>
            <li> Laugh if you will, but Dead sea cosmetics do have a healing property that many other products claim, but do not deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They told me just to use on my neck because of my facial skin sensitivity and they were right about that, the oil left behind by the magnet feels good but has to be washed off, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> My skin still has the soft wrinkled appearance after the treatment as it does before.</li>
            <li> That said, your skin will be soft after using the mask.</li>
            <li> the skin becomes velvet  soft.  </li>
            <li> surprenante et son action peau douce par microdermabrasion après</li>
            <li> We all have natural oils that are being stripped from our skin when we wash it or expose it to the elements.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, then either you need glasses, or you are too young to know what I&#x27;m talking about because your skin recovers</li>
            <li> Ladies with mature skin, try them.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun mask to use - it is messy, but it is fun to use because of that - plus the black color is fun to put on face, the texture is gritty</li>
            <li> But I do have some, some blotchy areas, large pores, dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I do have some, some blotchy areas, large pores, dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude.</li>
            <li> I have had red sensitive cheeks (often bumpy) for years.</li>
            <li> so I assume they will be as good as the mall product and a LOT less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores, so I began to use the Dead Sea Premiere Biox Line.</li>
            <li> While the magnet spin is very clever the actual mask is harsh and scratched my skin when i attempt to apply  \\&quot;gently\\&quot; with circular motion as directed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the mask is very good at cleaning the skin, yet leaving a moisturizing oil base, direct from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> the mask is very good at cleaning the skin, yet leaving a moisturizing oil base, direct from the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Premier came out with this worthless product because it proves that a)</li>
            <li> It is to be used once or twice a week, but at that rate, the jar won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> just about how much money women are willing to pay anyone to buy worthless junk; and c) that they are willing to ruin womens&#x27; skin to prove it, with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture of the mask was a little hard to smooth out.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in process of evaluating how it works for my skin as only one application done so far, and they recommend to apply  not more than every 6 or so</li>
            <li> I like anything premier dead sea offers.  </li>
            <li> It is very different than any other product on the market.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I moved here I have been battling dry skin</li>
            <li> Ever since I moved here I have been battling dry skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t run out- earlier tonight, my friend saw me and asked what I&#x27;d been doing- that I looked at least 5 years younger and had a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Not much wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> Not much wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and these two are the only two products I have discovered that tame the redness.  </li>
            <li> I find that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is very little about them on the net too.</li>
            <li> Also, the other products they make are just made with cooking oil, including the eye products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be illegal to sell a mask that puts teeny pieces of metal just the right size to enter your pores onto the delicate facial skin.</li>
            <li> The black mask is very different from any other mask products I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> , if you use this \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; mask with any regularity you will ruin your delicate facial skin.</li>
            <li> but I would think Amazon has to be telling me the thrush at less</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon for less than $30.00, so decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Use paper towels to clean/wipe magnet because soap and water will not clean the product off the magnet.</li>
            <li> Never mind, I just have to accept that miracles do not come in little containers.</li>
            <li> so i watched the little video that accompanies this product</li>
            <li> I know I am following the instructions correctly, but alas, I still look my age.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it fairly heavily.</li>
            <li> a side note, these Dead Sea Premiere Products make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> My wife about killed me when I forked over $150 for the product, but has since agreed it was truly a \\&quot;miracle\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks, Premier Dead Sea Miracle Noir Mask</li>
            <li> Eventually, I found it on Amazon for less than $30 bucks!</li>
            <li> I also moisturize with 100% organic virgin coconut oil at least every other day.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them.</li>
            <li> She said it would help my reduce my pores as well - as long as I wasn&#x27;t broken out.</li>
            <li> I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I am not sure what the difference is.  </li>
            <li> Just wrap the magnet in a small piece of paper towel.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells bad and is hard to use, but it leaves your face is really hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was very mad at first, and then listened as he explained why the mask was causing me to break out.</li>
            <li> I also have hard water.</li>
            <li> I also have hard water.</li>
            <li> At least they didnt with me.  </li>
            <li> This product is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> He same over one day with a bad outbreak</li>
            <li> They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least.</li>
            <li> when you see how organic orange peel, raw almonds, chamomile tea and milk powder make your skin glow in the seconds it takes to apply it and remove it, then you&#x27;ll realize how useless Premier is.</li>
            <li> This item may seem expensive at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Using a magnet to get the mask off your face is somewhat unsettling.  </li>
            <li> His father has it and uses a lot of prescription and expensive over the counter products to control it.</li>
            <li> And after my unhappy experiences at those luxury cosmetic mall kiosks, I will never overpay for cosmetics again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess if you like spending lots of time on your face with expensive creams - this is for you!</li>
            <li> I have told people that I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make-up, and people are shocked.</li>
            <li> Because I use a sleep machine with a face mask every night, I would be embarrassed with a ugly rash on my face.</li>
            <li> While walking through the Lexington Mall I was stopped by a salesman who bluntly referred to my face as ugly.</li>
            <li> I also was always scratching my face because it itched terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the skin. cleansing and nourishing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have had red sensitive cheeks (often bumpy) for years. This product cleared it up straight away and with weekly use keeps it away. I love it.</li>
            <li> At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product. When I got home over 200 miles away I found that I had not made it home with all of the things I was supposed to have. I called the representative to let her know and she promised to make it right with me. She didnt.  In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them. One was opened and used, one had the seal broke and had leaked in the box.   I contacted the company and told them what had happened and have had no reply what so ever. This was in September or October, and there still isnt any word from any of them. If you decide to purchase any of these products don&#x27;t depend on any one helping  you with what ever is the matter. They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least. At least they didnt with me.  I might have had better to say if they had just made an effort to help me in any way. I would not recommend these products. There is very little about them on the net too. I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them. I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li> I saw this mask when I was in Israel.  They sell it there for 3 times the price.  It is really great for the skin and easy to use.  I love how the magnet takes off the minerals.  It is grainy but that is because it also exfoliates the skin a bit.  I would highly recommend it.  Do not use if you have oily skin.  You will break out from it.</li>
            <li> This item may seem expensive at Amazon. But a few years ago, the same jar of Dead Sea formula was available only at luxury cosmetic kiosks in malls, and at high-end cosmetics stores --- for a great deal more money than they&#x27;re now offered directly from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the price I paid for this item, I feel definitely ripped off. It was more than twice as much. And after my unhappy experiences at those luxury cosmetic mall kiosks, I will never overpay for cosmetics again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the mask is very good at cleaning the skin, yet leaving a moisturizing oil base, direct from the Dead Sea. Laugh if you will, but Dead sea cosmetics do have a healing property that many other products claim, but do not deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend overpaying for the Premier Miracle Noir facial mask, but I do recommend it. Used once in a while --- it leaves your skin with a clean, healthy glow. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Think I was looking for a miracle, but did not get one. The demonstration I was given resulted in a diferent finish to the one I got when I used the Mask, every time. My skin still has the soft wrinkled appearance after the treatment as it does before. I know I am following the instructions correctly, but alas, I still look my age. Never mind, I just have to accept that miracles do not come in little containers.</li>
            <li> okay. so i watched the little video that accompanies this product and i was all excited because it looked so cool. well its not. i really dont think it did anything for me at all. i like the problematic mask much better</li>
            <li> I did and paid way more than I should have. They told me just to use on my neck because of my facial skin sensitivity and they were right about that, the oil left behind by the magnet feels good but has to be washed off, what&#x27;s the point? I like this product however every time I use it I remember being ripped off at the mall. This company has some good products but their sales tactics really stink.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know what to think.  Using a magnet to get the mask off your face is somewhat unsettling.  What are you actually putting on your skin?  That said, your skin will be soft after using the mask.</li>
            <li> This product does  what promises, softens  the  skin, does not irritate at all and after  application the skin becomes velvet  soft.  I will use  only this product  and  all of  this line  of  products...  Perfect for mature sensitive  skin..  Hunwoman</li>
            <li> I had purchased this in the mall and paid....a lot more...than on Amazon.  I was glad to learn on Amazon about the \\&quot;bargaining ability\\&quot; with the mall people and also that the best place to purchase it was Amazon.  I had bought one at the mall (got two free products) and I bought two more on Amazon.  My son has psoriasis.  He same over one day with a bad outbreak and we used it on his leg.  He called the next day to ask where I got it as it had cleared up the outbreak. His father has it and uses a lot of prescription and expensive over the counter products to control it. My son had tried numerous over the counter as he has no insurance and nothing worked until he used this. I knew he wouldn&#x27;t pay what I did at the mall so I bought them on Amazon.  I love it and my daughter as well on the face.  It leaves your face smooth, without blotches and moisturized. It really does make your skin radiant and it smells wonderful too.  I actually haven&#x27;t received my Amazon purchased ones as they are shipped from Israel but the reviews were good so I assume they will be as good as the mall product and a LOT less expensive.</li>
            <li> Like the other consumers wrote - it&#x27;s nothing more han a gimmick with a lot of iron filings suspended in oil - that&#x27;s why you use a magnet to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B-F-D!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they sell it online at their own web site for $165.00 - that&#x27;s more than a 5-fold mark-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT trust this company and do NOT buy their products!</li>
            <li> I had bought this cream before, but paid a fortune.  Bought it again with Amazon for a great price.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> This product seems to tighten and soften skin.  It pulls out impurities below the skin surface.  Watching the magnet remove the clay is fun too!</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  It is my favorite.  It makes my face appear softer and younger looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. If you get this item you can find a balck rod(rectangled) on the top(under the lid). After covering on your face for 5- to 10 mts you can remove by the rod. It cleans perfectly as if the rod sobs the mud. It is so fantastic! I would like you to use it. It&#x27;s exciting and you will be satisfied with its effect.</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores, so I began to use the Dead Sea Premiere Biox Line. I was amazed at the results- my pores visibly shrank. However, they were still noticeable. I remembered a sales agent trying to sell me this mask for a $300 price. She said it would help my reduce my pores as well - as long as I wasn&#x27;t broken out. At the time, I wasn&#x27;t able to afford that price tag. Eventually, I found it on Amazon for less than $30 bucks! It is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you apply this iron enriched mask on your face. I like to apply it fairly heavily. Let it sit for about ten minutes. During this time the dirt is suppose to attach or get stuck in the iron mask. Then you use a magnet to remove both the iron and dirt. Immediately after, I notice that my pores aren&#x27;t as clogged - but they don&#x27;t look smaller. This is because it takes time for the pores to shrink. As I go throughout my day, I notice my skin looking healthier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, these Dead Sea Premiere Products make my skin glow. I have told people that I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make-up, and people are shocked. I strongly recommend several of their product line.</li>
            <li> These item is a miracle worker and gives great results! If the way the mask works with the magnet is amazing but my sking feel and looks healthier and makes improvements to the skin.</li>
            <li> I first seen this at the mall they told me you can&#x27;t buy the real thing on line for had to by&lt;br /&gt;Retailer for the company.&lt;br /&gt;Well I don&#x27;t know but I would think Amazon has to be telling me the thrush at less I hope so&lt;br /&gt;And all I know is that it WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Must be real thing! With A great Price!</li>
            <li> Use this product - originally paid $200 from a &#x27;snake salesman&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Only to find out the real cost &amp; availability&lt;br /&gt;Love it &amp; works  REALLY good</li>
            <li> If anyone want to try something new, this mask is definately a great choice.</li>
            <li> This Mask does amazing things for  your skin.  Best Facial ever.  Awesome product!  Highly recommend!  Can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  I tried a similar product at a local mall.  I was impressed with the instant results;however I was not as enthusiastic about the price... $299.00.  The Premier mask gave me the exact same results but for a portion of the price.  Thanks Premier for the affordable product.</li>
            <li> Received not in good condition!</li>
            <li> This product is a big disappointment. While the magnet spin is very clever the actual mask is harsh and scratched my skin when i attempt to apply  \\&quot;gently\\&quot; with circular motion as directed.</li>
            <li> This mask is the most effective skincare product I have EVER used.  It&#x27;s honestly amazing- and incomparable to even the thousands of dollars worth of other skincare products I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve now been using this mask for a few months and came here to order more so I don&#x27;t run out- earlier tonight, my friend saw me and asked what I&#x27;d been doing- that I looked at least 5 years younger and had a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments... that alone would have me using this product again.  However, it&#x27;s the way my skin feels to ME that has me sold.  My skin tone, texture, and color have improved.  My light break outs are gone, and my skin is really healthy for the first time in my life.  I paid a great deal more for this product than I see it here, and it was still worth it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> My daughter tool me that I  would be amazed with this mask and she was right. It will last me forever.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  I have used this mask for about 4 years.  Great.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. It is really relaxing and massaging it into my face feels wonderful. I also think using the magnet is fun! However it does take time to apply and remove and I am not always a patient person. My face always has glow to it after using the mask. I do have acne, so I have seen the mask lead to break outs if I do not remove some of the excess oils, but if I pat away the excess oils my face is fine.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good condition as expected. I&#x27;m still in process of evaluating how it works for my skin as only one application done so far, and they recommend to apply  not more than every 6 or so days.&lt;br /&gt;Getting the fine iron filings off with the supplied magnet is a bit laborious.... and you really don&#x27;t want that residue anywhere near your eyes..... I guess if you like spending lots of time on your face with expensive creams - this is for you!</li>
            <li> I suffer from sleep apnea. Because I use a sleep machine with a face mask every night, I would be embarrassed with a ugly rash on my face. I also was always scratching my face because it itched terribly. While walking through the Lexington Mall I was stopped by a salesman who bluntly referred to my face as ugly. I was very mad at first, and then listened as he explained why the mask was causing me to break out. He introduced me to the Mask Miracle Noir and demonstrated how it was applied. My wife about killed me when I forked over $150 for the product, but has since agreed it was truly a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; my face is no longer an embarrassment to me. I use it once a week and have not had any problem since. Thank you for a truly great product!</li>
            <li> International ship fee is cheap and product is good.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will buy premier product again.&lt;br /&gt;The mask works really fine. the mask is very good at cleaning the skin, yet leaving a moisturizing oil base, direct from the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> J&#x27;aime sa texture surprenante et son action peau douce par microdermabrasion après application.&lt;br /&gt;A utiliser une fois par semaine pour une résultat optimal.&lt;br /&gt;La dépose du masque avec l&#x27;aimant est surprenante</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product for some time and am very happy with results. Face feels softer and shows less redness, more balanced.</li>
            <li> This mask is the magic&lt;br /&gt;Quickly delivered accurately</li>
            <li> This works great little different in how u apply and take this off as you use a magnet and the product does stick to the magnet as you remove it from the face. Use paper towels to clean/wipe magnet because soap and water will not clean the product off the magnet.</li>
            <li> I had tried the product at the mall....and I love how it left my face. But the price was just too high $200. So looking around I found it on Amazon.com, I received the package all sealed up and even with the seal protector when you open it. The texture of the mask was a little hard to smooth out.....but it was manageable. It left my face very smooth and soft. I am very happy with the product and most of all the price I got it for way less than the $200 they wanted at the mall.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product (and sampled it), at a Women&#x27;s Expo.  The cost was over $100.00.  I found it on Amazon for less than $30.00, so decided to try it.  It is very different than any other product on the market.  I am not sure what it does, but my skin looks moist and healthy after an application.  Beyond that, I am not sure what the difference is.  It is to be used once or twice a week, but at that rate, the jar won&#x27;t last long.  I do not plan to purchase bother jar, but for under $30.00, it&#x27;s worth a try for the experience of using something that requires a magnet (included), to remove.  Very interesting...</li>
            <li> love it. my skin looks awesome</li>
            <li> Adorei o produto!!!&lt;br /&gt;Minha pele estava desidratada e com algumas manchas de acne. Após o uso a pele ficou muito hidratada e bem mais clara.&lt;br /&gt;Quero conhecer os demais produtos da Premier...</li>
            <li> Although, my skin is oily I found that this product works amazingly for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Premier Dead Sea Miracle Noir Mask</li>
            <li> I do love Premier Dead Sea products.  This stuff smells bad and is hard to use, but it leaves your face is really hydrated. I only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  The whole line is amazing.  I&#x27;m 50 plus and now look 30.  Truly no joking.  I&#x27;m a smoker and those lines around my lips are literally gone.  It is magic how the included stone can take just that top layer of mud off and leave that wonderful serum ingrediant behind.</li>
            <li> I am almost 30. Not much wrinkles yet. But I do have some, some blotchy areas, large pores, dry and sensitive skin. No acne. When I use this product I see a difference in my skin. I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude. I also have hard water. Ever since I moved here I have been battling dry skin</li>
            <li> I am almost 30. Not much wrinkles yet. But I do have some, some blotchy areas, large pores, dry and sensitive skin. No acne. When I use this product I see a difference in my skin. I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude. I also have hard water. Ever since I moved here I have been battling dry skin. I was given a demo of this product at the mall. I am so glad I did not fork over $175 at that time. I found this on Amazon and was thrilled to pay a reasonable price. I see people complaining about the oily residue. A lot of people don&#x27;t like thAt aspect of it. But contrary to evey face wash commercial you have ever seen: oil is GOOD for your skin. We all have natural oils that are being stripped from our skin when we wash it or expose it to the elements. A good way to use this product is before bed time. You are not meant to wash off the oils. So do this at bedtime and let it absorb overnight. I go this and in the morning all I do is rinse with cool water as to not remove the oils. When I sleep with it on, I feel it gives the oils time to absorb. I wake up with smaller pores, plump skin, and even skin tone. Maybe the magnet is a bit of a gimmick, but I can&#x27;t argue with results. Do the mask evey 1-2 weeks. People compliment my skin on a daily basis (but I suppose a good portion of that is just plain genetics).  I also moisturize with 100% organic virgin coconut oil at least every other day.</li>
            <li> This greatly improved the look of skin. The jar lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I like anything premier dead sea offers.  I have found it to be a good product just like the other dead sea products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Premier came out with this worthless product because it proves that a) all of their products are things anyone could make themselves with things bought for pennies at the grocery store; b) they know nothing about skin, just about how much money women are willing to pay anyone to buy worthless junk; and c) that they are willing to ruin womens&#x27; skin to prove it, with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, if you use this \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; mask with any regularity you will ruin your delicate facial skin. There is A REASON they tell you you can&#x27;t use it once a week! It&#x27;s because it clogs your pores and it takes 2 to 4 weeks for them to recover! I go to the best salons so I know when I&#x27;ve used a great product and this mask has made me look 10 years older overnight. If you don&#x27;t, then either you need glasses, or you are too young to know what I&#x27;m talking about because your skin recovers naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be illegal to sell a mask that puts teeny pieces of metal just the right size to enter your pores onto the delicate facial skin. My face has actually HURT since using this mask only once. Also, the other products they make are just made with cooking oil, including the eye products. You could just get organic avocado, safflower or almond oil yourself and use it to moisturize under your eyes and to remove makeup, instead of wasting your money on their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, just read a little about how to make your own products -- when you see how organic orange peel, raw almonds, chamomile tea and milk powder make your skin glow in the seconds it takes to apply it and remove it, then you&#x27;ll realize how useless Premier is. If you have the eye \\&quot;oil\\&quot; product just try using a drop of organic almond oil instead, and you will see it does the same thing! They just repackage things we buy at the grocery store and charge hundreds of dollars for it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LADIES!!! IT&#x27;S TIME TO STOP BEING SO GULLIBLE!!!!</li>
            <li> Have bought this before in Vegas. Works great.</li>
            <li> Good product..... I really like it</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  I&#x27;m 52 with combo skin, no allergies.  I use Noir Mask every 1-2 weeks and I also use the Premier Cream Cleanser daily.  I have rosacea and these two are the only two products I have discovered that tame the redness.  I have stopped using Premier (to save money!) for short periods and always return to these two.  (Thanks, Amazon, for the price break!)  I find that a little goes a long way. The products are well worth the price.  Also it&#x27;s worth messing around with the magnet-thing.  Just wrap the magnet in a small piece of paper towel.  When the paper towel is &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; then take it off and re-wrap.  I follow with a dab of the Cream Cleanser to wipe away the remaining Noir Mask.  It&#x27;s easy, really.  If you have rosacea try this.  I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.  I am so happy to have discovered Premier products are at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  The black mask is very different from any other mask products I used in the past.  It leaves my face moist even after I wash my face.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a fun mask to use - it is messy, but it is fun to use because of that - plus the black color is fun to put on face, the texture is gritty so it also exfoliates while hydrating. The gimmick is the magnet that takes off the mask - it really works! If used weekly, your skin will stay hydrated &amp; look refreshed!</li>
            <li> This feels so wonderful on my face - it is awesome!! Had tried it a year ago but recently remembered this was to order</li>
