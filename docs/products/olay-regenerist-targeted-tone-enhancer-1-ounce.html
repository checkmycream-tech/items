            <li>Perhaps this product is wonderful for people with darker skin, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>One excellent aspect of this product is that it does not plug pores which would lead to comedones.</li>
            <li>This product is AWESOME for overnight zit relief.</li>
            <li>This has been the best product.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and creamy and makes my skin feel very nice all day.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of Olay products and use their foaming face wash, moisturizers (including the Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery is a great product)...</li>
            <li>the advertising kind of promised a miracle.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this and will buy more as soon as i am finished with the tube i have now.</li>
            <li>Love, love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY products to diminish these sun  spots and this is the BEST so far that I have found.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin that never tans.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin that can tan nicely.  </li>
            <li>bye sun spots and hello smooth skin!  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>So thanks for this great find.</li>
            <li>I like most of the OLAY line, but this did not deliver what it promised.  </li>
            <li>I can see I would probably love it, if my skin didn&#x27;t immediately start breaking out.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have acne prone skin &amp; need a tone enhancer, you would probably love this</li>
            <li>I simply love most all of Olay products..especially the Regenerist line... until I bought the Tone Enhancer.</li>
            <li>it was ok., but a face lift is the way to go</li>
            <li>It does work well as a good moisturizer as well, but i don&#x27;t really use it for that.</li>
            <li>Let me first say I love almost everything Olay Regenerist, do I assumed I would love this tone ehancer as well.</li>
            <li>My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) loves Olay products and it shows 24/7 in her radiant face.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful to find this product from Olay as I&#x27;m a loyal Olay girl.</li>
            <li>At most it takes two nights for the blemish to completely disappear.</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment if the expectations are right.  </li>
            <li>As the previous poster mentioned, it&#x27;s good as a backup moisturizer as it&#x27;s not too oily.</li>
            <li>At 58 my skin has gone thru the era of &#x60;no one knew about the hazard of direct sun light  on your skin without anything to protect it...</li>
            <li>I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin).  </li>
            <li>I bought first this product in 2003, because of recommendation Consumer Reports, and still use it.</li>
            <li>I have brown patches on the sides of my face and on my forehead and although I do not apply this on a regular basis it has pretty much diminished these brown patches from my face to give me a more even tone to my skin.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a long term regimen for me and involves more than just applying lotion and thinking that is all there is to it.  </li>
            <li>This product is gentle to my skin and not irritating at all</li>
            <li>But this is no joke, it did absolute wonders for my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see much difference in my complexion even after a month.</li>
            <li>so I was really dissapointed to spend $16</li>
            <li>It is really works, makes skin of face brighter and whiter, remove also age spots.</li>
            <li>will continue to show damaged skin no matter how much product, any product, you use.  </li>
            <li>I will look to other brands to see if I can achieve better results.  </li>
            <li>IPL&#x27;s and peels have helped tremendously, but haven&#x27;t erased it all, so I thought maybe a product such as this would lighten those patches over time.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Most of the age spots are gone or lightened considerably, I don&#x27;t have dark or light areas, the skin is even toned, and it didn&#x27;t take as long as it says on the package.</li>
            <li>Will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>I love olay&#x27;s regenerist line, but this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any new spots on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It requires consistent use, and exfoliation regularly definitely helps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old and have exposed my skin to a lot of sun over the years.</li>
            <li>So much so that people kept telling me that they noticed something different about me and realized it was my face.</li>
            <li>With age, my face became splotchy, had a lot of age spots, and general discolorations.</li>
            <li>If you have large or dark age spots, I wouldn&#x27;t expect this to make them disappear (lets face if you want them to disappear completely probably the only thing that&#x27;ll work is laser surgery), but they should diminish.</li>
            <li>I really like other Olay products, but I cannot recommend this one to my fair-skinned sisters.</li>

            <li> It works on gradually fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> Maybe that is why some of the less than luminous reviews say it doesn&#x27;t work well - since continued exposure to the sun</li>
            <li> So I have a few spotting issues.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe the bad reviews are coming from people who don&#x27;t really need the product or it&#x27;s being applied incorrectly.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks it did lighten some small, stubbourn age spots.</li>
            <li> I started using Olay Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer about 2 years ago, when the dark spots on my face were getting worse with age.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but use just a little.  </li>
            <li> It is irritating if you get it to close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> What an expensive and painful waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sad to say,</li>
            <li> and this is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> It looked awful and makeup couldn&#x27;t even hide it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently started using this product and I do notice that my skin appears clearer. I still have brown spots although it appears to be lighter and is fading away.  This product is gentle to my skin and not irritating at all and I love it!  It was recommended to me by a friend who uses it and all of her brown spots are now gone so I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Perhaps this product is wonderful for people with darker skin, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have light skin that can tan nicely.  Because I tanned often when I was in my 20&#x27;s, I now have some skin discoloration.  IPL&#x27;s and peels have helped tremendously, but haven&#x27;t erased it all, so I thought maybe a product such as this would lighten those patches over time. I was prepared to have to continue to buy in order to keep the lightened effect.    Sad to say, after at least 5 months of diligent everyday (morning and night) use, I can detect no change whatsoever; even a test spot that I had not treated before stayed exactly the same.    I really like other Olay products, but I cannot recommend this one to my fair-skinned sisters.</li>
            <li> Love, love it!  It is expensive, but use just a little.  Combine this with gentle exfoliating and in a few short weeks it&#x27;s bye, bye sun spots and hello smooth skin!  Also helped with red splotches too!</li>
            <li> I did not have the same results or lack there of from this product as these other women had. I have brown patches on the sides of my face and on my forehead and although I do not apply this on a regular basis it has pretty much diminished these brown patches from my face to give me a more even tone to my skin. I am very pleased with this and will buy more as soon as i am finished with the tube i have now. It does work well as a good moisturizer as well, but i don&#x27;t really use it for that.</li>
            <li> I used this product once a night. After a couple of weeks it did lighten some small, stubbourn age spots. I haven&#x27;t used it for a while &amp; they are still the same. If you have large or dark age spots, I wouldn&#x27;t expect this to make them disappear (lets face if you want them to disappear completely probably the only thing that&#x27;ll work is laser surgery), but they should diminish.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, this product works as promised.  I love it and it only takes a dab where needed.  Small tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it claims.It is irritating if you get it to close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> At 58 my skin has gone thru the era of &#x60;no one knew about the hazard of direct sun light  on your skin without anything to protect it...I even used baby oil to advance the burn/tanning  process. So I have a few spotting issues. I&#x27;ve tried MANY products to diminish these sun  spots and this is the BEST so far that I have found. The problem I find is that I cannot  find it at Walgreens, Hyvee or Walmart. So thanks for this great find.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as directed and could see no difference in my facial discoloration due to sun exposure.  I like most of the OLAY line, but this did not deliver what it promised.  I will look to other brands to see if I can achieve better results.  It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> The tone enhancer works for me.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and it lightens a lot of the age spots I have.  It doesn&#x27;t make them totally disappear but lightens them noticeably.  I use it in the morning and before going to bed.  Just cover the area with a dab, rub it in and forget it!!  Takes about 2 weeks to begin to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I needed a bleaching cream but was too afraid to get one because most of them contain hydroquinone which is rumored to cause skin cancer. I was hopeful to find this product from Olay as I&#x27;m a loyal Olay girl. I used this on a dark spot on my cheek. The ad promised a change in 2 weeks maximum. I used it religiously twice a day for 2 months, applying the cream only to the dark spot. I&#x27;ve yet to see any difference on my skin, neither lighter nor darker.. nothing. Save your money, look elsewhere. As the previous poster mentioned, it&#x27;s good as a backup moisturizer as it&#x27;s not too oily.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the amazon reviews before buying this overpriced product. I love olay&#x27;s regenerist line, but this was a waste of money. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would give it zero stars. Applied it every day to my face for a month and my brown spots are still there. Tried it a second time and got a red rash which looked like a sunburn for a week. What an expensive and painful waste of money. I&#x27;ll go and visit a dermatologist instead...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and have exposed my skin to a lot of sun over the years. With age, my face became splotchy, had a lot of age spots, and general discolorations. It looked awful and makeup couldn&#x27;t even hide it. I think I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun. I began with the most expensive products and stuck with it through at least twice what was recommended to see results. Then I tried Olay Regenerist Targeted Zone Enhancer. It worked miracles for me. So much so that people kept telling me that they noticed something different about me and realized it was my face. I cannot recommend this product enough. I wish I would have taken before and after pictures, but nobody believes those anyway because you can correct them digitally. But this is no joke, it did absolute wonders for my face. Most of the age spots are gone or lightened considerably, I don&#x27;t have dark or light areas, the skin is even toned, and it didn&#x27;t take as long as it says on the package. I will NEVER stop using this product. My friends were so amazed, they&#x27;re all using it too. Maybe the bad reviews are coming from people who don&#x27;t really need the product or it&#x27;s being applied incorrectly. As for me? I&#x27;m sticking with this one. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the price is a little steep, but that&#x27;s the price we pay for vanity. -- SP, Connecticut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use up the bottle but probably not buy it again. I can&#x27;t see much difference in my complexion even after a month. But the, I was looking for a miracle and the advertising kind of promised a miracle. Will I never learn?</li>
            <li> From previous statements about this Olay Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer it seems that the product made in the middle of the last decade was imperfect.  The flaws must have been addressed because now the package insert is correct - the age spots are diminished and the skin is toned.  This is not the same as having cosmetic surgery/treatments in a medical setting, but for those whose problems are minor (small spots, early skin aging) it doe indeed work. One excellent aspect of this product is that it does not plug pores which would lead to comedones. It is worth the investment if the expectations are right.  It would seem that the product has been finessed by Olay - they are a company who constantly upgrades their offerings.  Grady Harp, December 11</li>
            <li> Let me first say I love almost everything Olay Regenerist, do I assumed I would love this tone ehancer as well. I can see I would probably love it, if my skin didn&#x27;t immediately start breaking out. This is the only Regenerist product I&#x27;ve tried that has done that (&amp; I&#x27;ve tried a lot). If you don&#x27;t have acne prone skin &amp; need a tone enhancer, you would probably love this</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME for overnight zit relief. At most it takes two nights for the blemish to completely disappear. Don&#x27;t use too much at once though or it will cause your skin to dry out and peel a little.</li>
            <li> My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) loves Olay products and it shows 24/7 in her radiant face. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Olay products and use their foaming face wash, moisturizers (including the Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery is a great product)... so I was really dissapointed to spend $16+ on this product and then see no change.  I am in my 30&#x27;s, have fair/medium shade combination skin.  I tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing.  I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin).  I tried it for several weeks.  No results.  This product did nothing for me.  I would not recommend it.  I would have given it zero start, but Amazon does not allow it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Avon has a product out that touts similar claims to Olay&#x27;s product.  I have not tried it yet but would suggest you see if you can try a sample of that from an Avon rep. instead.</li>
            <li> I bought first this product in 2003, because of recommendation Consumer Reports, and still use it. It is really works, makes skin of face brighter and whiter, remove also age spots.</li>
            <li> I simply love most all of Olay products..especially the Regenerist line... until I bought the Tone Enhancer. It did nothing for my face.  Not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin.  I guess I will use it as a moisturizer until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil Of Olay for over 20 years. I am an African American woman in her 50&#x27;s.  I started using Olay Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer about 2 years ago, when the dark spots on my face were getting worse with age.  This has been the best product.  It has made my cheeks looks even toned, and a lot of the spots are gone and I don&#x27;t have any new spots on my cheeks.  It is nice and creamy and makes my skin feel very nice all day.  I only apply it once in the morning.  I also use Oil Of Olay skin cream with this during the day.  I would say just be patient to the people who say, this does not work.  Give it some time it will work in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin that never tans.  Ever since I hit age 50 I&#x27;ve been prone to age spots on my face, hands and arms from sun exposure when I was younger.  I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Tone enhancer on and off for about five years.  It works.  Gradually.  It requires consistent use, and exfoliation regularly definitely helps. I&#x27;ve also learned to avoid sun exposure whenever possible and use sun block whenever avoidance isn&#x27;t possible. So it&#x27;s a long term regimen for me and involves more than just applying lotion and thinking that is all there is to it.  Maybe that is why some of the less than luminous reviews say it doesn&#x27;t work well - since continued exposure to the sun will continue to show damaged skin no matter how much product, any product, you use.  The only reason I did not give five stars is that I wish it worked a bit faster. But I think you only get really fast results from those products that contain unhealthy chemicals like hydroquinone and this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This tone enhancer doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected. Have used for months without any difference that I can tell. Will give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> Tried this awile back, forgot about it..It works on gradually fading dark spots. It even works on spots you&#x27;e had for a long time.</li>
            <li> Does lighten brown spots....and this is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> it was ok., but a face lift is the way to go</li>
