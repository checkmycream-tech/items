            <li>they&#x27;re really wonderful about fixing it.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly, and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Great product, Revlon!</li>
            <li>Very good!</li>
            <li>lt&#x27;s good stuff, Maynard!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in a pinch, but I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
            <li>That for me is an amazing thing.  </li>
            <li>Dries up fast and gives a good texture to nails!</li>
            <li>I also use Orly but like this better.  </li>
            <li>(this is more to keep my hands from drying out).  </li>
            <li>Because it \\&quot;dries\\&quot; to a rubbery consistency, the nail polish applied on top of it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It also does not come of easily.</li>
            <li>smudges/chips easily.</li>
            <li>After using this the first time, with a cheap polish and Revlon top coat, my nails lasted a week.</li>
            <li>l ran out and really missed it as l had to repaint my manicure more often.  </li>
            <li>I notice that my nail polish lasts longer when I use it and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and keeps polish from peeling off.</li>
            <li>of the cons include it not drying quickly at all</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and helps nail polish adhere to nail.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still not crazy for this, and I won&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li>I give it credit though, because it dries super fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to achieve a manicure that&#x27;ll last two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I must agree with the first reviewer of this product.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended!  </li>
            <li>the key to a long-lasting manicure.. get the revlon clear top coat too and your&#x27;e set</li>
            <li>It does not dry quickly at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like it cures very well for a quick dry product either.</li>
            <li>I got a great deal on the Revlon Quick Dry Base Coat, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot because it is mediocre.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what actual nail polish I use on top as long as I use this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried this several times and each time I have noticed that when I use it, the color coats on top of it never seem to dry and get spots on them like grains of sand.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s kind of sticky if you let it dry and don&#x27;t put another lacquer over it, but this is so that everything will hold really tight.  </li>
            <li>The bottom layers will not dry properly if you stick another wet layer on top if it while it&#x27;s still sticky.</li>
            <li>(I have several base coats that are not quick-dry and they actually dry faster than this), it not preventing my nails from peeling or chipping for more than 48 hours at best, and it not preventing staining when red polish is applied over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a busy, working mom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite thin in consistency which is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is the best base coat.  </li>
            <li>When I use this base coat, two layers of high quality polish, and any-old top coat, my manicures look VERY good for at least one week.</li>
            <li>It does dry fast for me.  </li>
            <li>I find it really makes my polish last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have had the same nail polish on my nails for a week so far and not a single chip.  </li>
            <li>Your base coat is the MOST important piece of your manicure because it allows for the polish to adhere to your nail and not chip off.</li>
            <li>I have a life where a normal manicure couldn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and have found that if I combined it with the quick dry topcoat</li>
            <li>I highly disagree with the other reviewers.</li>

            <li> I highly disagree with the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> but I put a little too much color on my nail and then bumped it before it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> But common sense will tell you if it holds on to polish thru dishes and such that it is on your nail really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brands of base coat and the Revlon Quick Dry Base Coat is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the bottle long</li>
            <li> This base coat really helps in keeping a manicure looking good for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> They lasted thru doing dishes daily, bath time with my little ones, cleaning the house with chemicals, and typing daily at my job.</li>
            <li> In between complete manicures, I&#x27;ll put another coat of this base on top of the polish and then another coat of polish.  </li>
            <li> of the pros include easy application (not the curved brush that I prefer, but no huge gaps or stiff bristles at least), an easy-to-grip bottle and brush handle, and viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t had a single bubble on any manicure since using this, and my nails haven&#x27;t gotten stained or discolored.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Revlon base coat.</li>
            <li> I recommend letting it dry for about a minute to maybe three before applying the next layer, this allows the lacquer to really dry and cling tightly to your nail.  </li>
            <li> But just a little warning Amazon does not use bubblewrap, so you might run into problems if they do not packing carefully enough</li>
            <li> My manicure was still gummy and peeled off 18 hours later, and I waited between each coat (this base coat, two coats of color, and a top coat).</li>
            <li> This basecoat never seems to dry properly...feels tacky to touch even after waiting for a half hour.</li>
            <li> I have seen other people say it causes bubbles, I did have that</li>
            <li> If you want a long-lasting manicure, my other tip is to be patient; allow 10 minutes of drying time between each layer of base coat, polish, and top coat.</li>
            <li> and I use a lot of nail polish including dark colors.  </li>
            <li> I love this base coat.  </li>
            <li> I love this base coat.  </li>
            <li> I always wear nail polish as a skin condition makes my nails look funky, so I go through a lot of base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the clear, normal base coat.</li>
            <li> I start using a few drops of thinner when I am about half way through the bottle.  </li>
            <li> My polish chips within a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> I wear polish everyday changing my manicure every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> This polish is a little hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Weird, seems to be tacky while its drying and not a quick dry as indicated.</li>
            <li> Decent base coat.</li>
            <li> I apply one thin coat and then apply another thin coat and then apply color.  </li>
            <li> It is rubbery, as mentioned, but base coats like that makes manicures last longer.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning, it leaves weird rubbery films on my nails each time I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not the worst base coat I have ever tried, but when a polish markets itself as a quick-dry formula, I think it should feel fairly dry to the touch within a few minutes, and this feels tacky even after 15+ minutes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the milky color</li>
            <li> I was looking for a base coat when I bought this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just used up the bottle I bought at Walgreens and came on Amazon to see if it is carried here.  I love this base coat.  I also use Orly but like this better.  I apply one thin coat and then apply another thin coat and then apply color.  I find it really makes my polish last a long time.  In between complete manicures, I&#x27;ll put another coat of this base on top of the polish and then another coat of polish.  I sometimes go two weeks without removing polish and starting over.</li>
            <li> Weird, seems to be tacky while its drying and not a quick dry as indicated. I prefer the clear, normal base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and have found that if I combined it with the quick dry topcoat I&#x27;m able to achieve a manicure that&#x27;ll last two weeks.  That for me is an amazing thing.  I have a life where a normal manicure couldn&#x27;t last very long.  I do wear gloves when doing the dishes or heavy-duty cleaning (this is more to keep my hands from drying out).  It&#x27;s quite thin in consistency which is nice.  You&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s kind of sticky if you let it dry and don&#x27;t put another lacquer over it, but this is so that everything will hold really tight.  I recommend letting it dry for about a minute to maybe three before applying the next layer, this allows the lacquer to really dry and cling tightly to your nail.  This is the cheapest I found it for.  But just a little warning Amazon does not use bubblewrap, so you might run into problems if they do not packing carefully enough (bottles are glass they can break), if this happens just e-mail the customer service they&#x27;re really wonderful about fixing it.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat.  I have a big problem with chipping nails but ever since I purchased this I haven&#x27;t had a problem.  I have had the same nail polish on my nails for a week so far and not a single chip.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I must agree with the first reviewer of this product. It does not dry quickly at all. It also does not come of easily. After cleaning, it leaves weird rubbery films on my nails each time I use it. I would have stayed away too had I known.</li>
            <li> This basecoat never seems to dry properly...feels tacky to touch even after waiting for a half hour. Because it \\&quot;dries\\&quot; to a rubbery consistency, the nail polish applied on top of it smudges/chips easily. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> This base coat really helps in keeping a manicure looking good for at least a week.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what actual nail polish I use on top as long as I use this product.</li>
            <li> the key to a long-lasting manicure.. get the revlon clear top coat too and your&#x27;e set</li>
            <li> Decent base coat. I notice that my nail polish lasts longer when I use it and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.  It is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Highly reccomended!  It dries quick and keeps polish from peeling off.</li>
            <li> I always wear nail polish as a skin condition makes my nails look funky, so I go through a lot of base and top coats.  I got a great deal on the Revlon Quick Dry Base Coat, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot because it is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the pros include easy application (not the curved brush that I prefer, but no huge gaps or stiff bristles at least), an easy-to-grip bottle and brush handle, and viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the cons include it not drying quickly at all (I have several base coats that are not quick-dry and they actually dry faster than this), it not preventing my nails from peeling or chipping for more than 48 hours at best, and it not preventing staining when red polish is applied over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the worst base coat I have ever tried, but when a polish markets itself as a quick-dry formula, I think it should feel fairly dry to the touch within a few minutes, and this feels tacky even after 15+ minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried this several times and each time I have noticed that when I use it, the color coats on top of it never seem to dry and get spots on them like grains of sand. When I don&#x27;t use it that doesn&#x27;t happen. I haven&#x27;t had the bottle long and I shake it well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in a pinch, but I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it. My polish chips within a few days of using this. It advertises that it stops nails from splitting and peeling, but it doesn&#x27;t. My nails still peel a lot. I give it credit though, because it dries super fast, I haven&#x27;t had a single bubble on any manicure since using this, and my nails haven&#x27;t gotten stained or discolored. But I&#x27;m still not crazy for this, and I won&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Revlon base coat. I purchase it all the time.  It works perfectly, and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It does dry fast for me.  It is rubbery, as mentioned, but base coats like that makes manicures last longer.  I do have to use a thinner over time as I get through the bottle.  I start using a few drops of thinner when I am about half way through the bottle.  I never get yellowing or staining on my nails and I use a lot of nail polish including dark colors.  I wear polish everyday changing my manicure every 3-4 days.  This base coats is great and I hope they never change the formula. I love this product. I highly disagree with the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brands of base coat and the Revlon Quick Dry Base Coat is by far the best. Your base coat is the MOST important piece of your manicure because it allows for the polish to adhere to your nail and not chip off. When I use this base coat, two layers of high quality polish, and any-old top coat, my manicures look VERY good for at least one week. Sometimes longer! If you want a long-lasting manicure, my other tip is to be patient; allow 10 minutes of drying time between each layer of base coat, polish, and top coat. The bottom layers will not dry properly if you stick another wet layer on top if it while it&#x27;s still sticky. Great product, Revlon!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was looking for a base coat when I bought this. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the milky color so I almost didn&#x27;t buy it. I am a busy, working mom. After using this the first time, with a cheap polish and Revlon top coat, my nails lasted a week. They lasted thru doing dishes daily, bath time with my little ones, cleaning the house with chemicals, and typing daily at my job. I was in AHH. I have used it twice now and both time the color lasts. I don&#x27;t have to baby my nails/manicure. I have seen other people say it causes bubbles, I did have that but I put a little too much color on my nail and then bumped it before it was completely dry. The dent in my nail smoothed over without me having to repaint it but there are tiny bubbles on my nail. This polish is a little hard to get off. But common sense will tell you if it holds on to polish thru dishes and such that it is on your nail really well. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Dries up fast and gives a good texture to nails!</li>
            <li> lt&#x27;s good stuff, Maynard!  Dries quickly and helps nail polish adhere to nail. lt does make a difference!  l ran out and really missed it as l had to repaint my manicure more often.  What a relief it&#x27;s here!</li>
            <li> Very good! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Leaves bumps and bubbles in the finish every time. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it cures very well for a quick dry product either. My manicure was still gummy and peeled off 18 hours later, and I waited between each coat (this base coat, two coats of color, and a top coat). Skip this one.</li>
